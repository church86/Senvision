Add A Comment September was another busy month and here's a look at the most popular articles on Phoronix for the month of my 267 original news items and 17 featured Linux reviews/articles. It was yet another month with a lot of exciting open-source/Linux events with publishing nearly 10 articles per day. Below is a look at the most popular news and reviews. As always, if you appreciate all of the timely open-source/Linux news and interesting benchmarks, please consider joining Phoronix Premium. On the Phoronix side, September marked the release of Phoronix Test Suite 6.6 while sadly the Phoronix Oktoberfest pilgrimage / meetup didn't happen this year. The most popular September 2016 news: Libreboot Leaves The GNU, The Free Software Foundation Denounced It was only in May that Libreboot became an official GNU project but now this free software Coreboot downstream has parted ways. Microsoft Reportedly Requires "Signature PCs" To Be Locked To Only Running Windows Lately I've heard a few reports of some newer PCs being less than friendly with Linux, namely a number of Lenovo devices who have issues with installing Linux. Based upon new information that's come to light from a Phoronix reader, it appears that PCs receiving Microsoft's "Signature Edition" tag are being locked-out from running non-Windows platforms. No, AMD Will Not Be Opening Up Its Firmware/Microcode This issue comes up every so often by people suggesting it or otherwise inquiring about it... No, AMD has no intentions of open-sourcing its low-level firmware / microcode for their Radeon GPUs. FSF, RMS Issue Statements Over Libreboot's Accusations Thursday night we wrote about Libreboot leaving the GNU and denouncing the GNU and FSF with rather harsh words. That thread generated more than 120 comments with differing views while now the Free Software Foundation issued a statement as well as Richard M Stallman. Adobe Returns To Updating NPAPI/Linux Flash Player Adobe stopped updating its NPAPI-based Linux Flash Player four years ago and planned to stop supporting it entirely in 2017, but now the company has backtracked on those steps with a commitment to regularly update their NPAPI and PPAPI versions of the Flash Player for Linux. Vim 8.0 Released With GTK3 Support, Async I/O & DirectX Support Vi IMproved has been further improved with today's Vim 8.0 release. In fact, this is the first major release of Vim in the past decade! Trying Out The FreeBSD-Powered TrueOS With Its Custom Qt Desktop While I've been running PC-BSD on some systems for years I hadn't tried out any of its rolling-release FreeBSD 11.0-based spins under the new TrueOS brand nor had I tried out the project's Qt-based Lumina Desktop Environment since it reached 1.0. That changed today with trying out the latest weekly spin of TrueOS x64. GCC Might Finally Drop The GNU Compiler For Java (GCJ) The GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) while made a lot of progress in its early years as a free software Java compiler, in recent years it's basically been in maintenance mode and might now be removed entirely from GCC. Intel Has Been Working On A Fast 2D GPU Renderer Focused On Web Content Intel's open-source developers have been working on a GPU-based high-performance 2D renderer that can be nine times faster than Cairo's CPU-based renderer and still multiple times faster than Qt (even with OpenGL), Cairo with OpenGL, or even Google's Skia with OpenGL rendering. The focus of this new project, FastUIDraw, is ultimately for speeding up the rendering of web content and being able to accelerate all of the HTML5 canvas operations. Here Are The Steam Survey Results For Linux During August 2016 The start of the new month brings a new percentage about the estimated Linux gaming population as measured by the Steam survey. Feral Interactive Said To Be Announcing "Massive" New Game For Linux Tomorrow The Mac/Linux game porters at Feral Interactive are teasing that tomorrow they will be announcing a "massive" game. QEMU 2.7 Released With Many Improvements For The Linux Virtualization Stack It's time for another stable QEMU update. And the most popular articles: macOS 10.12 Sierra vs. Ubuntu 16.04 Linux Benchmarking Apple released macOS 10.12 "Sierra" last week as the successor to OS X El Capitan. Given this annual update to macOS / OS X, here are benchmarks of macOS Sierra compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a MacBook Air and Mac Mini computers. LLVM Clang 3.9 Mostly Trails GCC In Compiler Performance Following yesterday's GCC 5 vs. 6 vs. early 7 benchmarks, to no surprise LLVM's Clang compiler was brought up in the comments. I had already been running some fresh LLVM Clang benchmarks on this same Intel Xeon system and have those results to share now with Clang 3.8 and the newly-released Clang 3.9. Early GCC 7 Compiler Benchmarks On Linux: Some Performance Improvements While GCC 7 is still under heavy development and the GCC 7.1 stable release will not come until a few months into 2017, here are some early benchmarks of GCC 7.0 compared to GCC 6.2 and GCC 5.4 on an Ubuntu Linux x86_64 system. Intel Xeon E5-2609 v4 Broadwell-EP Linux Benchmarks Recently I purchased a Xeon E5-2609 v4 Broadwell-EP processor as a $300 Xeon with eight physical cores but clocked at just 1.7GHz and without any Turbo Boost while the TDP is 85 Watts. Here are some benchmarks compared to other LGA-2011 v3 CPUs in my possession under Linux along with an AMD FX reference point too and followed by some Skylake Xeon benchmarks. TrueOS vs. DragonFlyBSD vs. GhostBSD vs. FreeBSD vs. PacBSD Benchmarks For your viewing pleasure this weekend are benchmarks of TrueOS 20160831 (the rolling-release distribution formerly known as PC-BSD), DragonFlyBSD 4.6, GhostBSD 10.3, FreeBSD 11.0-RC2, and PacBSD 20160809 (formerly known as Arch BSD) all benchmarked from the same system! Plus for reference to the Linux numbers are Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS and Clear Linux 10040 being compared to these BSDs on the same tests and hardware. Intel Core i7 6800K Benchmarks On Ubuntu + Linux 4.8 While the Core i7 6800K has been available for a few months now, there hadn't been any review on it since Intel hadn't sent out any Broadwell-E samples for Linux testing this time around. However, I did end up finally buying a Core i7 6800K now that the Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support is finally coming together (at first, Intel PR said it wouldn't even be supported on Linux) so that I can run some benchmarks there plus some other interesting items on the horizon for benchmarking. Here are some benchmarks of the i7-6800K from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the Linux 4.8 kernel. 7-Way Linux Distribution Benchmarks To Kick Off September In testing out a new Broadwell-EP system as well as for final validation of the new Phoronix Test Suite 6.6, I carried out a fresh Linux OS distribution comparison last week. Here are those results from Ubuntu, Clear Linux, Scientific Linux, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Fedora, Antergos, and Sabayon Linux. A Look At The Exciting Features/Improvements Of GNOME 3.22 If all goes well, GNOME 3.22 will be officially released tomorrow, 21 September. Here is a recap of some of the new features and improvements made over this past six month development cycle plus some screenshots of the near-final desktop that will power the upcoming Fedora 25 Workstation. Trying Out Eight BSDs On A Modern PC: Some Are Smooth, Others Troublesome Following the seven-way Linux distribution benchmark comparison published earlier this week, on the same system I set out to test a variety of BSD distributions on the same system and ultimately benchmark their out-of-the-box performance too. Those performance benchmark results will be published later this week while today were a few remarks I wanted to share when trying out TrueOS, DragonFlyBSD, GhostBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MidnightBSD, and PacBSD (Arch BSD) on this modern Intel Xeon system. Intel 600P Series SSD NVMe M.2 Linux Tests Last month Intel introduced the 600P Series solid-state drives as the most competitively-priced NVMe SSDs launched to date. Here are a few Linux comparison benchmarks from my initial testing of the SSDPEKKW256G7X1 M.2 SSD on Linux.

Minyanville 4 Best ETFs and Stocks to Tap the Tech Boom By Scutify Sep 30, 2016 9:32 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. After a lackluster first half of 2016, the technology sector is on fire in the third quarter on improving fundamentals, investors' drive for cheaper valuation and renewed focus on beaten down growth stocks. In fact, the sector led the market rally in Q3, with the ultra-popular Technology SPDR (XLK) gaining nearly 10.5% versus the gain of 3.4% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Inside the Tech Surge Impressive growth of the sector largely hinges on Apple Inc.'s(AAPL) solid performance led by robust earnings and the iPhone 7 launch. The flurry of better-than-expected Q2 results from heavyweights such as Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc(GOOGL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), and Facebook Inc (FB) also injected optimism, pushing the sector to new highs. Ongoing consolidation in the semiconductor industry and strong earnings reports from chipmakers Intel Corporation (INTC), Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN), and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) added further strength (read:Catch Apple's Rally with These Top-Ranked Tech ETFs). In fact, the sector has staged a strong turnaround from the two previous quarters of negative earnings and even surpassed the S&P 500. The trend is likely to continue in the third quarter as the sector's earnings are expected to decline 1.9%, much lower than that of the S&P 500's decline of 3.1%, as per the Earnings Trend report. The expectation of outperformance in Q3 continues to fuel the rally in the sector. Additionally, a strengthening economy and better job prospects gave a nice boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology that typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle. As the world is becoming increasingly digital, demand for novel and advanced technologies such as cloud computing, big data, smartphones, high-speed fiber networks and the Internet of Things is growing by leaps and bounds. This is creating great opportunities for tech companies. And not to forget, most of these tech companies are sitting on a huge pile of cash and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble even in a rising interest rate environment, the chance of which is looming large for later this year (read: Time to Buy These Tech ETFs?). While most of the ETFs and stocks have outperformed in Q3, we have highlighted four from each corner of the space that will continue their outperformance in the coming months as well. Let's take a look at our ETF picks first... Using our database, we have selected those technology ETFs that offer domestic exposure and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Each of these has the potential to move higher in Q4 as well (see: all the Technology ETFs here). PowerShares Dynamic Networking (ETF) (PXQ) - Up 22.6% This product targets the networking segment of the broad U.S. technology sector by tracking the Dynamic Networking Intellidex Index. Holding 30 securities in its basket, the fund is well spread across each component as each security accounts for less than 5.1% share in the basket. From an industrial look, about half of the portfolio is focused on communication equipment followed by 30% in software and programming. The fund is unpopular and illiquid in the broad tech space with AUM of $19.9 million and average daily volume of about 3,000 shares. It charges 63 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 with a High risk outlook. Global X Funds (SOCL) - Up 21.7% This fund provides pure play access to social media companies around the world and follows the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index. It has amassed $132 million in its asset base and charges 0.65% in fees and expenses. The ETF sees a lower trading volumes of roughly 48,000 shares a day. In total, it holds 31 securities in the basket with higher concentration on the top four firms making up for a combined 39% share. U.S. firms take half of the portfolio, closely followed by China (26%), Japan (8%) and Russia (6%). The fund has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3, with a High risk outlook (read: Twitter Acquisition Talks in the Air: Stock & ETFs Gain). PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (ETF) (PSI)- Up 21.5% This ETF provides exposure to the semiconductor segment of the broader U.S. technology sector by tracking the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex Index. This benchmark selects stocks on a variety of investment criteria: price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action and value. In total, the fund holds a small basket of 30 securities with none holding more than 5.2% share. The product, with AUM of $92.7 million is often overlooked by investors and hence sees a lower average daily volume of around 23,000 shares. The product charges a fee of 63 bps a year and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1, with a High risk outlook. Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) - Up 18.3% This fund provides exposure to 26 chipmakers by tracking the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 Index. It has a large concentration on the top two firms that collectively make up for 26.1% of assets. The product has managed assets worth $567.4 million and charges 35 bps in annual fees and expenses. It is heavily traded with volume of around 2.7 million shares per day and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2, with a High risk outlook (read: Profit from the Semiconductor Rally with These ETFs). Next up are our stock picks for the tech sector... To pick the best performing stocks in the sector, we have used the Zacks Stock Screener. We narrowed down the list by selecting stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, a VGM Style Score of A or B, and market cap of above $2 billion. Investors should note that these stocks have the potential to continue their outperformance next year. Lumentum Holdings Inc (LITE) - Up 73.3% Based in Milpitas, California, Lumentum is a manufacturer of innovative optical and photonic products in the Americas, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 with a VGM Score of B and a market cap of $2.46 billion (read: Can The Uptrend Continue for Lumentum Holdings?). Finisar Corporation (FNSR) -Up 68.5% Based in Sunnyvale, California, Finisar is the world's largest supplier of optical subsystems and components for data communication and telecommunication applications in the United States, Malaysia, China and internationally.

FNSR has a Zacks Rank #1 with a VGM Style Score of B and market cap of $3.21 billion (read: Looking for a Top Momentum Stock? 3 Reasons Why Finisar is a Great Choice). InterDigital, Inc. (IDCC) - Up 40.6% Based in Wilmington, Delaware, InterDigital designs and develops technologies that enable and enhance wireless communications in the United States and internationally.

(ITRI) -Up 26.8% Based in Liberty Lake, Washington, Itron is a provider of metering solutions to electricity, gas, and water utility markets worldwide.

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → Evidence is Mounting: Apple Will Convert the Macs to ARM CPUs John Martellaro @jmartellaro Sep 30th, 2016 4:54 PM EST | Particle Debris The time since most of the Macs have been updated can now be described as geologic. Is that because Apple doesn’t care about the Macs? Time Cook says “I Love the Mac.” Or, more likely, could we be in for another major architectural change? Evidence is mounting that Apple really will abandon Intel and take the Mac lineup to ARM. Here’s the assessment. First, let’s look at the latest evidence from iDownloadBlog. macOS Sierra code suggests Apple could replace Intel in Macs with custom ARM chips That article nicely recounts the history of this notion, including this important section. And in 2014, former head of the Macintosh division Jean-Louis Gassée hinted that the first ARM-based Macs could appear in 2017. Gassée explained: If we follow this line of reasoning, the advantages of ARM-based processors vs. x86 devices become even more compelling: lower cost, better power dissipation, natural integration with the rest of the machine. For years, Intel has argued that its superior semiconductor design and manufacturing technology would eventually overcome the complexity downsides of the x86 architecture. But that ‘eventually’ is getting a bit stale. Other than a few showcase design wins that have never amounted to much in the real world, x86 devices continue to lose to ARM-derived SoC (System On a Chip) designs. The Key Issues In addition to what Jean-Louis Gassée explained abive, there are some other nuances to explore. Intel releases its new CPUs on its own timetable that doesn’t rigorously take into account Apple’s technical needs and product development cycle. All iOS devices use ARM. This change will make Xcode and development in general more coherent across platforms. It could lead to better synergies between iOS and macOS. The ARM processors in the latest iOS devices are 64-bit and more than competitive with CPUs from Intel in performance. Apple is the acknowledged expert in taking millions of customers though a major architecture change. The company did it first from Motorola 68K to PowerPC in 1998 and then PowerPC to Intel in 2005. The very long time since we’ve had updates to the Mac Pro, Mac mini, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro suggests (but doesn’t guarantee) that this architecture change has been in the works. Apple is taking its sweet time to do it right. That would include, perhaps, a Rosetta-like mechanism that allows current Intel-based Mac apps to run on the new Macs. Apple’s technical roadmap may well be diverging from Intel’s, one that has to take into account the needs of PC makers, not Apple. Perhaps Apple is done with this. Also, the nicety of installing Windows natively on a Mac with Boot Camp is a notion whose time has come and gone. Virtual Machine hardware in the ARM CPUs and an instruction translator would still allow Mac users to run VMs with Intel-based OSes like Windows and Linux. From what we’ve seen, modern ARM CPUs have the horsepower to do that. A new ARM-based MacPro? Perhaps not the droid we were looking for. Image credit: Apple That said, I strongly suspect that the MacBook Pros, rumored to be announced in October will be the last Macs with an Intel CPU, the Skylake series. The question now is, will Apple simply release the new MacBook Pros without mentioning the transition? This is important because if Apple tips its hand at an October event, too many customers might decide to wait until 2017 to upgrade their MBP. On the other, had, it could make sense to introduce an ARM-based Mac Pro or 5K iMac and suggest that the MacBook Pros will be the last Macs to make the transition in 2017/8. Mac customers would collectively breathe a sigh of relief to finally see what Apple is up to. And if you need a new MBP, buy it now (in October). It will be viable for years. Meanwhile, Apple will deliver a multi-CPU workhorse ARM-based Mac Pro/iMac for developers to get the ball rolling. This is a delicate maneuver for Apple because customers are hungry for new Macs, and the company would have to both plan for and announce these new Macs in the right sequence with the right messaging. Now we wait. Next page: The Tech News Debris for the Week of September 26th. The new Apple Echo chamber.

Unlike what has been going on over the last few years with Intel; Apple’s incessant desire to control everything possible can be better realized in this way. September 30, 2016 at 5:35 EST PM quakerotis September 30, 2016 I don’t think this will happen any time soon. ARM is great in single cores and multicores. It doesn’t have floating point, it doesn’t have multiple execution threads nor the thermal capacity to handle any of this. Benchmarks don’t tell the story. These are different tasks. Maybe someday, but not in the near future. September 30, 2016 at 5:48 EST PM quakerotis September 30, 2016 Additionally, Bootcamp and virtualization are not ideas whose time has come and gone. That is naive. Virtualization will only become more critical in the future, not less. And you’re absolutely wrong if you think Apple will deliver a Mac Pro with ARM. The Mac Pro’s problems are with the nonsensical design and the garbage Video cards they come with. September 30, 2016 at 5:50 EST PM belmikey September 30, 2016 Apple might do this–in fact, I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if they do this–but it would be foolish of them, and their sales would plummet as soon as people realized that nothing actually worked on them any more. Most games for the Mac, for example, are not ports–they run in an environment derived from WINE or its relations, and depend upon an x86 base. ARM CPUs are not yet nearly fast enough to provide decent performance doing instruction translation from x86 to ARM so that these capabilities would remain. Nothing would make me more likely to abandon the Mac platform. I don’t think I’m alone. September 30, 2016 at 6:07 EST PM vpndev September 30, 2016 This will happen but we should expect a lengthy transition. MacBook and MacBook Air are obvious candidates for starting the transition. This is almost in the “low hanging fruit” category. No huge need for big compute capacity or demanding video – so this would be easy. The Mac Pro is at the other end of the spectrum. It needs lots of crunch an that might be hard to do with ARM, especially given the tasks that these machines often do. I’d expect this one to be last in the line. belmikey: you’re right, but many games spend most of their time in code provided by libraries or the kernel, and not in actual application logic. Apple did a study of this back at the time of PPC->x86 transition and found that many apps were about 10% local code and 90% system/kernel/etc. So this hit might not be as bad as you fear. September 30, 2016 at 11:37 EST PM Bregalad October 1, 2016 I believe Apple is certainly moving in the direction or A-series processors in Macs. They want to control the whole widget and likely see improved compatibility with iOS devices as more important than compatibility with Windows. At the same time Apple seems eager to make further inroads in enterprise environments and moving away from the processor architecture and instruction set used in the vast majority of corporate hardware could be a huge mistake. When Macs relied on emulation you hardly ever saw one in a business setting. Once virtualization was possible Macs flooded into fields where they’d never been seen before. Maybe Apple truly doesn’t care about keeping Macs in business. Maybe they expect sales of iOS devices will be able to pick up the slack. Judging by the falling sales figures for iPads, however, that probably isn’t a viable approach. October 1, 2016 at 2:58 EST AM colinddarby October 1, 2016 Makes absolute zero sense for a number of reasons, seems nonsensical, user-hostile and would actually make the Mac’s less attractive, have less software, more expensive and would drive pro-users like me, over to Windows. However it will make them 0.3mm thinner because ARM series chips are slightly smaller than Intel ones, so I expect the transition to start in mid-October. In five new sparkly colours, including jet black. October 1, 2016 at 4:33 EST AM Guy B Serle October 1, 2016 The problem with most of the comments to this story is that you’re looking at it from your point of view and not Apple’s. Many of you have said that it seems like Apple no longer cares that much about the Pro market and this fits right in with a move like this. Other than FCP and Logic, what pro apps are left from Apple? How much money does Apple actually make from the pro market as compared to the consumer side? The answer is…not much. If they can keep 80-90% of their customer base after switching to ARM and still keep their same margins while offering lower prices across their line, the loss of the pro market as compared to new potential consumers is nothing. Remember as well that with iOS Apple is beginning to make inroads to the Enterprise market which has the potential to be huge. Apple is better suited to take a chance like this than they were when they switched from 68xxx to PPC or PPC to Intel. They have a tremendous war chest that can easily weather any financial storm for 5-10 years. They have a strong Mac market that has grown quite a bit since 2005 and there’s still a quiet revolt over the changes made since the release of Windows 8 and 10. People are looking for something different but don’t want to pay the Mac tax. If Apple can lower their prices and still keep their margins this could be a win for nearly everybody. Microsoft and Adobe will release ARM versions of their software for the Mac (assuming it happens natch). They’d be crazy not to. Heck MS is already there with iOS and Android version of Office October 1, 2016 at 10:32 EST AM aka_JYeager October 1, 2016 What will happen to hardware sales after someone figures out how to run that version of macOS on a Raspberry Pi (a $35 ARM based computer)? October 1, 2016 at 12:51 EST PM John Martellaro October 1, 2016 Guy B Serle: That’s a great summary of the situation. October 1, 2016 at 5:24 EST PM brilor October 1, 2016 Evidence is mounting that Apple really will abandon Intel and take the Mac lineup to ARM. I see reasoned guesses, speculation and discussions portraying a parallel to Apple’s PPC to Intel transition but no actual evidence. First, there is no way an A10 can perform the sustained computing that is often done on a Mac. It is good for short ( few seconds ) bursts of intensive usage but more intensive tasks are beyond it right now. Sure, Apple might have longer-term plans to couple ARM and Macs but the A10 isn’t it. Yes, the future of the Mac Pro and anything “Pro” ( and I mean really Pro not just the labels Apple slaps on devices that are borderline to not pro ) is tentative based on extrapolation of current evidence ( i.e. almost three years since a Mac Pro rev and cancellation of their only monitor with suggestions to buy competitor’s monitors ), so if the Mac Pro has been canceled it makes it easier for Apple to wield some future ARM product. Of course a top of the line 27 inch iMac currently can out compute ( and for longer periods ) an A10 and Apple keeps the iMac mostly up-to-date ( so there is no indication of its eminent demise thus giving Apple fewer Macs to address with its ARM ). So, while Apple *may* take the Mac to ARM, the question is when. The answer is when ARM is ready technically plus the other details need to be sorted out( Mac users who like to run Windows in Boot Camp is one, when licensing deals allow it and more ). October 1, 2016 at 8:49 EST PM DudeMac October 1, 2016 I would have to see Macs with ARM inside 🙂 October 1, 2016 at 9:22 EST PM DudeMac October 1, 2016 I would love to see Macs with ARM inside 🙂 October 1, 2016 at 9:23 EST PM BradMacPro October 2, 2016 Apple’s A series processors are approaching the performance of that which is used in the MacBook. So a future MacBook could use ARM, as Apple’s advances in performance are exceeding Intel’s jumps. It will be a few generations and years before we could see a Apple ARM derived design in a iMac and even longer before in a MacPro. All that being the case, more and more people are not seeking faster performance from their computers than what exists now, so Apple A series could catch up to that level. The switch from Intel based macOS based to Apple A series based Macs could be helped along with a system similar to the Rosetta system used up to Snow Leopard. October 2, 2016 at 12:06 EST AM geneking7320 October 2, 2016 How about the Macintosh retain Intel chips (until they are not profitable) and Apple introduces a new line of computers with ARM chips named after a different apple? October 2, 2016 at 12:27 EST AM John Martellaro October 2, 2016 You guys seem focused on a 1:1 replacement. I’m thinking about 8 or 16 modified A10s (16 or 32 high performance ARM cores) in a MacBook. Many more in a desktop. Good-bye quad core MBP, hello 32 cores. October 2, 2016 at 12:49 EST AM brilor October 2, 2016 The switch from Intel based macOS based to Apple A series based Macs could be helped along with a system similar to the Rosetta system used up to Snow Leopard. It will probably easier than that and it’s easy to imagine such a translator won’t be required because Apple already provides several layers of abstraction for AppKit and Foundation frameworks. Plus iOS( ARM ), already uses AppKit/Foundation, so many apps will rebuild with minor Xcode changes unless the developer is writing low-level, non-standard framework code. Even though a Mac ARM strategy is certainly possible, it isn’t clear to me if there is strong motivation to move away Intel. For all their delays, Intel probably offers Apple low prices given the volume of chips they purchase, plus they want to incent Apple’s purchase other Intel chips. Macs are only a small part of Apple’s business, and assuming they plan to keep producing Macs ( else why invest the time/money to change them to ARM ), only Apple knows if Mac ARM is justified at a business ( accounting ) level. I hope Apple starts building more innovative products with features we want but realize a large corporate public company maximizing profits and minimizing expenses ( consolidating CPU platforms is one such strategy along with the other synergies it confers ) is constrained. October 2, 2016 at 1:24 EST AM Paul Goodwin October 2, 2016 Not sure moving to ARM processors in Macs would be any less of a mistake than it was for Apple to move to the PowerPC. In the beginning there were all sorts of charts showing how technically the PPC chip development would far outstrip the Intel ones in speed and functionality. It never happened, and eventually the market was industrial embedded processing and about 1% of the computers sold as the Mac’s market share dwindled because of compatibility issues with the x86 world and limited software choices. There were some great PPC Macs, but eventually it proved to be a bad technical move. October 2, 2016 at 9:20 EST AM Scott B in DC October 2, 2016 To the vast majority, nobody cares what the hardware looks like inside the box. Only the geeks care. Most users only care that their computers work, that I can run their software, and that they won’t get any viruses. Other then the kicks the only community that would care are those with heavy computing needs, like the creative community. However, their needs are being satisfied with multicore high performance graphics cards. If most of the graphics and floating point computations are being handed off to these graphics subsystems, and what difference does it make if an ARM chip has flooding point or not. BTW, this is another back to the future moment. In years gone by, in the time of storage to put terminals which is equivalent to today’s web browser, floating point processors for separate from the CPU. The microprocessor industry championed the integrated processor chip. Now it’s being broken up again. Everything old is now new! October 2, 2016 at 10:33 EST AM GraphicMac October 2, 2016 All the numbered points (save for #1 and #2) made by the author shows a misunderstanding of the subject matter in some cases, assumes a whole lot incorrectly, are wildly speculative or are completely wrong. October 2, 2016 at 10:36 EST AM Wulfkind October 2, 2016 I think this line of thinking that Apple is eventually going to go ARM over Intel has further credence when one realizes that Intel announced this year they are getting out of the phone and tablet CPU business. Their ATOM line of CPU’s were cut down iCoresomething CPUs originally made for desktops and laptops and these CPU’s were being marketed and sold to device manufacturers from NAS designers to phone and table manufacturers. Particularly with the phone manufacturers Intel literally spent BILLIONS of dollars in rebates and cross-marketing in order to entice phone ODMs to start using Intel ATOM CPUs instead of ARM. It was a spectacular failure and Intel bowed out this year. Now Intel is trying to pitch what is left of the ATOM line ( they’ve killed that name BTW ) to ODM’s in the 2in1 Hybrid tablet/laptop space in the Windows world. So….just like the PowerPC alliance began to stagnate, particularly in the mobile space ( think Motorola PowerPC 4 ) and in the desktop space ( think IBM PowerPC 5 series CPUs ) Intel has stagnated and dropped out of the key mobile space where Apple is seeing the most innovation and revenue. Apple HATES not being seen as the most innovative in any aspect of their portfolio particularly when they feel they are being held back by a third party…..so….why not go “in-house” with their own home grown ARM based CPU? So….in my humble opinion…..you will see an ARM base Apple Air in the 2017-18 time frame, an entire mobile portfolio based on ARM in 2018-19 timeframe ( think Macbook, Air, iPad, iPod, Phone and Watch ) and in the 2019-2020 range you will see the first Apple desktop with an ARM cpu. October 2, 2016 at 2:22 EST PM brilor October 2, 2016 Scott B wrote: … the only community that would care are those with heavy computing needs, like the creative community There are lots of folks who purchased a Mac because they can run Windows applications natively ( i.e. without a VM ). They are just normal users and not necessarily the creative community. Apple would potentially lose these customers by switching to ARM. John M. wrote: I’m thinking about 8 or 16 modified A10s (16 or 32 high performance ARM cores) Good point but this would require major software changes( and many developers might be either reluctant or not skilled enough to implement – ( it is difficult even with GCD – Grand Central Dispatch ) because most applications run on a single core ( main queue in GCD ) and use only one core. Even some of Apple’s apps are written for a single ( main queue with the UI ) core. I’m not saying this isn’t solvable but it would be a problem today and it would be a major effort. Moreover, a solution would probably require a major investment by Apple and it’s not clear they have the will to do this. October 2, 2016 at 2:56 EST PM JustCause October 2, 2016 John M. wrote: I’m thinking about 8 or 16 modified A10s (16 or 32 high performance ARM cores) Apple doesn’t need to switch to ARM to do this, they can simply add ARM chips in addition to the Intel chips. The software to support different processing units is already in the OS. October 2, 2016 at 4:51 EST PM JustCause October 2, 2016 Those of us that work in corporate jobs that require access to Windows running well (without a crappy Wintel PC) think this is a really, really bad idea. October 2, 2016 at 5:03 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 “Apple is the acknowledged expert in taking millions of customers though a major architecture change.” Not again! 🙁 As nice as ARM may be, it’s really convenient to be able to run Windows for games and apps that need it. One great thing about Windows is that customers haven’t had to go through these architectural switches, which are painful. As much as I prefer the Mac, I have to say that Windows definitely has better backward compatibility in terms of both software and hardware. October 2, 2016 at 7:43 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 p.s. I note that Microsoft has dabbled in other architectures such as MIPS, itanium, and ARM, but they never abandoned x86 the way Apple abandoned 68K and PPC. October 2, 2016 at 7:44 EST PM archimedes October 2, 2016 That being said, Apple could surprise us all with an A12 processor that had … x86 compatibility. I think it would be a mess, but it would be an interesting one. October 2, 2016 at 7:47 EST PM John C. Welch October 3, 2016 Virtual Machine hardware in the ARM CPUs and an instruction translator would still allow Mac users to run VMs with Intel-based OSes like Windows and Linux. From what we’ve seen, modern ARM CPUs have the horsepower to do that. Well then, you should be able to provide a fine list of real world devices that folks here can buy to test this out for themselves. You know, a nice laptop or desktop.

The likelihood Apple has written ( if they didn’t start it years ago it won’t be ready anytime soon ) and will embed it in an ARM CPU is very unlikely, both technically and at a business level, IMO and there is certainly no evidence to support such an endeavor. Nice fantasy though. October 3, 2016 at 11:14 EST AM Albatrossflyer October 3, 2016 let’s see…. a MacBook with an ARM processor makes it an iPad with a keyboard, which makes its a MS Surface.

If Apple moves to ARM without getting their ARM processor performance drastically better, it’s not a viable option for me. October 3, 2016 at 3:09 EST PM Old UNIX Guy October 3, 2016 It doesn’t matter what CPU Apple puts in future Macs if they don’t reverse the downhill slide they’re on with the quality of their software. If it’s not iOS or watchOS they clearly don’t care. Switching to ARM CPUs isn’t going to help that. Dumping Craig Federighi and bringing back Betrand Serlet might (along with letting Jony Ive be the CDO for stores, $10K watches, and $100K cars ONLY)… October 3, 2016 at 3:10 EST PM Andrush October 4, 2016 Hey Guys,: Heavy duty hardware vendors are already building devices to put ARM chips into Data Centres: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/10/04/kaleao_kmax_armbased_server/ It’s only a matter of time. How much time? Who knows? Perhaps Apple? October 4, 2016 at 10:43 EST AM brilor October 4, 2016 @Old UNIX Guy: Agreed. @Andrush: True but Apple is about high profit margins which means squeezing standard vendors ( Intel, TSMC, AMD etc. ) for major price concessions. To secure price concessions, Apple avoids vendors selling items they won’t discount because they aren’t made is mass quantities. Virtually all knowledgeable folks agree it’s technically possible but a lot of factors suggest it won’t happen anytime soon ( read prior posts for some ideas ). Brian October 4, 2016 at 1:28 EST PM Macsee October 12, 2016 iOS is a jailed limited toy. Mac is a full computer. Intel x86 compatibility is a must. Or else, switch to Windows. A shame for all.

Qatalyst will begin a formal sales process to find a buyer for NXP, said the people, asking not to be identified because the information is private. In addition to Qualcomm, Avago Technologies Ltd., Intel Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co. are the most likely to be interested, one of the people said. NXP may also hire a co-adviser, another person said. While NXP has grown quickly via its purchase of Freescale Semiconductor at the end of last year, it’s still relatively small compared with companies such as Qualcomm, Intel and the more rapidly expanding Broadcom Ltd. NXP is projected to have more than $9 billion in revenue this year. NXP Chief Executive Officer Rich Clemmer and his board, who successfully brought the company back to the public markets in 2010, may be tempted by an offer to become part of a bigger company as industrywide costs of production rise and customer lists shrink. Representatives of NXP, Qatalyst, Broadcom and Intel declined to comment. A representative for Samsung didn’t respond to requests for comment. Qualcomm’s Options NXP is one of several companies that San Diego-based Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, has been studying as it determines if and how to put its offshore cash to use, people familiar with the matter said Friday. Qualcomm is also considering a handful of other large acquisitions, both domestic and international targets, the people said. Talks between NXP and Qualcomm are still preliminary, people with knowledge of the matter said.  Qualcomm is under pressure from shareholders who want the company to put its industry-leading $30 billion of cash to work, said a person familiar with the considerations. Management hasn’t yet decided whether to stick with its policy of smaller acquisitions to plug gaps in technology or to pursue a large deal that would transform the company, the person said. Combining with NXP would create a company with technology that would place it at the center of the growing push to bring more electronics and automation to cars, according to Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho Securities. He upgraded his rating on Qualcomm to buy and is predicting the stock will rise to $75. The shares closed Friday at $68.50. “We believe a deal here makes significant strategic and financial sense,” he wrote. “The move to automotive transforms the narrative on Qualcomm from handsets to automotive, a secular growth road map with connectivity, mobility, and services platforms.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

About Us Archives Advertise Technique Search for: Home Search for: Home News Opinions Consensus Opinion Letters to the Editor Political Cartoon Life Entertainment Sports Time Out Blogs Technocrats Advertising Talking CEED with Benton-Johnson By Keely Mruk on September 30, 2016 Leave a reply Tweet Felicia Benton-Johnson serves as Director of Diversity for Tech’s College of Engineering, a job she has held since 2004. As such, she also heads Tech’s Center for Engineering Education and Diversity, or CEED. This program works with entities, both inside the Tech community and otherwise, to promote a more diverse landscape in Tech’s engineering programs. The Technique was able to sit down with Benton-Johnson to discuss CEED and the impact it has on students. Technique: Could you give an overview of some of the services that CEED provides students? Benton-Johnson: Okay, so, CEED is the Center for Engineering Education and Diversity. We give students retention support, some one-on-one tutoring and mentoring, financial support, academic advising and career opportunities, like connecting students with corporate entities. The most important thing for us is we’re really big on building relationships with everyone we touch. The students, even parents, and corporate entities. We try and create a safe space for students to come and interact with us. There are five people who are on staff here and we like to make sure that if one of us isn’t available, someone else is, and they can go in, give a student a hug, give them a pat on the back, give them sort of a push when they need the motivation to keep going. We call ourselves the safe space, a home away from home for students. Technique: What part of your job do you enjoy the most? Benton-Johnson: To be honest, the students. When people say “what do you enjoy the least,” definitely the meetings. But yeah, the students, especially when you see things come full circle. For example, we have a summer engineering institute and the students are here for three weeks. This happens as early as when they’re rising juniors in high school, and it’s so cool that we see them now, in the end, when they are graduating from college. It’s really crazy. We see students that we’ve met as a freshman and now they’re in Ph.D. programs. Or when they come back from industry. We have a lot of students who come back from industry and they come in all the time and they come by to say “Hi” — that type of thing. You see what you’ve done when students come back. Or they come back in smiling and they just tell you, “Oh my gosh I did so good on this test or this project,” and it’s really cool to see. Technique: Is there any particular program that CEED runs that you are the proudest of? Benton-Johnson: Most proud of? Well there’s more than one project that we have in this initiative. The partnership with Intel, we became a partner with Intel last year. They gifted us $5.5 million over the next five years to increase the number of underrepresented minorities across engineering and technology. With that, it has enabled us to increase the number of students that we’ve impacted. For one we’ve expanded our peer to peer program, so now we’re supporting 120 students in that. Across the college of engineering and college of sciences and computing. That’s where we do a peer mentoring approach with upperclassmen mentoring underclassmen within the same major. And then we also have graduate students who mentor the mentors. Also the partnership with Intel has enabled us to support more students financially. So we have what’s called “retaining inspirational students in engineering and technology;” we call it RISE. RISE is for your nontraditional student who is pursuing engineering or technology, sometimes a graduate student, and they are resilient in pursuing their degree. So these students are nontraditional, someone who did not come to college straight out of high school, someone who may be married or is a first generation student. But they all have a strong work ethic and a drive to give back. RISE has enabled us to more than double the number of students that we are supporting financially, and we are really proud of that. The other thing is our summer engineering institute, which is the three-week residential program I spoke of. We started that in 2008. Since then, over 92 percent of the students who participated in that have gone on to pursue STEM degrees. We have a number of programs, I can’t really just tag one, we’re proud of a good number of them. Technique: That is certainly understandable. You are doing great things here. Benton-Johnson: Yeah, and we’re excited about that, having good people makes a big difference. We wouldn’t be able to do this with people who aren’t committed to the students and to making sure they obtain their degrees. Even for [engineering] students who we meet and who later decide to change their major, they are still a part of the CEED family. Technique: Are there any new programs that CEED is looking to start? Benton-Johnson: So, one thing that we realized is that graduate students need support as well. This year, we’re looking to start a graduate program similar to our peer-to-peer mentoring, where we are going to have support for graduate students. It will have different workshops, focused on professional development or how to get through masters or Ph.D. programs. … These workshops would answer questions like, “Should I go into academia versus industry?” We will try to get faculty involved in the mentoring aspect as well. Technique: What have you enjoyed about working on a college campus? Benton-Johnson: It keeps me young. I also love the innovation and the intellect … always keeping abreast of what is new and current in the academic arena. Technique: Would you say Tech has a different campus culture than other campuses that you have been at? Benton-Johnson: Oh yes, definitely yes, for sure. The campus culture is one of innovation, it’s one of camaraderie. I see students all of the time coming in. Just this Friday, I had a conversation with two students and they said, “we just started our own business.” Here, you get a lot of that — where students are starting start-ups, you know, that’s nothing out of the norm. I really love that about Tech. Then too, it’s so diverse, in every sense of the word. In socioeconomics, culture, language, you know. People may not say it’s diverse in the sense of majors because engineering is the 800-pound-gorilla, but even the engineers are very multidisciplinary. They reach over into the other colleges and look to work with other students to build businesses or work on projects. Technique: What brought you to Tech? Benton-Johnson: So, I actually was a chemistry teacher, and I wanted to go into higher education. I wanted to get out of the classroom and do something different. I started out as a diversity coordinator for an engineering research center, called GTech,  back in 2004. I got here and I just loved it. It just blended everything that my background is. The science, the education piece, the administrative and leadership piece, as well as diversity. It was just a really nice blend. Every day is something new. That’s the one thing I really love about working in academia. Every day is just completely different. Every day is nowhere near the same. That’s the other thing I really, really like. I’m blessed to do something that I’m passionate about. This is something I get up for in the morning, I love coming to work. It’s something I can do every day, all day because it’s always different. Technique: When you were little, what did you want to do when you grew up? Benton-Johnson: Oh my gosh … this is really interesting … my mom was a teacher, and I was like, “I do not want to be a teacher. I do not. I do not. I do not want to be a teacher.” So I was actually going to school to be an optometrist. I did a dual degree in biology and chemistry for my undergraduate degree, and then I went onto optometry school. All my life since I was little, even in middle school because I wore glasses, I was like, “I am going to be an eye doctor.” That was what I wanted to do, and once I got there I realized, “Oh, this is not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.” I ended up being, where am I, I’m in higher ed. I’m in education. I’ve taught in K-12 and I’ve taught higher ed on the education side, teaching students who were pursuing their doctorates. So I did education and higher education, but this is a different side that I like being on. I feel like I am right where I’m supposed to be. Technique: What do you get from this job that you didn’t get from working as a teacher or in higher education. Benton-Johnson: I get to have more input in the administration piece, and in directing the vision the way I want things to go.  In the class room, I’m more passing the knowledge onto students. But now, it’s kind of like directing the programs that support the knowledge and inventing programs that support the knowledge base. Technique: What do you like to do in your free time? Benton-Johnson: I love to watch a good movie or show. That’s my free time. When I have it, I mean I have kids so I’m always running around doing sports or traveling for work. But just kind of like students, when I get the time I enjoy it. I also love to listen to music. Technique: What do you like to listen to? Benton-Johnson: Jazz and blues, though blues is probably my favorite. Technique: Do you have anything you like to do in or around Atlanta? Benton-Johnson: I really can’t stand the traffic, and my favorite season is the fall. So then, I love to go to the park, watch the leaves, look at the colors. Driving down the highway, when there isn’t any traffic of course, and looking at all of the different colors on the trees.  I just love fall. Technique: What are some things that a lot of students don’t know that you wish they did? Benton-Johnson: So the things that I give to them all of the time: This too shall pass. You’ve got this. You can get it done. We wouldn’t admit you to Georgia Tech if you can’t get it done. Right now it doesn’t seem like you can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it’s there. With age comes wisdom. The things you stress out about now, you won’t later. For students, especially Georgia Tech students, they have to take a small time to do something that they enjoy to get refueled and reenergize to hit the books back again. They always seem like they are saying they can’t take the time, but they don’t realize that [not taking the time] impacts them being able to focus. It’s just stressing them out. So if they take time, step away from it, and do something that they enjoy, they will get reenergized, refueled to tackle it again with a different perspective, and through a different lens. I’m also really big on persistence, trying to stay persistent. Learn from your failures and stay persistent. Once again remember that this too shall pass. As one of my good friends says, “It gets greater later.” Technique: It’s very inspiring to listen to someone speak so passionately about their job. Benton-Johnson: It’s very rewarding. I don’t think I could see myself doing anything else. Touching lives. Seeing them. It’s so funny when they get older and they come back and they have babies. I think “Oh my gosh, I feel so old.” But it’s a good thing. I’m waiting on that day, when one of my students brings their child to me, and they’re in the summer engineering institute, or coming to Tech as a freshman. That’ll be the real “ahhh” moment.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 18, 2016 Very, Very Tiny X86 Systems 99 Comments by: Brian Benchoff September 30, 2016 The most interesting market for Intel in recent years has been very, very small form factor PCs. ARM is eating them alive, of course, but there are still places where very small and very low power x86 boards make sense. The latest release from SolidRun is the smallest we’ve seen yet. The SolidPC Q4 is one of the smallest x86 implementation you can find. It’s based around the MicroSoM, a module even smaller than a Raspberry Pi, and built around a carrier board that has all the ports you could ever want from the tiniest PC ever. The SolidPC Q4 is technically only a carrier board featuring a microSD slot, Displayport, HDMI 1.4B, two RJ45 ports with the option for PoE, three USB 3.0 Host ports, jacks for mic and stereo sound, and an M.2 2230 connector for a wireless module. The interesting part of this launch is the MicroSoM, a System on Module based on Intel’s Braswell architecture. Two models are offered, based on the quad-core Atom E8000 and the Pentium N3710. Both modules feature up to 8GB of DDR3L RAM and 4GB of eMMC Flash. The interesting part of this launch is the MicroSoM, a System on Module based on Intel’s Braswell architecture. Two models are offered, based on the quad-core Atom E8000 and the Pentium N3710. Both modules feature up to 8GB of DDR3L RAM and 4GB of eMMC Flash. The size of these modules is 52.8mm by 40mm, or just a shade larger than the stick-of-gum-sized Raspberry Pi Zero. The SolidPC isn’t intended to be a Raspberry Pi competitor. While those cheap ARM boards are finding a lot of great uses in industry, they’re no replacement for a small, x86 single board computer. The pricing for this module starts at $157 according to the product literature, with a topped out configuration running somewhere between $300 and $350, depending on options like a heatsink, enclosure, or power adapter. If you want a small single board computer with drivers for everything, there aren’t many other options: you certainly wouldn’t pick a no-name Allwinner board.

Always a challenge when the mind runs on the cranial equivalent of 30pin SIMMs… ;) Hey, hey, it could be worse — banks of individual DRAM chips were a thing, once, too — and before that, was SRAM, which –IMO– was significantly superior in all areas except for cost. Faster than period DRAM, cycle for cycle, and it didn’t have that little amnesia problem that DRAM has when somebody forgets to hit up the refresh line every so often… of course it was more expensive… and that’s how DRAM won that battle. For the record, I’m a bit of a Commodore nut, and, yes, I know, they used DRAM — and it makes me sore in the head to think about it. They were being cheap, and –quite sadly– cheap sells better than good, and it has for some time. I’m a strong believer in keeping accountants out of engineering ;) …wow, that went off topic fast.

Throw all of that in a cheap case and PSU and you have the same power at a cheaper price point. Now, if size does matter, you’d probably bite the bullet and pay the premium. But at that point, unless you just really need x86 there are equally capable ARM boards out there for a fraction of the cost of this one.

Where can I get an ARM board that has video out, a good ethernet connection, Good USB 2.0 support, video out, 4 sata ports, and a PCI slot?. I can find an x86 board that supports that for under $60 with power supply and ram. Even if you are running Linux x86 tends to offer you better software support and higher performance. Sure Pis are nice and small and even cheap but the wired network support and USB performance tend to be pretty bad. Forget about using them as NAS or even a router. Sure ARMS are good chips but a small cheap X86 that supports Windows, Linux, BSD and so on could be a really popular board. I have to wonder if any project that used an X86 over a pi could get on hack a day.

Their documentation sucks, and last time I looked they provided no way of actually using those I/O-pins that are connected to the Intel CPU, even though they bring them out on a header, and running Linux on a Lattepanda is a waste because the bluetooth- and WiFi-peripherals aren’t supported and so on. The Udoo x86 ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-x86-the-most-powerful-maker-board-ever/description ) is in pretty much every possible way a more compelling product, with higher-quality documentation, a much more experienced team behind it, more connectivity-options and so on and so forth.

As for the cheap end, with those lousy slow A4s and Celerons, I’m telling my folks that the $299 special, with only 4GB RAM, isn’t going to be any faster than their 5 year old mid range machines, which they’ve already got 8GB in probably. SSD isn’t really going to sell a new machine, they’re $80 for a usable size and you can stick them in anything and get same benefits. Mostly I think it’s because intel shot itself in the foot with maintaining high pricing on i5 and i7 due to AMD not being so competitive, which means they keep slipping weaksauce units under them to try and move anything at all. It’s like that late 80s, early 90s era when 386/486 were stratospheric pricing, but nobody cared apart from the CAD people because all the everyday stuff ran on DOS on a 1986 Turbo XT just fine.

Infokiosks, ATMs, even some electronic billboards use such systems. And most of the software is legacy, so there is no point in changing to x64 architecture. It’s like with the banks that still use COBOL because it was cheaper to maintain the code and hardware than doing an upgrade.

I just said you could never offer me enough to get me interested in COBOL again – try the grave yard there are lots of COBOL programmers there. Report comment Reply RÖB says: October 1, 2016 at 11:32 am PS: The COBOL runs on a virtual machine with DOS and communicates out via virtual serial port. That virtual machine is within another virtual machine that runs Linux and connect the virtual serial to TCP/IP and that virtual machine is within a version of windows server. Nightmare Much? Report comment Moryc says: October 1, 2016 at 1:19 pm Sysadmin who made that setup either collects Matryoshkas or is a big fan of Inception… Report comment RÖB says: October 1, 2016 at 4:33 pm @[Moryc] I would guess that over time successive sysadmis who are not COBOL programmers have just dealt with the issue as best they can. The original software (COBOL) obviously ran in DOS and most likely used Direct Port Interfacing via DMA, IRQ and Port Number. This method of interfacing is not possible on a modern OS and hence the virtualization of such and old operating system as DOS. This is more common that you may think. I have a name brand JTAG programmer here and it looks like someone who did the coding died and left a puzzle behind. The original code did much same thing and required Port Mapped IO. Their solution is mind boggling and here is how it goes. The programmer consists of a USB to Serial (JTAG) bridge followed by a large FPGA with lots of SD RAM and then a hardware JTAG interface for the target device. When you plug it in it is a USB to Serial (JTAG) bridge that is used to program the FPGA to be an X86 compatible system with the basic code to boot from serial. Then it disconnects and re-connects as it boots from plain serial and the synthesis platform is loaded. Then the connection cycles again and then it acts as a plain USB to Serial bridge and the HDL file to be synthesized is sent via the serial connection. It then syntheses the HDL file on the hardware virtualized x86 and programs the target device via a HDL encoded Mapped port to JTAG hardware interface. So when you plug it in you get the windows sounds for USB connect / disconnect several times and that led me to work out why. It seems that they lost the source code and comments. No problem! just fix it software virtualized hardware platform that runs the original compiled code.

Buying this thing to run a DOS application would be a poor choice because you would be paying for may houses to pull a very small cart and the horses would eat too much, making running time small if you have to carry food. Then you have to deal with more waste and the horses could never get up speed because the cart is too small. Really, what application would require a quad core in such a small form factor. You would need to be processing a lot of input, much more input than you could fit through Ethernet. Perhaps image processing or something like that but seriously I can think of exactly ZERO applications that would warrant such CPU power and if I could think of one then I would choose something cheaper. Small form factors are good for portable devices and portable devices run on batteries and this thing would need a truck battery.

The pricing for this module starts at $157 according to the product literature, with a topped out configuration running somewhere between $300 and $350 The differentiating applications for a small overpriced x86 single board computer are almost none compared to cheap ARM boards. Something that runs Windows isn’t an application. It has to do something. What can these x86 boards do significantly better than a $20 ARM board? Where’s the value? Sure there’s old legacy DOS/windows applications, but those were written at a time when there was little choice other than x86. The x86 “pc architecture” was never chosen for its features or excellent design, but for its relative low cost and mass production. Now there’s better alternatives, making the “pc architecture” for embedded designs a dinosaur. Windows CE is dead. Embedded x86 is dead. Move on. > If you want a small single board computer with drivers for everything, there aren’t many other options: you certainly wouldn’t pick a no-name Allwinner board. Define “divers for everything”. All Allwinner boards run Linux, and most of the kernel is open (with the exception of the Mali GPU, which is ARM IP, not Allwinner). But the same is true for x86. Open source graphics drivers are sketchy on PC architecture at best. Sure you can always download a vendor supplied BLOB (often only for windows), but that’s no different than Allwinner/Mali. And all x86 boards are hindered by the horrible UEFI and PC BIOS, making even some versions of windows impossible to use. Obtaining Windows drivers does not mean “drivers for everything”. Also an Orange Pi One is $13 shipped. You can get 10 of them and still be less than the starting price for this x86 board. And if you’re application is legacy DOS or Win3.1/Win95, DOSBox emulation works nicely. Raspberry Pi also has closed graphics drivers, but that’s not a deal breaker. There are many options. What is few are the compelling reasons to continue to use x86.

Vortex86 DX3 (specs at http://www.vortex86.com/?p=264) immediately comes to mind, RDC EmKore DS too (specs at http://www.rdc.com.tw/?route=home/emk albeit more focused to commercial applications). Those two SOCs are good for embedded shenanigans, but have certainly weak specs for a full-blown actual desktop OS… just imagine if they’ve gained momentum 5 years ago. Like Espressif that was another IC maker in a sea of manufacturers, and their game was “uplifted” by their very consumers ’cause of a nice product with potential, I cannot stop thinking that those two missed the maker & IoT bandwagon miserably. Maybe we could have had a way better Quark-alike SoC years before Intel also said me-too, or user friendly modules with half the Q4 size running Windows/Linux/YouNameIt effortlesly. Sigh.

Will the refreshed MacBook Pro break free from Intel chips? by Chris Smith 30 September 2016 0 shares Read Comments Apple is reportedly considering ditching Intel processors for the rumoured MacBook Pro refresh, thought to the coming next month. According to reports, the hotly-anticipated machine could feature an AMD Zen APU. According to Italian website bits and chips, Intel’s Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake units are not progressing as fast as hoped, prompting Apple to consider a different solution. The report says, AMD may have been tapped to create a custom SoC design for the new MacBook Pro. It is already thought AMD may leak the Polaris 10 GPU into the new MacBook so AMD could be doubling up here. Recent reports suggest Apple will announce the new MacBook Pro in late October, after it was left out of September’s iPhone 7 announcement. The laptop is rumoured to feature a touch-sensitive OLED panel to replace the current function keys. It is also thought the company could ditch the MagSafe charging solution for USB-C, a la the 12-inch Retina MacBook.

Chip maker Intel’s own ten-nanometer chips are due in second half of 2017. Speaking at a tech symposium in the northern Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, TSMC CEO Mark Liu said that his company recently started research and development (R&D) work for a cutting-edge five-nanomenter process technology, Nikkei reported Friday. The semiconductor foundry will also start trial production of seven-nanometer chips in small quantities in the first quarter of 2017. It’s recently started work on five-nanometer chips and has assigned 300 to 400 engineers to develop a three-nanometer technology. Plus, TSMC is currently researching a two-nanometer process. TSMC’s R&D budget increased substantially from $690 million in 2009 to $2.1 billion in 2015. For all of 2016, it’s allocated $10 billion for capital expenditure. TSMC built the A9 chip along with Samsung and is exclusively producing the latest A10 Fusion chip for the iPhone 7 on its 16-nanometer process. The company is also rumored to have secured a contract to build ‘A11’ chips for 2017 iPhones. Were Apple to swap out Intel in Macs for in-house designed CPUs based on iPhone and iPad chips, as it’s been suggested, TSMC’s should have its sophisticated manufacturing technology ready to make it happen and help Apple beat Intel at its own game.

I’d never even thought they could really bring it down so low… Hussain Alsanona Think of 2 nm then. Wow mind blowing to be honest Rolf Bause Dude, when I went to middle school 80-90nm were the norm 😀 In the meanwhile they passed this limit where even the wave length of light was starting to get a problem (used for the etching process) and they now basically need to trick physics a little with the stencils, in order to even still get it to work. And we now surpassed all of this for a long time already and they still manage to make it thinner and thinner… that’s what I was mainly talking about 😀 armyk Custom made chips with 10nm in Macs? That would blow competitors away… Ruturaj A 10nm mobile chip (what apple has) won’t be even near 4th generation 22nm i7. armyk You know based on? Ruturaj I don’t know how much powerful they will be, same as you don’t know if they will blow away competition. But I made a guess, given performance of current ARM processors, A10 chip and x86 chips. armyk Well I am positive they can design top of the range ARM processor and if they can manufacture with 10nm, they will have advantage. Then it is just matter of scaling. Ruturaj Sure I am positive they can design top of the range ARM processor and they will do it on 10nm. But ARM processors are not scalable, that’s why AMD have octa core processors but didn’t do as well as Intel’s dual core. But lets see. eqHullabaloo While technically TSMC will have their 10nm process out before intel from what I understand TSMC’s version of 10nm process will be larger than intels 10nm process. What TSMC is calling 10nm will have poorer transistor density compared to what intel is calling 10nm. The reason I wanted to point this out is that you can’t compare the two directly. I don’t want to get all technical on exact details, but if you’re really curious someone else who’s more knowledgeable in wafer fabrication would be able to explain it. mrgerbik TSMC process different then Intel’s.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 30, 2016 at 8:49AM Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is something of a rare, if not unique, phenomenon within the chip industry. The company brings in an extraordinary amount of revenue -- $55.4 billion in 2015 -- at an extremely robust gross profit margin of over 60%. That favorable combination makes Intel one of the most profitable chip companies in the world, raking in a whopping $14 billion in operating profit and $11.4 billion in net income in 2015. Because of the importance of Intel's gross profit margin to the company's overall profitability, it's worth taking a look at some of the key factors that influence this figure. Here are two big ones that come to mind. Product features and competitiveness Former Intel Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith said it best on the company's second quarter earnings call back in July 2015: For us, the key is to have great products, and that's why we're adding this third wave of products. At the first approximation, that's the best correlation of gross margin is when you've got leadership products, you tend to have a healthy gross margin. Indeed, Intel's personal computer and server/data center processor products usually offer best-in-class performance and power efficiency. Furthermore, Intel has done a good job over the years of continuing to integrate additional features and technologies that previously required separate chips, allowing the company to capture additional value with its offerings. If Intel can continue to field feature-rich products that deliver unmatched efficiency and performance, it should continue to command robust margins. However, if Intel slips (or competitors execute really well), then the company's gross profit margins would be at risk. Product cost structure Gross profit margin is a function of both the amount that a company can charge per-unit and the manufacturing costs per-unit of a given product. Having competitive features and performance enables Intel to command relatively high prices for its products. However, if the company can only achieve that product competitiveness by blowing up its cost structure, then its margins see no improvement. A good rule of thumb is that, assuming all else equal, a larger chip is going to be more expensive to manufacture than a smaller chip. What Intel has worked to do for quite some time is to develop different variants of its products targeted at different price and performance points. More expensive, higher-performance chips tend to be larger -- as they usually pack in additional processor cores, graphics, and so on -- while lower-cost, lower-performance chips tend to be smaller. Building multiple variants of a chip to target different price points does require additional research and development spending, but at the unit and revenue scale that the chipmaker operates in, the additional spending is more than offset by the gross profit margin benefit from building "right-sized" products for each segment. That said, chip size isn't the only thing that affects cost structure. Intel owns and operates its own chip manufacturing plants and spends significantly to develop the manufacturing processes to actually build those chips. The yield rates that Intel achieves with these manufacturing technologies directly affect a chip's cost structure. Remember, if you assume wafer cost is fixed, and if you assume the number of chips per wafer is fixed -- dependent on the size of the chip -- then the cost of those chips depends on how many of those come off the wafer usable, since better yields mean more salable chips for a given wafer cost.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Sep 30, 2016 at 9:45AM Image source: AMD. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has made meaningful progress this year. It launched Polaris, its line of mainstream graphics cards that aim to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Various financial maneuvers, including multiple joint ventures and a stock offering, have strengthened the company's balance sheet. And a return to non-GAAP operating profitability during the second quarter signaled that the worst may be over. The second phase of AMD's comeback will begin next year. Zen, the company's upcoming CPU architecture, will launch early in the year, with PC variants coming first, followed by server variants, and finally APUs. Vega, AMD's upcoming high-end GPU, is expected to begin shipping in the first half of the year, with the goal of challenging NVIDIA in the high-end of the GPU market after years of playing second fiddle. While AMD's turnaround seems to be picking up steam, both Zen and Vega will need to be successful for the company to reach its full potential. Why Zen is important Expectations are high leading up to Zen's release. AMD has promised significant performance improvements that should at the very least narrow the gap between its own products and those of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). According to AMD, Zen will boost instructions per cycle by 40% compared to the previous generation of CPUs, a major increase enabled by a host of improvements. Image source: AMD. Winning back share in the PC market will be the first goal. Zen will focus on the high-end of the market at launch, with AMD aiming to peel away profitable market share from Intel. With the PC market as a whole continuing to slump, going after the high-end gives the company the best chance at returning to profitability. The server market is equally important for AMD. Intel currently dominates the market for server CPUs, with AMD's market share essentially rounding down to zero. AMD estimates that the total addressable market is around $18 billion, so even clawing back 5% of the market from Intel would significantly boost AMD's top line. Intel won't give up market share without a fight, but AMD's server business can't really get any worse. Zen doesn't need to be better than Intel's products for AMD to win back some market share, but it does need to close the performance gap. If Zen lives up to the hype, AMD's turnaround will continue to gain momentum. If it doesn't, returning to sustainable profitability will be tough. Why Vega is important Image source: AMD. While Polaris aims squarely at the mainstream portion of the graphics card market, Vega, which is expected to launch during the first half of 2017, will be AMD's re-entry into the high-end of the market. Ever since NVIDIA launched the GTX 970 and GTX 980 in late 2014, the company has dominated the market for expensive, and highly profitable, graphics cards. Vega will be AMD's attempt to appeal to the high-end gaming PC market. NVIDIA has a head start, launching the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 earlier this year. Higher-end variants are expected to be released in the coming months as well, including a rumored GTX 1080 Ti. NVIDIA's next-gen GPU, Volta, is unlikely to be launched earlier than the second half of 2017, but AMD's Vega will be launching into a market dominated by NVIDIA. Vega will need to be disruptive in order to pry away high-end market share from NVIDIA. If AMD succeeds in producing a viable challenger to NVIDIA's high-end cards, the company's graphics business could become more profitable compared to a scenario where the company only succeeds in winning back mainstream market share. For AMD, 2016 was important, but 2017 will be a critical year as well. The fate of AMD's nascent turnaround will be determined by the success of Zen and Vega.

An Easy Way To Try Intel & RADV Vulkan Drivers On Fedora 24 Written by Michael Larabel in Fedora on 30 September 2016 at 09:19 AM EDT. 15 Comments Fedora 25 should have good support for the open-source Vulkan Linux drivers (particularly if it lands the next Mesa release) while Fedora 24 users can now more easily play with the latest Mesa Git RADV and Intel ANV Vulkan drivers via a new repository. A Phoronix reader has setup a Fedora Copr repository that is building Intel's Vulkan driver from Mesa Git plus the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver re-based from its source (David Airlie's semi-interesting GitHub branch). Fedora COPR, for the uninformed, is the distribution's equivalent to Ubuntu PPA repositories. From a Fedora 24 box, when running dnf copr enable mystro256/vulkan-git users can then run dnf install mesa-libvulkan-intel or dnf install mesa-libvulkan-radeon to fetch the Intel and/or Radeon drivers, respectively. More details on this repository for the Git Vulkan drivers on F24 can be found here. The same user is also maintaining an amd-staging-kernel repo to have the very latest AMDGPU DRM testing code. Of course, with either repository, use with caution.

Apple CEO Tim Cook Copyright Andrew Burton, Getty Images Advertisement Apple Inc. and Ireland are preparing appeals to argue that European Union competition investigators unfairly kept them in the dark during a probe that ended in a record 13 billion-euro ($14.6 billion) tax bill, people with knowledge of their case say. As they weigh their court challenges, the pair contend that the EU neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Their appeals would be reminiscent of Intel Corp.’s complaint that the EU trampled on its rights in a separate probe nearly a decade ago. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s team insists there was never a U-turn and that it kept Apple (IW 500/2) and Ireland up to date with developments from the time the probe was opened in 2014 through Aug. 30 -- when Ireland was ordered to claw back the proceeds of alleged sweetheart tax deals. “The defender, the member state, has the right to know exactly what are the objections and if the objections change,” said Jacques Derenne, a Brussels-based lawyer at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP. “If it’s confirmed that the final decision addresses issues, facts and even legal interpretations that have not been discussed with the member state, there is a problem.” The defender, the member state, has the right to know exactly what are the objections and if the objections change." — Jacques Derenne, lawyer at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP In an order that reverberated across the Atlantic, the EU slapped Apple with the multibillion euro bill, saying Ireland granted unfair deals that reduced the company’s effective corporate tax rate to as little as 0.005% in 2014. The U.S. Treasury hit back, saying the EU was making itself a "supra-national tax authority" that could threaten global tax reform efforts. The 0.005% figure cited by the commission is “extremely misleading and deceptive,” Apple said in a note to investors this month. “We paid $400 million in corporate income taxes in Ireland in 2014 -- considerably more than the commission’s figure suggests.” Popular Now Tesla’s Future in Trump’s World Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why Cutting Edge Technologies Power Cincinnati Industries But during the Apple case, scrutiny of the company’s tax affairs in Ireland appeared to shift from so-called transfer pricing arrangements on transactions between units which are used to calculate taxable profit, according to the people familiar with the investigation. The final decision focused on how Apple allocated almost all its European sales profits to what the EU said were “head offices” not subject to tax. Transfer pricing wasn’t mentioned in last month’s press release. Apple says none of its units was ever exempt from tax -- and that under the law they are subject to deferred U.S. tax. While the commission denies a change in approach occurred, Apple and the Irish government were rebuffed repeatedly when they sought fuller information on the supposed U-turn, the people said. Apple and Ireland first got wind of the change of direction in November 2014 when the EU sought answers on intellectual property issues. Both separately asked officials to explain what the investigation was now focusing on without getting clear information, the people said. Even a January meeting between Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Vestager failed to get answers. Unhappy Intel Memories For Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, the affair may stir up unhappy memories from his time at Intel, which faced a record antitrust fine for thwarting smaller chipmakers. “The commission changed course a number of times and has taken all sorts of steps to obscure that fact from us and from the Irish,” Sewell told reporters immediately after the EU decision on Apple last month. "We were not given the opportunity to defend this case in the way that we should’ve been."

Powered by the Intel® CurieTM module, a tiny, low- power hardware product, the glasses gather biometric data from the wearer, using sensors that monitor brainwave, heart rate and breathing data to infer stress in real time. During the presentation the wearer’s biometric data was then sent to the model’s belt using Bluetooth, which using the Intel® Compute Stick, a tiny computing device, captured the data from the glasses and translated the information into visualizations that interpret the wearer’s stress level. These visualizations are projected by the belt onto a wall as the models move down the runway.  The projected visualizations then remind the wearer to try and reduce stress levels where needed, with the imagery changing in real-time to correspondence with the body’s response.  Intel and Chalayan showed five studies of the unique glasses and belts, which following Paris Fashion Week will be on display at the Design Museum’s “Fear and Love: Reactions to a Complex World” exhibition in London starting in November.  #fashion-week #news #afp Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Best Buy’s pre-Black Friday 2016 sale is live right now – here are the 20 best deals BGR News Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far BGR News iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Microsoft cuts top Xbox One games by 40% in Black Friday deals The Verge New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech AirSelfie drone is small enough to stow away in a phone case Digital Trends This smart crib will help your baby sleep safely through the night Yahoo Tech Privacy |Terms |About our Ads |Suggestions Brought to you by Yahoo News Network
Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Internet New Ethernet standards will offer up to 5Gbps performance using cables you already own New Ethernet standards will offer up to 5Gbps performance using cables you already own By Joel Hruska on September 30, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Consumer Ethernet performance has been stuck at gigabit speeds for nearly 20 years. Apple was the first company to ship gigabit Ethernet in motherboards. Intel’s 875P chipset popularized the feature in the PC market by connecting the Ethernet controller to the northbridge, thereby offering improved performance. Thirteen years later, gigabit is still the standard for wired Ethernet — but that might be about to change, thanks to a new wired networking standard from the IEEE 802.3bz task force. There are multiple reasons why we’ve been stuck on gigabit for as long as we have. 10GbE requires more expensive cabling — either fiber optic cable in some cases, or more expensive Cat6a or Cat7 cabling for others. It’s not as backwards-compatible with previous standards (half-duplex operation isn’t supported), and routers, switches, and network cards that can support 10GbE are all far more expensive than their gigabit counterparts. But one simple reason gigabit Ethernet has stuck around so long is that it’s taken a long time for the average home network to demand enough bandwidth to saturate it. That’s slowly starting to change. Wireless performance improvements, the increased popularity of media streaming, and the slow rollout of gigabit fiber across the US (thanks in part to Google) are all signs that in the long run, we’re going to need a faster standard. The two new IEEE standards, known as 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T, should satisfy that need. These two standards were specifically created to use 10GbE signaling, but at a rate that would be compatible with existing runs of Cat5e and Cat6 cable out to 100 meters. The 2.5Gbps standard can run on Cat5e out to 100 meters, while the 5Gbps standard requires Cat6 cable to run 100 meters. Both should be far easier — and cheaper — to bring to market than current 10GbE technologies. Image by Wikipedia This is still a long-term rollout for most of us. Typical homes and small offices pull more data from the internet than across local networks, and the vast majority of Americans don’t have access to gigabit yet. Home and small office networks may also still require new hardware to take advantage of the standard. Many lower-end routers and switches that advertise themselves as gigabit capable only support that standard on a single port rather than across the entire device. Still, the nature of a standard is to be forward-looking. Technically proficient consumers who build their own networks could still see immediate performance improvements from higher-speed networking cards and gear, and newer wireless standards are already capable of challenging gigabit wired performance. Hopefully the appearance of the new 2.5GbE and 5GbE standards will spur companies like Intel and AMD to start work on compatible chipsets.

It is of course referring to the upcoming Intel 7th Generation Core processors, also referred to as Kaby Lake processors. Intel launched its 7th Generation Core processors exactly a month ago – but only for laptops and other compact form factor devices. That first release of Kaby Lake processors was of the Y-Series and U-Series chips. We don't have an exact date for the launch of Kaby Lake CPUs for desktops but it is generally thought that these chips will launch and become available in January. So it looks like we still have a three months plus wait for desktop Kaby Lake CPUs. Nevertheless, it's great to see a major motherboard manufacturer get all their current modern motherboards ready for Intel's next generation processors in advance. MSI says that all the BIOS updates are now made available for download via the official MSI support website. The new BIOS files bring "better performance and compatibility using the latest Intel processors with better specification and higher frequencies" says MSI. I don't have an MSI motherboard but downloaded one of the new BIOS files, apparently updated on 22nd Sept, to see if there was any further information in the traditional accompanying 'readme.txt' file. All the release note said was "This BIOS fixes the following problem of the previous version: Supported next generation new Intel CPU." (This was for the MSI Z170A GAMING M5 - see pic above). The full list of Kaby Lake supporting motherboards with the new BIOS update file downloadable is embedded below. With the compatibility being the only addition to this BIOS file I would probably wait until I had bought a Kaby Lake chip, in January or beyond, before applying any of these BIOS updates. Looking at the frequency of BIOS updates for the GAMING M5 it (and other models) could easily receive another BIOS update by that time.

After all Sandy Bridge motherboards worked with Ivy Bridge with BIOS update, and Haswell boards worked with broadwell with a BIOS update. If any of the companies do not support Kaby Lake on the 100 chipset boards, they are just being lazy and not caring about their customer.

By B. Saimin   AMD’s a custom, SOC Design with HBM2 Memory System. For a long time Apple MacBook Pro series has been featuring a mix of U and H series processors, Usually, both tiers get their graphics updated with performance extent around in the same time but with Kaby Lake, the High-performance models might be challenging. There are rumors that Intel would be starting a new line of CPU family known as Kaby Lake. These CPUs will be available in several variants. Where, MacBook Pro’s looking for reliable and faster graphics performance and that does not seem to be the case in with Intel new processors   Picture, Hassan Mujtaba AMD may offer latest Zen Architecture custom chips in 2018.

As they weigh their court challenges, the pair contend that the EU neglected to flag a shift in emphasis in the investigation, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Their appeals would be reminiscent of Intel Corp.’s complaint that the EU trampled on its rights in a separate probe nearly a decade ago. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager’s team insists there was never a U-turn and that it kept Apple and Ireland up to date with developments from the time the probe was opened in 2014 through Aug. 30 -- when Ireland was ordered to claw back the proceeds of alleged sweetheart tax deals. “The defender, the member state, has the right to know exactly what are the objections and if the objections change,” said Jacques Derenne, a Brussels-based lawyer at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP. “If it’s confirmed that the final decision addresses issues, facts and even legal interpretations that have not been discussed with the member state, there is a problem.” In an order that reverberated across the Atlantic, the EU slapped Apple with the multi-billion euro bill, saying Ireland granted unfair deals that reduced the company’s effective corporate tax rate to as little as 0.005 percent in 2014. The U.S. Treasury hit back, saying the EU was making itself a "supra-national tax authority" that could threaten global tax reform efforts. The 0.005 percent figure cited by the commission is “extremely misleading and deceptive,” Apple said in a note to investors this month. “We paid $400 million in corporate income taxes in Ireland in 2014 -- considerably more than the commission’s figure suggests.” But during the Apple case, scrutiny of the company’s tax affairs in Ireland appeared to shift from so-called transfer pricing arrangements on transactions between units which are used to calculate taxable profit, according to the people familiar with the investigation. The final decision focused on how Apple allocated almost all its European sales profits to what the EU said were “head offices” not subject to tax. Transfer pricing wasn’t mentioned in last month’s press release. Apple says none of its units was ever exempt from tax -- and that under the law they are subject to deferred U.S. tax. While the commission denies a change in approach occurred, Apple and the Irish government were rebuffed repeatedly when they sought fuller information on the supposed U-turn, the people said. Sought Answers Apple and Ireland first got wind of the change of direction in November 2014 when the EU sought answers on intellectual property issues. Both separately asked officials to explain what the investigation was now focusing on without getting clear information, the people said. Even a January meeting between Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and Vestager failed to get answers. For Apple’s general counsel, Bruce Sewell, the affair may stir up unhappy memories from his time at Intel, which faced a record antitrust fine for thwarting smaller chipmakers. “The commission changed course a number of times and has taken all sorts of steps to obscure that fact from us and from the Irish,” Sewell told reporters immediately after the EU decision on Apple last month. "We were not given the opportunity to defend this case in the way that we should’ve been." Kept Abreast Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said that it kept Apple and Ireland abreast during the investigation that was formally opened in June 2014.

Those rulings "endorsed an internal allocation of profits within Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe, between their respective head offices and branches, allowing Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe to pay very little tax on its profits." Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan has said he was only informed of the vast amount of back taxes he would be ordered to collect from Apple, hours before Vestager told reporters in Brussels that the iPhone maker got illegal tax advantages. Apple declined to comment beyond referring to Sewell’s earlier remarks. Ireland’s finance ministry also declined to comment. Changed Emphasis Philip Andrews, a lawyer at McCann FitzGerald in Dublin who isn’t involved in the case, said the information the EU has made public so far -- a June 2014 letter to the Irish government when the case was opened and a press release last month -- do show a change in emphasis. "It’s clear the commission has changed its theory of harm, at least from the press release," he said. "The rationale does appear to be different from the case that was pursued" initially in 2014 "which focused on whether the transfer pricing followed arms length" guidelines on how goods and services are transferred between units of a company. "There was certainly a surprise when the press release came out and Vestager announced a figure," Andrews said. "The commission kept that quite secret until the very last moment." But even if the probe did change, it may be hard to prove that the commission broke any rules of procedure with the way it handled the case. The bloc’s state-aid law sets far fewer limits on regulators than antitrust and merger probes where there are strict deadlines and clearer rules on what information companies are entitled to see. Main Target Even though Apple will also appeal, from a procedural point of view, under the EU’s state-aid rules, member states and not companies are the main target. Vestager’s team focused on Ireland for granting unfair tax advantages to Apple, which meant the company’s role was largely confined to supplying investigators with information they wanted. Technically, that also means only Ireland had a formal right to defense as the case unfolded and could attempt to argue at the EU court that its rights had been breached. In reality, both are in it together, with full cooperation and disclosure between Apple and the Dublin government. Ireland has just over two months from the Aug. 30 decision to lodge an appeal at the EU’s General Court.

View Latest Posts >>> Pedophile Terrorism is Running Rampant in America By Preston James, Ph.D on September 29, 2016 All Lives Matter ~ Similar to the Pennsylvania Appalachian Belt, the Minnesota Strip feeds kids into the national Sex-Trafficking Network to slake the World's never-ending thirst for angelic-looking Sex Toys by  Preston James $200 Sometimes Minnesota nice isn’t as nice as you might think. Right now there is a local and high level cover-up of major sex trafficking of minors in Minnesota. Some of the young girls are being sold for as little as $200.00 USD. Many have been taken out of state for purposes of prostitution, obvious White Slavery crimes which are federal felonies, kept in bondage with induced drug addictions and serious threats. About 90% of the sex trafficking that starts in Minnesota is associated with Black Pimps. Political Correctness and recent concern with the George Soros’ secretly-backed “Black Lives Matter” (which is actually led by Intel assets) tends to motivate local LE to want to avoid any energetic investigations. White USG officials at moderately high to very high levels run the actual deployment of these compromise ops, while the black pimps do most of the procurement. In past years, when Gary McGaughey was head of Vice at the Minneapolis Police Department, he and Detective Rothstein worked the case now known as the “Minnesota Connection“. Through their efforts, and some honest, standup FBI agents like themselves, they were able to arrest and gain convictions with long jail sentences for 11 of the 12 top human-trafficking pimps in America. Detective Gary McGaughey had an impeccable record and, after he and Detective Rothstein assembled the case against Hubert Humphrey for taking illegal payments from the Milk Industry, the Secret Shadow Government deployed numerous means that destroyed Detective McGaughey and his family. This incredible hero died a broken man, never to be honored for his amazing Law Enforcement achievements for the community, or for what a standup, honorable and honest police officer he was. His career was a gift to the whole community of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Do middle class Americans have feet of clay because they are victims of their own self-induced mind-kontrol prison of Political Correctness? Are we unwilling to address Sex-Trafficking and the actual causes of blatant urban crime, which is always a secret systemic consequence of high-level government, LE and Intel corruption? Detective McGaughey was known for frequently making the following claim about how human compromise operations were accomplished: “I know enough about vice to know that everybody has a chink in their armor”. To effectively human compromise someone all Intel has to do is find it and exploit it by providing the proper custom designed temptation. I am presenting this difficult truth here because, like many in LE, good black people are very frustrated that white America is like a giant with feet of clay that refuses to go after the real criminals at every level, including the black gangs, the black pimps, the white CIA drug traffickers and warmongers within the USG, Intel and the Pentagon. The majority of middle aged blacks are pro law-and-order, and desire whites to get over their guilt and take on these criminal black pimps that prey on their young girls and boys, as well as they want them to prosecute all the black and white crooks in DC (and there are a lot that need to be prosecuted). Most adult blacks are just like middle class whites, they want law and order in their communities. Most of the High level pedophile Honey traps are run by this Satanic pedophile network with the help of the Mossad, the CIA and all covered up by the FBI. Some of the young sex-trafficked victims are used as Intel honey traps to set a snare from which numerous Members of Congressman and high Military and Corporate Officials can be blackmailed and controlled. Some end up used exclusively in Satanic pedophile networks for Honey Traps used by Intel such as was described in the Book The Franklin Cover Up by Attorney John DeCamp, a personal friend of former CIA Director William Colby who was murdered after he retired. These Intel related “Honey Trap” human compromise operations are the specialty of the CIA, MI-5&6 and the Mossad. Naturally the FBI’s top managers at the Washington Field Office (WFO) are charged with keeping all these operations covered up FOREVER by using any means necessary, and this is of course authorized under so-called “national security”. Omaha ring kidnaps Johnny Gosch from his paper route and he later shows up in a photo Any good FBI agent who starts investigating these crimes, finds the investigation is immediately taken over by the WFO, and he is pulled out of it. Local Law Enforcement who get too inquisitive or try to do their jobs get stepped on in various ways to the degree necessary and are told that the investigation is now being handled by the Feds and they are no longer needed. Like with so many other USG and Intel linked RICO crime, the FBI refuses to fully investigate Intel-linked sex-trafficking and Honey Trap human compromise operations at any level. A member of the privileged elite with then underage Virginia Roberts photographed in early 2001 (file photo) Make no mistake about it, this sex trafficking in Minnesota (as well as most other sex trafficking in America) is linked to a very large worldwide, satanic-linked, organized crime pedophile network, which hides in the shadows and in secret societies. This satanic pedophile network uses Intel agencies, specifically the FBI, to keep it covered up under so-called “national security”, which is invoked to prevent exposure and public outrage. When you get right down to it, whenever national security is invoked these days, it is not referring to protecting the security of the USA, but is actually all about protecting the security, power and standing of the Rothschild Khazarian Mafia and their appointed Doofuses and Cutouts in high positions of Authority. This story of sex trafficking is the “tip of the iceberg” and involves law enforcement at all levels, failing to act for fear of retaliation and because of high level interference. It also involves Minnesota State Legislators who are refusing to take action despite numerous individuals, including one retired Law Enforcement expert, contacting them with evidence of these major crimes against children and adolescent minors. US Congressman Erik Paulsen–Doing the best he can with limited knowledge of “human compromise operations” by the various Intel agencies which are used to control politicians and USG and Corporate officials. Erik Paulsen a good man and a very well-meaning Minnesota Member of the US Congress. He has done his best, and has made an effort to fight sex-trafficking legislatively. Actually, Congressman Paulsen is one of the few good guys in Congress, who has been trying to stop this horrendous crime of sex trafficking. It is like trying to swim up a waterfall because the “fix is in” at the highest levels of government, the Pentagon and Intel with those Select few that sit at the top of the Establishment Hierarchy (EH). Sadly despite his consultations with an honest Minneapolis Vice Detective who nears retirement, he appears to not understand the way this problem must be approached to be effective in greatly reducing it and even stopping it. I sent Congressman Paulsen a request that he meet with America’s top expert of sex trafficking, prostitution and pedophilia, retired LE Detective James Rothstein (NYCPD Gold Shield Retired), and offered to facilitate the meeting. I knew such a consultation would be necessary for him to be adequately briefed on the extent of this problem of sex trafficking in Minnesota and nationwide; and without help, his actions would be doomed. And that seems to have been the case. Representative Paulson never contacted or met with Detective Rothstein. Maybe his staff screened out my request and he never got it, who knows what happened? Congressman Paulsen went on to propose legislation in the US House of Representatives entitled, “Stop Exploitation through Sex Trafficking (HR 159). This was passed in the House and sent to the Senate as (S166) where it was sent to the Judicial Committee, where it sits inactive now. Sadly, I must report that, even if passed in the US Senate as S166, HR159 is a lightweight effort with no chance of success in stopping the now rampant sex trafficking, which is a very big deal in Minnesota, as well as many other states too. Detective Rothstein has authored a draft resolution that, if adopted as law in the states, would deal a direct blow to sex trafficking by attacking the root cause of the cover up. According to a Congressional rating services, this Bill HR159/S166 has a probability of becoming passed and signed into law of about 26%, not very promising. And if passed it could never be effective anyway. _________ Proposed Solution Detective Rothstein has an excellent solution to this problem of human sex trafficking, which should be enacted into all State Laws. As Mayor his city passed a Resolution that is designed to serve as model legislation for every State of the Union. This would have real teeth if passed and implemented as State law. He has been fighting to expose all this for many years, and especially since he retired from the NYCPD, where he was a Gold Shield Detective assigned to “15 man special projects team” that also worked for the NY State Crime Commission on very sensitive matters, such as this subject. After retirement from the NYCPD as a Gold Shield Detective, Detective Rothstein eventually moved back to his home town in Minnesota and became mayor. In an effort to set a new standard for fighting Sex Trafficking, his city passed the first adequate solution to human sex trafficking — a resolution that needs to become law in every state. RESOLUTION 2014 08 ResolutionOnHumanTrafficking by yanira on Scribd _________ Detective Rothstein’s background Det. James Rothstein, NYCPD Gold Shield, Police Intel, NY Crime Commission Special Squad (now retired). America’s No. 1 expert in sex trafficking, organized pedophile human compromise ops and illegal narcotics trafficking. Responsible for the prosecution and conviction of more high level human compromise criminals than any other LE person in America. Det. Rothstein is a totally stand up man who can be trusted and has a distinguished record that is unmatched. Detective Rothstein’s background in LE involved operating at a very high level with involvement in numerous highly sensitive national security related and covered up crimes, including the international satanic and Intel linked sex Trafficking and pedophile network. During this time, the detective made numerous trips to Minnesota investigating the Minnesota Pipeline to NYC for sex trafficking and prostitution with Gary McGaughey and other ethical, stand up detectives in the Minneapolis Police Department. After retirement, Detective Rothstein moved back to his Minnesota home town to become the Mayor. He exposed the pedophile priests at St. John’s Abbey, and has continued his fight to expose the whole human sex trafficking pedophile network. Detective James Rothstein is a totally standup man, has served the NYCPD, the State of New York and all of America with great distinction. His accomplishments in LE and Police Intel would fill a book. In fact, Rothstein has a book that is pretty much complete and will be published in the not too distant future. I have read the first drafts, and I can tell you it is spellbinding to say the least. It is not an exaggeration to state that Detective Rothstein is by far the top expert on sex trafficking, organized pedophilia and drug trafficking in America. Detective Rothstein’s favorite phrase based on witnessing many years of cover ups and unwillingness for the authorities to deal with all the crimes of human compromise of politicians, and USG and corporate officials: “In our politically correct, feel-good society, there is no place for truth or for honesty.” Rothstein, a German Catholic served the NY State Crime Commission under Governor Hugh Carey as part of a special anti-corruption squad that traveled all over America investigating and arresting pedophiles. At one time, as many as 100 NYCPD Detectives were assigned to this squad. What Detective Rothstein found out was that many of these children sex trafficked from Minnesota and other locations ended up under the control of a powerful satanic linked pedophile network linked to Intel, the Establishment Hierarchy (EH), and the Secret Shadow Government (SSG). Image from April 28, 2015 Press Conference Nineteen Monk Offenders from Saint John’s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota (USA) It turns out many of these sex traffickers were actually pedophiles who were either working with the CIA or serving as their “protected informants”. And most of these offenders are protected because they played an important part in setting up “honey traps” to human-compromise corporate leaders, and elected or appointed USG and high state officials. Most of their work was intended to compromise weak, perverted DC politicians, and this should be no surprise to many who know how DC really works. Detective Rothstein’s career at the NYCPD was illustrious, with many national security related situations, some of which became publicized, such as the time he saved Marita Lorenz’s life and arrested Frank Sturgiss, aka Frank Fiorini, the notorious Watergate Burglar and JFK Assassination Op40 trigger-man at Dealey Plaza that terrible day 11-22-63. Detective Rothstein has continued investigating corruption since his retirement from the NYCPD and has done everything he can to expose the pedophile Priest crimes of St. John’s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota. St. John’s University is a separate institution and should in no way be blamed for these incredibly serious crimes of St. John’s Abbey. St. John’s Abbey should be sued into bankruptcy, with all its proceeds given to past victims and their surviving families. So far they have been protected by the local police, the FBI and the CIA. The term surviving families is appropriate here because there have been un-prosecuted murders associated with St. John’s Abbey due to police inaction. There are many secret victims of this St. John’s Abbey Pedophilia who have never come forward, and numerous suicides of victims who tried to tell, but no one would believe them. Most parents who have been told years later by their child about being abused by a St. Johns Abbey Priest have had great difficulty fathoming that their own Priest could be so two-faced and evil inside, when trusted to be alone with parish children, but then to harm them and betray their trust so seriously. Personally I would like to see St. John’s Abbey bankrupted for what they have done, completely remodeled or even torn down, and transformed into a wellness and healing center for the victims and surviving families of these Pedophile Priests of St. Johns Abbey. Even though some have died of old age and were never exposed, there are still those who have skated for their crimes against young children, and some of these still at St. John’s Abbey un-confronted, un-prosecuted and not publicly identified. _______________ Related Posts: Army Special Forces soldiers killed in Jordan were working for the CIA Motorola is Dead but Donbass lives on A Timeline of CIA Atrocities Covert strikes on Assad back on US table to prevent ‘fall of Aleppo’ – report Doctors of Death: Syrian doctors in the US and their CIA-ISIS ties The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Log in to Reply JS  October 2, 2016 at 5:43 pm Dr James, Minnesota and Minneapolis/St Paul have very high numbers of American Indian women and children who are sexually trafficked and murdered, and the picture isn’t complete without mentioning them. Many are stolen from the reservations, many from city streets, and many from the child welfare/foster care system. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  October 3, 2016 at 9:46 am Very good point and so true. Fortunately there is now someone that is going to appropriately address this major problem as a separate issue in addition to Detective Rothstein. But everyone must do everything reasonably possible to expose this great evil perpetrated against Indians in Minnesota. It must be fully exposed and stopped. Right now these crimes often ending in murder are covered up. This is disgusting and must stop. The biggest power available is the mothers. If they organize they can apply more political pressure than any other group to expose this and stop it. Cosmodrome  October 2, 2016 at 8:49 am Good article! And that Resolution is a great document. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  October 2, 2016 at 10:37 am Yes, and it is based on many years of active police work by Detective Rothstein, some which involved some of the most sensitive investigation into government and Intel operations related to this involving those who are responsible for these human compromise crimes in the first place.

The link I posted outlines those efforts. Preston James, Ph.D  October 2, 2016 at 10:32 am So sorry to hear of your great loss. Sadly this happens to many mothers in America every years as so many children kidnapped by the sex traffickers end up murdered. Detective James Rothstein consulted with the most respected judicial experts and human behavioral experts and discussed how to stop this. He told me that the best solution they could come up with was that the Mothers had to organize and apply massive political pressure to do this and this was probably the only solution that can work right now. jensingr  October 3, 2016 at 5:38 pm I am sorry too Debra, thanks for your bravery.

Emma Yacht  October 5, 2016 at 10:05 am It occurred to me to present this petition here to help transmute some energy. “Bless, O Lord, the alters of the persecuted ones for their Highest Good in the multiverse in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos. And Heavenly Father, bind the energy of the blessed alters; make it so for time and all Eternity on every planet in every timeline in every Multiverse on every plane and in every Dimension and beyond, in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos. And heavenly Father, disintegrate the dna and disintegrate the rna of the energy-bound and blessed alters for Time and All Eternity on every Planet in every Timeline in every Multiverse on every Plane and in every dimension and beyond, in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos. And heavenly Father, remove the disintegrated dna and disintegrated rna and bound energy of the blessed alters to one dimensional points; make it so for Time and all Eternity on every planet in every timeline in every Multiverse on every plane and in every dimension and beyond, in the name of Jesus Christ, Christos.

Slowly but surely, the perverted satanic agenda is creeping into being the”‘norm”. The temples of Baal being set up everywhere is next. Log in to Reply JohninMK  September 30, 2016 at 7:40 am It seems remarkable that Detective Rothstein is still alive to tell the tale. A very brave man indeed. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  September 30, 2016 at 8:49 am Yes, but he has strong friends and allies in some very high places. He has always been a stand up man, someone whose word is always kept and who has proved many times he can be trusted by informants and even those he arrested. He always played by the rules and has been fair and square. Actually he has had the biggest most loyal informants one could ever imagine because of this. His book when it comes out will detail this and why he has been trusted and revered so much by informants, many whom he rescued and protected from this sex trafficking and prostitution horror. To this very day much of this network of informants is intact and functioning. Numerous FBI agents have come to him over the years who were assigned to investigate these crimes and they would ask him, “how far can I go before I lose my job or get sent to Butte Montana chasing stolen cars?” He always would advise them the ways they could do the most good without losing their jobs. The WFO has always been the main cover up agent in all this just like it is now with so many high level crimes by the RKM and the super-elite deviants who use the law and the USG to protect themselves, often invoking so-called national security which is only their own security and has nothing to do with real security of America or We The People. wjabbe  September 30, 2016 at 2:47 am My late Mother and Father were both born in the State of Minnesota; she in St. Paul to immigrant parents from Denmark and Norway and he in a small town to parents with roots to Germany. With the exception of picking potatoes in the hot sun, and the cold weather, they loved this State. They would have been very upset at reading this excellent but disturbing report on evil activities in their birthplace. I am frankly glad they are not alive to read the article because it is so upsetting. Thanks to Dr. James for a very powerful but disturbing report. Every time we think our government may have reached rock bottom, we discover it was a false floor. The Catholic Church is also a world wide criminal enterprise which should be banned from operating in our country. My Mother was a high school English teacher and Librarian; my Father was a mechanical engineer; both graduated from the University of Minnesota one of the top universities in the world. They would have regarded the disclosures in this article as evil and disgraceful to all mankind. This is one of Dr. James most powerful articles yet.

Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  September 29, 2016 at 8:47 pm Great comment Khalid Talaat. And usually the hard truths are very politically incorrect. concernedvet5  October 1, 2016 at 9:39 am When stopping “political correctness” gets the most thunderous applause at Trump rallys, more so than terrorism, the wall, or anything else…I know we have a problem with definition of terms. That term can mean anything to anyone at anytime. Its a relative term, so it behooves anyone writing about it to DEFINE exactly what they mean when they bring it up. Stating that homosexuality is involved in this is nothing new. What is “politically incorrect” about saying that? Are all homosexuals involved in human trafficking? Not so by a long shot. So why is the term PC used to unecessarily obscure this conversation about literal vampirism? The truth is that this issue is about structures of hidden power that have existed on this planet for a long time, and the factions to be concerned at this moment are ones that base thier actions and beliefs on vampirism. Instead of empowering themselves from the abundant energy of the planet and cosmos, they feed off of the literal energy, fear and and blood of other humans. Satanic cults do this. Every war can be also easily used as a ritual sacrifice because of the energy generated by the spilling of blood…making this planet a very popular feeding ground with several entiites. Those in these factions are men, women, straight, gay, and all shades in between. Its about the actions, not about the race or sexual orientation. Not focused on PC or not being PC…just focused on being correct. Emma Yacht  October 1, 2016 at 11:47 am Dear Concerned, what is politically incorrect is to name blacks as being involved in crime in America to any extent.Additionally, I read your comment that you propose absolving Gays of sexual predation. Is that what you intend?Because, I think that Political Correctness is literally defined as what you just did, which was to come along & lecture someone else about definition of terms in a flurry of semantics.You are implying that the Gays are no more involved with pedophilia than straights,(with “Oh, no… it’s just the vampires who do it”) but many readers are on to your scheme, & are oh so very sick of the satanic hogwash embodied in your argument.Because, here’s the problem–anytime that someone comes along & “lectures” anyone else about “What they should think & HOW they should think” with the catchall “define your terms” decoy, is attempting to subvert the larger conversation to Methodology rather than the intransigent Problem itself.Now, you say it’s spiritual vampirism & not the innocent gays, who,despite their movement’s protestations to the contrary, have all along been happily part of a larger FrankfurtSchool Conquest-of-America Agenda via the LGBTIQ Movement-but numerous Gays can not even admit that fact to themselves, since they themselves have fallen victim to mind-kontrol by the Matrix.Americans easily distinguish between homosexuals and pedophiles.. no problem.Anyone who defends pedophiles by deflecting culpability as you do makes me question their motive. Agin  October 1, 2016 at 2:23 pm Dear Emma Yacht, there are different levels of communication going on here (I am not necessarily disagreeing with you.) Concernedvet5 is addressing a specific level (of communication) which is related to a previous article from Dr. J on the switch to the esoteric. You will have to speak a language that they will understand. Many of these groups are Saturnic (as in devouring their young). I was in a discussion with a member of one of these groups in which I asked why he would prey on the weak (women or children). “Evil” is considered a human concept for the mundanes. He asked whether I felt rape or pedophilia was “evil”. I told him it is a disease for which True eviL (Live) is the cure. He correctly understood that as a death sentence. I leave this to whom it may concern: “There is a 6th principle too, though it is not part of the (sanskrit) Tan. It is connected to the Abyss, it is a defender, though it really seems more like a Child: Innocence. This Innocence is like a “sparkle in the Eye of the Great Dark” like a shining diamond child, metaphorically speaking. ALL Black or LHP magicians KNOW this! NONE would harm it!” Emma Yacht  October 1, 2016 at 3:37 pm Very interesting Agin. I admit that I don’t use the lingua franca that you two are using. I don’t know how you would align your Defender that springs from the Abyss to this pedophile problem. In my understanding, if we who are eternal souls continue to turn our backs on the idiotic harvesting of nonconsenting “young blood”, then we are culpable. Notwithstanding the sparkle in the eye of the great Dark, there are forces that bow to no star or “sparkle” and these forces will emanate from Source (the source of light and dark which is also the source of thinking about light and dark), both in the quantum intelligence multiverse and the atomic carbon manifestation of the multiverse, and these forces shall bind and disintegrate the rogue harvesters in every dimension and beyond, and in every imagined or nonimagined timeline of the Oneness. That’s the best way I can explain it without getting into the methodology. The current fractal holographic units will be rolled up and there will be consequences for the actors and their ephemeral props, but I sincerely doubt that the rogue harvesters will receive cosmic Tony Awards for their playacting. They just won’t be invited back, due to their lower harmonic frequency which is being phased out due to obsolescence. Diesel Chadron  October 1, 2016 at 5:33 pm Khalid, your contribution is right on. I have 3 uncle’s who were victims of this crap (two from Catholic church). Two are gay. Of the two molested in Catholic church, one actually got married with kids and denies anything happened at their private weekend getaways. The other is openly gay, ‘bottom boy’.

Other topics included the role of equipment data models in semiconductor production systems, SAP process automation in the manufacturing environment, and overviews from industry experts about the latest trends and the future of photovoltaic and IC manufacturing. Every year at the evening event, the Automation Network Dresden awards the “Innovation Award for Automation” to a leader in manufacturing automation. This year the award was presented to SolarWorld for their cutting-edge migration of a high-volume manufacturing execution system (MES) to a cloud platform. Travis Stevens, president of SYSTEMA USA Corporation, described this year’s event as "Successful – the feedback was positive. I know of no other event in the US that is specifically dedicated to bringing manufacturing experts together to discuss the latest innovations in the semiconductor automation solution space. We look forward to bringing this unique opportunity to the US again in the future." The Automation Network Dresden is a consortium of four Dresden-based companies - AIS Automation Dresden GmbH, Fabmatics GmbH (formerly HAP GmbH and Roth & Rau – Ortner GmbH), SYSTEMA GmbH and XENON GmbH - all of which are premier experts in automation through software and hardware.

The quest turns the very first gun obtained by Guardians into an Exotic Weapon and comes with several poignant moments with the player’s Ghost. The Khvostov 7G-OX is the most configurable weapon yet in Destiny. Players will have the option to choose between the Auto Rifle, Pulse Rifle, and Scout Rifle archetypes while also choosing its rate of fire. Step 1: Obtain the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic There are two ways to get the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic. This first is by dismantling the original Khvostov Auto Rifle you received when you first started your character. That may have required some foresight or the willingness to start a new character just to obtain the weapon. The second way is by picking up a Splicer Intel Relay that is dropped by Broodmother Wizards in the Plaguelands Patrol. They spawn regularly in the Lord’s Watch zone where you spawn in Patrol, which make it easy to pick up one. Now head back to the wall breach zone where your character first starts Destiny. Spawn in at Lord’s Watch and go from Foundry 113 to Rocket Yard to The Divide and The Breach. You’ll come across a door barred by lasers as you make your way back toward the outside of the wall. This is where you’ll need to use the Splicer Intel Relay to continue. Use a Splicer Key on this door to get to the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic. [Image via Destiny] Once the door is opened, continue outside the wall and you’ll see a Fallen Ketch at the top of the hill where your Guardian spawned the very first time. Make your way onto the Ketch and kill everything. Once all the minions are dead, a chest will spawn in the corner containing the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic. Head to the Fallen Ketch and kill everything. [Image via Destiny] This chest will spawn once all Fallen are killed. [Image via Destiny] Step 2: Take the Khvostov 7G-OX Schematic to Shiro in Felwinter’s Peak Go to the Felwinter’s Peak social area and visit Shiro. He’ll take the schematic from you and give you a new quest to complete. Step 3: Start the ‘We Found a Rifle’ Quest There are two parts to the first half of the “We Found a Rifle” quest. Both involve visiting the Plaguelands Patrol once more. Collect 10 Manual Pages for Khvostov 7G-OX – These are simply collected by killing Fallen and Hive anywhere on the Plaguelands Patrol. It can also be done in the Archon’s Forge for those that want to try to get as much done as once. Alternatively, most if not all can be collected while collecting the other set of items needed. Collect 3 Weapon Parts for Khvostov 7G-OX – While in the Plaguelands Patrol, you’ll want to go almost to the original starting point for the Cosmodrome Patrol. Turn right from when you spawn in the Plaguelands and make your way through the Foundry 113, to the Rocketyards, then the Divide, and finally to Dock 13 as your starting point. Tip: The weapon parts are easily marked by the triangular shaped item icons while roaming around. It will pop up automatically when you are near or you can aim down the sights of your weapon when you are not near but in the same zone. Weapon Part 1 is located underneath the stairs that going the main room in Dock 13 to The Steppes. [Image via Destiny] Weapon Part 2 can be found by going back to the Rocketyards and then following the same path as the Devil’s Lair Strike. Once you reach the Refinery, go through the door that Ghost unlocks during the Strike. This Weapon Part can be found on the wall on the right. [Image via Destiny] Weapon Part 3 is located in the Blast where you fight the Devil Walker tank during the Devil’s Lair Strike. It is located on the side of the building that is immediately ahead of where you enter the zone. [Image via Destiny] Step 4: Complete the mission A Khvostov Rising This is a straightforward mission in the Plaguelands that takes you through familiar ground, but also has a particularly tough boss. Players will need to hunt down and kill the Splicer Captain, Kaviss, to obtain the final part needed for the Khvostov 7G-OX. You’ll first encounter him in The Divide. He’s got a tough Void Shield and will move around quickly. A strong Void Heavy Weapon and/or Special Weapon will greatly help along with using your Guardian’s offensive Super abilities to whittle his health down. He will retreat once his health gets low. The mission will continue to The Breach with the path blocked by SIVA Clouds and Trip Mines that will need to be avoided and destroyed. The final battle will take place inside the broad alley inside the wall. Kaviss will be protected by a pair of Servitors and a host of Fallen Splicers dropping in from Skiffs. Work your way through the minions while avoiding fire from the Skiff and then concentrate on Kaviss when things are clear. This cycle will repeat until his health is completely drained and the Splicer Captain is killed. He will drop an Exotic Engram that grants you the Khvostov 7G-OX. Make sure you have a free spot in your Primary Weapon grid and then go kill more minons with the weapon to complete the mission and get a touching moment with Ghost. Afterwards, go speak with Shiro at Felwinter’s Peak one last time to close out the quest.

We Might Never See A New OpenGL Version, At Least Not For A Long Time Written by Michael Larabel in Standards on 1 October 2016 at 08:58 AM EDT. 39 Comments During past Khronos press briefings about OpenGL/Vulkan and in other communications, while Vulkan is the organization's big graphics API focus, it was implied during these conversations that OpenGL would continue to march to its own beat and evolve as needed. While OpenGL continues to be significantly used by cross-platform graphics application/game developers, it turns out there might not be a new official version for a long time - if ever. OpenGL 4.5 was released in August of 2014 while there was the "OpenGL 2015" updates last year and this summer we just had the 2016 update that just introduced ARB_gl_spirv. There's been nothing definitive about any OpenGL 4.6 or OpenGL 5.0 update while OpenGL continues to be widely-used and is also the basis for OpenGL ES, WebGL, etc. In the discussions about the next Mesa release and what to do about versioning, it was brought up how to handle Mesa version numbers when they reach OpenGL 4.5. Well, Mesa major version bumps will then probably be tied to Vulkan version bumps. But the interesting remark prompting this story was this comment by Intel developer Ian Romanick, "There is a distinct possibility (spoiler alert) that there won't be any new OpenGL version for a long time, if ever." Ian's comments about OpenGL carry a fair amount of weight considering he's one of their main OpenGL Linux driver developers but more importantly is Intel's representative to the Khronos Board. He's long been involved with OpenGL and liaising with Khronos. But do keep in mind this wasn't any official announcement and he wasn't making any official proclamation on the behalf of Intel nor Khronos but rather remarks on a developers' list. Intel developer Jason Ekstrand also commented on the same thread about the likelihood of seeing a new OpenGL or OpenGL ES version, "we just turned on [OpenGL ES] 3.2 and ES is about as likely to get a 3.3 as desktop is to get 4.6." So if it's indeed accurate that there won't be a new OpenGL version for a long time, if ever, that's fairly interesting and somewhat differing from what was implied in past briefings that OpenGL would continue to evolve on its own. Presumably that means then they'll just continue with their routine extension roll-outs when warranted for new GL functionality and not proclaim any new version, but I'll be seeking more information about any new OpenGL master plan during the next Khronos briefing. 39 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Blog Tablet, Phone Makers Get Behind Universal Stylus Spec Stephan Ohr, Consultant, Semiconductor Industry Analyst 9/30/2016 02:50 PM EDT  0 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Use of USI standard (1.0), developers believe, will dramatically expand to use of stylus-dependent applications. The Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) encourages touchscreen device makers and software developers to support a newly standardized peripheral interface. The USI standard (1.0) measures stylus user characteristics — like pressure, color and stroke width — and communicates these to the tablet or smartphone host. The use of a standard interface, developers believe, will dramatically expand to use of stylus-dependent applications. A consortium of computer hardware and software makers announced Thursday (September 22) their support for a stylus peripheral standard. The Universal Stylus Initiative (USI 1.0) standard describes a handheld computer stylus interface, intended to work with any USI-enabled tablet or touchscreen. Supporters of the standard include computer industry heavyweights Dell, Lenovo, HP and Intel. “Our goal was to have a single, universal stylus capable of operating with all the touchscreen devices that a consumer owns or uses in the workplace — whether tablet, 2-in-1, or smartphone,” said Peter Mueller, an Intel VP and chairman of the USI. “One USI stylus will talk to many different devices.” A stylus interface standard will increase the use of these peripherals, and expand the applications for them, Mueller believes. The application of styluses with tablets has thus far been something of a niche. Many drivers may be familiar with the tablet-based forms filled out by service reps at an automobile service center. Other use cases include drawing and graphics rendering — even handwriting recognition and analysis. Photo editing will be a major growth driver, suggests graphics industry analyst Jon Peddie of Jon Peddie Research. In these applications, the editor can use a stylus to highlight an object on screen with all the precision his hand will allow. The popularity of stylus applications like this could catapult the stylus market from 100 million units in 2015 to as much as 300 million in 2018, Peddie suggests. The stylus, Jon Peddie reminds, is the latest computer peripheral device to get industry-wide attention — behind the keyboard, mouse, voice recognition hardware, and touch pads. This is surprising considering that human beings learned to write with pens, long before they learned to work computers. What is miraculous, Peddie suggests, is that more than 30 companies got together on a new interface standard. One stylus, many channels In operation, the USI standard defines the communication method — the wireless protocol — by which the stylus sends data about its operation to the smart phone or tablet host. The data includes information such as pressure levels, stroke width or color (selectable with button presses on the pen) or eraser operation. The USI technology makes use of the existing touch sensor (capacitance changes) in smart phones, tablets and notebook PCs, minimizing the cost of a new peripheral. http://www.universalstylus.org/ The communications protocol, used to identify peripherals to the USI host, is fast and flexible, says Peter Mueller. Like wireless Ethernet, transmitter will seek the carrier frequency which ensures the best communication for any particular setting. USI System comprises of a USI-compatible touch controller and stylus. It defines the communication between an active stylus and a touch controller. (Source: Universal Stylus Initiative) Areas standardized by USI members include the stylus discovery mechanism, the packet formats required to communicate key information (such as pressure, button info), and mechanisms for vendor extensions. Areas NOT specified by the standard include the stylus’ industrial design (its look-and-feel), the hardware/firmware implementation in the touch controller, and the software APIs for stylus data access. The standard offers many avenues for vendor differentiation (see Table). Areas to Standardize Not Specified by USI stylus discovery mechanism stylus industrial design / look and feel packet formats to communicate key information (such as pressure, button info) hardware/firmware implementation in touch controller or stylus IC facilitate low-cost as well as high-end,  premium implementations touch sensor technology mechanism for vendor extensions software APIs for Stylus data access In addition to Intel, HP, and Dell, electronics industry notables supporting the Initiative include Sharp, Asus, LG and Lenovo. Touch controller makers include Parade Technologies, Silicon Integrated Systems, Raydium Semiconductor and STMicroelectronics. Touch pen makers include Wacom, Atmel, and Synaptics, among others. This group has enough momentum, Peter Mueller suggests, to bring USI products to market by the end of next year, or the beginning of 2018. Influential suppliers on the sidelines regarding USI include Apple, who typically uses proprietary solutions for their product appeal, and Microsoft, which has an investment proprietary pens for its Surface Pro computers.     Email This Print Comment Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

The macOS kernel, which Dutch site TechTastic took some time to dig through, adds support for a new CPU family called “ARM Hurricane.” Apple’s given its recent ARM-based Ax chips similar codenames (A7 was Cyclone, A8 was Typhoon and A9 was Twister).  Hurricane might be an unannounced sequel, or it might even be the A10 Fusion processor introduced with the iPhone 7. The A10 Fusion chip is Apple’s first model with a quad-core design, packing two cores for high-performance tasks and two energy efficient cores for regular activities. Based on recent benchmarks, the A10 Fusion even rivals the Intel Core M chip used to power the 12-inch MacBook. That means it’s not out of the question that new MacBooks could rely on an A-series chip. There’s one more bit of evidence. TechTastic notes that macOS Sierra also changes the way developers submit third-party Mac apps. Basically, it allows Apple to automatically convert those apps between platforms. That could make it possible to easily switch all apps to work with an ARM-based chip without requiring each developer to resubmit their software. Apple is expected to unveil new MacBooks next month, which could provide the company with a perfect opportunity to announce the big switch. Cupertino hasn’t confirmed plans for another event yet, but we’ll let you know as soon as the invitations go out.

By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computer-related jobs available. U.S. graduates are only on track to fill about 29 percent of them and women are expected to only take 3 percent of those jobs. On national and local levels, efforts are gaining to not only boost STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) curriculum in K-12 systems, but to also help girls understand there’s a prosperous career path awaiting them in technology. That’s the drive behind the Girls Who Code program, a national effort to expose sixth to eighth grade girls to computer programming and coding. Girls Who Code started as an experiment with 20 girls in New York and has now impacted the lives of 10,000 girls in 42 states. In Chandler, the effort kicked off in October 2014 and is set to offer its third installment at the downtown Chandler Public Library where it began. With the help of an Intel sponsorship and company volunteers - real in-the-trenches women coders - teaching the classes, about 20 middle school girls each fall are catching a glimpse of something that is passing so many of their peers by. “We’ve really been excited about partnering with Intel. … We feel like the whole experience is instrumental in helping girls to feel more comfortable with the sciences and technology,” Kris Sherman, assistant library manager at Chandler Public Library, said. Making An Impact Statistics from the Girls Who Code website indicate that between ages six and 12, 66 percent of girls express an interest in computers. That number drops to 32 percent between the years of 13 and 17 and by the time these young women become college freshmen only 4 percent of computer science majors are female. Working with youth, Sherman has seen the disconnect first-hand. “They seem to be pretty excited when they’re younger, but somewhere along the way they gravitate towards different interests,” she added. “STEM careers like engineering and coding become accessible to students when they actually get to experience it first hand and programs like Girls Who Code take learning to a whole new level because students get to create their own ideas,” said Intel’s Arizona Director of Public Affairs Carlos Contreras. Girls Who Code is a project-based club environment where middle school girls are encouraged to make new friends while exploring the world of coding. Nikki Moreno, now a valley ninth grader, went through the Chandler Public Library Girls Who Code program the first two times it was offered. The 40-hour (20, 2-hour sessions) curriculum started with work on simple MIT-developed open source coding software called Scratch. At first, Moreno and her peers built simple memory games and learned how to use code to make small characters on a screen move. Eventually, the curriculum progressed to using JavaScript, which was more difficult, she admitted. But the capabilities greatly increased, too. “I enjoyed exploring stuff on my own. … We also got to make … secret codes,” she said. “It was pretty cool. I might take a class later.” Moreno is considering a career in either psychology or marine biology. If she opts for the latter, she said, she would consider taking a robotics class in the future “to apply robotics … to go underwater and maybe help clean up the oceans.” Her mother, Deborah Moreno, who also works as a library assistant in the youth services division of Chandler Public Library, was impressed with how quickly her daughter picked up the concepts. “What I thought was really interesting was that the programs they were using in the class were really user friendly, and she was able to come home to teach her brother a lot of what she was learning in the class,” Deborah added. In less than two years, the program has gained strong word-of-mouth recognition. “Now that we’ve done this a couple times, we’re getting a lot of emails and phone calls from parents who want to know when the class starts,” Deborah said, “and now we’re starting to see siblings of those girls who went to the first two.” “We’re seeing new friendships made in Girls Who Code sessions,” Sherman added. “There’s a comfort level and talent is being grown.” In addition to receiving instruction from Intel mentors and actual working engineers, students aren’t the only winners in the experience. The Intel Involved Matching Grant Program also pays Chandler Public Library $10 per hour for all Intel employee volunteer hours. This effort generated $2,330 for the Friends of Chandler Public Library in 2015. For more information about the Intel Involved Matching Grant Program, click here.

The new spec enables hardware makers to eliminate traditional 3.5mm mini-jacks from their devices and use USB-C ports to connect headsets and other audio equipment. Makers of peripherals can also build their audio solutions, which use USB-C instead of traditional analog connectors. Developers of the standard hope that elimination of mini-jacks will help to make devices slimmer, smarter and less power hungry. The industry, led by Intel and some other companies, has been mulling about replacing the traditional 3.5mm mini-jack connector for some time now. The main motives for replacement were necessity to simplify internal architecture of devices by removing analog and some audio processing components from the inside (which leads to further miniaturization), minimize the number of external connectors, improve power management as well as to add smart features to headsets and other audio equipment. We discussed USB Type-C Audio Technology briefly earlier this year and mentioned that this is not the first time that the industry has tried to use USB instead of the good-old mini-jack. The important difference between contemporary initiative and attempts in the past is the fact that today the primary goal is to replace the 3.5mm jack in portable devices. As reported, the USB Audio Device Class 3.0 specification supports both analog and digital audio. Analog audio is easy to implement and it does not impact data transfers and other functionality of USB-C cables since it uses the two secondary bus (SBU) pins. Some device makers may find the analog audio feature of the standard to be a relatively simple way to add certain smart capabilities to their headsets without major redesign of hosts. While analog USB-C audio will not help to shrink dimensions of portables, it could be particularly useful for non-mobile devices, where miniaturization is not crucial, but where port space is at a premium or where additional features either make sense (infotainment, sport equipment, etc.) or are fundamental (VR HMDs). The USB ADC 3.0 defines minimum interoperability across analog and digital devices in order to avoid confusion of end-users because of incompatibility. In fact, all ADC 3.0-compliant hosts should support the so-called headset adapter devices, which allow to connect analog headsets to USB-C. However, digital audio is one of the primary reasons why companies like Intel wanted to develop the USB-C audio tech in the first place, hence, expect them to promote it. According to the USB ADC 3.0 standard, digital USB-C headphones will feature special multi-function processing units (MPUs), which will, to a large degree, define the feature set and quality of headsets. The MPUs will handle host and sink synchronization (this is a key challenge for digital USB audio), digital-to-analog conversion, low-latency active noise cancellation, acoustic echo canceling, equalization, microphone automatic gain control, volume control and others. Such chips will also contain programmable amplifiers and pre-amplifiers, which are currently located inside devices. Besides, USB ADC 3.0-compatible MPUs will also support USB Audio Type-III and Type-IV formats (the latest compressed formats), but will retain compatibility with formats supported by ADC 1.0 and 2.0. Finally, among the mandated things set to be supported by USB-C Audio devices are new Power Domains (allows devices to put certain domains in sleep mode when not in use) as well as BADD (basic audio device definition) 3.0 features for saving power and simplified discovery and management of various audio equipment (each type of devices has its own BADD profile). Over the past few months, Conexant has introduced three USB-C Audio MPUs (1, 2) for headsets, docking stations and other equipment. Assuming that these chips are compliant with the USB ADC 3.0 specs from a hardware standpoint, and the software is ready, actual devices featuring USB-C Audio could arrive in the coming months. Pricing of the first USB ADC 3.0-compliant MPUs is unknown, but in general MPU ICs do not cost too much. Moreover, as developers adopt smaller process technologies and a larger number of such chips hit the market, their prices are going to decline. In the end, it will be interesting to see where digital headphone prices end up. The MPUs will definitely add to the total bill of materials for a set of headphones, but at the same time they add new functionality as well, so the big question is how manufacturers then factor all of that into device pricing. A number of companies, including Apple and LeEco, have already introduced smartphones that do not use traditional mini-jacks, and Google added support for USB DAC devices to Android over a year ago. The finalization of the USB ADC 3.0 spec, introduction of USB-C audio ICs, as well as design decisions of smartphone makers demonstrate that the industry is trying to eliminate 3.5mm jacks from mobile devices. The big question is whether the rest of the industry plans to do the same. It is true that portables are primary devices for music listening for many people. However, there are tens of applications which still rely on analog connectors, and hundreds of millions of people who use them either to consume or create content. To eradicate 3.5mm jacks completely, USB-C Audio promoters will have to work with thousands of vendors and this takes time. Consequently, it is too early to say that this is the end for the good-old mini-jack. Images by Conexant, USB IF.

All this does is move what was in the phone to a stupid dongle. Screw apple and moto for doing this. Reply DanNeely - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link What you're forgetting is that since your phone maker is the one who will be blamed for the battery not lasting long enough is that outside of extreme budget models they're likely to spend the extra $0.50 on the BoM for a high power efficiency DAC. The tiny company in China who manufactured the cheap no-name dongle you bought on Amazon. Not so much. Reply ImSpartacus - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link Oh god. I didn't think about this. Fuck. This is not good. Reply __Miguel_ - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link Of course it's not. USB-C audio is nice, and all, but it's just a cash grab. The only people who would benefit from it, i.e. audiophiles (because normal headphones will not benefit an iota from being USB-C in the first place, they're too small and/or made with parts not able to capture the extra clarity the dedicated DAC would allow), have been using external USB DACs for years, now. They'll probably have a little bit less latency, but that's about it. Everyone else will either A) buy USB-C headphones, thus having to spend more money for something they already had, especially because since USB-C can handle analog audio, you might just be getting some "premium" USB-C headphones that are basically analog headphones with a USB-C plug; or B) have to fumble with fragile USB-C to 3.5mm adapters, again having to spend more money, potentially multiple times, with zero gains. AND, while this is happening, you'll either have to choose if you want to charge your phone or listen to music, or lug around a USB-C hub (because let's face it, the odds of at least 2 fully-functional - i.e., with all services offered by the phone over USB-C on both - USB-C ports on a phone are slim to none), which is utterly ridiculous, not to mention expensive. Reply dsumanik - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link Hey smartphone makers, there is a very real and lucrative business opportunity for you here... simply hang on to the audio jack and refuse to buy into this scam, customers will reward you with sales. Reply damianrobertjones - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link "outside of extreme budget models they're likely to spend the extra $0.50 on the BoM for a high power efficiency DAC" Do you mean, "outside of extreme budget models they're likely to NOT spend the extra $0.50 on the BoM for a high power efficiency DAC" These companies don't care. When making a million phones 0.50 is a LOT of cash. Reply MobiusStrip - Saturday, October 01, 2016 - link This is an offensive and anti-customer scam to be sure. So now we have redundant DACs in EVERYTHING. The phones have to have DACs in them to provide sound to their own speakers... so Apple hasn't offloaded the work at all; it simply blocked access to it. And now many manufacturers will repeat Apple's blunder of blocking access to the sole power port with this asinine audio dongle? Want to listen to music on your road trip? NOPE. You can listen OR charge... but not both. Craven stupidity. And apologists will gobble this shit up. Reply Azethoth - Saturday, October 01, 2016 - link I don't get it. Why are you blaming Apple for some other company doing stuff? USB C is not an Apple standard, it is just USB copying what Apple does. Reply Morawka - Saturday, October 01, 2016 - link Audio over USB C was announced over a year ago, and as mentioned, motorola was the first to do the headphone jack thing. in the technology sector, no-one copy's apple, because apple is never the first to do anything. apple copies everyone else and puts their spin on it. now copying apple on aesthetic design is valid argument. Reply melgross - Saturday, October 01, 2016 - link Oh for crying out lout, nothing is being blocked. Stop the hysteria. Every time something new replaces something old we get people who can't understand why, and think it's some plot and will destroy everything. This has been a long time coming.

That’s exactly the conclusion one could reach by looking closely at code strings in the macOS Sierra kernel, discovered by Dutch outlet TechTastic.nl. It’s very peculiar that Apple would add support for ARM technology to macOS Sierra. As you know, all Macs manufactured since 2005 run Intel chips. The Apple appears to be implementing support for ARM chips in the Mac operating system could mean that first ARM-based Macs might appear this year. As TechTastic.nl states, developers no longer submit fully compiled binaries. Instead, intermediary bit code is submitted which Apple uses to compile the binary code for the specific CPU architecture. Should Apple release an ARM-based Mac, developers wouldn’t need to re-submit their existing code nor would they need to add any ARM-specific code in order for their apps to run natively on ARM-based hardware. “It is probably also one of the reasons why legacy applications have recently been removed from the App Store,” speculates the publication. The macOS Sierra kernel indicates support for the ARM Hurricane family. Now, ARM’s existing blueprints make no mention of the Hurricane CPU so this is most likely Apple’s internal code-name for a custom ARM-based CPU architecture. Starting with the A7 chip in the iPhone 5s, Apple stopped implementing ARM’s off-the-shelf CPU parts in favor of 64-bit CPU cores which are compatible with the ARM instruction set but are designed in-house from scratch. With the A7 onward, Apple started naming these custom-built CPUs. The A7 microarchitecture was code-named “Cyclone”, the A8’s CPU is called “Typhoon” and the A9 uses “Twister” CPU. The A10 Fusion is Apple’s first ARM-compatible mobile chip that uses four CPU cores, two for high-performance task and two highly energy-efficient cores for tasks that don’t require the full power. The idea of an ARM-powered Mac dates back to 2012, when Bloomberg reported that Apple was exploring ways to replace Intel processors in Macs with a desktop version of in-house designed A-series chips that power iPhones and iPads. “Apple engineers have grown confident that the chip designs used for its mobile devices will one day be powerful enough to run its desktops and laptops,” said Bloomberg. And in 2014, former head of the Macintosh division Jean-Louis Gassée hinted that the first ARM-based Macs could appear in 2017. “Apple’s drive to own all layers of the stack continues unabated years after Steve’s passing,” he wrote. “As a recent example, Apple created its own Swift programming language that complements its Xcode IDE and Clang/LLVM compiler infrastructure.” All iOS device processors use CPUs based on ARM’s power-sipping technology. Gassée explained: If we follow this line of reasoning, the advantages of ARM-based processors vs. x86 devices become even more compelling: lower cost, better power dissipation, natural integration with the rest of the machine. For years, Intel has argued that its superior semiconductor design and manufacturing technology would eventually overcome the complexity downsides of the x86 architecture. But that “eventually” is getting a bit stale. Other than a few showcase design wins that have never amounted to much in the real world, x86 devices continue to lose to ARM-derived SoC (System On a Chip) designs. Therefore, an ARM-based Mac notebook would theoretically have a much longer battery life than any existing MacBook with an Intel chip. With its own custom-designed Mac processor Apple would no longer be dependent on Intel’s slowing roadmap. More importantly, it would be able to refresh Macs once per year because any future A-series processors for computers would likely be on the same annual release cycle as the iPhone and iPad chips. Does that make any sense to you guys?

Ara Rezaee I could see this happening for the Macbook, and maybe mbAir David Gillooly They may try out the technology in a MacBook Air first to give it extreme battery life. This would differentiate it from MBPs and MacBooks. Guy This wouldn’t be something Apple would do lightly. This is an “all-in” kind of move for the Mac. It would also explain why the long wait between updates for the entire line. Shameer Mulji doesn’t explain anything at all. Just pure speculation Guy Until it’s actually announced (if ever) of course it’s speculation. The only point was Apple would switch the entire line IF they did this David Wilson Wow there sure is a lot of nitpicking about verb choice in this comment feed … Kira Kinski Moving to ARM will be the beginning of the end of the Mac as we know it. iOS is a joke. It’s power and flexibility pales in comparison to macOS, even though that too has been dumbed down considerably in recent years. OTOH, Apple could add an ARM chip to the motherboard for about nothing and it would be cool having an option to boot up or run multiple architectures natively. One box to rule them all. Of course, Apple could also factor macOS to run on ARM, but that too reduces its utility. It’s still a Wintel world out there, pure and simple. Chris Yes. This would be the end…just like when Apple moved from OS X from PPC to Intel. chamers No, moving to a more standard, open architecture was a beginning. Moving to a closed architecture is the end. Chris Which part of Intel’s architecture is open? Don’t confuse widely used with “open”. TheLouisXXI Intel doesn’t have locked bootloaders for one and most OS’s run on Intel CPU’s and Intel still has the fastest chips to date. Given any ARM CPU or GPU is still at maybe PS2 levels for graphics Reed Harston Sorry, but both your previous comment and this one are widely misinformed. First, the GPUs in modern mobile devices have much better graphics than the PS2. Remember that the PS2 only output 480p and that current phones may have 1080p or 1440p screens, which is about 7 or 12 times as many pixels, respectively, as the PS2 put out. And their graphics are even more fluid and better looking as well. They are MUCH better than a PS2. Besides, even if you feel like ARM GPUs are slow, whoever builds the SoC with an ARM CPU in it can use whichever GPU they wish and there are plenty of other GPU options out there which are better than ARM’s GPUs. Second, what are you even talking about locked bootloaders? How are bootloaders on ARM devices ‘locked’? I have a Raspberry Pi and it has a ARM chip. And it can run Windows, Linus, whatever. So long as it is compiled for ARM. So I have no idea what you are trying to imply. Guy Why are you confusing an operating system with hardware? iOS does exactly what Apple has intended for it to do. macOS on an ARM chip would look and work like…well, macOS. Apple most likely would not add an ARM chip to an Intel-based Mac, what would be the point?They added Windows support because while running on native X86 processors it made no sense to not offer it. However my guess is that fewer and fewer people are doing so these days. I stopped after the last time MS borked my legally acquired Windows 7 Pro after doing something crazy like adding more drives to the Mac Pro it was on. Wasn’t even part of Windows, but added storage for OS X. They did it the first time and after 3 hours, grudgingly gave me a new license key. When they did it again (I had the audacity to swap out my main drive with OS X), I just wiped it and added it to the rest of the computer again. Once Apple hits some magic number with fewer Boot Camp installs, I imagine they could decide that they could do it and impact very few people. Kira Kinski Nah. I know the difference between hardware and software. I also know that iOS is a UI abomination, and that mindset has permeated macOS in recent years. That is my greatest fear of Apple moving solely to ARM. I personally care little for Wintel compatibility, but it is comforting to know it exists and opens the Mac up to far more possibilities since the world is mainly Wintel. Why restrict it to ARM analogous to the PPC days, other than to close the box a little tighter, once again? That being said, Intel does need to do something about its own space. It’s long in the tooth and their mobile efforts have failed to date. And don’t even get me going on Apple hardware today. There’s not a single Mac I care to purchase, for the first time going back to the Apple II. Everybody has their own needs and desires, and many consumers feel different about Apple today than me. I get that. elvisizer Your greatest fear from a proposed cpu architecture change is that UI design in macOS will follow iOS? Those two things have absolutely nothing to do with each other, you know. at all. As you yourself said, the UI design of iOS has migrated into macOS over the last few years, despite macs not using arm cpu’s. prl99 What you seem to not understand is that iOS has nothing to do with macOS when it comes to running a Mac. Just because they use a lot of the same code doesn’t mean macOS will only use the iOS UI. As for Apple’s A-series CPUs, check out their Geekbench scores; 3304 single core, 5339 multi-core. This is for a simple 2+2 core miniature SOC. The 4GHz iMac only has a single core score of 5181. Multi-core scores are faster because the Intel CPUs have more cores. There’s nothing stopping Apple from designing a quad or 8-core A-series CPU, running it a normal speed while adding either an internal multi-core GPU or external graphics card. As for your disfavor with Apple hardware, fine. Why are you even commenting when you don’t care? Imad Ghandour Agreed prl99 Actually, it’s an iOS and Android world along with linux. Wintel is going away even though businesses refuse to accept it. Think about it …. Reed Harston I don’t think Windows is going anywhere soon on the desktop/laptop. They failed to gain any ground on mobile but they still rule the ‘traditional’ computer. That isn’t to say that someday Windows might not exist but that would take a radical change that most people aren’t ready to take yet. Remember that phones and tablets are largely tethered to PCs to offload pictures and so on. As for the Intel half of ‘Wintel’, however, I think that they may go out of style even faster than Windows. ARM chips are becoming very impressive and their architecture has always been much more simple and power efficient, despite Intel’s rather amazing work to improve the efficiency of their incredibly complex x86 CPUs. When Apple (I don’t think it is an ‘if’) moves to ARM then other companies may start taking courage to do the same and Microsoft could easily port Windows to ARM as well. You can already install Windows on a Raspberry Pi actually and that has a ARM processor. And with the push to move Windows apps to the Windows store on Windows 10 like with the App Store in macOS they may easily do the same thing that Apple is currently doing and release their software onto both platforms without any extra work for the developers. JerryO What I would like to see is Apple release Rack based servers again. Competing against HP and Dell for Amazon/Ebay/Goog’s business. Currently, Intel Processors consume way too much power. A large server farm (i.e. GOOG, et. al.) consumes lots of energy – which costs companies $$$. Imagine Apple ARM based servers. Couple this with Cisco, IBM, Deloitte, et. al. support for the Enterprise – Apple can open up one more multi-billion $ business overnight. Rowan09 Test it out on the iPad Pro and iPhones first to see how it performs. Guy Chances are in house they have done so Geoffrey Spencer I hope they keep the Pro series with Intel chips. I use VMWare Fusion (or you can use Parallels) to work on Windows projects. ARM could be used but that would be emulators and that is a no-go for most people like me. Guy IF Apple did this, it would be across the board Reed Harston I agree that it would be across the board but it would also likely be in stages as was the PowerPC -> Intel jump. The Pro was the last to be released because the chips weren’t ready for it yet. The same is likely going to be true if/when they make this jump. Profesional workstations depend just as much on the proper software, if not more, as they do on great hardware. With the right software it is actually possible to edit HD video on the MacBook just as well or faster as on a workstation with the wrong software. Point is, the software for what professionals do is also going to have to be updated to work properly on ARM before the Pro can be updated, and that may take some time. Releasing iMacs and Mac Minis first would give the developers a warning that they need to start getting their software ready for an ARM based Mac workstation. Then when Apple releases the Pro everyone should be a bit more ready. Of course Apple may do something radical and different but that is what I would expect. aalberti I don’t think so, it’s not necessary. For the Apps running on different processors will be transparent with the LLVM stack, so Apple can keep both lines of processors Guy They could but probably wouldn’t. It makes no sense for Apple to keep two separate lines (processor related anyway) of Macs going. The Pro market isn’t big enough on it’s own to make it worthwhile Reed Harston Read my comment below first for my thoughts on releasing the timeline for releasing an ARM based Mac Pro. As far as working on Windows projects I commented above that I wouldn’t be surprised if Microsoft releases a version of Windows that can be installed on ARM as well (they already do actually, it is just a cut down version), so you would still be able to use Windows on your Mac. Just not work on x86 projects for legacy computers. Denver Morgan This could also mean OS X on an iPad like device. lattermanstudio That’s what I was thinking……. an evolution to one OS on all devices…. that way can finally catch up with what’s been happening with Windoze tablets that run standard Windoze apps…. somethings that Apple can’t offer right now due to the processor differences……. they are stuck in a corner and need to take drastic steps to enter the modern world. ……. now…. they may come up with a clever way to dual boot iOS/macOS or create some kind of new Finder that you can choose macOS-mode or iOS-mode depending your needs/liking… Reed Harston Apple not putting macOS on the iPad has nothing to do with the processor differences actually. Recompiling code to run on a different architecture isn’t as simple as flipping a switch but it isn’t that hard either. The bigger problem is making macOS and your favorite software work on a touchscreen. Your idea of having two modes, one for macOS and one for iOS, just exacerbates the problem. There is no easy or pretty way to make one OS work on both platforms. Windows 8 was meant to unite both platforms but instead it was universally hated by all. One OS to rule them all didn’t really work out very well for them. The problem is that mouse and keyboard oriented UIs are bad for touch screens and touch oriented UIs are just funky and out of place when you have a mouse. That is because on touch screens buttons have to be large and easy to press with a big finger, where a mouse pointer is small and much more precise. I can see the hardware converging more and more internally but I personally think the different OSes and UIs are going to remain. I prefer macOS for its power and I prefer iOS for my wife for its simplicity. sassymacgeek People always assume that Apple wants to put ARM into MacBooks which I agree would be great for certain aspects particularly cost and battery life (but perhaps not for cross platform development) but they fail to recognize that Apple could also be planning to have OSX for iPad Pros. It is also a possibility as long as we are guessing. Lit Why would they switch to an underpowered chip? That’s suicide. The only thing I can think of is to increase profit margins, which would be a typical Cook move. Reed Harston Before you go off and say ‘underpowered’ do your homework. The iPhone 7 has higher single and multi core GeekBench scores than the Intel powered MacBook 2016. Of course there is more to usability than benchmark scores, but that is still very telling. And there is the fact that the iPhone 7 has a minuscule battery compared to the MacBook yet it gets much better battery life (yes, the display affects it greatly I know but still you can’t help but be impressed). Of course you could say the MacBook is underpowered as well, but I would argue it is just fine and that other laptops are more powerful than they need to be. At least for the average user anyway. Even power users like me could get by just fine with the MacBook since it has an amazing SSD in it. Point being, using an ARM chip isn’t that farfetched an idea to me at all. mrgerbik there is no comparison when comparing A10 vs an i5 or i7 – its like a sports car vs a family sedan ItzSky_05 If you take the most powerful ARM processor and compare it with the most consumer grade processor, there’s no point of comparison (Apple A10 vs Intel Core i7-6700k or even the Intel Core I7-6700HQ). ARM is still underpowered, but looks like it’s getting stronger every time. For a portable or unpowered device like the Macbook, is a great idea. CaffeinePizza Or since iOS and macOS share the same Darwin kernel….. Reed Harston +1 While I do think that there is something to be said for Apple deciding to got to custom ARM chips in the Macs I agree that at least for the time being you (and the others who commented the same as you) are most likely right. macOS and iOS share a kernel so they may have likely just found a reference to the CPU in the iPhone 7. rockdude094 Maybe its hinting an iPad type device that runs Mac OS Shameer Mulji Good point. Many are assuming that Apple is building an ARM-based Mac but instead they may be working to port macOS to iPad Pro. Imad Ghandour tl;dr; Would be a downside to introduce this: 1-No more windows compatibility 2-Cant game 3-Unless big innovation is done 4-Doubtful …in more detail below I wouldn’t like this because it would render mac’s unable to run windows side by side with the Macintosh operating system, unless Apple finds some kind of workaround with drivers that would make this possible; which is doubtful. Even then, apps that would run on this ‘tweaked’ windows infrastructure, mainly games in this case for me at least, would be virtually ‘unrunnable’ because they are built to either run on AMD and Nvidia GPUs or either on AMD and Intel CPUs. Doubtful that they will support Apple’s ARM architecture since developers still barely support running games on Macs all together; basically there is little reason for them to change their minds as Apple is focused on Enterprise and Creative consumer-base rather than the avid casual gamer user-base instead. This is all true, unless Apple probably produces some rendition of a mac that is a graphics powerhouse that might reignite the idea of possibly gaming on a mac; very possible since this is seen today with the iPhone. However, as I said twice before, I find this very doubtful because, if this was a considered goal we would have seen Apple take a jab at this market earlier; until today only their high end MacBooks have a discrete graphics cards which are situated mainly for video editing rather than gaming all together. Unfortunate really. lattermanstudio i think it the end of an era where most (if not all) Apple computers can also run Windows natively. Back in the day…. Apple switched to Intel for a number of reasons…… PPC chips where having development issues, there was a big demand for Windows apps being able to run on our ofiice Mac…. in the end it was all about $$$ ……. same thing now….. Apple looks kinda weak when you compare it’s “pro” ipad series with and windows tablet that runs native windows apps ON a tablet….. it’s not very elegant in the Apple world…. they need to be able to offer a seamless experience ….. they can’t that unless they change and have ‘one’ OS….. things need to change…… Reed Harston You have good points but I think there are some things to consider. 1. As I have mentioned in other comments, I think that Windows on ARM isn’t too far out. It already exists for Raspberry Pi, which is ARM based. Also, as someone else commented there are likely fewer and fewer people using Windows on their Macs so even if it doesn’t work anymore (though I still believe it will) then it may not be missed very much by the masses. I know I wouldn’t care much. 2. ??? First, Macs aren’t widely regarded as ‘for gaming’ anyway. Second, switching to ARM CPUs doesn’t mean you won’t be able to use an AMD or Nvidia GPU. Two different things altogether. As for games running on ARM, anything from the App Store won’t care what CPU you have since Apple recompiles apps on the fly, so those games won’t even notice any change. As far as Windows gaming goes though you are right. You’ll just have to put together a gaming PC for those games, and even if Apple doesn’t switch from intel to ARM that would probably be best anyway since Macs don’t have great support for all the latest hardware, since you obviously only seem to care about games and nothing else which is not what Macs are made for (which you’ve said yourself). 3. I honestly don’t know what to say to this. Obviously the whole jump to ARM would take some innovation so that is a given. And they are already on the way there actually. All of Apple’s iOS devices run ARM so running macOS on ARM would be a piece of cake (Linux already runs equally well on either x86 or ARM or PowerPC or MIPS or whatever). And Apple has already set up the App Store to accept apps in a state that allows Apple to compile the app for the CPU of the device the app will be installed on, so that means no more work for the developers. 4. Doubtful? Maybe. Possible? Likely. I think it is more a question of ‘when’ then ‘if’ at this point. Having one type of CPU architecture in all their devices would make a lot of things easier for Apple in the long run. Imad Ghandour Just to touch on a point that I believe I didn’t make clear. I don’t use my mac specially to game. I actually bought my mac in order to Video Edit in the fly on Adobe Premiere and FCPX; gaming for me is a compliment to that experience. The reason I believe that people say that Macs aren’t meant for gaming is that 1- There is an abysmal support for games on macOS 2-Most MacBooks don’t come with a discrete graphics card, evens the ones that do, although satisfy photo editing and video editing very well, cannot game which I find weird honestly. I don’t game seriously just a bit of Overwatch and couple of other titles here and there and my mac serves me well. However, most of my games rely on windows (only reason I have the OS installed) and it would be a shame to want to uogeade in the future and lose this privilege. Even games that are cross-platform run better on windows due to their initial aim to use Direct-X as the main API instead of Open-GL or I guess now Metal. So losing the ability to run windows is a letdown. If Apple can facilitate and smooth transition (which would be possible obviously with macOS as you mentioned) for boot camp as well, odds are very low though, that would be great. Don’t get me wrong I do think switching to Apples own designed ARM is a great idea as there own chips have proven to easily outperform intel chips in the past, again just desappointed on compatibility. pjp “…developers no longer submit fully compiled binaries.” “Instead, intermediary bit code is submitted which Apple uses to compile the binary code for the specific CPU architecture. Should Apple release an ARM-based Mac, developers wouldn’t need to re-submit their existing code nor would they need to add any ARM-specific code in order for their apps to run natively on ARM-based hardware.” This isn’t true. Bitcode is for iOS apps, not Mac apps. Reed Harston Correct, but do you think it is much of a stretch for Apple to do the same for Mac apps? It would take practically no extra work for the developers to support this in their apps, if any at all. All Apple would have to do is flip a switch on their end and voila. The Mac app store will behave like the iOS App Store. Will Collier I’ve been expecting this for a while. Makes Apple independent of Intel, and kills Hackintoshes in one swell foop. (I’m opposed, FWIW.) lattermanstudio yup….. would kill the Hackintosh……. not good – but at the same time I can see why it makes sense to them in the long run……… hey…… you can ‘still’ make a Hackintosh and run OSX 10.12 and below…… nothing wrong with that 🙂 lattermanstudio Bye bye to Mac that also run WinDoze but that’s no big loss. We may finally see ipads that run OSX….. that would be great 🙂 Leslie Bee With extra cores (maybe 9) at 3-7nm, ARM could probably replace Intel entirely by around 2020. Apple would love to boost profits, and jettison Intel and eventually all other non-Apple chips in all their products. The future is coming whether we like it or not. Everybody wants to rule the world, especially Apple. Reed Harston I don’t think ARM needs that many more cores in order to replace Intel. ARM chips are generally seen as slower because they are. We only see 1 to 2.5 GHz ARM chips because that is as fast as they can get before melting the phones and tablets they are most used in. Intel chips regularly clock up to 4GHz or more in high end machines. I don’t doubt that ARM chips could reach the same speeds as Intel chips do in a full sized laptop or desktop computers. Then they would be very completive and most likely more power efficient to boot. Of course Apple is looking to improve their bottom line more than anything but I also think that if they do make this move it would simplify a lot of things for them overall. It would mean only one architecture to support on their OS and apps (which would mean more resources for more debugging and better software). And it would also mean that Apple would have more control over the pace of their hardware upgrades as well. I agree, whatever happens is going to happen and there isn’t anything we can do to make Apple change their minds. Frank CHEN That’s why the name “FUSION”. The question is will we have an iOS like macbook or a osX like ipad pro. Shameer Mulji my bet is on the former. Niklaus Mikaelson I guess My iapd pro is getting macos Johny Burns So many amoebas are biting on the TMZ reporters. Typical Kardashian story. ARM tried in the Chromebooks thru the Linux distro flavor, and Intel uses the weakest and cheapest silicon there. Apple has around 10 more years to catch to what Intel has right now. Not to mention HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Sams, Huawei, Xiaomi are pissing all over iMacs. Apple got butt hurt when Intel stop providing them with custom made silicon. Dell already got a Kaby Lake chips, and Apple is now on the back of the bus. mrgerbik Comparing current ARM builds to current x86 is like comparing a Nissan Sentra to a McLaren F1. For everyday computing the speed is reasonable enough, but for any serious workloads, x86 is still the champ by far. aalberti LLVM was architecture independent from the start. I supposed intermediate code (bitcode) was the way to go for distribution, with a JIT compiler specific for the installed chip on the computer. They took a long time, but it seems they’re finally headed there. It is certainly doable and even very efficient. Jorge Rivera Yes, it does make sense. Additionally, macOS and iOS may merge and this is why one can find those references in the include files. It is the beginning of implementing a vision for future Apple devices as they become more homogeneous. Jon Allen Time to look at windows again. Apple, its been a good decade. Sentinel64 Well….this line of thought ( Apple going ARM across their entire portfolio ) has a little more credence when you realize that Intel has recently bowed out of the phone and tablet CPU market. For the last 3-4 years Intel has poured BILLIONS of dollars into the mobile space trying to dislodge the stranglehold that ARM has in that market. They quite literally were seeing BILLIONS in losses due to rebates and marketing given to phone manufacturers to entice them to start using Intel CPU’s instead of ARM. This would be Intel’s ATOM line of CPUs. It was a spectacular failure. So this year they announced they are out of the phone and tablet business and are concentrating the ATOM line for 2in1 Hybrids and cheap laptops on the Windows side of things. Read that again…..OUT of the PHONE and TABLET business. Now….where is Apple making the most money from but the PHONE and TABLET business? So…..just like a decade ago when the PowerPC alliance was failing to bring the innovations needed to Apple, not only in the desktop division but particularly in the laptop division forcing Apple rightfully at the time to go Intel, Intel is now stagnating and ARM chips have advanced enough to become viable replacements across the entire Apple portfolio from desktops to mobile. I think 2017 is a good year to see an ARM based Apple Air laptop. 2018 sees an ENTIRE mobile portfolio ( all laptops, phones, tablets and watch ) go ARM and in the 2019-2020 timeframe the first ARM based Apple desktop. Just my humble opinion. iAndroHacker Does it mean that i can dual-boot Android Nougat ARM version? yeah cool right? lol. just saying La Vida Leica …or macOS running on iPad Pros. Frank Moolah This should be no surprise that Apple is trying to be independent from Intel (can’t blame ’em) but banking on ARM at it’s current state would be a crapshoot. Not ready, not even for 2017 Anthony Randazzo or it could be that they are slowing combining the iOS and macOS code base so that there is less to manage, and soon iOS may be running macOS as its core. Another option is a more affordable netbook style Apple Baltazar It could make sense to go with in-house ARMs. Most tasks now are not CPU bound. I’d argue unless you are high-end gaming, science/CAD, content creation, we are getting to the point that for many people their Chomebooks or iPads are able to do everything they want. Hopefully they keep the Pro line and 27″ iMac line with Intel and OS X. I’d disagree that Apple has been held back by Intel’s cpu timeline. No updates on: Mac Pro, MacMini, Apple Display, etc. Carson Wotell It’s probably the arm t1 chip apple integrated into the new macbook pros John Smith WHOA, WHOA, WHOA The Touch Bar on the new MBP is powered by an ARM processor, wouldn’t that account for the code???????????   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Early MacBook Pro adopters confused by misidentified graphics in System Profiler Twitter for iPhone and iPad gains support for rich notifications on iOS 10 Teardown confirms both 13″ and 15″ Touch Bar MacBook Pros have non-removable SSDs Google revamps Play Newsstand, adds For You recommendations, rich media, web app & more Apple launches worldwide “Touch Disease” repair program for iPhone 6 Plus   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 30, 2016 9:50am   Comments Share: Related MON Fast Money Traders Share Their Picks Ahead Of The Election Alibaba, Monsanto and Gold: Fast Money Picks For October 31 Top Merger Stocks Held By Fund Managers (Mid-Q4 2016 Edition) (Seeking Alpha) Related MSFT Chowdhry: Cisco Is Just Another Victim Of Amazon's Superclouds 7 Biggest Price Target Changes For Thursday US Market Indexes Higher on Thursday (GuruFocus) When people talk about emerging markets, they usually think about China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Turkey or Saudi Arabia. And, while most also include Brazil in this list, they seldom mention other booming Latin American countries. This trend is clearly seen in the allocation of venture capital, which poured almost $12 billion into China venture capital funds in the first half of the year, compared to less than $220 million for Latin America, a recent TechCruch article commented. However, this trend has started to slowly revert, as firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital and QED have been investing in the region – mostly in Brazil, but also in Mexico and Colombia. Moreover, TechCrunch contributor Julie Ruvolo explained, this is a market that’s set to boom, with its internet population bound to double, from 300 million to 600 million users; only half of the people included in the banking system; and an avalanche of new people coming online as smartphones become more affordable. Related Link: Evaluating A High-Flying Emerging Markets ETF Also worth pointing out, the author continued, is the fact that Brazilians spend more time online than any other country. All of this explains why venture capital investments have been surging consistently over the past few years, with 2015 setting a new record of $594 million. Furthermore, in the first half of 2016, venture capital transactions in the region rose 46 percent year-over-year, the Latin American Private Equity and Venture Capital Association said. So, let’s take a closer look into some major Silicon Valley firms landing in Latin America. Silicon Valley Goes Latino Earlier this year, Andreessen Horowitz decided to back Rappi, a grocery delivery service in Colombia. Founders Fund invested in Brazilian startups Jusbrasil and Nubank. The latter has already secured more than $80 million in funding from Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Kaszek Ventures and QED Investors. Goldman Sachs also made a $52 million debt investment in Nubank, as well as a $10 million outlay in another Brazilian startup, CargoX. Accel Partners also put some money down in Mexican grocery shopping startup Cornershop. QED Investors, along with Kaszek, Quona Capital, Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund and Jaguar Ventures, participated in an $8 million Series A in Konfio, a lending platform. Fintech Is King Given the high percentage of unbanked population, fintech initiatives are having a big impact on financial inclusion, Ruvolo explicated. This is why 29 percent of the money invested in IT went to fintech startups in 2015; this figure rose to 40 percent in the first half of 2016. Another sector that is gaining traction is agtech – agricultural technology, Ruvolo continued. Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) recently announced an investment of up to $92 million in BR Startups, a Brazilian agtech fund run by Microsoft Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM)’s Qualcomm Ventures. The latter also invested in a program to get drones to Brazil’s 2+ million farms. Finally, BASF SE (ADR) (OTC: BASFY) launched Agrostart, a agtech accelerator.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact FIDO Authentication Coming Soon to Lenovo Notebooks 88Shares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Azeem Ullah 2 months ago With the monumental Yahoo hack, which compromised of more than 500 million accounts, behind us, Lenovo and partners are teaming up to make sure your online verification methods use something more unique than a password: the good-old fingerprint. FIDO Alliance The FIDO Alliance consisting of Lenovo, Intel, PayPal and Synaptics will result in the arrival of more fingerprint scanners in your laptops. FIDO, or Fast ID Online, will combine Lenovo’s laptops with Intel’s hardware knowledge and Synaptics’s biometric verification prowess to provide an enhanced alternative to passwords. Benefits of FIDO Athentication The procedure will assist with the online payment from services such as PayPal and decrease online fraud. Because the fingerprint is so hard to replicate, the method is likely the most secure form of authentication available right now. Also, it will facilitate users who have to remember different passwords for several of their accounts, to act as a one stop shop. “Passwords are a universal problem that is not limited to mobile devices. Every internet connected device needs the ability to upgrade to simpler, stronger Fido authentication and thanks to this partnership, the desktop ecosystem is on an accelerated path to get the same Fido capabilities already well established across the mobile ecosystem.” Brett McDowell, executive director of Fido Alliance Upcoming Support for the FIDO Standards The first product to be adorned by such hardware is the new Yoga 910 from Lenovo. The new convertible, which already has features, such as a 4K display and a 7th-generation Intel processor. According to Lenovo, this would be the first time PC users will experience this technology. The Yoga 910 will be available starting from next month. Apart from that, Microsoft is also making sure that its Windows Hello supports FIDO authentication, in a bid to finally give users a more complex alternative to passwords. The news comes on the eve of the Yahoo data hack, which saw more than 500 million users losing essential private information. While fingerprints do not tend to be entirely secure either, this step will at least make sure news such as this are seen less often.

Intel Rolls Out HD Graphics Driver 20.19.15.4530 Beta - Download Now The new beta release should fix Gears of War 4 problems Sep 30, 2016 05:38 GMT  ·  By Iulian Pascal  ·  Share:  Intel has made available a new Iris and HD Graphics package, namely version 20.19.15.4530 beta, which confirms the pending driver code changes that should fix crashes and/or unresponsiveness while playing Gears of War 4. However, even though the present release might resolve some game issues seen across certain platforms, the 4530 beta build is basically a test driver that should be used at your own discretion. In terms of compatibility, Intel’s update is suitable for configurations running one of Microsoft’s 64-bit architectures of Windows 7, 8.1, and 10 operating systems, as well as including a supported CPU model as highlighted on the description page. When it comes to installation, first make sure your system is valid for this new driver, save and unzip the downloadable archive, and run the available setup file. Afterwards, simply follow all instructions displayed on-screen for a complete and successful upgrade. In addition to that, once finished, it would be a good idea to perform a system reboot to allow the changes to take effect. If this task isn’t requested, however, make sure to carry it out manually. That said, download Intel Iris/HD Graphics Driver 20.19.15.4530 Beta 64-bit, apply it, and constantly check our website to be the first to know when a newer and stable version is available for your device. #HD Graphics#Iris Graphics#Intel 4530#Gars of War 4 reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft Updates Firmware for Its Surface 3 - Download Version August 8, 2016 Download HD Graphics Driver 20.19.15.4463 for Intel NUC Devices Download All Drivers for Sager’s NP8151 Notebook Model MSI’s GT72S 6QD Dominator G Tobii Notebook Receives Drivers for Windows 10 Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build NVIDIA Makes Available New GeForce Graphics Hotfix Driver - Version 375.95 AMD Releases Radeon Crimson Edition 16.11.4 Hotfix - Download and Apply Now New Firmware Is Available for Sony PlayStation 4 Consoles - Get Version 4.06 Amazon Adds Alexa to Its Fire, Fire HD 8, and Fire HD 10 - Get Firmware 5.6.0    Gears of War 4 issues should be momentarily resolved New Apps Gwyddion: An efficient and reliable modular application designed specifically for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data visualization and analysis Gus Tools: Turn ESD images of Windows 10 to ISO format, so that you may upgrade your computer to this operating system using a USB or a DVD Avira System SpeedUp: Clean junk files, repair registry errors, delete invalid keys, clean computer activity traces, and defragment your drives using this all-in-one tool POPcon PRO: Advanced program that helps you retrieve messages from POP3 mailboxes and deliver them to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes using antispam, archive, antivirus engine, rule-based distribution and scheduled tasks WFilter Enterprise: Monitor bandwidth, filter and block Internet activities on your network from a single computer via a web-based administration interface PDF to Image Converter: An intuitive and user-friendly application that can come in handy whenever you want to convert your PDF files to various graphic formats Mkgmap splitter: Split the OpenStreetMap files into smaller tiles in order to use them on your Garmin device, with this practical command-line utility Reader comments AMD Releases Radeon Crimson Edition 16.11.4 Hotfix - Download and Apply Now more on: Radeon 16.11.4 Hotfix i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Between ever-increasing internet connectivity and the breakdown of the console upgrade cycle, cloud gaming is likely to make it big sooner than we’d expected. Posted By Arjun Krishna Lal | On 01st, Oct. 2016 Under Article, Graphics Analysis Tweet +1 Like Share Reddit "C"loud, the final frontier. Over the past few years, we’ve encountered plenty of innovation and advancement in terms of how we engage with games. While motion controls are still not exactly mainstream, the Wii popularized that concept ten years ago, and today’s Steam Controller features gyro aim that’s far from gimmicky. VR’s finally become something of a mainstream proposition. While we’re yet to see the Rift and Vive go the way of the 90’s VR craze, significant content is being produced for a change. 4K and HDR are taking us a step closer to that somewhat far-off point of time when the monitor reaches its logical endpoint, as a window into the outside that’s indistinguishable from the real thing. Sony and Microsoft’s decision to out the PS4 Pro and Project Scorpio has completely changed the way we look at gaming consoles. The hardware is no longer fixed: as with mobile, the new model centres on iteration. The downside to this is that there is no longer any guarantee against your hardware becoming obsolete: your console no longer becomes that comfortable 5-year investment you’d expected it to be. Games are no longer tied down to platforms because the platforms themselves are no longer fixed. Take Microsoft’s repositioning of the Xbox brand, for example. A decade ago, an Xbox was an Xbox: a (physical) Microsoft-designed home console box that you’d set in your living room and hook up to your TV. There was no talk about phones or Crossplay or Continuum. An Xbox was an Xbox, simple as that. But what does the cloud mean for the Xbox? Today, Xbox is nearly everything it possibly could be apart from the Xbox One, and this leads us to an interesting proposition: What if we were to fully de-tether the brand from the platform? What if Xbox meant games which didn’t have to run on a fixed hardware platform like the Xbox One or Project Scorpio? What if you could play Halo 5 on your phone, on the way to work? Cloud gaming is the logical next step forward. The upsides are obvious: AAA games have always been constrained by the need to run on fixed hardware—namely whatever consoles are current at that point of time. The seventh gen gave us some remarkable titles, but at the end of the day, seventh gen games had to be able to run respectably on GPUs that were within the performance profile of Intel’s HD 4000 iGPU. The infamous spate of “downgrades” in eighth-gen titles, from Watch Dogs to The Witcher 3, to The Division only serves to underline this point: when you’re dealing with fixed hardware you have a (very) limited rendering budget. In the case of the Xbox One, this limitation prevents the console from running most AAA games acceptably at 1080p. Compromise is the only way to make a game that will work on the fixed hardware that most of your customer base will be on. Cloud streaming solutions, on the other hand, augment or get rid of the weakest link—fixed hardware. Instead of individual users with relatively weak local hardware, firms with the capital can invest in massive server grids with virtually unlimited amounts of rendering power on tap and offer games as a subscription service—something they’d make far more money off of in the long term than a fixed hardware purchase every couple of years. This is a market that Nvidia’s been trying to tap into for quite some time now with their Geforce Now service running on Nvidia GRID servers. In the “console” space (although that word starts to lose meaning when the brand’s decoupled from hardware), Sony’s PlayStation Now service is a strong portent of what’s to come next: while, currently, only PS3 titles are on offer, PlayStation Now users have access to over 400 titles at $20 a month. All that’s needed is hardware capable of streaming HD video—anything from a smartphone on up, and this is what’s truly remarkable about the cloud: your laptop becomes a PS3.  Your phone becomes a PS3.  Could this model work for Microsoft? The Xbox 360 has a  great catalogue of exclusives: support for backwards compatibility on the Xbox One goes to show that there is a market for people who want to continue exploring seventh-gen titles. But a cloud-enabled service would mean that any piece of hardware you own–and not just the Xbox One or Scorpio could run a wide selection of titles. While an Xbox cloud-streaming service is pure speculation, the innovative physics implementation in Crackdown 3, leveraging the power of Microsoft’s Azure servers is a strong signal that Redmond isn’t standing idle. Microsoft’s gambit with the Xbox brand, however, seems to be broader in reach than just game streaming. With Xbox Crossplay, UWP (Universal Windows Apps), and Continuum, Microsoft is already offering a consistent, platform-agnostic Windows experience. With Project Scorpio, Microsoft appears to be taking somewhat of a conservative stance: Based on specs, this is a very powerful local system, built from the ground up to power high-quality local experiences. It’s quite likely to be large and noisy. Microsoft’s cageyness about cloud gaming, at least as far as the Scorpio is concerned is understandable: Cloud gaming require access to unlimited,high-bandwidth internet connectivity, and even today, that’s somewhat of a rarity. But considering the maturity of their Azure platform, and the exciting partnership between Nvidia and Microsoft to leverage Nvidia GRID graphics tech, a cloud-enabled Xbox streaming service is something Microsoft could make happen whenever it needs to. Although Crackdown 3 is the only game to do so, any Xbox game can take advantage of Azure to offload graphics, physics, AI, and more. Microsoft’s approach, dubbed Kahawai, uses “collaborative rendering” to split the work between the local hardware and the cloud server. Because some of the rendering is being locally, this drastically cuts down on bandwidth requirements. While Kahawai is currently deployed for mobile, we wouldn’t be surprised to see it in action in Xbox games going ahead. This could have major implications for Xbox titles further down the line. With both Sony and Microsoft moving away from the conventional console cycle, it may well be possible that the Xbox Scorpio is the last or second-to-last Microsoft console. What would a post-Xbox console world look like? We see it as something akin to what Microsoft has done with “Windows as a service.” Windows 10 is iterative, with each build adding or removing features on the basis of feedback. Based on preliminary specs, the Scorpio is reasonably powerful for a 2017 machine. While there may be a further hardware iteration, we think that gradual cloud integration is the path Xbox will take: Crackdown 3 is the first step in that direction, making up for the Xbox One’s CPU deficit by offloading physics calculations to the cloud. As titles start to push the limits of what the Scorpio can do at 4K, upscaling would definitely be an option, but if developers further tap into Azure–graphics rendering may also be progressively offloaded to the cloud, and at a point where it becomes commercially viable, we’d likely see that fabled Xbox cloud streaming service.

Crackdown already looked amazing with the normal XB1. I can’t even imagine how it would explode with Scorpio’s power… efnet I thought it did anyway, man I’m just ready to see what the console looks like … We got to link up someday on Xbox live Jeremiah Locanas My only assumption is it will have an internal power supply and a 4K Blu Ray Player, plus I think it will be closer to the original XB1 in size b/c of the fan to cool the 6TF. The PS4Pro has a huge box also compared to the PS4. My XBL is: jablocanas – what’s yours? I don’t play many online games though, I picked up Battlefield 1 and Titanfall though b/c I’m pretty good at both. I get thrashed at Halo and CoD, lol… efnet Xbl: imsochill osg You already know I got pretty much everything . As far as the Scorpio go though I’m just waiting for them to show it . Jeremiah Locanas Cool, added! Yeah, same here, hopefully it will look nice. Jeremiah Locanas Hey dude, q for ya: do you have an elite controller? Is it worth the price? Got a coupon from Best Buy for rewards and trying to find out if it’s really worth it, or just expensive efnet Yea I do have one. Its worth it if you’re a competitive gamer, the controller give you the options of remapping your crucial buttons and options for taller or shorter thumb sticks which are great for shooters. I woil Jeremiah Locanas I’m not really competitive but I do like to win. I like the idea of triggers being easier to use b/c you’re not pressing all the way down. I also like the quality aspect as I’ve gone through 4 xb1 controllers this gen already :/ luckily the last 3 were all returnable to MSFT via warranty but it’s been borderline ridiculous… Jeremiah Locanas Thanks also! crazy_black_man- The cloud again? Oh gee whiz. The hilariousness continuous at Gamingbolt. kma99 You must hit refresh on your smart phone. I swear you just wait for every article to post crazy_black_man- You must hit the “hard reset” on your Xbox One. I swear you’re an idiot to even come here at all kma99 I swear most people have better things to do in a days time other than troll web sites all dat. You wouldn’t know about that would you? And stop pretending to be a black guy you nutcase. crazy_black_man- I swear most people have better things to do in a days time other than troll web sites complaining about what others post all day. You wouldn’t know about that would you? And stop pretending you’re not an idiot. kma99 White guy pretending to be black. Epitome of idiot. Match.com might help with that loneliness crazy_black_man- How did my race ever become a part of this discussion on the cloud helping to boost the power of Scorpio? You have no way of verifying my ethnicity, or how it affects my criticisms of the content in this article, but I on the other hand, CAN confirm beyond all doubt that it is an indisputable fact that, yes,… https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c577d78e10700095e9b8fd2e0773b685aa9224c761bf5be862c5c1c535bf43f.jpg YOU ARE AN IDIOT. kma99 How did you acting like a clown benefit this article. A smart man would somply ignore something he didnt like or read it and keep it moving if he cant add anything of value to it. Idiots sit on their computer all day and complain like a teenage girl about trivial stuff. That seems to be you moniker so i assume you’re the idiot. P.S. you’re still not black crazy_black_man- LOL. I’m getting you. It’s fairly obvious. “A smart man would somply ignore something he didnt like or read it and keep it moving”. The truth about what I say is getting under your skin. The evidence of that truth? “A smart man would somply ignore something he didnt like or read it and keep it moving”. You’re not a smart man are you? The evidence? You’re sitting continuously crying like a little b i t c h about what an actual smart man is saying about all this “power of the cloud” nonsense. Hilariousness! I love it! kma99 Microsoft is getting to you lol. You’re on here 24/7 complaining. I simply laugh at an idiot who can’t simply walk away. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- LOL. Classic cop out reply. The agony of defeat. I’m sure you’re used to by now. kma99 No cop out. Any Microsoft article you are thr first to post, that’s facts. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- Just out of curiosity. Had you commented on this article before I did, what would you have said? I mean, are you sure you don’t come to these articles just to see me? Would you like me to send you a naked picture of my hairy black a s s so you can wake up first thing in the morning and kiss it everyday? I can do that if you’d like. kma99 I wouldn’t have commented because i dont see the relevance intil we actual get some proof that Microsoft can pull it off. If and when they get proven to be liars or people of their word then i woule feel thr need to comment not complain. You on thr other hand get all in your hemotions anytime Microsoft is mentioned. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- You’re saying they haven’t proven anything to you, so you won’t connent, but yet MY opinion still offends you because I did comment. I may not be able to prove my ethnicity or why it matters in Gamingbolt, but you’re STILL continuously proving how much of an idiot you are, every time you show up here. kma99 Your opinion is simply your opinion and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is you always assert your negative opinion on anything Microsoft and thats borderline stupidity. You cant seem to leave well enough alone. If this was consistent between sony and Microsoft then i would simply assume u just hated life but u dont u praise one and down the other. I dont hate or love either company i support them both the same even though im partial to sega. crazy_black_man- Dude, I couldn’t give a sh*t about who you love and who you hate, and you should be adult enough to do the same about others. Go to a Sony article for the next six months and show all the Sony hate you want, and watch me NOT b i t c h and complain about your valid opinion as a consumer to feel the way you do, and try to silence that opinion from being heard. These are consumer products just like any other consumer product. Why are you crying like a b i t c h about someone else’s right to state their opinion on a consumer product, fanboy? kma99 What would be the point in doing that? To act as childish as you are now, that’s stupid. Like i said earlier why dont u go find a relationship to occupy your time and stop crying on message boards. Ps you’re still not black crazy_black_man- LOL. Still crying like a b i t c h. What’s stupid and childish is you still crying like a b i t c h. kma99 Nothing to cry over. Im not mad at Microsoft but u r lol. crazy_black_man- Oh, there’s no doubt in anyone’s mind how mad you are. That fact that you’ve just spent the afternoon crying like a b i t c h just proves how mad you are. Its good to know I can control your emotions like this. Thanks for letting me in. Hilariousness! kma99 Believe what you want but your emotional right now. Lol time to change your pads i presume. There is a singer named Carl Thomas who has a song called emotional that might help relax that fragile brain of yours. crazy_black_man- LOL. Wow. That comment was very telling. Is that what you listen to when your this upset? How sad. Listen son, in all seriousness, it’s just videogames. Please don’t hurt yourself today. I really wouldn’t want that for you. Ok? Can you promise me that? kma99 No its telling because im telling you how to resolve this anger issue u have with Microsoft. They have you raging even on holidays lol. crazy_black_man- Ok, we’ll go with that narrative. I’m ok with that. Im more concerned about you right now. I should show more sensitivity and I’ll have to work on that. You kids are under a lot of stress these days, confused about what gender bathroom to use and all that kinda stuff that my generation never had to deal with. I’m sorry little guy. kma99 Dont be concerned with me im mentally stable. Matter of fact i will come back to make you rage later, i have real life stuff to do. You will probably start responding to yourself and upvoting your comments again. crazy_black_man- Ok son. That’s good to hear. I’m so relieved. Please have a fun day today with your two dads. kma99 2 dads, aint you the comedian. Ps they both are still blacker than you. crazy_black_man- LOL. Good return! sazse007 He is probably paid to do this. Learned Handgun I seriously hope he is. Kma999 is right. This guy literally posts negative stuff on every Xbox article, has multiple accounts to do so, and pretends to be different people. It had to be either paid or loneliness turned mental disorder Mike E. LOL… no doubt. I had a good laugh reading this. Anyone interested in a real gaming experience won’t touch streaming services. Can you say input latency? Sheesh… Michael Ponyisms…lol….reminds me of that thing they called cell that sony had to sell…lol bewareofZ You mean the chip that helped the PS3 turn a 10 million sales deficit into a win. lol efnet 1 more year… The wait will be a long one.

Study finds pizza motivates people more than money!TNN | Oct 2, 2016, 01.00 AM IST Hey boss, how ’bout a pizza? Why Is This Important? Because everyone loves pizza. Long Story Short When given the option of free pizza, a cash bonus or praise from the boss, workers in a factory were most productive when offered the ’za, according to a new study. Long Story Have you ever been motivated to get all your work done as quickly as possible because you know a hot, gooey, slice of pizza is waiting for you at home? Well, you can thank the ’za. Dan Ariely, author of the upcoming book, Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations, recounts a study where workers in an Intel semiconductor factory in Israel were offered different awards based on how many computer chips they churned out in a day, as reported by New York Magazine. One group was told they’d get a cash bonus of 100 Israeli shekels (about $30) if they increase their productivity, another said they’d get congratulations from the boss (a ‘Well done!’ text message) and a third group was offered a coupon for a free pizza. One final group wasn’t offered anything – they were the control group. After the first day, one of the groups increased productivity by 6.7% – yep, you guessed it, that was the pizza group. Coming in a close second was the group offered praise. The money group, on the other hand, only increased production by 4.9% on the first day. Still, not bad. But a day later, it was clear which motivator was the best. By the second day, those offered the cash bonus were 13.2% less productive than the group not given any bonuses. Of the entirety of the study, those with the cash bonus ended up being 6.5% worse than those with no bonus at all – thus actually costing the company money rather than boosting productivity in any way. So, what does this mean? Everyone loves pizza. But that we already know. It means that cash isn’t always the best motivator to get people to be productive. Rather, giving them congratulations for their work — and yes, a delicious slice of pizza — can be even better. Ask The Big Question Why did the productivity drop when the cash was offered? Disrupt Your Feed Forget wages, people should just be paid in slices of pizza. After the first day, one of the groups increased productivity by 6.7% – yep, you guessed it, that was the pizza group. Coming in a close second was the group offered praise. The money group, on the other hand, only increased production by 4.9% on the first day By Joel Balsam Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Qatalyst will begin a formal sales process to find a buyer for NXP, said the people, asking not to be identified because the information is private. In addition to Qualcomm, Avago Technologies Ltd, Intel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co are the most likely to be interested, one of the people said. NXP might also hire a coadviser, another person said. While NXP has grown quickly via its purchase of Freescale Semiconductor at the end of last year, it is still relatively small compared with companies such as Qualcomm, Intel and the more rapidly expanding Broadcom Ltd. NXP is projected to have more than US$9 billion in revenue this year. NXP chief executive officer Rich Clemmer and the company’s board, who successfully brought the company back to the public markets in 2010, might be tempted by an offer to become part of a bigger company as industrywide costs of production rise and customer lists shrink. NXP is one of several firms that San Diego, California-based Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips for mobile phones, has been studying as it determines if and how to put its offshore cash to use, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Qualcomm is also considering a handful of other large acquisitions, both domestic and international targets, the people said.

Intel Xeon E5-2670 Elroy Bethell - October 1, 2016 5:00 AM Print Recipient E-mail Sender E-mail Today’s CPUs (Central Processing Units), APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) or processors, as they are sometimes called, boost a variety features that present a daunting task when it comes to choosing the right one for your needs. Whether you are a gamer or more into productivity, your task should be centered around finding the CPU that best supports what UDO. (You D0). I think we covered all the acronyms so far. When choosing a processor, your budget is usually the main deciding factor. The performance you get from a processor is often in direct correlation to the amount of money you spend to purchase it. In order to make the buying process as simple as possible, you can narrow down your selection process by deciding on AMD or Intel, price point, number of cores, and clock speed. While there are many notable chip manufacturers out there, AMD and Intel are more often sitting at the top of the list. Here is a head-to-head comparison of their two shining stars… or chips.   SPECS AMD A8-7670K Photo Source: Amazon Intel Xeon E5-2670 Photo Source: Amazon Price $105.09 $345.26 Processor Speed 3.6 GHz 2.6 GHz Max Turbo Core Speed 3.9 GHz 3.3 GHz Processor Count 4 8 Socket Socket FM2+ LGA 2011 Brand AMD Intel         These two processors are clearly not in the same field to be competing against each other. The point here is that each offers something that is important based on consumer needs. The AMD A8-7670K “Kaveri” with Radeon R7 Graphics is an excellent performer in the graphics department. It features 10 cores with consist of 4 CPU cores and 6 GPU cores. The Intel Xeon E5-2670 excels in the power arena.  It has 8 cores and features Hyper-Threading technology and Virtualization Technology (VT-x) Which would you choose?

Reilly For The Register-Guard Oct. 1, 2016   Today’s Opinion stories Providing shelter University presidents GOP leaders not on ‘same page’ quite yet Lies in the Guise of News in the Trump Era The Glass Ceiling Holds More Opinion »   Oregon voters have a critical responsibility this election season. So, too, do the federal lawmakers whom we trust to advance our interests nationally. I refer not to the contentious presidential election, but to a pressing pocket­book issue for all Oregonians: the dual imperative of defeating Oregon’s Measure 97, while also urging national comprehensive tax reform that features a lower, universally applied rate across all sectors and avoids excessive taxes on business through new regulations. At the state level, Oregon’s Measure 97 would be a dangerous, business-stifling, job-killing consumption tax (disguised as a gross receipts tax), the effects of which would ripple throughout the state. At the national level, American enterprise currently labors under the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world. That rate, at 39 percent, coupled with onerous regulations represents a massive drain on our economy. America’s corporate tax rate also cripples American businesses as they compete with foreign companies that enjoy a lower rate and a less complicated regulatory environment. This high tax burden affects Nike, Columbia Sportswear and Intel — all iconic Oregon companies — just as it affects the small businesses statewide. As our country’s economy continues to struggle, it is hard to fathom why the Obama administration is contemplating additional tax increases and more regulation. A recent public comment period on the U.S. Treasury’s plan to regulate American business under Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Service code revealed opposition from all stakeholders, including individual taxpayers, small and large businesses and business associations across many sectors. These diverse business associations conclude that the new rules “present a severe impediment to the use of intercompany financing for even normal operations and will significantly increase the cost of capital and limit the amount of capital available to invest in the United States.” As a small-business owner and advocate for Oregon’s small businesses, I can attest to the weight of high taxes and increased government regulations. Ore­gon’s unemployment ranks in the top 10 among all states, and it is 43rd (the eighth worst) on the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council’s annual Small Business Policy Index, which ranks the 50 states “according to various major government-imposed or government-related costs that directly or indirectly affect entrepreneurship and business.” In this climate, how could Oregonians contemplate passing Measure 97, which would represent the highest corporate tax in the state’s history? The state’s own analysis is dire, compelling caution against implementation, predicting “major pitfalls for wages, jobs and consumers’ pocketbooks” as well as “about 38,000 private-sector jobs” lost over five years. Oregon voters must reject this tax increase and hold Sen. Ron Wyden to his stated mission of “updating the nation’s tax system with a focus on growth and fairness, and ensuring fiscal policy supports American jobs.” That means comprehensive tax reform with a lower corporate tax rate that doesn’t discriminate across sectors, and a withdrawal of Treasury’s proposed Section 385 regulations. Only then will Oregonians find our state on the road to economic recovery. T.J. Reilly is president of the Oregon Small Business Association.

What is enabling this transformation? RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Agrotech x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Debjani Ghosh Last month, India ranked 66th in the Global Innovation Rankings , an achievement worth noting when you realize that we moved up by 15 ranks from the previous year. A deeper analysis shows amongst middle-income countries, our quality of innovation was placed at number two, just behind China. So what is enabling this transformation in the Indian ecosystem? Digital India - two words that define the vision for our country, is changing the innovation landscape in our country. Through successful public private collaborations, we have embarked on a journey to establish a local, sustainable innovation ecosystem that is challenging India's challenges. Localized solutions to local problems A steady community of Indian innovators has emerged to accelerate innovation and entrepreneurship in the country, as they take their solutions from mind-to-market. This is a paradigm shift from the beginning of India's start-up gold rush almost a decade ago, when the local start-up ecosystem followed an import-oriented model, where international businesses entered the Indian market by customizing their services for local consumers, such as Uber accepting cash-on-delivery exclusively in India. Now, it is the Indian citizens who are finding localized solutions to local problems. These home-bred thinkers are best suited to develop solutions that address the pressing needs of our population because they see reality at the grassroots level. As India heralds a new era of thinking globally and acting globally, it recognizes that issues such as poverty, health, agriculture, urbanization, sanitation, and climate change are global in nature, but both their challenges and consequences have local effects. Rather than adopting a one-fits-all approach, Indian innovators are using their experience and perspective to understand the niches of the market to develop solutions from the bottom up. Take the example of Jayalaxmi Agrotech, one of the top three winners of last year's Intel & DST Innovate for Digital India Challenge. This end-to-end solution, developed by entrepreneurs who came from farming families, can be accessed even without the internet and delivers information about 20 crops in regional languages and audio-visual content, for the benefit of uneducated farmers. The data is delivered through a local server (Agripole), and the solution is currently being used by 7400 villages, downloaded via 300 Agripoles; till date. It has reduced input costs by 14% and increasing profitability by 17%. And this is the type of impact we must see in sectors such as healthcare, and financial services, amongst others. Doing well? To make innovation accessible and thorough, the Indian government is working with the private player ecosystem to reach out to not just for entrepreneurs in big cities, but also to students across age groups and states. For instance, NITI Aayog, under the Atal Innovation Mission, is setting up 500 Atal Tinkering Laboratories that will provide access to hands-on experience with chips, boards, robots, and machines via school labs, to the young minds. With similar initiatives at the college and PhD level, and beyond, we can be certain of increased enthusiasm by local makers to invent solutions that solve everyday problems faced by our citizens. These programs are in fact creating a unique blend of social entrepreneurship and innovation opportunities in India's non-urban towns. Clearly, India is re-engineering its growth curve by incorporating innovation as a critical factor to establish itself as a self-sufficient, knowledge economy. It's been a commendable start, but there is much more to achieve. If you look at countries that have successfully built a culture of innovation, two names come to mind - the United States, and Israel. There are several learnings from both, but three that we are doing well and should continue to embrace. First, the role of the government. In both countries, innovation is a top priority, and supported by the right plans, processes and most importantly investment. Digital India is already making this possible through multiple bodies such as the Department of Science and Technology, and the Ministry of Human Resource Development, amongst others. As in the US, these organizations are not just investing in creation of new technologies, but in creating new markets that private sector may be reluctant to enter. Second, getting the right policies in place to encourage more R&D in country is imperative. Innovation has to be driven by start-ups and large companies alike, and this is being made possible in our country through initiatives wherein larger companies are identifying entrepreneurs and start-ups with great ideas, and providing them access to mentors and market access. Finally, a strong industry-academia connect, something that Israel excels at. In fact, their government has put up a consortia of university research departments and IT companies to enhance dialogues and connects between academia and industry, which has a strong influence in shaping the research agenda based on real needs and problems. This is perhaps the least developed, and the strongest improvement area for the Indian innovation agenda. In any economy, innovation has a domino effect - it inadvertently fuels further innovation. This can only be ignited with the passion to think the impossible and challenge assumptions. In fact, whoever chooses to tread this path must have the appetite to fail because constant reinvention and mistakes are indispensable to nurture disruptive innovation. Ultimately, innovation is a way to improve our citizens' quality of life, change the way people live, and provide solutions to problems that are a potential hindrance in the social and economic progress of India.

Instead of waxing poetic on her floating dresses, her smart take on the bar jacket, or how damn good Jennifer Lawrence looked in the front row, we’ll cut to the chase: Chiuri triumphed with flying colors. She remained reverent to Monsieur Dior. She worked his love of tarot cards into embroidered finale gowns and breathed modernity into his signature shapes, while still offering plenty of options for modern women (kitten heels and suiting) and young girls in love with the idea of Dior (J’adior chokers). The biggest hit, however, was the T-shirt emblazoned with “We Should All Be Feminists.” Outside of Dior, however, there was plenty else going on in the City of Light. Here, the day’s biggest headlines for reading while you sink into a Friday night of Netflix, chilling, and catching up on Vogue Runway shows.   Expand Christian Dior Spring 2017 Photo: Indigital.tv Maria Grazia Chiuri Makes a Feminist Statement at Dior A lot of designers speak about strong women and femininity as inspirations, but few come at the ideas directly. For her debut at Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri presented a thoroughly feminist collection of fencer’s jackets and tulle skirts—as well as a T-shirt that read “We Should All Be Feminists.” We agree with her sentiment—and with her revival of Dior’s “J’adore Dior” catchphrase, here transformed on heels and straps as “J’adior.”   Expand Loewe Spring 2017 Photo: Alessandro Garofalo / Indigital.tv Loewe Hits the Beach Jonathan Anderson set his Spring 2017 collection for Loewe against screens showing a video of two men at a beach. But it wasn’t a sultry proposition, this being Loewe. Instead, the men spent the video trying to lug oil barrels ashore. Brood over the message of that while you brood over Anderson’s crafty collection of flared linen, cotton, and burlap dresses and skirts that added a cerebral spin to beach dressing.   Expand Chalayan Spring 2017 Photo: Kim Weston Arnold / Indigital.tv Chalayan Blows Up Hussein Chalayan is known for innovation. Today, the designer showed a collection created partially in collaboration with Intel. Five outfits registered the behavior of the models wearing them. Among the emotions on full display were anxiety and fear—and the wearer’s levels were projected the on a wall by the runway. For those looking to hide away from oversharing, Chalayan also sent out inflated puff dresses and tops that seemed to have the opposite intension.   Expand Undercover Spring 2017 Photo: Kim Weston Arnold / Indigital.tv It’s a Picasso Party at Undercover What would the fashion lovechild of Coco Chanel and Pablo Picasso look like? We now know, thanks to Jun Takahashi’s Spring 2017 Undercover collection. The show started out with Coco-esque boater hats and Breton stripes and ended with violin F hole markings in harlequin colors. In between there were trompe l’oeil saxophones, slouchy cargo pants, and cherry red espadrilles—all essentials for an arty lady en route from Rue Cambon to the Cote d’Azur.   Expand Alexandre Vauthier Spring 2017 Photo: Courtesy of David Bellemere The ’80s Are Officially Back at Ungaro and Alexandre Vauthier Glamour girls rejoice! Alexandre Vauthier and Emanuel Ungaro are bringing the ’80s back full throttle with their reworked takes on Reagan-era style. At the former, Vauthier softened his broad shouldered jackets and shrunk his tuxedo-inspired minidresses, turning model Taylor Hill into a modern-day Cindy Crawford. (Kaia Gerber and her generation will be glad to see Vauthier also offering logo waistband underwear and sheer tops.) At Ungaro, designer Fausto Puglisi turned to the dramatic ruffles of the ’80s for inspiration, sending out models in pastel colors and voluminous shapes. No Crawford vamping there: Puglisi’s minis are more for a contemporary Sloane Ranger on a night out.   Expand Photographed by Phil Oh Photographed by Phil Oh The Chicest Woman in Paris is in Reeboks and Jeans Sometimes you can’t beat the classics. The proof is in this understated yet oh-so-effective outfit spotted by Phil Oh at Paris Fashion Week. This woman—in medium wash jeans, white Reebok sneakers, and an undone white button-down—had that French je ne sais quoi down pat. See more of her similarly well-clad peers in our street style slideshow here.   Expand Photo: Getty Images Photo: Getty Images Balmain Parties All Night Long Take Olivier Rousteing, Kim Kardashian West, and a bevy of models clad in Balmain’s glittering frocks and you have the perfect recipe for an all-night rager.

Citing unnamed sources familiar with discussions, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the two companies are in discussions. A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on speculation. NXP, based in The Netherlands, could not be reached for comment. If it happened, the deal would be by far the largest ever for Qualcomm, potentially transforming the company from a mobile chip maker and intellectual property provider to a broad-based semiconductor firm with a slew of products in automotive electronics, Internet of Things, secure payments and other markets. It also could be a tricky integration, merging the cultures of a high-profile Southern California smartphone chip company with a European firm that supplies technology that's not often in the public eye. "This would vault Qualcomm into so many markets, and from a product portfolio standpoint, I think the two companies would be just an awesome match," said Jim McGregor, head of Tirias Research, a technology consulting firm. "But I would be concerned about the culture. These are two drastically different cultures.". Such a deal could return Qualcomm to revenue and earnings growth, however. After three years of fast growth from its lead in 4G LTE technology, Qualcomm has struggled to boost its financial results in the past year or so amid slowing smartphone sales and increased competition in mobile chips. Last year, Qualcomm's revenue fell about 4 percent from 2014 to $25.3 billion. The company is expecting flat results this year. While Qualcomm has been pushing mobile technology into wearables, drones, mobile health, automotive connectivity and other markets besides handsets, these moves have not yet been enough to make up for slowing smartphone growth. "Cellphones have peaked," said Will Strauss, head of industry research firm Forward Concepts. "It's just like Intel has found out the personal computer market. It is not growing anymore because we all have one and last year's model works as good as this year's model, and the same thing is happening with smartphones." Strauss called the potential deal "a surprising move simply because it is a different path than Qualcomm has been on in the past. But certainly I think NXP, if the financing works out, would be a good acquisition for Qualcomm." NXP is among the world's top 10 semiconductor companies, with an estimated $10 billion revenue including its recent acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor. It supplies many chips used in cars, ranging from motor controls for such things as power windows to on-board entertainment systems. It is the world's largest supplier of automotive electronics. NXP also makes Near Field Communication chips for mobile payments, secure payment semiconductors used in smart-chip bank cards and point of sale products, as well as network communications infrastructure chips and radio frequency semiconductors for mobile devices. It also sells sensor chips and range of industrial mirco-controllers. "NXP is probably one of the best positioned semiconductor companies on the planet right now because of their size, their product breath and the fact that they are in key areas that are growing" said McGregor of Tirias Research. "From the Internet of Things to being a leader in automotive to being a leader in security to being a leader in digital networking, they are in a lot of key growth markets." Last year, NXP kicked off what turned out to be a wave of consolidation in the semiconductor industry when it paid nearly $12 billion deal to buy Freescale, which is based in Austin, Texas. Intel followed with a $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, and Avago jumped in with a $37 billion deal for Broadcom. Qualcomm stayed on the sidelines, with Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf concentrating on trimming costs, including cutting an estimated 4,000 jobs globally. But Qualcomm did hire former Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff last year as an executive vice president of strategy and acquisitions -- signaling that it would consider buyouts as a way to return to growth. Because NXP is based in Europe, Qualcomm could use its $29 billion war chest of offshore cash to finance the purchase, said Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon. Like other global companies, Qualcomm keeps a stockpile of cash offshore to avoid the higher U.S. taxes. In addition to pushing Qualcomm into other markets, it also would be a big enough acquisition to boost Qualcomm's bottom line. Rasgon estimates it would boost Qualcomm's earnings 20 percent to 30 percent. "Given Qualcomm's size there are actually few acquisitions candidates that are big enough to move the needle and that also make sense, at least superficially, from a strategic point of view," said Rasgon. "NXP appears to be one of these." Analysts noted that the two companies are very different in terms of markets, product lifecycles, profit margins, customers and manufacturing strategy. NXP owns semiconductor manufacturing plants, for example, where Qualcomm hires other companies to make the chips that it designs. Shares of both companies jumped on the news of a potential deal. Qualcomm's stock gained 6 percent to $67.47, while NXP's shares surged nearly 17 percent to $96.12 on the Nasdaq.

(WTNH) — November 22, 2014. 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot by an officer in Cleveland, Ohio while carrying a toy gun. He died the next day. Now, New Haven police are calling on parents to due their part to prevent a similar situation from happening in the city. “I can tell you right now, if either of these was pointed towards me by a bad guy I would do what I can to protect my life,” said Officer David Hartman. At a press conference on Friday afternoon Hartman held up two similar looking rifles. One, an assault weapon used by police. The other, a paintball gun seized during a recent attack. Both look strikingly similar. “These are weapons. They’re considered weapons. The incidents we’ve had, we’re gonna go back and do arrest warrants for the people. Any further incidents, they’ll be prosecuted,” said Sergeant Karl Jacobson, head of the Criminal Intel Unit with New Haven Police. Officers say many of the paintball and BB gun fights happening in the city are part of turf wars between gangs. Last night a 10 year old girl was shot in the head by a paintball gun in Newhallville. This morning another person was hit by a BB gun in Fair Haven. In all about 12 calls came into New Haven Police in the last week alone for similar situations. “We had another scenario where they were on a major roadway in New Haven firing back and forth at each other in stolen cars. It was almost a typical drive by shooting scenario but they were using paint-balls instead,” said Sgt. Jacobson. Police say the calls are coming in from alarmed residents who believe the guns being used are real. Officers say the end result could be tragic. “Police officers arriving at the scene of what is being reported as a gun battle and ending up with teenagers and children shot dead because they were involved in what they thought is some type of game,” said Officer Hartman. Police are urging parents to know what your kids are up to and to tell them to put their guns down. “You need to be involved. These are your kids that are getting into these battles and you have a responsibility to keep your children from harm,” said Hartman.

Richard Trapunski - Sep 30, 2016 share 0 tweet 8 stumble 287 reddit 0 post pin it Tagged: Amy Schumer Drake Jason Aldean Justin Bieber Justin Timberlake Katy Perry Ke$ha Lady Gaga Miley Cyrus Rihanna Selena Gomez Will Smith The internet age has given us access to a whole host of new data to determine the popularity of musicians and celebrities, from YouTube views to Spotify streams. And you'd better believe Drake and Katy Perry are keeping track of their Twitter and Instagram follows. But there's another way of measuring the heat of a public figure: how likely they are to give you a virus. Intel Security just released its 10th annual McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, which tracks which celebrities are the most dangerous to search. Amy Schumer comes first, while musicians like Justin Bieber, Rihanna and Miley Cyrus fill out the list. Here's the whole top 10, in handy infographic form: It's clearly promoting McAfee's protection software, but it's still very handy for people who spend their days googling celebrities, whether they're music writers looking for interesting news (hi), mouthbreathers downloading the latest Nerdist podcast, illegal music and comedy streamers, or, like, anyone under 15. Ignoring the fact that the findings manage to qualify Amy Schumer as a "female comedian" at every single mention of her name, there are some interesting findings here: If you google "Amy Schumer Torrent," for instance, you have a 33% chance of hitting a malicious website. Search Justin Bieber and you've got a 15% chance of hitting trouble (viruses, malware, credit card scams, etc). Beyond the top 10, people searching late night hosts are likely to get hit (how else are you gonna know what dumb game Jimmy Fallon played with the next dangerous politician?), and those searching the hosts of The Voice. There are also a lot of holdouts from streaming subscriptions, apparently, trying to access free music from artists like Drake (No. 13), Katy Perry (No. 14), Jason Aldean (No. 16), Justin Timberlake (No. 17), and Lady Gaga (No. 19). So next time you want to hear the latest Drake & Rihanna rumours, don't try to google it. Just ask Dennis Graham instead: Read the whole study here.

By Todd Haselton | September 30, 2016 Front Page /Virtual Reality/Featured/Gallery By Todd Haselton | September 30, 2016 Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Share Universal Orlando recently offered TechnoBuffalo a chance to fly down to Florida to check out its new horror/virtual reality experience called “The Repository.” It’s this year’s addition to Universal’s annual “Halloween Horror Nights” and offers a new spin on theme-park horror adventures. Instead of walking through a haunted house – don’t worry, you’ll experience some of that, too – you’re taken to another world through the use of virtual reality. The experience isn’t cheap – it’s $49.99 plus tax on top of your Halloween Horror Nights admission, but it’s fascinating and fun. I don’t want to give away too many spoilers, so I’ll tell you the backstory and a bit of my experience with the event, and let you enjoy the rest yourself. The Repository The Repository is supposed to be an ancient warehouse built in 1775 for the Scottish army. Since then, it’s been used as a space for collecting haunted artifacts, the sorts of things you hear about in folklore. The artifacts include anything haunted, maybe a bell that rings at night when everyone is upstairs sleeping, or a doll that mysteriously makes its way to different rooms around the house. It’s these sorts of scary objects that have been collected and exist here in The Repository, giving the space some sort of evil power and aura. Somewhere along the line, between the armory and a fire in 1795, rumors of a “Grimslew Curse” have swirled. Your job is to find out if that curse is real and, if so, if you and four of your comrades can break it. “We really wanted to play with a story about artifacts and hauntings,” senior director of art and design at Universal, TJ Mannarino, explained. “Everyone has something that they know that’s haunted. It’s surprising how much people segment their horror, ghost stories hits a chord with everybody. Super-natural paranormal is interesting because it starts to play with the psychological aspects.” You’ll enter into The Repository with the goal of finding a “key.” It’s up to you to decide what that key is and, along the way, you’ll meet a crazy keeper of the relics, a rude scientist, several angry army personnel, a mad key-keeper and more. When it’s time, you’ll travel through a portal to the other world, where you’ll work with certain tools to understand the afterlife and try to get a better understanding of the aforementioned “Grimslew Curse.” A VR Portal This “portal” is where virtual reality comes into play. Characters within the warehouse will help you apply a virtual reality headset after which you’ll explore a burning library, stand atop a pillar hundreds of feet in the air above the ocean and walk in a graveyard. The effects will exhilarate a first-time VR user, but may not be as exciting to someone who has used an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. You will, at the very least, feel transported from this world into another. Mannarino told me Universal uses immersion techniques it employs in other attractions. Actors may touch you at certain aspects and effects like blowing air will help make you feel like you’ve visited somewhere else. You’ll even see other folks in your group while in the virtual realm, each one represented as a glowing mask. While you’ll travel during this experience, in reality you’ve never left the room where you first donned the VR headset. A lot will go on during the roughly 30-minute adventure, so be sure to pay attention. You’ll need to pick up on clues throughout the experience if you want to “win” at the end. I won’t reveal what happens, that’s for you to find out on your own tour through The Repository. My thoughts I found the entire experience very fascinating. Universal used detailed sets, characters and props that it has employed in other experiences, but decided to get its feet wet with advanced technology, too. Mannarino and his team wouldn’t comment on whether or not this is something we’ll see used in more rides that have a permanent position at the park, but said it’s exploring those sorts of options, including looking at other new technologies like augmented reality, and that virtual reality is going to play a huge role in entertainment moving forward. Park-goers and fear-seekers will really enjoy seeing the forefront of where VR can play a role inside amusement parks. Be sure to check out The Repository if you’re heading to Orlando between now and Oct. 31. Disclosure: Universal paid for my flight to Universal Orlando and a night in a hotel so that we could experience The Repository before it opened to the public.

That's where Sato Global Solutions, the new software division of Japan-based Sato Holdings, is working on ways to make shopping at brick-and-mortar retailers "fun" again by providing the interactivity of online and other new benefits. Sato, which opened its headquarters in Fort Lauderdale in May 2015, has joined an alliance formed earlier this year by communications company BT (British Telecom) Americas in Dallas. Together, the companies and their partners are developing technology that tracks inventory, maximizes performance of sales associates and provides more personal service for customers. Consider fitting rooms equipped with wall-mounted touch screens — allowing consumers to request that a different size or color be brought by a sales associate, or giving them recommendations on which shirts in inventory could match the jeans or skirts they're trying on. "Think about all the things you do online — you compare products, you get recommendations. We want to do that and more in a store," said Tom Wolf, vice president of global retail and consumer goods for BT Americas.

One of the reasons for the decline in manual transimissions is that cars with automatic transmissions now get better gas mileage than the manuals. Wolf said the alliance plans to "duplicate anything you can do online, and make [a store] more entertaining and just as personalized." Wolf said Sato was selected as an alliance partner because of its global presence and software development. "Sato has a great vision," Wolf said. With about 50 software developers and other workers at Sato's headquarters, employment is expected to continue increasing as it develops software for the alliance. "We're aiming to deploy the first completed prototype within a few months. We're going through the pilot stage," said Goro Yumiba, executive head of the Japanese company's North American operations, including Sato Global Solutions in Fort Lauderdale, which provides data capture and analytics software for hospitals, retailers and other customers. Nexgen Packaging tag on a piece of clothing, which is used to track retail inventory. Sato hopes to deploy the first alliance product prototype in 2017, Yumiba said. During a recent visit to Sato, BT's vice president of business development, Keith Sherry, explained that the alliance brings together complementary technologies. Dubbed the Acuitas (Latin for "insight") Digital Alliance, it involves five companies: BT, which is providing integration and customer service; Intel, the hardware; Sato, the software; RetailNext, video analytics; and Nexgen Packaging, the RFID, or radio frequency identification. "There's an increasing need to get better consumer engagements and bridge the gap between the online experience with consumer engagement within the store," Sherry said. RFID was first used in manufacturing and distribution centers, but now the technology is being deployed to track individual items within a store. In building its system, Acuitas also is employing cameras, Wi-Fi and digital signage to increase interaction between customers and retailer at the store. Sherry said he couldn't reveal which retailers have signed on to buy the Acuitas system, only that they are "major clothing and cosmetics retailers," many of whom operate in South Florida. With Amazon and other e-retailers continuing to gain market share, traditional retailers invested in brick-and-mortar locations continue to struggle. In August, Macy's announced it would close 100 stores, or 15 percent of its stores nationwide. Earlier this year, Walmart announced plans to shut down 269 stores this year. Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy in March, resulting in closures of all its 450 stores. And retailers Target, JC Penney, Kmart, Sears and Kohl's also have been streamlining store locations. BT executives say brick-and-mortar stores sales still are the bulk of the market. As of the second quarter of 2016, about 8.1 percent of total sales came from e-commerce, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The remainder, nearly 92 percent, came from stores. Yet online sales continue to grow. During the last holiday season — the biggest sales period of the year for retailers — online sales increased 20 percent, according to 2015 data by MasterCard SpendingPulse, which studies purchases made with credit cards, cash and checks. While it was a good year for holiday sales, total retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, rose only 7.9 percent. Bernie Saenz, director of projects for Sato, recently demonstrated his company's new Smart Fitting app to retail executives in a store showroom set up at the headquarters. Visiting retailers included Perry Ellis, Art of Shaving and Lamps Plus,  according to Sato. In addition to the fitting room touch screens helping consumers with clothing suggestions and requests, the technology could be used to keep track of store employees — how many are in the fitting room helping customers, at the sales counter, or on break, Saenz said. He said it could also help with an industry-wide problem: the misplaced store item. "You're missing an opportunity to sell an item because it wasn't where it was supposed to be," Saenz told the retailers. With a radio frequency tag on each item, store employees can receive an alert when the item is discarded by the shopper and lands on the wrong sales rack. Eventually, Acuitas plans to leverage customer loyalty programs through its technology, so when customers visit a store, they can be addressed by name and be presented clothing and other items tailored to them. BT executives said through the alliance's technology, retailers could gather specific information about customers and inventory. They could see which item is being left in the dressing room, instead of being purchased, for example, indicating a problem with the outfit. "We're giving information to the retailer they've never had before," BT's Sherry said. "Now we're getting into predictability on things that are trending and things you should be manufacturing." Sherry said reinventing the store experience "is getting back to enjoying shopping." While online shopping can be convenient, he said, "what you don't get from the online experience is that immediate satisfaction of, 'I just bought something.'

Reports surrounding the notebook have started to increase as September ends. While we’ve heard some analysts comment that a late September launch might be on the cards, it doesn’t look to be that way. Now, more sources have started to speculate on an October launch for the notebooks. In fact, some have gone as far as to give a precise launch date. Take a look below to find out more. Apple To Launch MacBook Pro In Late October Claim Multiple Sources Apple’s launch of the MacBook has been in the rumor mill for quite a while. The biggest question surrounding this year’s notebook launches from Cupertino is whether we’ll get to see Intel’s Kaby Lake on board. Current word on the street doesn’t make it out to be that way. We’re hearing more about AMD and Polaris’ potential presence on Apple’s product portfolio. Now, multiple sources claim to be in the know-how of the MacBook Pro’s launch date. Both of them believe that the notebook will be launched in late October. It’s believed that Apple’s working on an aggressive schedule. The company’s current focus on macOS 10.12.1 is geared towards catering to hardware upgrades for the lineup. To that end, the MacBook Pro is expected to feature several interesting upgrades this year. Advertisement TheApplePost is also reporting a potential launch date for the MacBook Pro. According to their sources, Apple will launch the notebooks on October 24th. This marks a month until the notebooks are finally unveiled by Cupertino. Furthermore, it’s also believed that Cupertino will seed one more beta version of macOS 10.12.1 to developers and public next week. There’s little information on Cupertino’s plans for the MacBook Air, with some analysts claiming that the gadget will also see an upgrade. The MacBook Pro is expected to feature several upgrades on board. For starters, it’s rumored with an OLED touch bar. This will replace the top function key bar on the notebook, and make for much more interactive methods of input. Secondly, Touch ID is also expected to finally make it on the MacBook Pro. This will also include Apple Pay support as users will get to authenticate their transactions directly from their MacBooks. Thoughts?

It recently updated its ThinkPad X1 Yoga with an excellent 2560x1440 OLED panel, for example, making it even more attractive to executives. But the company hasn’t forgotten users who dig more utilitarian builds, and don't need the latest bells and whistles. The ThinkPad X260 is all about functionality, portability, and quality. It is a no-nonsense road warrior. At about $765, the ThinkPad X260 has the lowest starting price of any laptop in Lenovo’s ThinkPad X ultrabook series. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon starts at $1,142 and features a very sleek, carbon-fiber reinforced body, along with high-resolution display options and other mouth-watering tech. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga (starting at $1,394.10) packs high-end hardware into the multi-mode chassis that has made Lenovo’s Yoga notebooks famous. As the shared ‘X1’ in their names implies, these two notebooks are more similar to each other than to the somewhat-blocky, enterprise-friendly ThinkPad X260, but there’s no doubt that X260 belongs in Lenovo’s ultraportable, high-quality X series. Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Specifications & Features Processor Intel Core i5-6300U Dual-Core 2.4GHz (Max 3GHz) OS Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Display 12.5-inch FHD IPS (1920x1080) 300 nits Non-Touch Graphics Intel HD Graphics 520 Storage 256GB SSD Opal 2 Memory 8GB DDR4-2133 Audio Dolby Advanced Audio v2 Camera 720p HD Camera Networking LAN, Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC 8260 (2x2), BT 4.1 Ports: Left USB 3.0 x2, Mini DisplayPort, HDMI Port, Power Port Ports: Right Headphone/Mic jack, USB 3.0 Port, SIM Slot, SD Card Reader, Ethernet Port, Lock Slot Keyboard Island-Style, Backlight Option Battery 3-Cell 23.2Wh Li-Ion Battery, 6-Cell Li-Ion Rear Battery Upgrade, Mobile Broadband Support, Smart Card Reader Support Extras Fingerprint Reader, TrackPoint, 6-Cell Li-Ion Rear Battery Upgrade, Mobile Broadband Support, Smart Card Reader Support Weight 2.9 Pounds Dimensions 12.03 x 8.21 x 0.8 Inches Warranty 1-Year Depot Or Carry-In Price $1,250.10 As Configured - Find Them At Amazon The ThinkPad X260 has a 12.5-inch display, which is the smallest panel in the X series. (The ThinkPad X1 Carbon and ThinkPad X1 Yoga have 14-inch displays.) The display on the base model is an uninspiring 1366x768, but you can bump that to a 1920x1080 IPS display when customizing your ultrabook before purchase. Touch screens aren’t available for the ThinkPad X260 line, however. Available processors range from an Intel Core i3-6100U to a Core i7-6600U. Our system features the Core i5-6300U, which makes for a nice performance/price balance in this notebook. The CPU has a 2.4GHz base clock speed and can Turbo up to 3GHz. The Intel HD Graphics 520 engine built-into Skylake is standard on the ThinkPad X260 series, but the line has multiple memory options, up to 18GB. Our test system arrived with 8GB of DDR4-2133 memory. Lenovo is touting the ThinkPad X260 as enterprise-ready, so it’s no surprise that the notebook has a full complement of security features, including a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip. Lenovo also opted for its ThinkPad 256GB OPAL2.0 SSD over more pedestrian storage options to provide OPAL 2.0 and IEEE 1667 support. You can add the optional security features when you configure your notebook online. The ThinkPad X260 equips a Smart Card reader for an additional $10 and can also include a fingerprint reader. As for networking, the ThinkPad X260 is ready for anything. It features an Ethernet port, which is becoming an uncommon sight on ultra-portable notebooks these days, along with an Intel Dual-Band Wireless-AC (2x2) 8260 WiFi controller. Wireless-AC is an important feature for road warriors, who move from one hotspot to the next. Bluetooth is also onboard for peripherals. Of course, one of the most important considerations for business travelers is battery life, and Lenovo aims high here, stocking the ThinkPad X260 with two 3-cell, 23.2Wh batteries. One is in the front of the laptop and the other, removable battery sits at the back. As you’ll see in our performance analysis, we tested the ThinkPad X260 with both its standard battery set and the 72Wh optional rear battery. Because the notebook has two batteries, the rear battery is hot-swappable: You can pop it out and replace it with a backup battery without powering off the laptop. The notebooks’ support for massively extending its battery life is clearly going to be a chief selling point for many business users. But before we dig into how the notebook (and its batteries) perform, let’s take a look at its design. Great battery life won’t matter much if you don’t like the notebook… NEXT PAGE Article Index:    Introducing the Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Design and Build Quality Lenovo ThinkPad X260 ATTO Disk, SunSpider And Cinebench Performance Lenovo ThinkPad X260 PCMark 8, 3DMark, Far Cry 2 Performance Lenovo ThinkPad X260 Battery Life And Acoustics Performance Summary And Final Analysis Tags:  Intel, Lenovo, ThinkPad, Core i5, x260 Image gallery Related content Alienware 13 R3 Review: OLED, GeForce 10 Pop And Performance WD My Passport Wireless Pro Review: Portable Storage For Mobile Devices Netgear Orbi AC3000 Mesh WiFi System Review Adventures With Dell's Rugged PC Line-Up Moto Z Play Review: 8-Cores And Insane Battery Life Comments Show comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Follow Us: Twitter Facebook RSS Email YouTube AppStore Google+ 85K 9K 4K 27K CONVERSATIONS Chrome Crushing It In The Browser Wars...45 Alienware 13 R3 Review: OLED, GeForce 10...13 Google DeepMind AI's Ability To Discern...9 Hell Freezes Over As Microsoft Releases...8 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Allegedly...7 Kaspersky Calls Out Microsoft For...5 Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar...5 FEATURED Huawei Honor 8 Review: A Stylish,...

Ratan Tata. AFP "Hearty congratulations to India's armed forces and Intel agencies for successful surgical retaliatory action against Pak terrorist camps," Tata said in a tweet. Yesterday, India Inc had rallied behind the Army's move to conduct surgical strikes across the Line of Control and saying it was time to act tough while ruling out any negative impact on the country's economy and trade. "Our civil n (sic) decent response in the past hasn't been met with reciprocity so it's time to act tough," Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw tweeted. Recalling an earlier tweet in which he had said "I trust our army. They know how to pursue & retaliate" in the wake of the Uri attack, industrialist Anand Mahindra said: "I don't need to add anything more today..." The action by the Army came 11 days after the attack by Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM on an Indian army camp in Uri in Kashmir. Hearty congratulations to India's armed forces and Intel agencies for successful surgical retaliatory action against Pak terrorist camps. — Ratan N.

Ok, got it TAGS Technology Car makers and telco giants join forces for Car-to-X communication tech. 30 September 2016 by Danny Kwan Audi AG, BMW Group, and Daimler AG, together with telecommunications giants develop the future of car communications German premium car makers form 5G Automotive Association with telecommunication giants to spearhead implementation of ‘Car-to-X’ communications technology. Although technological progress might appear as an individual achievement, bringing autonomous mobility to a broader and widespread application would require a team effort. This is why Audi AG, BMW Group, and Daimler AG, together with telecommunications giants, Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, and Qualcomm have come together to form what is known as the ‘5G Automotive Association’. The association’s end goal is to accelerate the commercial availability and global market penetration of ‘Car-to-X’ communications technology. That being said, the association will be involved in developing, testing and promoting communication solutions for cars and infrastructure. This also includes supporting the standardisation of the technology, engage regulatory bodies, acquire certification, and undergo approval processes, while addressing technical challenges such as security, privacy, and cloud computing distribution. On top of that the association also plans to run joint innovation and development projects, with large scale pilot programmes and trial deployments. With the emergence of 5G mobile networks, automakers are seeing the potential to deliver car-to-everything communications technology, or otherwise known as ‘Car-to-X’. This technology also allows cars to hook up to infrastructures to find empty parking spaces. As highlighted by Audi’s ‘swarm intelligence’, this technology has the capability of allowing the cars themselves to transmit information on traffic hazards or changes in the road conditions between one another. This technology also allows cars to hook up to infrastructures to find empty parking spaces or even time their approach to traffic lights as to arrive just as the lights turn green. Going in line with the shift towards the ‘Internet of Things’, the technology has the capability of greatly improving safety and reduce or eliminate traffic congestion, as well as enabling cars to integrate themselves into a city’s infrastructure. The widespread integration of such technology would allow autonomous vehicles to see far beyond the peripheral vision of their onboard sensors and cameras.  Effectively the system could enable such cars to steer clear of hazards, congested roads, and respond quickly to changing traffic speeds and conditions that are far beyond its vicinity. While ‘Car-to-X’ technology has been around for years, it has never been rolled out to mainstream applications due to issues such as standardisation, and also the technical challenge of achieving the data transfer loads required. Back in 2011 Continental AG demonstrated the potential of their ‘Car-to-X’ technology, and while the hardware was available to make all this possible back then, its developers admit that the biggest hurdle to overcome is data transfer. According to their estimates the amount of data transmitted between one car to the other or to another infrastructure was measured in megabytes. When combined with several such vehicles in the same area, the transfer loads could easily go into gigabytes. The association believes that these next-generation telecommunications networks are able to handle much more data volume, with significantly reduced latency issues, and thus are able to transmit data reliably between sources and receivers.  Despite its association to the big three German premium brands, the 5G Automotive Association says that their doors are open for other carmakers to join their programme. For now the association will more likely focus on developing the technology for the European market, though should their efforts prove successful, you can expect the standards and technology developed from this association to spread to other markets rather quickly. Is this alliance the key to mainstream ‘Car-to-X’ tech? Tell us what you think in the comments below.

The British government is trying to tackle the problem with publicity. Starting in 2018, it will require all companies with more than 250 employees to publish information about average and median pay differences as well as the number of male and female employees in each salary quartile. But sunlight may not be enough to force change. As a young reporter, I worked for the Washington Post Company, which, years earlier, had been sued for gender discrimination by some of its female employees. As part of the settlement, the company was required to disclose publicly the pay breakdown by gender for various categories of newsroom job. Each time, the gaps were visible and significant. By now, one hopes the company is doing much better. Back then, the disclosures were simply a depressing reminder of how far women still had to go. In the US, President Barack Obama has tried to put the weight of the White House behind the issue. In June, he convened a summit on the state of American women and asked companies to sign an equal pay pledge promising to analyse their hiring, promotion and pay practices annually with the aim of eliminating inequality. President Obama followed up with a second event in August to announce that a total of 57 groups — ranging from consulting firms and tech giants to airlines and retailers — had signed up. One of them, Intel, has already been working on such imbalances for years. The technology group tracks base pay and bonus targets by gender, ethnicity, job classification and location. Since 2009, it has been running company-wide statistical analyses to spot differences that cannot be explained by performance, education, length of service or other legitimate factors. If follow-up interviews fail to turn up a qualitative reason for the gap, the company boosts the person’s pay. Related article Close the gender gap to boost output Narrowing the gender divide offers economic gains as well as societal benefits This year, Intel announced that it had reached full gender pay parity and 99 per cent parity for under-represented minorities, which it defines as people who are black, Hispanic or Native American. It is easy to be cynical about this achievement — statistics can easily be manipulated when many factors affect pay, and gender comparisons are especially complicated when men and women do different jobs. Intel, like many Silicon Valley companies, has a serious shortage of women — just 25 per cent of its workforce is female, and they are far more prevalent in its “non-technical divisions”. Other companies, in an effort to prove that their equality pledges are not just empty words, have gone even further and are seeking outside validation. Related article How women can demand a higher salary Negotiation trainer Giuseppe Conti offers tips on handling pay talks All of them should be applauded for trying to live up to their promises. Not only is it the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. Studies by the advocacy group Catalyst and the consultancy McKinsey suggest that high levels of female participation at board level are correlated with better financial results, as measured by return on capital and return on equity. Lower down in the organisation, the same logic applies. At a time when many companies are struggling to retain mid-career women, a sense that the company plays fair will help keep good people around. As Intel spokeswoman Ellen Healy explains: “It’s in our interest to retain employees and hire at competitive rates. People who feel they aren’t compensated fairly will go elsewhere.” I certainly did.

While October can still be jammed with volatility, November through January is often a good period to be long stocks, and this year technology looks like a good sector to overweight for the stretch run. The heavily tech-weighted Nasdaq has had a nice bounce off the late June Brexit lows and looks to be breaking out to new highs. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe for tech stocks that are rated Buy at the firm and pay a solid dividend, and ones that could be ready to report solid third-quarter results too. We found four that look outstanding for long-term growth portfolios. Applied Materials This semiconductor capital equipment leader has moved up nicely this year after underperforming. Applied Materials Inc. (NASDAQ: AMAT) is the global leader in precision materials engineering solutions for the semiconductor, flat panel display and solar photovoltaic industries. Applied Material’s technologies help make innovations like smartphones, flat screen TVs and solar panels more affordable and accessible to consumers and businesses around the world. The analysts are very positive on the stock and see Applied Materials benefiting not only the semiconductor side of the business, but also from larger, higher resolution and flexible screens on the display side of the business. Despite reporting solid first-quarter earnings that were above consensus, and guidance that was in line with expectations, the stock is still very reasonably priced. It may very well be one of the best technology values available for investors today. Some Wall Street analysts see continued FinFET capacity expansion (10nm/14nm/16nm) and transition to 3D NAND, with DRAM spending remaining strong next year. Earlier this year the company announced a new $2 billion share buyback program, which comes on the heels of a recently completed $3 billion program. Merrill Lynch sees the purchase plan as being approximately 8% accretive to earnings. Shareholders receive a 1.35% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $35. The Wall Street consensus target is at $33.50. Shares ended Friday at $29.66. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations, a trend the analyst thinks reverses in the fourth quarter and 2017. In addition, a new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality, and a consistent shift away for reliance on chips for personal computers, keeps the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.8% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $45 price target, while the consensus target is $40.38. The shares closed Friday at $37.19.

You show up, people dress you up, they put your makeup on, they do your hair, and all you have to do is walk down a runway a couple of times, get your photo taken, and that’s done. However for those in the industry, you guys probably know it isn’t as easy as it seems. Granted a lot of models do make it look easy, but in reality, many could also be stressing out pretty badly. During the Paris Fashion Week, Intel decided to merge tech and fashion together by creating a wearable that will actually allow audience members to see the stress levels and the state of mind of a model as he/she walks down the runway. These wearables come in the form of smart glasses and belts. The glasses will have capacity EEG electrodes built into them that will read the wearer’s brainwaves, while the nose bridge will house an optical heart rate sensor and a microphone. The information gathered will be processed by the onboard Curie module and then sent to the 3D printed belt around the waist of the wearer. The belt also features a pico projector that can cast an image and animations onto a surface to show real-time stress levels. Now we’re not sure if there ever will come a time when such a wearable will be required in real-life, but we guess if anything it does show off the ways fashion and tech can work together.

Read today's eNewspaper Health Science & Research Upper-limb amputee at Johns Hopkins builds computer controller device for feet Developing controller for feet A controller developed by a Johns Hopkins student allows upper body amputees and others with limited upper body mobility to play video games with their feet. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) A controller developed by a Johns Hopkins student allows upper body amputees and others with limited upper body mobility to play video games with their feet. (Amy Davis, Baltimore Sun video) Carrie WellsContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun A Johns Hopkins student who lost his arms developed a device to control a computer with feet. Once an avid video gamer, Gyorgy Levay stopped playing when he lost his hands to a meningitis infection six years ago. Manipulating a mouse or a controller without hands or fingers was frustratingly impossible, but the struggles Levay faced sparked an interest in building devices to make life easier for him and other upper-limb amputees. Now a biomedical engineering graduate student at the Johns Hopkins University, he developed a prototype device last year that will enable people to command a computer using their feet instead of their hands. Levay, 28, a Hungarian native who pronounces his first name "George," is on a Fulbright scholarship to develop prosthetic devices at Johns Hopkins. He created his GEAR (Game Enhancing Augmented Reality) device in a biomedical instrumentation class and believes it could have broad appeal even for those who aren't amputees. "Right now basically all control options on computers are for hands," he said. His device "is not only useful for people who lost limbs, it's useful for people who have limited control in their limbs, like people who suffered a stroke or suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome. They can benefit from a method where they use their feet instead of relying so heavily on their hands for the simple control of computers." Gyorgy Levay, a grad student at Johns Hopkins, has created a tool for himself and other amputees who would like to play video games. It allows gamers to use their feet. Earlier this year, the clunky sandal-like device won a $7,500 grand prize in the 2016 Intel-Cornell Cup, in which student inventors are judged on applications of embedded technology, and was a finalist in the 2016 Johns Hopkins Healthcare Design Competition. Levay secured a provisional patent for the device through the university. A user activates the device's four sensors by pressing their feet into the foot bed in various ways. Those sensors, embedded in a silicon and 3-D printed plastic exterior, can be customized to follow any programmed command, but his unit is set up to perform game functions such as crouching, moving forward and backward, and moving left or right.

Since Donald Trump became president-elect, concerns have risen over birth control. Here's some background on IUDs. Besides playing computer games, the device could be customized to work with a computer for any task, such as editing photos. Levay said he doesn't want to create a startup to promote the device, a venture he called "pretty risky." He hopes an established company will buy the device, refine it and put it on the market. He thinks it could appeal particularly to those developing virtual reality devices, which often require hands to simulate walking. "It just gives a whole new layer of functionality to games," he said. "We have our legs and it's not used when we're interfacing with computers." The loss of upper limbs is rare. According to research published in the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in 2008, just 56,000 people are estimated to have lost a hand or an arm in the United States. Of the estimated 2 million people who have lost a limb, finger or toe, about two-thirds lost a lower extremity. A third, or 700,000, were classified as having lost an upper extremity, but most of those people have lost a finger or fingers. The device could be useful for those with spinal cord injuries who have lost dexterity or function in their upper limbs, said Heather Weesner, an occupational therapist at the University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopaedic Institute and a certified hand therapist. Many people who have lost their hands or the use of them are trying to use voice-activated technology to interact with computers, but it can be prohibitively expensive, she said. Prosthetic limbs also can be very expensive and cost as much as $100,000, said Karen Lundquist, a spokeswoman for the Amputee Coalition. Upper-limb prosthetics are trickier to design and can be uncomfortable and difficult to manage, she said. "There's a huge gap in what's available and what's possible," Lundquist said. Some upper-limb amputees have "gotten very life-hack about it," she said, developing unique solutions. A person might attach a cup holder to a prosthetic arm, for instance, she said. The ability to use the internet is crucial for those who have lost limbs, Lundquist said. "To be able to be socially connected to other people with disabilities, it could connect you to the world and give you a lot of work opportunities as well," she said. "You're more likely to not be depressed, you're more likely to be employed." That loss of social connection via the internet isn't something that really affects lower-limb amputees, Weesner said. But for upper-limb amputees, being able to use a computer is often a top priority after figuring out how to dress and bathe. "It really helps the patient's psyche when they can have some of the activities that they used to have," such as video games, she said. "Especially when they're fun." While testing the device, Levay and three nonamputees played the first-person action-adventure game Mirror's Edge and posted video of the game play online, asking viewers to guess which player was using the device. More than 80 percent of people who viewed the videos couldn't identify which player was using the GEAR controller. Such online anonymity could be good for those who have lost their upper limbs, Levay said, so they can temporarily avoid the odd glances from people who are surprised by their appearance. "I walk down the street and people think about what's going on," with his appearance, Levay said. "Without hearing it, you hear it in your mind. It doesn't bother me necessarily, but it can get annoying after some time. But there are people who would rather not go out and socialize … and all that goes away with computer games because no one sees you, so all they're going judge you by is how well you play." Still, Levay said that because he is focused on graduate school and building better prosthetics, he hasn't had much time to actually use the device and enjoy his old hobby. "The motivation was of course to allow me to play, but I haven't had any time to play on this or anything else," Levay said. "I'm happy it's there as a possibility. One day maybe I'll have more time." cwells@baltsun.com Copyright © 2016, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Maryland boy who got double hand transplant can throw a football, write with pencil, do other routine tasks Preliminary licenses to dispense medical marijuana in Maryland will be announced in December Unconventional indoor workouts in the Baltimore area Breaking Sports Maryland Opinion Business Jobs Obits Advertising 64°

Mesa 13.0 Planning For Release At End Of October, Might Include RADV Vulkan Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 30 September 2016 at 06:27 AM EDT. 10 Comments Following the mailing list talk over the past two days about doing the next Mesa release, plans are being discussed for releasing at the end of October and it might have just got a whole lot more exciting. Emil Velikov, Collabora developer and Mesa release manager for the past several release series, has commented on that previously discussed mailing list thread. He mentioned he was secretly waiting in hopes of seeing the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver merged for this next release! He said he'd even be willing to see it merged even if it's "not perfect/feature complete." David Airlie, one of the developers leading RADV, commented that he would be open to merging it but isn't too comfortable that it's not passing all Vulkan conformance tests yet. He commented, "It's probably fine if I just make a big printf on device creation that RADV isn't a conformant vulkan implementation yet. Sorta like what Intel do on the older GPUs. Otherwise I don't think merging it is a big job, it's 30,000 lines of standalone code, I've already merged the prereq patches, and I think any code sharing should happen in tree." So now we are looking at potentially having this RADV open-source driver in mainline Mesa in time for the official release in one month. We'll see what ends up happening! Emil Velikov laid out tentative plans for having the feature freeze and first release candidate on October 7th or the 14th, then having the second release candidate one week later, and then having a third release candidate or final release one week after that. Long story short, we could be seeing this next Mesa release -- with possibly RADV -- around 28 October. For this next's release version number, if past tradition holds it is to be called Mesa 13.0 since OpenGL 4.4 was reached by core Mesa and the Intel driver. Core Mesa also supports OpenGL 4.5 although no hardware driver is officially exposing conformance. However, Intel developer Jason Ekstrand said he'd prefer seeing it version 12.1 rather than 13.0 already. So we'll see how that discussion settles if the Mesa versioning practices will change. That's the latest so far on planning for the next Mesa release.

(Alphabet Inc - Image Courtesy) Shares23 Karrishma Modhy | Sun, 4 Sep 2016-04:30pm , Mumbai , DNA webdesk Google's special event will take place today at San Francisco. Google is gearing up for an exciting event, which is scheduled for today at San Francisco. The company is expected to unveil new smartphones, a smart-home device along with a new virtual reality platform. Though we cannot be sure of what the company will show off, here’s a breakdown of what we can expect from Google. So long, Nexus: Enter ‘Pixel’ Google has left the Nexus brand behind, and will announce a new line up of devices called, Pixel. Two new smartphones are expected to be announced at the event – Pixel and Pixel XL. The phones are supposed to be built by HTC and Huawei. The former will sport a 5-inch display, replacing the LG Nexus 5X while the latter, sports a 5.5-inch display, which will replace the Huawei Nexus 6P, released last year. Rumours suggest the Pixel smartphone line up to include top-notch specifications such as 4GB of RAM, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processors, 12MP cameras along with fast-charging batteries. Both devices will run Android 7.1 Nougat respectively. Along with smartphones, Google could unveil a Huawei-built 7-inch Android tablet. Serial tipster Evan Blass, stated that a Google tablet built by Huawei with 4GB RAM is “on track for release before the end of the year.” Lastly, Google may unveil a new ultra-portable ‘Pixel’ laptop. This device could be based on an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32GB or 128GB of storage and 8GB or 16GB of RAM. It is also slated to have a fingerprint sensor, stereo speakers, quad microphones, a backlit keyboard, and a glass trackpad respectively. Replacing Google Cardboard: Daydream VR Google announced a VR platform in May this year, called Daydream. However, no in-depth details were shared. As the platform has now stepped out of beta, and is open to developers, we can expect a lot more information regarding Daydream VR, which is intended to offer high-quality virtual reality experience. It will replace Google Cardboard. Smart-home gear: Google Home Google Home, which would rival Amazon's Echo, Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple's HomeKit was announced at Google I/O this year. The device will be available with integrated speakers, a microphone and a WiFi router. This would be the company’s first venture into AI-powered smart-home décor. Reports suggest the device is priced at $129 (approximately Rs 8,600). In addition, Google is expected to unveil a ‘companion’ device for Google Home which is a WiFi router. It would retail for at $129 (approximately Rs 8,500) and will link together larger wireless networks. New OS, Andromeda According to the rumour mill, Google will now step into the desktop OS space with Andromeda, a powerhouse combination of Chrome and Android OS. It is named after a stilted combination of Android and Chrome, with a da. The Huawei-made tablet and Pixel 3 laptop may run Andromeda OS. Next version: Google Chromecast Rumoured to be called Chromecast Plus or the Chromecast Ultra, Google’s new digital-media player will include 4K support. It will also allow you to stream Ultra HD content. The device will be much more expensive than the original Chromecast, priced at $69 (approximately Rs 4,600) Karrishma Modhy TOP TOP < Shivaay vs ADHM Poll Results out: Ajay Devgn or Karan Johar - who won?   Comments   Also Read Sci/Tech Online game about lost sea hero helps scientists studying dementia Sci/Tech Chinese makers lead smartphone growth Sci/Tech Tiny band-aid-like device can monitor heart health, recognise speech Sci/Tech Planet heads for hottest year after third-warmest October Sci/Tech Multinational crew blasts off for International Space Station Sci/Tech Stephen Hawking thinks humanity will not survive another 1,000 years on Earth Next Article > Saint Teresa of Calcutta: All you need to know about the nun India fell in love with < Previous ArticleNext Article > Shivaay vs ADHM Poll Results out: Ajay Devgn or Karan Johar - who won?

FreeBSD 11.0 Comes Up Short In Ubuntu 16.04 vs. macOS Sierra Benchmarks Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 29 September 2016. Page 1 of 3. 28 Comments Yesterday I published some macOS 10.2 vs. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS benchmarks from a Mac Mini and MacBook Air systems. For those curious if BSDs can outperform macOS Sierra on Apple hardware, I tested the MacBook Air with FreeBSD 11.0 compared to the Linux and macOS results on that Core i5 system. Here are those results. FreeBSD 11.0 AMD64 was tested on the Haswell-based MacBook Air and it actually worked well. Even the HD Graphics 5000 were playing nicely with the FreeBSD DRM Intel driver. The MacBook Air is equipped with a Core i5 4250U CPU with HD Graphics 5000, 4GB of DDR3 memory, and a 120GB Apple SSD. The install was smooth and was off to the races with testing. The TrueOS (formerly PC-BSD) rolling release was also attempted for testing on the same system, but unfortunately it didn't work out well. It was able to boot the TrueOS installer, but after rebooting, it wasn't able to boot into TrueOS. Even when trying the installer again and using the GRUB boot-loader, it still failed. When trying DragonFlyBSD 4.6, it failed to boot with the kernel hanging after the uhub1 reports. At least FreeBSD 11.0 was happily running on this Apple MacBook Air for being able to conduct those benchmarks. The compatible test profiles via the Phoronix Test Suite were then carried out. Continue reading to see how macOS 10.12, Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS (with both GCC 5.4 and LLVM Clang 3.8 compilers), and then FreeBSD 11.0 compare on the same MacBook Air system.

More Tech BIO-key brings Hello logins to any Windows 10 PC By Lee Mathews 09.29.2016 :: 12:45PM EST Everybody’s looking for ways to kill your passwords these days. If you’re running Windows 10, Hello is a nice option… provided you’ve got the right hardware. There still aren’t many computers shipping with Hello-compatible webcams (like Intel’s RealSense) to allow facial recognition. Fortunately, Windows Hello works with other biometric devices, and BIO-key makes adding one to your computer a relatively painless process. BIO-Key just unveiled a trio of new fingerprint scanners. First up is the EcoID. It’s designed for desktop use, with a short USB cord that tethers it to your computer. Park it next to your keyboard and you can log in to Windows 10 and authenticate in apps that have added Passport support by simply placing your finger a top the sensor. The SideSwipe. Sorry about the lack of banana for scale The other two scanners are designed for tablets and laptops. The SideTouch (top) is the larger of the two — larger because its sensor is the same kind of tap-to-authenticate number BIO-Key used in the EcoID. The SideSwipe, on the other hand, is about as small as USB fingerprint readers get. It’s roughly the same size as your fingertip, and, as its name suggests, you swipe your finger over the sensor to authenticate. Even if the developers of your favorite apps haven’t jumped on the Hello train just yet you may still want to pick up a BIO-Key scanner. The bundled password management software they ship with lets you sign in with a tap or swipe anywhere an app like LastPass or 1Password would. All three readers are reasonably priced. At $39.99, they’re among the least expensive options out there for adding biometrics to your PC. They’re also certified to work with Windows Hello, and you’re not likely to find a cheaper sensor that comes with Microsoft’s stamp of approval.

bit-tech.net Home News Reviews Hardware Modding Gaming Blog Forums Search All Hardware Gaming Industry Other Nvidia announces Volta-based Xavier SoC Published on 29th September 2016 by Gareth Halfacree 3 Comments News Nvidia's Xavier SoC design packs an eight-core ARM processor, 512-core Volta GPU, and a special accelerator block for visual computing tasks. Nvidia is continuing its heavy push into the automotive market with the announcement of Xavier, a Volta-based system-on-chip (SoC) design the company hopes will be driving the autonomous vehicles of the future. Nvidia first announced that it was serious about making an impact in the automotive sector with the opening of a dedicated technology centre in Michigan in 2013. Two years later the company announced the Tegra X1, a spin of its previously mobile-centric ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) designs which it claimed would be perfect for running the artificial intelligence system needed of a self-driving car. Now, the company is once again doubling down on automotive technology with Xavier, a new SoC design featuring an eight-core ARM central processor and a 512-core graphics processor based on the company's new Volta architecture. In short: it promises to be a bit of a beast, at least according to Nvidia's chief executive Jen-Hsun Huang. 'This is the greatest SoC endeavour I have ever known,' Huang told attendees at the company's GPU Technology Conference Europe, where Xavier was unveiled, 'and we have been building chips for a very long time.' The chip itself, built on a 16nm FinFET process, includes the aforementioned CPU and GPU blocks as well as a visual processor capable of 8K resolution with a high dynamic range (HDR) and a 'computer vision accelerator.' This block, Nvidia explains, works much like the Movidius visual processing unit (VPU) technology recently acquired by rival Intel, and is designed to accelerate tasks revolving around depth-sensing and image recognition from connected camera systems. As far as power goes, Nvidia claims that a single Xavier SoC is capable of offering 20 TOPS (trillion operations per second, a seemingly different metric than the company's usual measurement of floating-point operations per second) in a 20W power envelope. With that performance, the company claims, manufacturers can replace an existing Nvidia Drive PX 2 in-car computer system and its dual discrete graphics processing units with a single Xavier chip for equal performance at a significantly lower power draw. Nvidia has indicated that Xavier samples will ship in limited quantities for research purposes at the tail end of 2017, with no firm launch date yet provided for commercial availability and implementation. The remainder of the company's announcement can be found on the official website.

Bindibadgi 4th October 2016, 13:45 Quote: Originally Posted by ModSquid I understand there's a cost implication, but given they're already in mass production, isn't it cheaper to chuck a low-end Core/Pentium/Tegra/whatever chip in these "other" applications, rather than tee up a new fabrication line? Automotive will never use a consumer chip as they have specialist requirements inline with embedded: > Extensive validation + ISO certs. You complete the project, which is normally "yay sell time" then it's another 9+ months of testing. > Environmentally hardened - temp + packaging. > Unique IOs. This is becoming less the case as automated vehicles standardize around 'regular' IO > Auto is loooooong tail, like embedded. New car is 2-3 years design + 7 years of sales + 3 years of aftercare. You are contractually obligated to guarantee the chip will be around for at least 10 years. Core 2 Duo would just be seeing EOL in other words. > Customized designs to meet specific needs - you don't just slap as much as you can in one central processor. It's actually better to have certain fusions of parts around the vehicle with their own local, low power processing. That's more risk averse + uniform low temp + low power + small size to fit into nooks and crannies around the vehicle. This is why your usual $5 chip is now 5-10x as much.

 What you should know about the ending of a US contract some say amounts to 'giving away the internet' Allan Smith Oct. 1, 2016, 4:37 PM 20,863 facebook linkedin twitter email print Ted Cruz. AP Photo/Evan Vucci A historic transfer of internet power was scheduled to occur at midnight Saturday. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers became an autonomous nonprofit after a contract with the US Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration expired. Now ICANN will perform the duties of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority without direct oversight of the US government.  Instead, ICANN is now accountable to international stakeholders that include a governmental advisory committee, a technical committee, an industry committee, internet users, and other telecommunications experts. The organization, based out of Los Angeles, coordinates the Domain Name System that matches internet addresses with their actual numerical computer addresses. IANA functions include maintaining the registry of IP addresses and the allocation of internet-numbering resources. The entire ordeal sounds extremely complicated — and it did not come without its fair share of controversy. That contract, which is now officially expired, had been in place since 1998. Both businesses and members of the international community had been pressuring the US to cede control over IANA functions, deemed by some as a very minor ordeal — likening it to printing the phone book. But others, such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, likened it to "giving away the internet." Cruz originally wanted a provision in the recent stopgap spending bill in Congress to prevent this transfer from occurring, but that did not happen. Late this week, the attorney generals of four states filed a lawsuit in federal court looking to block the midnight Saturday transfer, but it was thrown out by a federal judge in the Southern District of Texas on Friday. "This transition was envisioned 18 years ago, yet it was the tireless work of the global internet community, which drafted the final proposal, that made this a reality,” ICANN Board Chair Stephen D. Crocker said in a statement. "This community validated the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance." Speaking to Business Insider Friday, before the Texas judge's decision, aides to Cruz called the issue — which amounts to control over the internet address book — a ground zero of protecting free speech online. They also criticized the White House for claiming that, in his fight against the transfer, Cruz didn't understand how the internet works and wanted to keep government involved in the process. "I love it when big-government liberals try and lecture conservatives about limited government," an aide said. Chief among Cruz's concerns is that a government advisory council is part of ICANN. He believes that the foreign governments who have a voice in that part of the group will begin to have a much bigger sway in how it operates going forward. His aides likened it to a form of the UN, where each country involved will be on equal footing. The problem with that, Cruz believes, is that countries such as Russia and China, both of which maintain strict internet control in their own countries, will be able to exert it on a global stage, possibly even impacting internet freedom within the US. But Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware told Business Insider in a Friday interview that the way the Texas Republican is characterizing the issue "is exactly wrong." "This is not a handover of control of the internet to some UN body, as much as he tries to make it sound like ICANN, which is an American corporation registered in California, is some international body," the Delaware Democrat said. "It isn't the UN or anything like it." "The way that China or Russia could have greater influence over the naming function of the internet is if we delay this transition," he continued. "Lose our credibility internationally that we do intend to privatize this function, and give them the leverage to make stronger arguments at the United Nations that the UN ... should begin preparing to set up their own DNS function. I think there is a very small risk that this transition will lead to any increased role for any country, including those that censor the internet in their own country." Cruz's team insisted that, although ICANN has not censored content in the past as a part of their duties, the senator believes they could have that ability moving forward. The group performs only a clerical function, but Cruz believes that could change. Using the example of "Free Tibet" groups in China, which have their web content blocked within that country while it can still be viewed elsewhere, a Cruz aide said China could begin to dictate whether that content makes it outside of the country. Chris Coons. Cliff Owen/AP Photo Coons used the phone-book analogy to try and disprove what Cruz has argued. He said that, when he was a kid, the Yellow Pages and White Pages essentially had a monopoly. But by the 1990s, dozens of publishers printed competing phone books. "The fact that there is a company that publishes the Yellow Pages that says if you want to purchase from a hardware store in your city, you know, here they all are, here are all of their names, that doesn't restrict what you can say on the phone to the hardware store," he said in his analogy. "It has nothing to do with the content of your conversations with the hardware store. All it does is assign pages to certain names and numbers. That's pretty similar to what the IANA does." "The IANA maintains the directory for when a string of numbers comes through your computer — it translates it into a bunch of numbers and then connects you to the right computer," he continued. "One of the things that was clearly eluding the critics of this transition was the idea that there could ever be a second Yellow Pages or a third Yellow Pages. Right now, the internet, which is a network of networks, is not owned or controlled by anyone. That's why it's the internet." Coons called the government-controlled contract that just expired a deal for "one version of the phone book." "And for 20 years, they've said 'America, at some point, will you turn over this minor role you have in this organization that is printing the Yellow Pages," he said. "And we said in both Democratic and Republican administrations, 'Sure, we'll get around to it. Sure, we're about to do that.'" He said that, with many in the international community growing leery that the US would ever end up actually doing it, there was increasing support for a "competing phone book" run by a sub-unit of the UN. That sounds a lot like exactly what Cruz does not want. "And the entity that would resolve disputes between who owns which domain or which website will be resolved by this UN agency," Coons said. "That is a structure where countries like China and Iran and Russia would have a bigger role. Instead, we have focused on the last four years pretty aggressively, and in the last two in a heightened way, on privatizing a very minimal US government role in overseeing how this phone-book contract is administered." "Here's the true irony: Sen. Cruz is a tireless advocate for personal liberty and an opponent of federal-government control in just about every subject matter area except this one," the senator continued. "What he's opposing is privatization. By opposing it, he's actually putting at risk the possibility that it will instead be taken over by a competing effort led by countries that do not favor free speech in the UN. Does that make any sense?" The Delaware senator said the transfer should make "no real difference" for everyday Americans, as there should be no perceivable change in how the internet works, explaining that it has to do with the "wires, plumbing, and piping" of the internet, not its content. Coons asked why tech giants would be in favor of the transfer if it posed a legitimate threat to internet freedom. "Why would companies like Dell and Cisco and Microsoft and Intel — who rely on a robust and open global internet for their businesses — why would they be so invested and concerned about this?" he said. "Because they need predictability." "Because ICANN, this large company in California that is largely run by the internet community, which is largely run by American companies, why would they want that group in control of this internet naming function rather than the UN," he continued. "I think you just got the answer." At the UN, countries such as Russia or Iran would have that equal footing to the US, while ICANN, because it is based out of California, is still subject to California law, he said. And it will be mostly under the purview of the private sector, which has a business interest in the internet being open and free. AP Photo/Tim Hales, File "If I got to choose between having the phone book published by the UN or by an American nonprofit company that is headquartered in California and subject to California law, I know which one I want," he said. "I want the latter." The senator called the reason Cruz wanted to stop the transfer a "fringe conspiracy theory," adding that many such theories have gained plenty of traction during the 2016 campaign season. "One of the things that has made this campaign season particularly interesting is the number of fringe conspiracy theories that have somehow made their way into the mainstream," he said. "This issue is no exception to that unfortunate trend." On Friday, after aligning himself with Cruz's position on the issue, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump ripped the "disastrous" IANA transfer during a rally. "Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interested trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation," he said. "She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet — let it be given to the world. What a bunch of people we have representing us. What a bunch of people." Coons said Trump's statement shows, "unfortunately," that Trump "is not well informed on internet-governance matters." "This particular issue was seized upon by a few in order to score some points, by misleadingly suggesting that President [Barack] Obama is giving away the internet," the senator said. "The United States does not own a set of keys to the internet. It's not a physical thing. It's not as if we're taking our dad's Oldsmobile and giving it away at a flea market. It is a network of networks. And that is a hard thing to grasp and an easy thing to mislead people about."

The company is preparing to respond within weeks to three separate charges of EU competition rule breaches in its online shopping service, Android smartphone software and advertising business. Google’s counter is the latest salvo in the European Commissions’s six-year investigation into the company. It comes at a critical point as tensions simmer between the US and Brussels. In August, the Commission said Apple should pay billions in unpaid taxes to the Irish state, provoking fury from Washington, while the US Department of Justice has recently demanded that Deutsche Bank pay a $14bn (£11bn) mis-selling fine. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner Credit: EPA A response from Google to all three of the charges could now come as early as mid October after the company recently requested that the EU extend legal deadlines to answer the charges. The Commission confirmed that it had given the company extra time to answer. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, hit Google with formal antitrust charges last year, claiming it exploits the monopoly enjoyed by its web search engine to prioritise its own price comparison shopping service. She followed that with two more charges this year, claiming that the company uses its Android software’s overwhelming share of the smartphone market to force its other services onto smartphones and that it restricted competitors to its AdSense for Search advertising service by signing exclusivity agreements with websites. The Commission has the power to fine Google up to 10pc of its annual revenues if it finds it guilty of anti-competitive practices, which could mean a penalty of up to $7.5bn (£5.8bn). This would eclipse the biggest fine to date, the €1.1bn (£950m) the Commission levied on Intel in 2009. The history of Google Play! 02:31 While a response is expected in mid-to-late October, it could be delayed further as Google puts the finishing touches to its answers. The company may still offer concessions in a last-ditch attempt to seek a deal with the Commission that would lead to a reduced fine, but after several failed attempts in the past, the prospect of a truce appears unlikely. Both sides are now believed to be prepared for a long-running battle, and any EU fine may be appealed at the European Court of Justice, a process that could take years and extend beyond Ms Vestager’s 2019 term. The Commission’s combative stance has irritated the US government, which cleared Google of any search bias after its own investigation in 2013. Barack Obama has accused the EU of attempting to protect its own companies by reining in Silicon Valley giants. When it responds, Google is likely to argue that it needs to place restrictions on Android to ensure the consistency of the software and that many price comparison services have benefited, not suffered, from the search engine. A Commission spokesman confirmed that Google’s deadlines for responding had been extended. It now has until October  13 to respond to the charge related to online shopping, October 26 for advertising and October 31 for the Android claim. Google did not comment.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 1 October 2016 | MYT 10:00 AM Car industry shows off cooperation as way to rival technology firms Future challenges: Can carmakers charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free? — Reuters PARIS/FRANKFURT:  Alarmed by the threat posed by Silicon Valley firms developing autonomous driving systems, carmakers at this week's Paris Motor Show showed signs they are ready to hit back by cooperating in areas where they might have been expected to compete. "This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE. Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars. However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020. Careful driving At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise. Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analysing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters. —  Reuters You May Be Interested Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail US is concerned over Russia blocking access to LinkedIn German minister says Facebook should be treated as a media company Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The package was originally created by a collaboration between Intel and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI). To reduce verbosity, we may refer to the Brain Imaging Analysis Kit using the BrainIAK abbreviation. Whenever lowercase spelling is used (e.g., Python package name), we use brainiak. Requirements We support Linux and MacOS with Python version 3.4 or higher. Most of the dependencies will be installed automatically. However, a few need to be installed manually. Linux Install the following packages (Ubuntu 14.04 is used in these instructions): apt install build-essential cmake libgomp1 mpich python3-pip
 Install updated version of the following Python packages: pip3 install --user -U pip virtualenv
 Note the --user flag, which instructs Pip to not overwrite system files. You must add $HOME/.local/bin to your $PATH to be able to run the updated Pip, e.g., by adding the following line to $HOME/.profile and launching a new login shell (e.g., logout or execute bash -l): PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
 MacOS Install the Xcode Command Line Tools: xcode-select --install
 Install brew from https://brew.sh. If you already have brew, examine the output of the following command to make sure it is working: brew doctor
 Then install the following: brew install llvm cmake mpich python3
 You must instruct programs to use this clang version at /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin. One way to do this, which works for most programs, is setting the CC environment variable. You can add the following lines to $HOME/.profile (or $HOME/.bash_profile, if you have one). For them to take effect, you must logout or launch a new login shell, e.g., bash -l: export CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang
export CXX=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++
 In addition, you also need to specify the directories that the newly installed clang will seek for compiling and linking: export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib $LDFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include $CPPFLAGS"
 Install updated versions of the following Python packages: pip3 install -U pip virtualenv
 Installing The Brain Imaging Analysis Kit is available on PyPI: pip3 install -U brainiak

Gaming 3 0 0 September 30, 2016 ‘Quantum Break’ Steam Release: Is The Steam Version Better Than The Windows 10 Release? Joseph Bradford Quantum Break has made the leap onto Steam this week, and while the game has been out for most of the year on PC, this move means more consumers have a chance to check out Remedy’s time-bending, story-driven game. Quantum Break blends a television show and a video game pretty seamlessly, creating one of the more unique takes on storytelling in the medium. Now with the Steam release, Quantum Break gives those not running Windows 10 a chance to try out the game. However, is there a difference between the two versions? Digital Foundry released their analysis of Quantum Break’s Steam release versus the original Windows 10 release. The major difference is the lack of a DirectX 12 requirement on Steam, meaning users still running Windows dated back to Windows 7 can now enjoy the game. But is there a difference in terms of performance between the two? According to Digital Foundry, it depends on your hardware. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-PK55-kCviA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> In the video, the outlet ran Quantum Break at ultra settings, 1080p, and with the upscaling effect enabled. Essentially, as the Inquisitr reported earlier this year, the upscaler is taking four 720p images and combining them into one 1080p image. Turning this off will see a performance drop, but it does clean up the image tremendously. However, for the purposes of the test, they decided to keep it on as that is the optimal setting. When running on Nvidia hardware, the Steam version found itself running at a much higher clip than the Windows 10 counterpart, sometimes on average of 10 or more frames per second. This is telling, as Nvidia hardware has struggled in terms of DirectX 12 performance, so the change to DirectX 11 has definitely improved things for Nvidia users. This writer has noticed the same during testing, as the game is running smoother on Steam than it ever has on my EVGA GTX 980 SC graphics card, paired with an Intel i7-6700K and 16GB of RAM, clocked at 3200 MHz. The game feels smoother, and it runs better than it ever did on the Windows store release. That being said, it’s not perfect. Playing with the upscaling off, for instance, immediately cuts the framerate in half, and while that does give a crisper, clearer image, its performance feels sluggish by comparison. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eU17_kd-e4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> AMD users have a different story unfold for them, however. Team Red’s hardware leads the pack when it comes to DirectX 12 performance in many titles, but its interesting to see there is not much of a difference in terms of metrics between the two Quantum Break versions. Showing some test footage of AMD’s Rx 480 card, the framerates are a wash, pretty much within a few decimal points and well within the “margin of error” for Digital Foundry. However, it’s incredible to see the gulf of difference between the Nvidia GTX 1060 and the Rx 480 when the settings are fiddled with to target a full 60 frames per second in the Steam version. At times, the video showed the Nvidia card running a full 40 frames better than the AMD card, a staggering gulf between them. If you’ve never played Quantum Break before, this is definitely the version to go with, unless you want the ability to cross save with your Xbox One should you choose to grab the game there too. The Steam version doesn’t sync with your Xbox Live ID, so your progress doesn’t carry over. However, if you’ve held off waiting for a potential Steam release, this is the version for you. Are you playing Quantum Break on Steam this weekend? Sound off with your comments below about what you think of the game.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Guides Destiny PlayStation 4 Xbox One Destiny Khvostov Quest - schematic location, 7G-OX weapon parts and manual pages for Rise of Iron's We Found a Rifle Quest How to start and complete Rise of Iron's Quest to get an Exotic version of Destiny's very first gun. By Matthew Reynolds Published 29/09/2016 Destiny: Rise of Iron has a neat callback to the very first weapon players wield in the game - the Khvostov - by making it the Exotic weapon Khvostov 7G-OX. The path to get there isn't signposted by the game, but once you're on the Khvostov Quest in Rise of Iron, it will only take you around an hour to 90 minutes to get it - though expect some exploration and a tough boss battle before you do so. Once you're done, maybe you'd want to take on another Exotic - the Gjallarhorn Quest, Thorn Quest or Outbreak Prime Quest perhaps? - which are required to complete an entry in Rise of Iron's Record Book. How to get the Khvostov Quest 'We Found a Rifle' in Destiny: Rise of Iron First, you need the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic to unlock the questline. There are two ways to do this: Dismantle the original Khvostov weapon Use a Splicer Intel Relay to board the Ketch ship in The Plaguelands If you managed to keep hold of that weapon from way back in 2014, then great - pull it out of your Vault, dismantle it and move on to the next step. Of course, most people got rid of it as soon as possible, and thankfully there's another way to get the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic. Here's the Khvostov 7G-OX up close. You need to head to the place you started Destiny, just outside the Cosmodrome walls. Fire up The Plaguelands patrol (complete the game's final story mission, The Iron Tomb, to access this) and head back in the direction of the Rocketlands (from where you spawn in, go right, through the doorway on the upper walkway). Once in the Rocketlands, go left to The Divide, then left round the corner into the sewers to access The Breach. You need to make sure you have a Splicer Intel Relay on you, because before you can go exit the wall, you'll have to open a doorway in The Breach. (Note that this won't work if you try and access the ship from story The Walls Come Down - we tried it.) Once you do, work your way through the pile up of cars to the Ketch ship in the distance, and kill everything on board, including a rather persistent Pilot Servitor. Once taken care of, a chest will appear in the far right corner, containing the Khvostov 7G-OX schematic. Whichever way you get it, take it to the Iron Temple to continue the next part of the quest. How to complete the 'We Found a Rifle' Quest, Khvostov weapon parts and manuals pages locations You now have to locate 10 manual pages and 3 weapon parts while in Patrol in The Plaguelands area. 10 Manual Pages for Khvostov 7G-OX - These are dropped by killing Fallen enemies within Patrol, so kill everything you come across and they'll drop from time to time. For some players this step was rather quick, with a steady stream of drops, but for us it took a while. We also had more success when not doing patrols, but you can do other things at the same time - we had two drop in a single Acheon's Forge session, for example. In short, you can get most of these pages while getting weapon parts, then just stay in Patrol until you're done. 3 Weapon Parts for Khvostov 7G-OX - These three weapon parts are found in specific places. Start The Plaguelands, and make your way back to the Rocketyards, which will act as your starting point. From here, you want to go to the Refinary, and essentially take the route the Devil's Lair Strike takes you on. Two of the three Weapon Parts are on this route: 1. One is located in the room after you face waves of enemies as your Ghost opens the door, on the right side in the corner. The first Weapon Part in the 'We Found a Rifle' Quest. Please ignore the photobombing dancer. 2. The next is in The Blast, the vast area where you face the Walker, outside in the centre of the map, against the purple pipe. The second Weapon Part is outside near where you fight the Walker in the Devil's Lair Strike. 3. For the third Weapon Part, go back to the Rocketyard, and head in the other direction so you go to The Divide. Instead of going left to The Breach, go right to Dock 13 (as if you are going to where you spawn into the Cosmodrome in the original Patrol). After the large room with enemies, the Weapon Part is under the stairs. Check under the stairs in Dock 13 for this third Weapon Part. Once you have 10 manual pages and 3 weapon parts, return to the Iron Temple to get a mission that'll finish off the Quest. Completing the Khvostov Quest 'We Found a Rifle' in Destiny: Rise of Iron This final A Khvostov Rising mission is home to a particularly tough boss encounter. Make sure you're a decent level (our article on how to reach Light level 400 can help) and come equipped with something that can take down a Void shield and do strong follow-up damage. If possible, team up with one or two other players too. Start the mission, use your Ghost on the scan point then head outside to meet Kaviss. As mentioned, he's pretty tough, so take his shield down with a Void Heavy or Super, then follow it up with more rapid damage. When his health is low enough, he'll retreat. Go to The Breach where you'll encounter a path of SIVA clouds through the tunnels, and be wary of the trip mines along the way. When you reach the wide, snow-filled area, head to the far end upper walkway to start another battle with the Captain. Kaviss is pretty tough, so make sure you have a powerful Void attack to knock out his shield. Again, same rules apply as before - use a Void Heavy or Super to quickly drop his shield then follow up with the opposite or some more to get in some damage. The problem here is the amount of surrounding enemies; the two things you mainly have to watch out for are the Servitors on the walkways (a few sniper shots will drop them) and the dropships that occasionally appear. Wait until the dropships disappear before coming out into the open (we had to 'approach' them to make them move one time, so consider that if they aren't budging) and try and clear as many regular enemies as you can. Then, when the coast is mostly clear, go in with a Super / Heavy combo to drop a chunk of the Captain's health, then retreat and repeat the process. It's a tough battle solo, and no doubt will be easier with a few of you, so consider grouping up if you can.

Once Kaviss is downed, he'll immediately drop the Khvostov 7G-OX as an Engram, which you can equip straight away. We're not done with the mission just yet though; make your way onward to beyond the wall, where you started the game and the new Ketch ship is, and clear out all the Fallen along the way. Once you've taken out all the enemies on the ship, your Ghost will want to have a chat with you while admiring the view. Once you've done the cutscene, head back to the Tower, and chat to Shiro-4 to complete the Quest.

Maintaining cover: A guide to business insurance Let's have a meeting in the echo chamber Download Current Issue Scale Computing Scale Computing announced that Johan Pellicaan has joined as managing director for EMEA. He will focus on expanding the company’s channel presence across the region. Pellicaan has over 30 years’ experience in technology sales and product management, with more than ten in channel focused roles. He comes to the company from Springpath where he was responsible for driving their hyperconverged EMEA regional strategy. Prior to Springpath, he was an executive at Seagate, Microsoft and ProClarity. “Scale has an extremely interesting proposition for small and medium sized businesses,” said Pellicaan. “It’s ‘data centre in a box’ enables businesses to reap tremendous cost savings whilst delivering the simplicity and ease of use that hyperconvergence can. With such an exciting product offering in a rapidly growing market, I am looking forward to using my experience to build good professional values across EMEA and establish solid distribution channels”. FireMon FireMon has announced the appointment of Satin Mirchandani as its new president & CEO. Mirchandani said that he will focus on branching out into major regions beyond the UK, as well as building on the company’s commitment to channel partners. “My first enterprise software experience was with a company that focused on the IT channel (VARs, distributors) – I learned the unique value of a trusted advisor who is a domain expert,” Mirchandani continued. “For many customers—and, in security specifically —the channel is simply irreplaceable.  FireMon is fortunate to have partnered with the best of the best.  As such, I intend to continue investing heavily in the education, enablement and growth of our channel partners.” Tech Data Tech Data has appointed Tom Baker as its first business development manager for Google in Education. Baker will be working with partners to raise awareness and increase penetration of Chrome-based devices across the sector. “I’ve done a lot of work with education partners already but in this new role I’ll be able to concentrate all my efforts on supporting resellers that have a specific focus and on schools and driving penetration of Chrome devices,” Baker said. “I feel that we can make a positive difference – for schools and for partners – by raising awareness of Chromebooks and demonstrating just how effective they are in educational settings." Cloud Industry Forum The Cloud Industry Forum (CIF) has announced the appointment of Frank Bennett as deputy chair. Bennett will work alongside CIF’s chairman, Richard Sykes. He has been involved with a number of vendors known to the channel, including Microsoft, Google, IBM, Avaya, Verizon, Intel, Avnet and VMware.  “The role that CIF plays in the industry is more important than ever,” Bennett commented. “Cloud adoption is rapidly accelerating and businesses are migrating more and more workloads and in some cases their entire IT estate and are achieving truly transformative changes as a result.” “More substantive migrations imply more complexity and potentially associated risk, so the guidance and education that CIF can provide to support that change is critical. I’m therefore delighted to assume the role of CIF’s deputy chair and look forward to working closely with the rest of the team to build a strong community of industry partners and Professional CIF Membership to deliver on the promise of cloud computing."

"This is how the automotive industry may be able to fight off the threat that Apple and particularly Google represent to their brands as digital services become more and more important," technology investment analyst Richard Windsor said. BMW, Daimler and VW's Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm HERE. Separately HERE's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with truckmaker Volvo and carmaker Skoda, a VW subsidiary. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give automakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars. However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top automakers said this week they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020. At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. "We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform," Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. "Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively," Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian auto maker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise. Daimler, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers who want to go it alone but still sees some need for collaboration. "We need to think whether we work together analyzing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case," Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships like the deal between Chinese carmaker Geely's Swedish subsidiary Volvo Car Group to develop autonomous cars with Uber Technologies, and General Motor's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. "The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways," Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

According to Android Police, Google will be unveiling a new operating system, currently nicknamed ‘Andromeda,’ which combines its two major software platforms. That’s in addition to previously rumored announcements of two Pixel phones, a new Chromecast, a new Wi-Fi router, and a release date for Google Home (an Amazon Echo competitor). Mind you, Andromeda is separate from the company’s ongoing project to bring Android apps into Chrome OS. In fact, Andromeda appears to be the opposite: it’s based off of Android, and pulls in features from Chrome OS. It’s also separate from the Fuchsia OS we reported on last month, which is focused on IoT devices. The company may also announce a new laptop codenamed ‘Bison’ (nicknamed Pixel 3). The report emphasizes that the laptop will not be marketed as a Chromebook, but instead as its own entity. Rumored specs suggest the laptop will take a page off of Microsoft’s Surface Book; the 12.3″ device will supposedly include a ‘tablet’ mode and stylus. Internally, there may be two models with “either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM.” All this will fit in a device under 10 mm thick. Unfortunately, this laptop wouldn’t be due until Q3 2017, and a lot could change about the hardware between now and then. Still, a legitimate Google laptop sounds like an exciting prospect. Part of the issue with Chrome OS is that while you can do a lot on the Web, you will almost always have to turn to something more powerful if you want to get serious work done. But Andromeda could mitigate this by building off of Android with a legitimate laptop form factor and specs. Perhaps we will see a true contender to Windows and Mac OS at last. In any case, the Andromeda launch seems fairly likely at this point. At the very least, Google thinks October 4 will be a big deal; Senior VP of Android Hiroshi Lockheimer tweeted this out over the weekend: We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 Comparing the upcoming event to the original Android launch is no small statement.

The suit was filed late Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas by a quartet of Republican state attorneys general. They chose litigation after Sen. Ted Cruz and other GOP lawmakers failed to add language blocking the handover to the stopgap spending bill Congress passed Wednesday. Judge George C. Hanks Jr. is set to hear the plaintiffs’ request to delay the transition. Story Continued Below — After months of talking up the transition, NTIA and ICANN aren’t saying a word about the case. But their allies on Capitol Hill torched Republicans for the last-minute move. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said the “baseless lawsuit is another cheap attempt by a fringe group to politicize” the transition. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) took it a step further, referencing the most recent budget battle. “Senator Cruz failed to convince his colleagues to join in his reckless plan to derail the IANA transition,” Pallone said in a statement on Thursday, “so his cronies are now turning to the courts to undo the will of Congress, which was clearly expressed less than 24 hours ago.” WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE FCC ON SET-TOP BOX — Chairman Tom Wheeler is still searching for three votes after a last-minute cancellation of a highly anticipated vote on his set-top box proposal on Thursday. The chairman projected confidence after Thursday’s meeting, telling reporters that “this is a timing issue” and “all that’s happened here is that the deliberative process that has been going on continues to go on. That’s the only change.” Still, the delayed vote was a big setback for the chairman’s ambitious fall agenda — and has opponents of Wheeler’s approach energized that they’re making an impact. The set-top box item remains on the commission’s circulation list, which means it could be voted on at any time, but major items are usually saved for open meetings (the next of which is Oct. 27). Alex and Margaret have the rundown for you here. — A NEW WRINKLE? Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, whose support Wheeler needs to reach the magic number of votes, has focused her criticism of the proposal on FCC oversight of the app license between cable companies and device-makers. But she also has some concerns with the proposal’s framework for how pay-TV apps would tell devices which channels or on-demand shows consumers could access, one source familiar with the negotiations tells MT. That system, which the FCC says would be set up by a standards body, is crucial to giving new cable boxes a universal search capability — something the FCC touts as a major consumer benefit. Rosenworcel didn’t answer questions after Thursday’s meeting, and her office didn’t get back to us Thursday night. GOOD FRIDAY MORNING!

ANOTHER TESLA AUTOPILOT INCIDENT — A Tesla driver says he was using the car’s Autopilot feature when the vehicle crashed into a bus in Germany on Wednesday, an incident that prompted renewed scrutiny of the reliability of the vehicle’s technology. The collision follows a May crash in which a Florida driver was killed in a Tesla while using Autopilot, and a fatal collision in China in January that also involved the company’s driverless tech. In the latest crash, the car’s driver was slightly injured and no one on the bus was harmed. Tesla announced in September that it intends to offer more than 200 safety updates in its latest Autopilot iteration, including an emphasis on onboard radar, more prominent alerts for drivers and limitations on hands-free steering. ** A message from the National Association of Manufacturers: It’s time for America to come together.

Here are a few highlights from the conversation: — On autonomous vehicles: The existing Lyft Line service matches up with the company’s autonomous vehicle plans, which will also enable people to share rides. The self-driving cars will likely get their start in popular fixed routes that are frequently traversed within cities. — On what Lyft believes sets it apart: The company argues that it has branded itself as one that treats drivers and passengers better than its competition. As an example to support this framing, Durbin notes that the tipping feature in its app has resulted in its drivers collecting more than $100 million in total tips since the feature launched. — On independent contractors and acquisition reports: Lyft continues to classify its drivers as independent contractors. (It has previously encountered opposition on this classification from workers pushing for union rights.) The company is in talks with members of Congress to develop portable benefit options for drivers, which are an alternative form of benefits that contract workers can carry from job to job, as opposed to traditional, employer-based packages. Durbin and Wilson also reiterated previous statements from Lyft that the company is not for sale. REVENGE PORN ROUNDTABLE TODAY — Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) will open a discussion in the House’s Cannon building this morning on how lawmakers can criminalize the non-consensual sharing of pornographic images online, a conversation convened by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Speier introduced the Intimate Privacy Protection Act this past July to address the problem of revenge porn — and a spokeswoman tells MT she will talk about the bill’s future on the Hill. Some question how the proposal would enforce its stated protections while still preserving free speech. Other panelists include Antigone Davis, Facebook’s global head of safety; Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization of Women; and Mark Eichorn, assistant director of FTC’s Division of Privacy and Identity Protection, which is part of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. IT’S AWARD SEASON AT THE PATENT OFFICE — The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office announced two sets of honors this week — on Tuesday, it was the winners of its Cancer Moonshot Challenge, and, on Thursday, the top finishers in its Patents for Humanity contest. In the first competition, USPTO shared 269,353 patent documents related to cancer research, which participants were invited to analyze to identify key insights about how testing and clinical work was being conducted. Dolcera, the IP research firm that came out on top, visualized a connection between cancer epidemiology and genetics, and research funding, patenting and testing. The Patents for Humanity honorees included the FDA, Case Western Reserve University, GestVision and the Global Good Fund at Intellectual Ventures — all of which have built innovations that address development challenges, such as malaria detection. SILICON VALLEY CEO TO HELP HILLARY GET OUT THE VOTE — The Democratic National Committee has tapped Donnie Fowler, founder and CEO of Dogpatch Strategies and a veteran Democratic political operative, to head the Clinton campaign’s “get out the vote” efforts, reports POLITICO’s Carla Marinucci. “Donald Trump has a superb marketing department,” Fowler said. “But Donald Trump has no sales team, nobody to go to the voter and make the sale. And Hillary has a very deep and sophisticated sales team." TRUMP BRIEFED ON RUSSIAN HACKER INTEL BEFORE DEBATE — While the Republican nominee cast doubt on whether Russia was actually behind the DNC hack during Monday’s presidential debate, intelligence officials told Time that he was briefed prior to the prime-time showdown on intelligence that allegedly ties Russia to the cyberattack. “I do not comment on information I receive in intelligence briefings; however, nobody knows with definitive certainty that this was in fact Russia," Trump maintained in a statement to Time. OUR FAVORITE LONG-READS THIS WEEK — “Microsoft bets its future on a reprogrammable computer chip,” by Wired’s Cade Metz: “Microsoft had spent 40 years building PC software like Windows, Word, and Excel. It was only just finding its feet on the internet. And it certainly didn’t have the tools and the engineers needed to program computer chips — a task that’s difficult, time consuming, expensive, and kind of weird. Microsoft programming computer chips was like Coca-Cola making shark fin soup.” — “Some like it bot,” by Five Thirty Eight’s Laura Hudson: “When a writer or programmer uses the words of dozens or hundreds of other people as the source material for new machine-generated content, who’s the creator: the person programming the AI, the authors of the original works or the AI itself?” — “Building your sonic brand,” by California Sunday Magazine’s Jack Hitt: “Think of the telephone’s ring, once actual bells and clappers, shifting into an array of fully composed, harmonically appealing digital ring tones. Electric cars will make that same transition, including being branded by car model. We will know that it’s a Nissan Leaf; or an Uber self-driving car; or a Google, Apple, or Microsoft car before it even pulls into view.” — “Rise of the Robomasters,” by The Verge’s Ben Popper: “Over the last half decade, high-profile U.S. startups like Oculus and Pebble have journeyed to Shenzhen, not just to outsource their manufacturing, but for local expertise on how best to build it. The city had evolved to be low cost, but also high tech. ‘We can call Shenzhen our Silicon Valley,’ said Liu Zi Yi, a RoboMaster’s competitor from the Xi’an region.” — “Hacking, cryptography, and the countdown to quantum computing,” by The New Yorker’s Alex Hutchinson: “The encryption methods that protect everything from online shopping to diplomatic communications remain effectively impregnable when properly implemented. … Scientists around the world are inching toward the development of a fully functioning quantum computer, a new type of machine that would, on its first day of operation, be capable of cracking the internet’s most widely used codes.” WARM AND FUZZIES — Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) shared a heartwarming message on Thursday about the recent arrival of his granddaughter, Henley Joy Hargens. “You look at that little girl who you held when she was born now holding a baby girl of her own. At that moment, you are overcome with the emotion you felt nearly 27 years ago when your baby girl entered the world,” he writes. “It’s the kind of thing that can turn the most stoic of Scandinavians into blubber.” TELECOM FOODIE ABOUT TOWN — Per a tip from former Pro Technology Deputy Editor Amy Schatz, we’ve learned that Rick Chessen, SVP of Law and Regulatory Policy for NCTA-The Internet & Television Association and a former senior staff attorney at the FCC, has got quite the gastronomic side gig.

BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi announced this week they would launch new traffic monitoring services next year which give drivers a view of road conditions miles ahead. They are based on video data collected from sensors in other cars and fed to the three carmakers' jointly-owned navigation mapping services firm Here (http://reut.rs/2dabC1B). Separately Here's Dutch rival TomTom NV on Thursday announced traffic data deals with Volvo Trucks and Skoda. Also General Motors, Nissan and VW are experimenting with a plan to pull video data captured by their customers' vehicles using Israeli firm Mobileye's camera-based sensor systems, that may soon give carmakers an edge over the likes of Google in the precision-mapping required for driverless cars (http://reut.rs/2daj3Wr). Can they really charge for it? However, it remains to be seen whether carmakers can charge premium prices for connected car services as technology companies like Google look to develop similar offerings for free, supported by advertising or other business models. A deal by traffic data start-up Inrix to supply data to Google-owned crowd-sourced traffic and navigation service Waze will help drivers find parking spots on smartphones using the free app. And Renault said on Thursday it was showing a prototype of a Waze system built into its car dashboards which run Android Auto, Google's operating system for carmakers. Meanwhile connecting cars on the move with the Internet also needs more reliable mobile telecoms networks. With that aim, Germany's top carmakers said this week that they were teaming up with telecoms network equipment makers Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Qualcomm and Intel to help with developing the next-generation 5G networks set to debut around 2020 (http://reut.rs/2dcPuCy). Careful driving At the same time carmakers are now racing to plot their courses to building self-driving vehicles over the next five years, a dramatic acceleration in pace from the 10- to 15-year timeframes many had charted until pushed to speed up the process by the advances made by Google and Tesla. “We see the car transforming from a product into the ultimate platform,” Daimler Chairman Dieter Zetsche told reporters in Paris. Among the car companies there have been two camps, those who are trying to develop their autonomous driving technology in-house, and those who are outsourcing it, but that division is looking set to become less clear-cut due to the need for cooperation in some areas at least. “Gradually all of the car manufacturers will have to get more and more involved in managing data. It's natural. We're going to have to work much more collaboratively,” Stewart Callegari, a Nissan product planning executive for driverless cars told reporters at the Paris show. Fiat's recent partnership to build self-driving vans with Google is seen by analysts as an example of outsourcing, given the Italian carmaker's weak finances, limiting its ability to invest in its own software expertise (http://reut.rs/1ZatE2c). Mercedes-Benz, on the other hand, is firmly in the camp of vehicle makers that want to go it alone but it still sees some need for collaboration. “We need to think whether we work together analysing the data or whether we do this on our own. This depends on the use case,” Zetsche said, adding that it made sense to work together in areas where potential cost savings resulted but did not blur the distinctions between brands. Some partnerships such as the deal between Volvo and Uber to develop autonomous cars, and GM's partnership with Uber's rival Lyft, are also seen as hybrid approaches. “The automotive industry has and will continue to become a software business in many ways,” Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters.

However, the Journal also said it was possible there would be no deal and that Qualcomm was exploring other options. Netherlands-based NXP and San Diego-based Qualcomm said separately that they did not comment on rumors or speculation. NXP shares rose 16.9 percent to close at $96.12 on Thursday, while Qualcomm’s rose 6.3 percent to $67.45. Watch all our tech videos below Qualcomm was ranked No. 3 in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015, while NXP ranked No. 7, according to market research firm IHS. A deal would consolidate the combined company’s position as the third largest, behind top chipmaker Intel Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile Google Prepping a Pixel Notebook That Could Be Running the Andromeda OS By Omar Sohail Posted 2 months ago 23Shares Share Tweet Submit After the announcement of Pixel C, Google is aiming to bring the functionality of laptops and the portability of tablets in a single package, even though this particular package is said to be a notebook as well. That being said, Google is said to be working on a new Pixel laptop that is going to be running a completely new operating system altogether. New Google Pixel Notebook All Set to Be Running Andromeda – Google’s Next Operating System This particular project has been codenamed Bison, most likely because of the powerful hardware that it will be harboring underneath its hood. However, for the time being, it is going to be named Pixel 3 and it is said to be powered by Google’s Andromeda platform. For those that don’t know, Andromeda is going to be a blend between Android and the company’s Chrome OS. Google did improve the functionality of tablets with the announcement of Pixel C, but the fact that it was still running Android meant that it would be limited to running tasks that Windows and Chrome OS powered notebooks were effortlessly capable of executing. With Andromeda, you’ll receive the best of both worlds, even though Chrome OS still provides limited functionality in comparison to Windows and macOS. Regardless, Chrome OS was never touted as an operating system where it was perceived as an ‘all in one’ solution. Instead, it was targeted to students and users who would be on a strict budget and only required decent hardware to carry out work-related tasks. With the upcoming Pixel notebook, which is said to arrive during the third quarter of 2017, the Andromeda OS will be able to run Android and dedicated Chrome OS applications meaning that a near notebook experience will be guaranteed from the upcoming product. The source details state that Bison is going to be an ultra-thin notebook, and it is either going to be powered by an Intel Core m3 or Core i5 processor. It is not confirmed if Skylake or Kaby Lake chips are going to be a part of the hardware, but seeing as how Intel has already announced the mobile versions of its 7th generation CPUs (also known as Kaby Lake), it’s almost a guarantee that Pixel 3 will come running with Intel’s latest offerings. Advertisement It could also feature 8 or 16GB RAM configurations, along with 32 or 128GB of internal memory. A Type-C USB could also be present, along with a fingerprint reader. Pricing details are dicey at best, but the MSRP is said to start from $799. Just remember that Pixel C was the start of great things, and that the next Google Pixel notebook could be the elevated point at which the company would envision selling laptops.

According to a new report from the Wall Street Journal, the deal could be finalized in the next two or three months, marking the latest in a string of mergers in the semiconductor industry. NXP was ranked No. 7 in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015. The company is known for co-creating the near-field communication (NFC) technology behind wireless payment services like Apple Pay and Android Pay. The company is a leading chip supplier for Apple Apple and Samsung smartphones, and a major supplier of chips for both the auto and IoT industries, especially after its $12 billion acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor late last year. A deal would consolidate the combined company's position as the third largest semiconductor company by revenue, behind Intel and Samsung Electronics. Qualcomm is a major player in the smartphone industry with its popular Snapdragon series of SoCs and wireless modems. But the company’s revenues have been hit by slowing smartphone sales and contracting demand for high end devices, with budget devices from Chinese companies putting profit margins under pressure. The deal should accelerate its diversification to other areas of growth. The Wall Street Journal notes that the acquisition is not yet final and could fall apart. The chip industry has seen an influx in mergers and acquisitions — up to $145 billion in M&A deals last year according to Dealogic. Some of them include Avago Technologies' $37 billion purchase of Broadcom, Intel's $17 billion acquisition of Altera, and WD’s $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk.

By Richard Leadbetter Published 30/09/2016 Could this be our first look at how Xbox One titles will look on next year's Project Scorpio? Forza Horizon 3 represents a fascinating balance between looking good and running well on current generation console hardware while at the same time scaling up to provide an improved experience on high-end kit. Combined with the cross-platform nature of the new Play Anywhere system, what's clear is that Microsoft is laying the foundations for Scorpio's arrival right now - and it looks great. It helps that the Forza Horizon engine is so solid to begin with, to the point where it looks so good at 1080p, you can't help but wonder whether we actually need a new wave of consoles at all. If there was one takeaway from this year's E3, it was that the first party wares from both Microsoft and Sony are punching seriously above their weight, compared to the outputs we've seen from equivalent PC kit. Forza Horizon 3 builds upon the key technical successes of its predecessor and retains the superb image quality - 4x MSAA on a console title is virtually unheard of these days - while ramping up the environmental detail to new levels. It also goes without saying that the car modelling is exceptional, and though enhancements vary from vehicle to vehicle, the PC version does offer the ability to run more detailed in-game models, adding further to the spectacle. The choice of Australia for the latest Horizon festival also pays dividends - the locales are varied, ranging from brush to cities to rainforests - and the quality of the materials and texture work is second to none, backed by a simply sublime lighting system. There are compromises, of course. Object detail pop-in is probably the biggest issue, and moving to PC doesn't address it so much as move the LODing artefacts further into the distance. An in-depth comparison of Forza Horizon 3 on PC and Xbox One. The comparisons between Xbox One and PC prove fascinating because for the most part, the enhancements are fairly subtle to pick up upon using our standard 1080p comparison gallery set-up. The best guess is that the console version operates at an equivalent level to the high setting on PC, and we strongly suspect that various settings are scaled dynamically during play in order to stabilise performance. LODs in particular vary substantially from scene to scene, especially noticeable on foliage detail, which often looks similar to the PC version operating at low or medium settings. In terms of where the PC version improves matters, by and large, we're looking at the usual suspects: shadows exhibit more detail on the ultra setting, motion blur utilises more samples, anisotropic filtering rises up to 16x compared to what looks like 4x on Xbox One, while textures clearly resolve more detail. The world car level of detail setting adds significantly to some vehicles, as you'll see in the comparison gallery below, but it's mostly a massive drain on resources as it seems to utilise the full autovista models. Reflections also see further refinement on the PC side, though it's interesting to note that in bonnet-cam view, reflection detail is identical, even between PC quality settings - presumably because lower quality effects would look really rough when so much of the screen real estate is taken up with the effect. Draw distance is also an area where the PC version excels - while the pop-in issue in the mid-distance only sees an iterative improvement, it's clear to see that detail in the far distance is significantly more pronounced. At standard 1080p though, it's not exactly a deal-breaker, and in many respects, the overall impression is one of additional refinement as opposed to a night and day improvement. Here we can observe the differences in texture quality. The difference between high and ultra is subtle here but ultra textures become more useful at higher resolutions. In this shot, we can see the difference in reflection quality visible across the car's body. Once again, both high and ultra settings produce visually pleasing results while the lower settings introduce noticeable artefacts. This scene on the beach showcases the difference in distant LOD quality. On the lowest setting, lower quality foliage textures are used relatively near the player car. For this scene, we're primarily focusing on the tree shadow to the left of the car. The ultra setting provides a significant step up in shadow map resolution. We've also adjusted car detail to match each setting which produces subtle differences in vehicle rendering. This cut-scenes helps demonstrate the difference in motion blur quality available when using the ultra preset on the PC. A higher number of samples produces much cleaner results. This shot showcases the increased distant detail available on PC when using the ultra preset. The difference in reflections here are due to the variation in weather conditions but it should be noted that Xbox One uses the high reflection setting. This gameplay shot demonstrates the benefit of MSAA - this PC shot was downscaled from 1440p with MSAA disabled, for performance reasons, but the Xbox One version actually manages to look slightly cleaner. MSAA is certainly available on the PC, it should be noted. Take a look at the horizon in this shot and you'll see plenty of additional vegetation visible on the PC. In comparison, these trees and other details visibly pop-in to existence while driving on Xbox One. However, the situation changes dramatically once we move up to 4K and it's at this point that the enhancements all begin to fall in place, that we begin to realise why they are there. Forza Horizon 3 at high settings at ultra HD still looks good of course, but the additional levels of quality come across much more strongly as they fill the canvas offered by the higher resolution. At base 1080p, Xbox One's low-level anisotropic filtering isn't really an issue but at 4K, with 16x AF in place on PC, the increase to road detail is revelatory. And it's also at this point that the enhanced texture work on offer via the ultra preset can actually be appreciated. The longer draw distances and less impactful LODing also ensures that the vast pixel count is put to good use. Perhaps of more importance right now to many PC users is the fact is that these enhancements also help significantly at 1440p resolution - but the higher we scale, the more apparent the improvements become. Of course, the PC version's biggest issue is the fact that Playground's 30Hz iteration of the Forza engine really doesn't want to scale beyond 30fps, even on PC. We've documented the issues as they stand right now extensively, but the bottom line is that pushing beyond 30fps and hitting a solid 60 requires inordinately powerful hardware. A Titan X Pascal system can't sustain 1080p60 with 4x MSAA enabled - but it hits the target at 4K (!) with multi-sampling turned off. There are also scalability issues on mainstream GPUs too. While 30fps is the best choice for those with older Intel i5s and GTX 970-level hardware, you can push higher with adaptive sync displays and frame-rate limiters. On first impressions, Xbox One S scaled up from 1080p appears to hold up rather well. Of course, it's generally blurrier and blockier, but the overall impression isn't bad. However, intricate detailing on the car and far-off detail blends away. The motion blur is also far more heavy-handed in removing detail on Xbox One. Xbox One's meshwork alpha transparencies hold up rather well on the left here. However, all foliage elements have more detail, ground textures are hugely improved and looking at the decals on the bonnet, PC obviously has access to improved, higher resolution art assets. Look into the far distance around the mountain and you'll see the PC version resolving far more in the way of detail - view distance is pushed out significantly. This shot also highlights the importance of anisotropic filtering - we've got that set to 16x on PC. Edges scale up to 4K better than expected on Xbox One, owing to the utilisation of 4x MSAA. However, road and car detail is on another level on PC, while there is additional precision to shadows and reflections. It's worth noting that we're only using FXAA on PC - MSAA is sheer overkill at this extreme pixel density. An engine-driven cut-scene dramatically showcases what ultra-level motion blur does for the presentation - many more samples gives a cleaner look, while less detail is blurred away in the process. One explanation for the heavier blur on Xbox One may be the differing frame-rate - the simulated camera exposure will be twice as long. Otherwise though, it's 30fps that gives the best, most consistent experience and you don't need to nix MSAA. Indeed, the GTX 970 is perfectly happy to ramp up to 8x MSAA with the 30fps cap in place, and while we're on the subject, it's interesting to note that Forza Horizon 3 is one of the very, very few PC titles that actually frame-paces 30fps correctly - each update persisting for the required 33ms. The downside is that controls seem slightly muggier than the Xbox One version operating at the same frame-rate. The console version's dynamic scalability ensures a mostly solid 30fps refresh with an acceptable degree of input latency. Obviously, the drop in performance results in less responsive controls overall compared to the 60Hz Forza Motorsport series entries, but there's never the sense that the driving experience is unduly compromised by the reduced frame-rate. It feels different, but the consistency ensures that you adjust, that you remain in control. Xbox One frame-rates remain mostly locked at 30fps, just like previous Horizon titles, but there are instances where frames do drop. However, they are few and far between. At 30fps, the PC version also remains solid at high and ultra settings, even on lower-end Core i5 processors and mainstream PC hardware. However, the combination of detail-rich textures and MSAA could cause problems for users with 2GB cards. We noted that it was possible to hit 30fps with reasonable settings tweaks on a GTX 950 - however, the VRAM warning indicator was a nigh-on constant companion with 2x MSAA and high textures in effect. Similarly, top tier settings at 1440p causes similar problems for a 4GB GTX 970, where the GTX 1060 manages to cope just fine. Xbox One's 30fps experience is still beautifully solid - it's an excellent console racer. In conclusion, Xbox One offers a great experience out of the box, but to get the best from the PC version, you may need to accept that 30fps is the best you're going to get from the code as it stands right now. And that's a pity, because GTX 1060 and RX 480 should easily have the horsepower and the memory to run this game at 1080p60. Quite why they cannot is somewhat bizarre, and we can only hope that Playground Games is looking to improve performance. Forza Horizon 3: the Digital Foundry verdict Everything we know about Project Scorpio How powerful Microsoft's next system will be, backwards compatibility and more. A simply beautiful Xbox One experience, Forza Horizon 3 clearly needs work on PC, but the underlying work paints a fascinating picture of Microsoft's plans in maintaining 1080p support on Xbox One while striking out to support 4K displays. Firstly, there is the fundamental question of whether 4K is worthwhile, and we'd hope that the PC vs Xbox One S gallery above answers that question comprehensively. A good-looking experience on Microsoft's existing hardware scales up beautifully to 4K, but it is interesting to note that getting the most out of ultra HD is about more than just the raw pixel count, it's about exploiting the real estate effectively: enhanced draw distances, improved textures and - yes - decent anisotropic texture filtering support. That's going to need bandwidth and RAM - which Scorpio has - but it's also going to require horsepower. We can't help but wonder whether six teraflops would actually be enough to support 4K resolution in addition to supporting the extra detail, but let's put this way - we can't wait to find out.

The news of Shimon Peres’ passing was the talk of the day at the DLD Innovation Conference, which came to a close Thursday in Tel Aviv. The original plan was for Dr. Yossi Vardi, the conference chair, to hold a public discussion with his close friend Peres on technology, high-tech and Israel’s place as a leading innovator in the world. But when Peres suffered a stroke two weeks ago, the event, at which the prize for Outstanding Startup was also to be announced, was canceled. In recent years, Peres was a splendid ambassador for Israeli high-tech. He took part in many international conferences and economic forums at which he energetically promoted the Israeli high-tech industry. Peres met with the founders of tech giants like Google, Amazon, HP and many more, and encouraged their top executives to invest in Israel and assist in technological developments and collaborative projects. Just a few months ago, the Peres Center for Peace, located in Jaffa, opened the new Israeli Innovation Center with interactive exhibitions about the inventions that have made Israel the “Startup Nation.” Read more on Shimon Peres: Peres pursued peace for sake of Israel's values, and Palestinians' dignity | Hawk to dove, pro-settlements to pro-peace: Shimon Peres was it all | The countless contradictions of the late and great Shimon Peres | Obama, world leaders mourn Peres | Shimon Peres, the eternal immigrant | Peres' quixotic battle for Israeli-Palestinian peace | Drop the kitsch: Shimon Peres had a dark side, too | Peres, 1923-2016: an interactive timeline At the center’s inauguration in July, Peres talked about how, since the state’s founding, Israel has managed – against all odds and with scant resources – to invent and manufacture from scratch leading technologies in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry, by drawing on its human capital as the most important basis for all of this. “Science, innovation and peace are our goal, and they must be there for all, not just Israel – all the nations of the region should benefit. I believe that everyone has the potential to become a scientist, and Israel must strive toward this,” Peres said. Maxine Fassberg, CEO of Intel Israel, said Thursday, “What’s left after his passing is his vision. Peres was a remarkable man of vision – in the field of technology as well. More than a decade ago, he identified the importance of the nanotech field, described it as Israel’s future and put unprecedented energy and effort into it. Every year, at the Presidential Conference that he founded, he displayed the best of Israeli tech innovations. Peres was the prophet of the high-tech superpower and someone who could really read the tech map – sometimes better than people in that field. It was a huge honor for us to host him at our plant in Kiryat Gat and to show him how we are making his vision come true.” The Israel Advanced Technology Industries, the umbrella organization of high-tech and life sciences industries in Israel, also noted Peres’ contribution: “We will always remember him as someone who for many decades promoted high-tech and life sciences in Israel, who nurtured close ties with the industry and found many ways to promote the importance of the innovative and entrepreneurial thinking at its core,” the organization said in a statement. Professor Peretz Lavie, president of the Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, said Thursday that in a letter he wrote to him in 2013, Peres said, “The researchers and scientists of the Technion, including many talented young people, are helping to situate Israel as a bold and original global laboratory at the forefront of scientific development in the world. Your path-breaking innovation knows no bounds. You are the guarantee for Israel maintaining its qualitative advantage in the future.” Lavie says that Peres was a very unique person, a man of optimism and vision, who believed in the power of science and engineering to move humanity toward a better future. He was a strong supporter of nanotechnology research and even laid the cornerstone for the Technion’s Nanoelectronics Center. At the time, this was a brand new and pioneering field, and it is now a key area of activity at the institution.

Download The Industrial Digital Connection Point: Maintenance The primary driver behind the push for digitizing industry operations today is maintenance. This holds true whether the industry is manufacturing, oil and gas or even rail transportation. By David Greenfield , Director of Content/Editor-in-Chief, on September 29, 2016 SHARE ARTICLE: FILED IN: All, Transportation, Industrial Internet of Things A panel discussion during GE's press conference at InnoTrans 2016 featured (l-r) GE's Jamie Miller, Intel's Val Stoyanov, Amsted Rail's John Felty and GE's Seth Bodnar. Siemens' Gerhard Kress delivering his presentation at InnoTrans 2016. Perspective The Industrial Digital Connection Point: Maintenance The primary driver behind the push for digitizing industry operations today is maintenance. This holds true whether the industry is manufacturing, oil and gas or even rail transportation. By David Greenfield , Director of Content/Editor-in-Chief, on September 29, 2016 SHARE ARTICLE: As the initial flurry of explanations and expectations for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) began to settle about two years ago, it became apparent that the initial proving ground for IIoT—and industrial digitalization in general—would be maintenance. For many years before, automation suppliers had been touting the need to move from scheduled or reactive maintenance processes to predictive/proactive process based on data gathered from the assets themselves. Then the surge in interest around IIoT at the corporate level provided the necessary backing to prove out the IIoT/digitalization concept—and maintenance appeared to be the most logical proving ground because of the localized nature of the deployment and the potential for a substantial return on investment year over year. This trend around IIoT, digitalization and maintenance didn’t just occur in the discrete manufacturing industries, however. It's also playing out in the oil and gas sector. And just last week, I learned that the same trend is also occurring in the rail transportation industry. At the rail industry’s massive InnoTrans event in Berlin last week, I attended presentations by two of the largest technology exhibitors at the event —GE and Siemens; both of which focused on the application of digital/IIoT technologies to maintenance. Network Disruptions During the GE press conference, GE Transportation President and CEO Jamie Miller said the biggest rail industry concern is the “disruption to networks. An hour of delay costs thousands of dollars—and dozens happen every day.” The major causes of these delays are broken rails, damaged wheels and faulty track geometry. To address this, GE is focused on “enabling self-aware trains in a connected ecosystem by linking the engine, rail and rail yard,” Miller said. “A self-aware train can gather information about itself and the environment in which it operates” to recognize and report on potential problems before they cause delays. “We’re now driving results with this approach, it’s not just a whiteboard concept” any longer. As evidence of the real world application of these concepts, GE announced its first-ever European digital pilot withDB (Deutsche Bahn) Cargo, Europe’s largest rail operator. Deutsche Bahn is using GE Transportation’s RailConnect 360 Asset Performance Management to access locomotive health status updates to increase efficiency and spot repair issues before failures occur. According to GE, this is the first step toward self-aware locomotives and digitalization of the entire rail operation value chain. Though focused on the rail industry, the similarities with GE Digital’s Brilliant Manufacturing Software Suite are apparent in that both are designed to connect and track data from a variety of sources to provide visibility into assets and operations. Both also leverage GE’s Predix software. GE Transportation has also partnered with Intel to create GoLINC— a mobile data center that provides processing, wireless communication, networking, video and data storage. Amsted Rail, a global rail component manufacturer, has integrated GoLinc with its IONX Edge monitoring system to create its Car Integrity Monitor service. Using sensors mounted on railcars, Amsted Rail receives real-time notifications about the condition of railcar components, such as broken wheels, hot bearings and handbrake application. Miller noted that GoLINC is currently being used on 6,000 locomotives and has been used in 1,400 rail car modernization projects. She emphasized that a critical aspect of GoLINC is its ability to modernize legacy rail assets without requiring owners to invest in entirely new assets to benefit from digitalization. Like RailConnect 360, GoLINC is also leverages GE’s Predix technology. Monitoring and Analysis as a Service Siemens approach to digitalization for the rail industry combines data science with domain expertise. In his presentation at InnoTrans 2016, Gerhard Kress, director of Siemens Mobility Data Services, highlighted Siemens’ Smart Monitoring and Smart Data Analysis—a service enabled by Siemens Digital Services business of which Kress’s Mobility Data Services Center in Munich is a part. Siemens Digital Services reportedly combines all of Siemens remote analytics and maintenance services on a single technological base called Sinalytics. The company says it has consolidated these activities on Sinalytics to connect the technological components needed for data integration and analysis, connectivity and cybersecurity. Using massive parallel processing for scalable data storage and in-database analytics, Kress said the Siemens Sinalytics platform used by the Mobility Data Services Center relies on more than 200 CPU cores to handle all the data, analysis and data quality validations. He noted that analytics are conducted in the Sinlaytics database because there’s “too much data collected to be moved elsewhere for processing. Rail vehicles send between one and four billion data points per year—far beyond the amount of data transmitted in typical IT analysis applications.” The Mobility Data Services Center is comprised of a team of data scientists, physicists, transportation engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians who analyze the diagnostic data being collected from rail vehicles and rail line infrastructure components. They then develop algorithms and models using machine learning, data analytics, mathematical and physical methodologies to provide secure forecasts for the future behavior of vehicles and components. According to Siemens, “secure”—in this case—means a probability of well over 90 percent that the forecast will be accurate. “Collecting and analyzing this train data ensures there are no surprises for the operator or the passenger,” Kress said. “The value to the operating company is improved maintenance, root cause analysis of failure, reduction of preventative maintenance cost, and increase in availability. Imagine having your assets be 100 percent available.” Kress maintains this level of availability is possible and pointed to one example Siemens has been running in the field using Siemens Digital Services for more than 50 months without missing a failure.

The XPG SX8000 drives promise up to 2.4 GB/s read speed as well as the enhanced reliability of 3D NAND. ADATA’s XPG SX8000 lineup of SSDs will include 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB and 1 TB configurations, offering different levels of performance at different price points. The drives are based on Silicon Motion’s SM2260 controller (which sports two ARM Cortex cores, has eight NAND flash channels, LDPC ECC technology, 256-bit AES support and so on) and 3D MLC NAND flash from an unknown manufacturer (IMFT is the most likely supplier, but SK Hynix is a possible supplier as well). The drives come in M.2-2280 form-factor and use PCIe 3.0 x4 interface. The manufacturer rates XPG SX8000’s sequential read performance at up to 2400 MB/s and its write performance at up to 1000 MB/s when pseudo-SLC caching is used. As for random performance, the new drives can deliver up to 100K/140K 4KB read/write IOPS.  It is important to note that the 128 GB model is considerably slower than other SKUs in the family and the drive needs 512 GB configuration to demonstrate all the capabilities of the SM2260 controller.

Moreover, thanks to improved reliability of 3D NAND compared to traditional planar NAND made using ultra-small process technology, the manufacturer also rates the XPG SX8000 for two million hours MTBF, 0.5 million (or 33%) higher compared to previous-gen XPG SSDs. For several years, Samsung has been the only supplier of high-end SSDs based on 3D MLC NAND flash memory, offering high performance and improved reliability. Recently companies like IMFT started mass production of their 3D NAND for SSDs and independent makers of drives can now release their own SSDs featuring 3D MLC flash. Being one of the largest suppliers of NAND-based storage devices, ADATA is naturally among the first to offer advanced SSDs powered by 3D MLC with its XPG SX8000 family. But what is noteworthy is that last month Micron (which co-owns IMFT with Intel) decided to cancel its 3D MLC/SM2260-based Crucial Ballistix TX3 M.2 SSDs for an undisclosed reason. As a result, ADATA gets to join a rather exclusive club of non-Samsung M.2 NVMe drive vendors. Unfortuantely however, prices have yet to be announced, so we'll have to see if (and by how much) ADATA pushes prices below what Toshiba and Samsung have been charging for their own M.2 NVMe SSDs. Finally, along with today's release, ADATA is also prepping an upgraded version of the XPG SX8000 due in late October, which will feature increased performance. The upcoming SSDs are primarily geared towards desktop users and will require a heatsink, making them incompatible with the vast majority of notebooks.

POST A COMMENT 14 Comments View All Comments eek2121 - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link I use an ADATA budget SSD for my steam drive. It works fairly well, except random performance can suck sometimes (though I'm using it in a USB 3.0 enclosure, so that might be part of it). That being said, if ADATA can bring solid pricing to the M.2 market they might have a decent offering. However, right now, Samsung has a few awesome offerings that will make it very hard for ADATA to compete unless they compromise on price. Reply Meteor2 - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link 'the manufacturer also rates the XPG SX8000 for two million hours MTBF, 0.5 million (or 25%) higher compared to previous-gen XPG SSDs.' -- that's actually 33% higher. Reply Chaitanya - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link eagerly waiting for review, especially with Samsung having recently announced their new 960 series of NVME SSDs. Reply milli - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link "But what is noteworthy is that last month Micron (which co-owns IMFT with Intel) decided to cancel its 3D MLC/SM2260-based Crucial Ballistix TX3 M.2 SSDs for an undisclosed reason." Pretty obvious that the reason is performance. It seems that the SM2260 is slowest of the bunch. Barely faster than the two year old Marvell 88SS9293. The SM2260 is not really meant for the high end. I wonder why anyone would chose it over the Phison PS5007-E7. Reply ddriver - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link 5 years warranty sounds good, but "them speeds" are more akin TLC than MLC. Not that sequential performance are a critical factor, not at those levels anyway, and it could make up on random access, which samsung ain't too great at despite their high sequential transfer rates. The market needs competition, there are plenty of "competitors" but in reality samsung is like 50% of the market, pretty much dominating even in the presence of big boys like intel. Reply AnandReader1999 - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link The reason Samsung dominates is because their performance is way higher. These ADATA chips can't even compete with the old 950 line M.2 chips (non-oem). Reply Gondalf - Monday, October 03, 2016 - link Still Samsung is only 35% in revenue, looking at units sold and silicon utilized they are worse than others, for example worse than Intel and Toshiba in fact they have a better utilization of involved silicon wafers. It is not all gold in Samsung house, and now they have a lot of new contenders in 3D drivers. Only OEM final prices will say who will be the winner in upcoming years. One thing is almost certain, their 3D NAND tech is not the denser of the market and this could give big problems in the upcoming price war. V-NAND is a bit faster but right now is a disaster in number of layers needed to be on pair with competitors. Reply Mr Perfect - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link Did ADATA release write endurance numbers as far as TBs written? A straight MTBF is kind of useless on a SSD, seeing as it's writing to the flash hat typically kills them, not run time. Also, as a side note, has anyone noticed the ads on Anandtech get hilariously bad lately? They're not even close to being tech related.Revcontent seems to think your audience is interested in one weird old trick to "restore" 20/20 vision(they inserted the quote marks, not me). Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link FYI: Endurance is a useless number on SSDs these days. Don't worry about endurance, because unless you're using a consumer-drive for enterprise workloads (ie: 24/7 heavy I/O) then the drive's warranty will be out far before NAND endurance causes data loss. These days, the best indicator of the actual use-life of the drive is the manufacturer's warranty time. They carefully pick this number to have warranty end, given average workloads and usage, so that the vast majority (~90%) of customers still have working drives before the warranty ends. Reply AnandReader1999 - Friday, September 30, 2016 - link These are most definitely NOT high end Nvme M.2 sticks. They are for ADATA but not for the market. The Samsung 960 M.2 line absolutely crush these. These are not even a match for last years 950 line M.2. They are definitely superior to any M.2 stick that uses a SATA controller chip or any SATA SSD. Of course they will need to be priced in between an SSD SATA 6.0 Gbs drive and a true Nvme M.2. If they are smart they should be priced very close to the Sata drives and it will steal that market share.

The morning Inbox struggles to put together a cheap but powerful gaming PC, as one reader demands a better Godzilla game. To join in with the discussions yourself email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk   XCOM needs you As a huge fan of both the XCOM games, and turn-based strategy games, I’ve been hugely looking forward to XCOM 2 coming out on console this week. So much so that I felt compelled to write in to say that I hope we all support this excellent game and I really hope that it sells well on console in general, it certainly deserves to. We need to show these publishers that us console gamers are not just into first and third person shooters and racers (as fun as they are), and that a lot of us also appreciate quality strategy games with some depth, as well as other genres. For all those that are getting it, good luck commanders. Spartas Edge   Saving money Well, I have finally given in and bought The Last Of Us Remastered. Even though I had it for PS3. But at a price of only £11.99 it is worth another play through. However, I seem to have found a bug that stops you saving the game! I have checked on the Internet and this bug has been around for years. And hasn’t been sorted yet! Is there a way to get a refund on a game from PlayStation store? On a better note… XCOM 2 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is only £30 from Tesco Direct, let’s hope you can save in that. SJH1973 (PSN ID) GC: They do give refunds, but tend to be very strict about it. Especially if you’ve already played the game a lot.   First choice I just picked up a white 500GB PlayStation 4 for £149.99 with FIFA 17 disc copy from Smyths! They had a midnight launch for the game but the deal runs until Sunday if anyone is looking to pick one up. GAME and Argos are going to be doing similar deals apparently too. So my question GC, is what games would you suggest? However, whenever someone asks people always say Bloodborne and Until Dawn, etc. and while they may be good games they don’t appeal to me personally. But I see a lot of more obscure Japanese games that look very different to what’s available on the Xbox One and that’s what I’m after something a bit different. So which ones would you and the readers recommend? Big Angry Dad82 (gamertag) GC: XCOM 2.   E-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk   Switching classes I am fine with Destiny 2 not carrying my guardians’ data across, as long as the classes in Destiny 2 are significantly different from those in Destiny 1. One of the original criticisms with Destiny 1 is that the three classes are not that different from one another. The Titan has slightly more armour, the Warlock heals slightly quicker, and the Hunter was slightly more mobile. To solve this problem and add more variety in guardian classes Bungie needs to wipe the slate clean and create new classes which are more diverse. If they have done this I will be happy to start with a new guardian. If, however, Destiny 2 has the exact same three guardian classes with the same three sub classes then I will definitely not be happy having to essentially relevel the same characters again. If the split between the main guardian types is still narrow, then any modifications to existing subclasses could be done with additional or revised perks and should not require a complete reset. Essentially, if Bungie are stopping people transferring their guardians because they are reimagining the guardians themselves I am happy. If they are just doing it to make structuring the game easier for themselves and stop players rushing through the new game I am not. PazJohnMitch PS: In relation to the question you asked at the end of my last letter: Yes, I think three months of play from Rise Of Iron would justify the price tag.   The new Guardian Now that The Last Guardian is actually coming out (maybe, probably) it’s good to see Beyond Good & Evil 2 taking up the mantle of the world’s most delayed and least seen game ever. I’d like to think that two new bits of artwork in a month means something, instead of one new bit a year, but I’d be feeling a lot more optimistic if they’d been screenshots. Given Michel Ancel’s weird French sense of humour I’m not even sure I’d bet that he’s really working on the game. I mean, if it’s been going on this long they must have a few screenshots to share, surely? Maybe even a video? Why just show artwork which could mean they only started work on it this week? If it doesn’t show up as part of the NX announcement I don’t think we’ll ever see it, no matter how many pictures he puts up on Instagram. Timbo   Monster omission Probably not something that keeps many people up at night but isn’t it weird how there’s never been a decent Godzilla game? You would’ve though with Japan being the spiritual home of gaming they’d have been all over that. Or at least an unofficial knock-off. But the only half decent ones was that Power Stone style fighting game by an American company. It’s a bit like how there’s never really been a definitive ninja game either. So many easy goals missed, while they waste their time trying to make games they think will appeal to Americans. Anyway, the point of this letter is that I played the latest Godzilla game and it sucked. Bring back War Of The Monsters I say. Kazboo   Starting from scratch It’s hard not to feel that No Man’s Sky has earned most of its bad reputation, but I wonder what people would feel about a sequel. If, rather than just adding little bits here and there (if indeed that is their plan) they just admit the whole thing didn’t really work out as planned and decide to start it all again. Would you buy a sequel? Although I might be tempted, because I liked the original idea so much. I have to assume that most people would not. And I really can’t blame them. I think Hello Games have basically ruined their reputation, and I don’t see anyone trusting them again. To be honest, I don’t see them lasting very long as a company either. Which is a shame. Talk about zero to hero to villain. Signor   Catch up on every previous Games Inbox here   The price is wrong Well, what a palaver I’ve had researching PC gaming units! I’m currently the owner of a PlayStation 4, Wii U, and New 3DS, and I’m hoping to jump ship from my PlayStation 4 to a capable PC. I have a budget of around £500/£600 for just the unit base and I’m also hoping to build the little beauty myself. So, off I went researching on the Internet, YouTube asking tech savvy friends to ask their friends that know a thing or two about builds. I’d be happy with a build that can produce only slightly better graphics than my PlayStation 4 and over time I can then upgrade the system incrementally. Thing is, apparently a £500/£600 build doesn’t get you much: CPU: Intel Core i3 – £124 Motherboard: AS Rock H1708 – £73 RAM: 8GB – £73 Graphics Card: AMD Radeon 480 4GB – £209 Hard Drive: 1TB – £40 SSD: 120GB – £40 Power: Corsair – £33 Case: Cool Master 130 Elite – £45 Operating System: £40 Total = £677.00 So, apparently, despite this build costing quite a lot of money… it’s not very good and is considered to be in the lower end of PC builds. You’d expect for almost over double the price of a PS4 Pro that this machine would be an absolute machine, playing Witcher 3 on maximum, etc., etc… but apparently not. So, based on the above, why would I jump ship? It seems some GCers have off the back of the PS4 Pro iteration, but have they jumped and spent £600+?! I’d be very interested to hear of some readers builds to obtain ‘next gen’ capabilities that has torn them away from their PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. It seems like a very expensive jump for not very much of an upgrade? Or, I’m an idiot/noob. I’d be happy for GC to disclose my email address to any helpful readers. ObsoletePaul (PSN ID)   Inbox also-rans I’m a sucker for all things Battlefield. I bought the Ultimate Edition from Xbox Store, so I get it on the 17th. I also get a month’s worth of EA Access, but I already have it so you can give the code to anyone you like. I also have a code for the Warthog on Forza Horizon 3, though I think a lot of people may have this code too. woz 007 (gamertag)/woz_007 (NN ID) GC: Thanks very much, we’ll hand it out as first come, first served. A friend of mine recently lent someone both his PlayStation 4 controllers, now he has got them back and they will only turn on for a few seconds and will not charge. Any ideas? Mark GC: Get better friends?   This week’s Hot Topic The subject for this weekend’s Inbox was suggested by reader Hero10, who asks if you could wipe your memory of any video game, and play it again for the first time, what would you choose? It doesn’t necessarily have to be your favourite game, but one where the experience was never quite the same the second time around; either because of unexpected plot twists, gameplay elements, or just the shock of the new. Would you be worried that you wouldn’t enjoy the game as much if you played it again, with no memory or knowledge of it from before? Perhaps because of advances in technology, or other similar games, or simply because your tastes have changed since the first time around?

The company is expected to show off the Pixel and Pixel XL phones, Pixel 3 laptop, Google Home, and its Operating System 'Andromeda,' and more. Here’s everything you need to know about Google’s October 4th event. Google Pixel and Pixel XL Phones Google is getting ready to release two new phones called Google Pixel and Pixel XL. The Pixel and Pixel XL will be similar, except for their size. The Pixel will have a 5-inch display, while the Pixel Xl will have a 5.5-inch display. Both phones will have Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 821 processor, 4GB of RAM, 12-megapixel cameras, fingerprint scanners, and great battery power. Based on the images that have leaked, both phones will have sleek aluminum and glass designs. The Pixel and The Pixel XL will have headphone jacks, according to Android Police. Both phones will start at $649, which will help them compete against some of Apple and Samsung’s top phones. The Pixel and Pixel XL will be expected to launch with Android 7.1 Nougat. There aren’t too many details about Android 7.1 Nougat’s features, but we can expect it will be good. Google Home Is Amazon Echo’s Rival Google announced Google Home back at its I/O developer conference in May, so we can expect to learn a lot more about it next week, including where you can buy it and how much it will cost. According to Android Police, Google Home will cost $129. We’re not sure of the exact release date yet, but it will most likely be in stores before shopping season. With Google Home, users can do everything from playing music, adjusting thermostats or control internet-connected lights. Though, Amazon announced its $50 Echo Dog, which is available for pre-order. Google Home can help answer questions about TV shows, sports, science, or anything else you can think of.

It’s said that Andromeda will combine both elements of Chrome OS and Android, and will be for laptops and tablets. Android Police believes Google will announce the Pixel 3 laptop codenamed “Bison” which will show off 'Andromeda.' The Pixel 3 laptop will sport a 12.3-inch screen, either an Intel m3 or Core i5 processor and will have up to 10 hours of battery life. Chromecast Ultra In addition, Google’s Chromecast Ultra could be introduced at the October 4th event. It’s said the Chromecast Ultra will support 4K and HDR and will cost $70. While the Chromecast Ultra is  more expensive than the standard Chromecast, it has some pretty awesome capabilities.

If you're on a budget and don't mind adjusting to Google's Chrome OS, it could be worth a shot.

Running Google's Chrome OS and supporting a wide range of applications through Google's Play Store, the Chromebook is a less expensive alternative to a Windows-based notebook while offering a higher level of productivity than a tablet. To be clear, the Acer Chromebook R11 looks like a small notebook. It has a full QWERTY keyboard and touchpad along with an 11.6" IPS panel. The panel does support touch, and you can flip it 360 degrees and turn the Chromebook R11 into a tablet.     The biggest difference between a Chromebook and a low-cost notebook is the Chrome OS. The Chrome OS is based on the Linux kernel and offers the same applications you might download for your Android phone. These days you can do most things through your browser, and since most people already use Google Chrome on their desktop, notebook, or phone, the shift from a Windows-based OS to one based on the Chrome OS should be simple enough.   Since the Chrome OS is specifically designed to work with the Chromebook R11, it should be possible to optimize user experience. The Acer Chromebook R11 is my first encounter with the Chrome OS, but I do use a Samsung S6 as my daily phone, and I also use Chrome for browsing.   Follow me as we explore the world of the Acer Chromebook R11.     Specifications     The Chromebook R11 that we received uses an Intel Celeron N3060 dual-core CPU that runs at 1.6GHz, 4GB of DDR3L, 16GB of internal flash storage, Wireless AC, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, HDMI, SD card reader, and an 11.6" color touch IPS LCD with a resolution of 1366x768.   It's very thin and lightweight at 0.8"x11.6"x8" (HxWxD) and 2.76 lbs.     Pricing   The Chromebook R11 (CB5-132T-C8ZW, as reviewed) costs $279.99.

The continued growth in IT security opportunities correlates with metamorphoses in both the technology sector and the security world. Indeed, during the last two years, just about every aspect of IT security has been utterly transformed. Not only are there more lethal threats than ever, but the way IT security is deployed and managed has changed fundamentally. A few years ago it was enough to deploy antivirus software and a firewall. A few organizations might have gone the additional step of relying on a service provider to enhance their overall security posture. But by and large, those organizations represented a minority of the overall IT market. Fast-forward to today, and now the assumption is that more corporate networks have been compromised to one degree or another. Antivirus software and firewalls are still important in preventing even more attacks from penetrating the perimeter. However, thanks mainly to the rise of sophisticated social engineering techniques, end users are regularly fooled into downloading some form of malware. No amount of IT security will be able to protect end users from themselves. New IT Security Services Challenges Call for New Solutions Addressing new IT security services challenges requires new tools and techniques. IT organizations have begun investing at a rapid clip in advanced analytics applications that help them discover faster where malware is hiding inside the enterprise, for example. Once identified, the focus then quickly moves to isolating the infected systems, removing the malware and remediating the vulnerability that the malware was trying to exploit. That closed-loop approach to IT security, however, requires access to new tools and the expertise needed to run them. For that reason, interest in all forms of IT security technologies delivered as some type of cloud service is on the rise. "What's happening is new layers of security are being implemented between the cloud and the perimeter," said Gartner analyst Mike Dorosh. "There's a lot more orchestration now between all the security technologies being put in place." Solving Managed Security Services Challenges Enter managed security services challenges and opportunities. As IT organizations discover what's involved in achieving that level of orchestration, it becomes apparent that they don't have the internal expertise required to implement these technologies, Dorosh said. As a consequence, it's only a matter of time before they begin to rely more on IT security delivered as a managed service, he said. The good news is that work on the platforms needed to deliver these closed-loop approaches to IT security is advancing rapidly. For example, Sophos just launched an IT security management platform that leverages big data analytics to better identify threats, such as ransomware. Once the threat is detected, Sophos Integrity is designed to automatically quarantine the endpoint affected, while in real time making unencrypted copies of any of the data that a piece of malware might be trying to encrypt. In a similar vein, Splunk has partnered with more than a dozen IT security vendors to create its Adaptive Response framework,which leverages machine data and machine learning algorithms to reduce the amount of time it takes to determine what actions to take when a threat is detected. Meanwhile, Cloudera, a provider of a distribution of Hadoop, at the recent Strata + Hadoop World 216 conference announced a proposal in collaboration with Intel that would donate Spot to the Apache Software Foundation. Formerly called Open Network Insight, Spot is an open-source project started by Intel that seeks to increase visibility into security threats using big data analytics and machine learning. Demand for cloud security services provided by both Trend Micro and Symantec is way up, said Daniel Saks, president and co-CEO of AppDirect, a distributor of cloud services. "Security creates an opportunity for the channel to add value via the cloud," Saks said. 12                     Submit a Comment Loading Comments...

By Dealnews.com September 30, 2016 Save for later Saved Certain back-to-school items — such as denim — are still on sale with deals that won't get any better. Business Wire/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of October can be a precarious month for shoppers. Although it's packed with respectable sales thanks to Columbus Day and  Halloween, it's also the month when we first see Black Friday ads and leaks. As a result, some shoppers may feel the need to abstain from making any purchases this month. But we're here to tell you that October is actually a great month for some purchases, as long as you're making the right ones. Below, we've created a list of 9 items you should buy this month, alongside a list of 9 items that will be cheaper in November. That way you know you're getting the most out of your buck. Still uncertain about what to buy? Be sure to sign up for the  DealNews Select Newsletter so you don't miss one of the best deals. Recommended: Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. 9 Deals You Should Buy in October If you're putting off the following purchases because you think you'll score a better deal next month, then think again! These items are at their hottest this month. Test your knowledge Are you a smart shopper? Take our quiz. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 Cars October is traditionally one of the best months to purchase a new car. By now, hundreds of 2017 models have entered the market and dealerships are more eager than ever to clear out 2016's inventory. That means consumers have the upper hand when it comes time to negotiate. According to MarketWatch, the longer you wait to buy a car,  the greater the bargain you'll find. However, don't wait too long; by November and December, selection can become an issue. So head to the dealership now! Costumes Make no mistake, the best time to buy a  Halloween costume is on the day after Halloween, when retailers discount all of their unsold costumes by as much as 75% with stackable coupons and free shipping. However, most people don't buy their costumes that far in advance, so the second-best time to purchase one is during the week before Halloween. That week, you'll find sales that range from 20% to 70% off from retailers like  Spirit Halloween, Oriental Trading, and  Hot Topic. On October 29 last year, Amazon even offered free one-day shipping while slashing up to 70% off costumes. On October 29 last year, Amazon offered free one-day shipping while slashing up to 70% off costumes. Gamers should also take note that for the past few years  Steam has been holding its own Halloween sale, taking up to 90% off a selection of horror- and zombie-based video games like The Walking Dead and Plants vs. Zombies, with prices starting as low as 19 cents. European Vacations According to travel expert Rick Steves, October can be an excellent time to book a  European vacation, since October is the start of Europe's off-season. That means travelers will "find more budget rooms, spend less time in lines, and meet more Europeans than tourists." Combined with a  strong dollar, that means travelers can expect to have an overall better vacation experience while saving money on the side. Patio Furniture New patio furniture is probably the last thing on your shopping list this month, but the truth is October can be a great time for  patio furniture deals. Retailers are desperately clearing out their inventory, so look for up to 70% off at  Sears,  Target, and eBay, as well as stackable coupons that will increase savings. 55" 1080p LCD HDTVs We've said it before and we'll say it again,  Black Friday is the best time of the year to purchase a new HDTV. However, in years past, we've noticed that 55" sets didn't drop much in price. That's because this category size has hit a price plateau, meaning retailers have discounted them as much as they're willing to. You can currently find  deals on 55" HDTVs for about $400, which is the same price we're predicting for Black Friday. So if you're in the market for a TV in this size range, you might as well purchase it this month, as it won't drop significantly next month. Moreover, by making your purchase this month, you can shop at your leisure and avoid the stress of shopping during the holidays. Jeans Back-to-school sales have come and gone, but certain back-to-school items — such as denim — are still on sale with deals that won't get any better. Last year,  Amazon discounted designers like Lucky Brand and 7 For All Mankind, cutting 50% off and offering free shipping.  Levi's had its own sale, cutting up to 75% off. Come November, these discounts won't be as strong, or if they are, they'll have certain purchase or shipping requirements. So your best bet is to shop now and enjoy the same discounts without the purchase requirements. Camping Gear Although you won't find sales on winter sports gear, October is still a great month for  deals on end-of-season outdoor gear like water sports and hiking equipment. Shop Backcountry Outlet, CampSaver Outlet, and  Cabela's forr sales that knock from 40% to 60% off select merchandise. While it's likely you'll see similar sales in November, the sales are more frequent in October and come with no minimum purchase requirements. Wait Until Black Friday to Buy... While there are some great deals in October, there's no denying that November is a month full of stunningly low prices on a variety of electronics and other goods. Below we've focused on some of the bigger  Black Friday deals that you should plan to buy in November. Appliances Although appliance manufacturers tend to release their new models in September and October, it turns out that November is actually the better month for deals on large appliances. That's because many of these items will be deeply discounted during Black Friday as stores like  Home Depot, Sears, and  Lowe's kick off their sitewide sales. Our deal archives show that November will on average offer more than twice as many appliance deals than we see during any other month of the year. Our deal archives show that November will offer more than twice as many appliance deals than we see during any other month of the year. Also, roughly 16% of our November appliance deals were marked Editors' Choice last year. By comparison, only 4% are marked as such during October. Winter Apparel As a general rule of thumb, you should never buy apparel that's in-season because you'll wind up paying higher prices for it. However, Black Friday is the exception. Every clothing retailer from Macy's to  JCrew will discount its cold weather apparel and accessories, which means it's worth waiting until November to refresh your stock of sweaters, hats, and gloves. Expect apparel retailers to offer their best coupons of the year with discounts that can take up to 50% off or more from your purchase. However, there's an exception to the exception! Don't look for big discounts on winter coats like parkas on Black Friday. The best deals for these come in January. Most Apple Devices Retailers crushed the Apple Store's Black Friday sale last November. And although we're used to seeing that every year, last November was an exceptionally great month for  Apple deals as we saw dozens of deals on Apple's MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone, iMac, and iPad mini. This year we expect to see a repeat, particularly on the 11" MacBook Air and iPad Air 2, which have not been refreshed recently. Deals on the iPhone 6 and 6s will also be hot, as the  iPhone 7 is now the current-gen model. Laptops November is the best time of the year to  buy a new laptop. If your budget is tight, we expect to see 11" budget notebooks as low as $99, a price we've seen for the past several Black Fridays. If you require a more sophisticated machine with current-generation hardware, such as one of Intel's latest processors, then you'll want to look at 15" mainstream models, which could hit as low as $300. Expect to find these sales from retailers like Amazon,  Best Buy, and Staples. HDTVs HDTVs are the meat and potatoes of most Black Friday sales. For many screen sizes, you simply won't find better deals any other time of the year. And with prices that start as low as $70 (for a 32" set), it's no wonder most shoppers wait all year to buy their TVs in November. And if you think its only off-brand TVs that see discounts, think again. Last year we saw an increase in the number of name-brand 4K HDTV deals, and we can  expect that to occur again this November. General Electronics November is the best month of the year for making general  electronics purchases. That means you'll find price lows on tablets, cameras, home theater gear, and media players. Unfortunately, there's no way of guaranteeing that the specific device you want will go on sale next month, but the chances are in your favor that at least one retailer will discount it. Photo Services The holidays are a great time not just for taking pictures, but also printing them. During the week of Black Friday we traditionally see sales from a variety of  photo printing services. Last year, for instance, Shutterfly, Walgreens, and Groupon all offered their best deals of the year on printing and personalized items for Black Friday. Ready to put this information to use?

Unified Streaming, as a partner in the Superfluidity project, is helping to develop and define that reality. With an all-star consortium of telecom and IT experts across Europe and Israel onboard, this European Commission initiative aims to imbue the 5G network with the property of superfluidity. That is, the state at which matter has zero viscosity and therefore flows – like fluid. It may sound mystical, but Superfluidity’s objectives are concrete: to empower new business models that require rapid mobility of network and service functions close to end users, to enable innovative use cases and to reduce startup and operational costs. That implies the ability to instantiate services on-the-fly, run them anywhere in the network and shift them transparently to different locations. Superfluidity is part of the 5G Public Private Partnership (5G PPP for short), under the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. Unified Streaming’s crucial role in Superfluidity is to deploy video streaming software on top of the architecture and technologies being applied in the project. By doing so, Unified Streaming addresses widespread technical weaknesses, such as overprovisioning, and promotes optimisation overall. According to Unified Streaming R&D engineer Rufael Mekuria: “The ‘Network 2020’ will facilitate on-the-go data center resource scaling and network location independent deployment of Unified Streaming products. These can then run as network functions in a virtualised cloud native network, enabling more resource efficient deployments. Further, we will use these technologies to realise more personalised and easier-to-manage video delivery network chains for the benefit of our customers.” Unified Streaming recognises that video streaming has varying demands and a superfluid network architecture can bolster support of them. Superfluidity promises to revolutionise the old design by providing high-performance network components and services that decompose into reusable software units and are, in turn, embedded into a native, converged cloud-based network. Benefits to a superfluid 5G network include: location independence of network services in heterogeneous networks time independence via instantaneous deployment and migration of services scale independence for almost unlimited and transparent service scalability hardware independence via development and deployment of services with high performance, irrespective of underlying hardware. Unified Streaming’s fellow consortium members include multinational telecom and IT companies, SMEs and academic institutions. They are: Citrix, Intel, NEC, Nokia (serving as Technical Coordinator), OnApp, Red Hat; British Telecommunications , PT Inovação – Altice Labs, Telefónica, I+D; EBlink and Telcaria; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, CNIT led by the University of Rome Tor Vergata (serving as Project Coordinator), Dresden University of Technology, Politehnica University of Bucharest and the University of Liège.

Instead of filling a map with icons and distractions, it pulled players along a tight story with little room for wider exploration. Mafia 3 attempts to change this with an open-world full of activity markers. The game ditches its predecessor's Brylcreem-loving Sicilians and the story takes place two decades later in the New Bordeaux – a fictional analogue of New Orleans. New Bordeaux is gorgeous, the period’s abhorrent racial tension is respectfully replicated, and Mafia 3’s revenge story is told via some of the most convincingly-acted out cutscenes I’ve seen. It’s just a shame that you’re forced to repeat the same tedious activities to see them. For the first four hours, during its linear prologue, Mafia 3 is superb but, as soon as it embraces its open-world design, it yet again all falls apart. Mafia 3 Preview: You learn about the game’s protagonist, Lincoln Clay, via documentary-style clips, told decades later by people affected, or through testimonies during a trial. Like Mafia 2’s protagonist, Vito Scaletta, Lincoln begins the game returning home after war, though his tour was in Vietnam. Related: PlayStation VR review Seeing things from Lincoln’s perspective, as a black man in New Orleans during such a turbulent time, is one of the game’s biggest strengths. It’s distressing to hear racially-charged language in a videogame, but you should be taken aback, you should be shocked and you should feel uncomfortable – this was a very real part of our recent history and to pretend it wasn’t like this would be disrespectful to those who lived it. In New Bordeaux, some places don’t allow black people entry at all, while others force them to enter through the establishment’s rear entrance. It’s a Mafia game where you don’t play as a mafioso. Mafia 3 instead wants you to tear the organisation to pieces and build your own empire in the ashes. I won’t spoil Lincoln’s motivations for revenge, but damn is he good at it. Lincoln was at home in the bloodsoaked and napalm-scorched paddy fields of ‘Nam, and he feels just as comfortable dishing out street justice in New Bordeaux. Buy Now Mafia 3 at Amazon.com from $57 Mafia 3’s gunplay feels punchy and brutal, with headshots accompanied by a satisfying pop and a crimson spray, soaking the walls and floor around your victim. Each shot causes enemies to clutch a limb or reel from the force – upon death they tumble over boxes or slump over satisfyingly, thanks to a weighty physics model. Moving in and out of cover feels fluid, so you’re often pro-active on the battlefield, trying to close the range instead of sitting behind cover and popping heads from a distance. The guns all feel great, too, from rat-rat machine guns to devastating hand-cannons. The enemy AI lets combat down, however, thanks to simplistic behaviour. Shotgunners just walk towards you to try and score a close-range shot, while other enemies duck behind cover, leaving the top of their heads exposed, taking potshots. The occasional molotov forcing you to move doesn’t sufficiently spice things up. Often I would find myself using stealth to try bypass shootouts and shift up the pace myself. The stealth is simple: one button causes Lincoln to crouch, and then it’s just a case of getting near someone and tapping melee, causing him to drive a knife through their eye, throw them to the floor and stamp his boot on their face, of one of many other vicious takedowns. Bizarrely, there is also an option for non-lethal stealth animations, but it’s tucked away in the pause menu. You only know about it because a tutorial tooltip informs you once you get your hands on the knife. Related: Gears of War 4 review Those tooltips are a constant pain, too. 20 hours in, the game is still telling you how to dismantle criminal rackets, even though it’s all you’ve been doing for the last 15 hours. You’re just killing dudes, but Mafia 3 seems intent on making it appear like there’s some depth hidden beneath the gore. There isn’t. Then there are tooltips that you do need, like when you’re told how to shoot and ram while driving. I wasn’t informed of this until around the 15-hour mark, even after I’d been involved in a few of the rare car chases. Driving around New Bordeaux, thankfully, feels great. The cars are all angry, heavy things that swing around corners, fishtailing in wide arcs. They all drive like American muscles, and they all feel like beasts that need taming. Skidding around a corner in the heat haze of New Bordeaux as Creedence Clearwater Revival, Jimi Hendrix or The Rolling Stones blast out of the speakers feels incredible, but you’re only ever driving to and from repetitive missions. Unfortunately, an amazing soundtrack, solid gunplay, good acting and fun driving unfortunately aren’t enough to mask over Mafia 3’s largest issue. After the prologue, you’re free to explore New Bordeaux as you see fit, and that’s when Mafia 3 turns into a game about hoovering up map icons. Things kick off properly when you’re tasked with recruiting three underbosses: one from the Irish, one from the Haitians and one from the Italians. You do this by taking down rackets to draw out a rival mobster who’s running them. Each enemy mobster has a monetary value assigned to them, so you go around their businesses destroying merchandise, stealing money – which is usually dotted around the place, even found on the back of toilets systems – and killing dudes. Once you’ve done enough damage, you can then go for the boss, who will most likely be in one of the places you just fought your way through, though now all the enemies will have respawned and it’ll be all tidied up. So you go and do the mission again, but with a guy who can survive about five headshots to fight at the end. You have to do this whole process twice to recruit each underboss, and, then, when they’re recruited, a cutscene tells you that you have to do it all again about ten more times. Almost the entire game is compulsory filler missions. Related: Best PS4 Games Coupled with Mafia 3’s many technical issues, the repetition soon begins to grate, and it only serves to highlight more issues. When all you’re doing is sneaking and fighting through nondescript businesses, you can’t help but put the game’s core under more scrutiny, so the floating NPCs, oncoming traffic popping into existence, enemies who don’t react and bodies clipping through scenery stand out even more. At one point I had to load a previous checkpoint because I escaped the police by swimming through a canal, but there was no way for Lincoln to climb out. It feels like the game would have benefitted from another year in development. Nothing is as strong as it should be, technical issues are a common and annoying occurrence, and its uninspired mission design drags the whole package down. There are things I like about Mafia 3, but as a complete package it’s massively flawed and a huge step backwards after Mafia 2. Verdict Mafia 3 is the biggest disappointment of the year. It’s a game with masses of potential, but unfortunately that potential is wasted on by-the-numbers open-world game design. The first few hours tease the game that could have been if it hadn’t succumbed to the open-world bloat. This is a solid eight-hour game stretched far too thin. Mafia 3 has an interesting setting and a great cast of characters, but its lack of focus undermines everything it’s trying to do, and that’s a damn shame.

Actually recorded the first 45minutes of the game for anyone wanting to get a feel for the game before hand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?... Paul Chach Mcarthy October 10, 2016, 12:48 pm False positive review. Other sites are dishing the truth on this generic average sandbox-em up. The story seems to be the main draw for this game but is it truly that unique to see an angry black man protagonist taking brutal revenge against white racists? Nope. That trope was worn out decades back with the advent of blaxploitation films. So if you remove the standard angry black man trope story that appears to have been written by BLM, then there isn't much left to recommend this game, aside from the soundtrack, which you can listen to for free on YT. So it is not worth the full price unless you are an sjw who thinks hearing the "N" word repeated infinitely is "edgy and original". Jordan Richardson October 10, 2016, 6:01 pm This story is not about a black man taking revenge against white racists. But a man taking revenge against the italian mafia who betrayed and murdered his family and friends in the black mob after a joint heist. The racial tension comes from the time period and how it brilliantly incorporates the racial tension from that period. But the story, in in of itself is just brilliant due to the amazing characters and acting. Chris_34 October 10, 2016, 6:19 pm Would like to know how "the biggest disappointment of the year" equates to "False positive review". And the review says (albeit with better phrasing) it's a "generic average sandbox-em up". What a baffling comment. Frank Lovejoy October 10, 2016, 6:39 pm What a load of toss. It amazes me that coastal hipsters who can't even remember the 90s think they know all about racism in America. In 1968, which is when this game is set, black people were not 'forced to enter via the back door' of establishments. Schools had already been desegregated for years, even in Louisiana (the fight over that happened in 1960). There certainly was (and is) racism in the area, largely because in the South black and white people live and work together (unlike in the North where social justice hipsters live in segregated gated communities as far from anyone unlike them as possible, while lecturing us all about 'abhorrent racism'). James A October 11, 2016, 1:47 am AS flawed as this game is, no way does it deserve such a low score. I already have over 30 hours in it, and I'm still enjoying it and have not beat it yet. The missions are repetitive though and design feels very Ubisoft-ish after a while into the game. It reminds me of Shadow of Mordor in it's repetitiveness (which got way higher scores than the reviewer gave this game and which I was finished after under 20 hours). The story is very good though and the music when driving around is awesome. There are open world games way more annoying and repetiitive than this that seem to get way better scores (far cry for example). I think the reviewer must be a GTA fanboy. The lowest any non-bias person would give this game is maybe a 6.5 or 7 out of 10 because of it's flaws, not a damn 5. All credibility lost. James A October 11, 2016, 1:51 am Flase positive? He gave it a damn 5 out of 10. Which is RIDICULOUS!!! A 5 out of 10 game is usually one not even worth touching, I already have over 30 hours in this game and had a lot of fun so far. (even though there are flaws) David Barajas October 11, 2016, 4:11 am Glad I passed on this game. Didn't like the direction they went with. Although, I might mess with it once it hits the bargain bin. Maybe. Paul October 11, 2016, 5:07 am And thats why they didn't release review copy's, they knew it was heavily flawed & just carp NR October 11, 2016, 5:29 am You gave NMS 7 and m3 a 5!? I agree M3 was dissapointing but, I would take it 20 times out of 10 over NMS. Unless you edit NMS to 2/10 you're as "trusted" as Trump and Hilary combined. disqus_1S1GyNUnq5 October 11, 2016, 12:00 pm alright, repetitive crap. exactly what i expected. this game seems to be a polished turd. thanks, but i am done with these gta-clones. i am even done with gta itself. maybe it's time to invest in some proper market research, gaming industry. Rodrigo P Felix October 11, 2016, 1:46 pm just another generic. don't like open world games. Gocha October 11, 2016, 4:00 pm Either couldn't have been better. Though Mafia 2 was developed by Dan Vavra's group - the developers of Mafia 1, it still weren't as good as its predecessor, therefore the new one isn't Mafia at all James A October 12, 2016, 2:35 am Weird thing is though, when it's a Ubisoft open world game, it's even more repetitive than this, plus lacks the cool story and setting, yet somehow always manages to get good review scores. Are Ubisoft games exempt from having to have good gameplay to get a good score or something? If this exact game was made by Ubisoft everyone would be giving it a 8 or a 9 out of 10. Tremere October 12, 2016, 9:06 pm When are game developers going to (re)embrace the notion that they should optimize a game for each respective platform? Every time I get hyped for a game that turns out like this, I become more and more jaded. This is why I never pre-order a game and in cases like this, I'd rather wait for the price to drop. For as much as I'd like to give them my money, I won't pay full price for a product that isn't optimized for the platform on which I play. Whatever happened to the times when developers said: "We'll release it for this platform on this date and that platform on the other."? I'll gladly accept a developer deciding to delay releasing a game if it requires more time to be optimized for this or that. Now it just seems like they're embracing the Micro$oft mentality by letting customers pay to be Beta-testers. If that's the case, fine... I'll pay you when the price drops... Maybe. Tremere October 12, 2016, 9:10 pm Having said all the above, what I've seen of the game is engaging. So I won't say it's not worth playing. Rodrigo P Felix October 13, 2016, 11:48 am Not for me. I quit AC Syndicate just to be boooooring Repetitive missions, just like this one. Dejah Fortune October 13, 2016, 8:31 pm you must be white Frank Lovejoy October 14, 2016, 10:22 pm You mistyped 'right'. Simon Coope October 16, 2016, 1:57 pm You can't give credit to a video game for music when it's just playing other people's songs, hell even I could do the music for videogames if all I have to do is cut n paste somebodys songs or you could Just put headphones on and save a load of time and effort. Cherie Durant October 18, 2016, 4:16 pm As a hardcore Mafia Fan....(the Godfather games and Mafia 1&2.....This one is fun....BUT!.....As Burke would say....."is so much shite packed into an nice neat package" inglorious delorious October 19, 2016, 12:10 am very disappointing. i was excited to have a another mafia game just like its predecessors only improving on every aspect to make it better, but all they did was create a bland and repetitive open world game. mafia 2 felt a bit linear even though it was an open world game but at least the story was solid. even though the review says the story is pretty good its not really the classical Italian mafia story line that it should be. i hope the game gets enough sales to make a next one and hopefully they learn from their mistakes. Goga Montana October 28, 2016, 2:10 am Gorgeous cutscenes, beautifully designed city and boring objectives + very stupid AI. And, above all, shitty performance on PC because they've made it for consoles. Played, just to see ending and then immediately deleted. Not worth your money and time.
