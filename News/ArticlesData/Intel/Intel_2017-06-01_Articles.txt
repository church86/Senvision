Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 1:30PM On May 30, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its new Skylake-X processor family aimed at high-end desktop personal computers. At the very top of the product stack is a chip known as the Core i9-7980XE. This chip, based on what we know about it, is quite a beast. It packs 18 server-grade processor cores as well as 44 PCI Express lanes, among other goodies. Additionally, Intel is pricing the chip at $1999. Image source: Intel. About $1,999 for a consumer-grade computer processor is certainly expensive, but it's worth noting that the value proposition of this new chip should be substantially better than that of the company's previous high-end desktop flagship chip, the Core i7-6950X. The 6950X had only 10 cores and 40 PCI Express lanes for around $1,700 at launch, and it managed to sell better than Intel had expected it to. The success of the 6950X in the marketplace makes me hopeful that the 7980XE (which is arguably a much better product than the 6950X was, relatively speaking) will do well in the market, too. It's worth noting, though, that while some of the basic specifications of the Core i9-7980XE are known (core count, PCI Express lanes, etc.), Intel hasn't yet disclosed the base or turbo boost frequencies at which the chip will run. Although these chips will primarily be sold to users who will run these chips out of specification, the frequencies at which the chip runs out of the box is still an important consideration. Here's where I think Intel needs to peg them on the 7980XE for it to be as compelling as realistically possible. Low base but high Turbo Boost 2.0 speeds Intel typically tells consumers the base frequency of a given chip as well as the maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 frequency at which the chip can run when only one or maybe two cores is being used. Given that there are 18 cores on the 7980XE, it's not realistic to expect that these cores will be able to run at high frequencies when they're being loaded up simultaneously. However, for the 7980XE to work well as a gaming chip in addition to a productivity chip, the chip needs to ramp up to high frequencies when only a few cores are in use (e.g., what most games will be able to use). Intel did a respectable job of this with its 10-core Core i9-7900X; it comes rated at a base frequency of 3.3GHz, but the chip offers a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 4.3GHz, which should make it quite good for gaming applications out of the box. What's more is that since any of the 10 cores found on the 7900X can be tapped to run at 4.3GHz when executing a workload that can only use a few cores, every core on the chip needs to have the capability to run at 4.3GHz. This makes it harder for Intel to find "good" chips within a given batch, although for the $999 asking price of that chip, Intel really must do it. For the 7980XE to be cleanly superior to the $999 Core i9-7900X, it should offer a maximum Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 4.3GHz, meaning that each one of the 18 cores on the chip needs to be able to run at 4.3GHz -- no easy feat. Moreover, the turbo speeds of the chip in 1-10 core operation really needs to match the 1-10 core turbo speeds of the 10-core Core i9-7900X. If Intel can offer that, then the 7980XE won't be a compromise relative to the cheaper models in the product stack and should easily be worth its asking price. If Intel compromises on that to any significant degree, then even enthusiasts who generally demand the best and are willing to pay for it might forgo the Core i9-7980XE in favor of a cheaper model, like the Core i9-7900X. Given Intel's strategy to try to upsell consumers to better, more expensive processors as much as it can, compromising on this would be less than ideal.

The investigation, according to Reuters, will focus on Flynn’s work for Inovo BV, a Dutch shell company operated by Ekim Alptekin, the chairman of the Turkish-U.S. Business Council. It is not clear if Mueller is investigating Flynn’s lobbying work because it relates directly to the Russia probe or as a separate matter. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, is also under scrutiny because of his contacts with Russia’s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. In August, while he was advising the Trump campaign, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, signed a $600,000 contract with Alptekin, a former U.S. congressional aide. (RELATED: Michael Flynn Is Lobbying On Behalf Of Dutch Firm Tied To Turkish Government) As part of the deal, Flynn agreed to conduct research on Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric living in exile in the U.S. who Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, wants extradited back to Turkey. Ekim Alptekin (Youtube screen grab) The contract also called for Flynn to create a documentary about Gulen and to utilize an “investigative laboratory” of former intelligence community officials to investigate the imam. (RELATED: As Foreign Agent Of Turkey, Flynn Agreed To Form Elite Investigative Team, Make ‘Criminal Referrals’) The contract also called for Flynn Intel to potentially make “criminal referrals” based on its investigation.

Mueller, a former FBI director who was appointed last month to oversee the Russia probe, has some history with one member of Flynn’s investigative team. As FBI director, Mueller appointed Brian McCauley to serve as associate deputy director of the FBI division overseeing human intelligence operations. McCauley was paid $28,000 by Flynn Intel for consulting work on the Inovo BV contract. Flynn Intel disclosed its involvement with Inovo BV to Congress in September under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. But the filing included few details of the arrangement, and Inovo BV’s ties to the Turkish government were not made apparent until several days after Flynn published an op-ed in The Hill on Nov. 8, Election Day, calling on the U.S. to extradite Gulen. The Daily Caller found that Flynn had signed a lobbying deal with Inovo BV and then discovered Alptekin’s involvement through business documents filed in the Netherlands. Flynn disclosed details of the work for Inovo BV on March 7, in a retroactive filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In the filings, Flynn revealed that he and Alptekin met on Sept. 19 with two Turkish government ministers, including Erdogan’s son-in-law, Berat Albayrak. McCauley, the former FBI official, also reportedly attended the meeting. Former CIA director James Woolsey, an unpaid adviser to Flynn Intel who also attended the session, has since said that the issue of an extrajudicial extradition of Gulen was discussed that day. Flynn, through his attorney, has disputed Woolsey’s claim. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, August 1, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst It is not entirely clear why Mueller’s investigation is turning toward Flynn’s work for the Turkish government. A federal grand jury in Virginia has already issued subpoenas for Flynn’s business associates involved in the lobbying effort, several news outlets have reported. According to Reuters, the subpoena “seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo.” Flynn’s decision in March to file retroactively under FARA puzzled many at the time, but is now clear that the Justice Department compelled the former Army general to register under the law, which has more stringent disclosure requirements than the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that the Justice Department began looking into Flynn’s lobbying work after a staffer read the Nov. 8 op-ed. The unnamed staffer then reached out to Flynn, according to The Journal. TheDC has recently obtained Justice Department documents through the Freedom of Information Act showing internal discussions about Flynn that helps fill in a few gaps about the Justice Department’s inquiry. On Nov. 29, Mary McCord, then the head of the Justice Department’s national security division, sent an email to two associates entitled “question on Lt. Gen. Flynn complaint.” McCord, who left the Justice Department earlier this year, referred to a “complaint/letter” that had been sent to the agency regarding Flynn. The email includes few details about the complaint or about the fledgling Flynn probe, though the recipients of the correspondence may shed light on how the Justice Department has handled the investigation. McCord sent the email to Adam Hickey and Bradley Weinsheimer. Hickey serves as deputy assistant attorney general for national asset protection, a role which oversees the national security division’s cyber security and economic espionage investigations. Weinsheimer is director of risk management at the national security division. The National Security Division reached out to Flynn and his a day after that email was sent, other DOJ documents reveal. “In light of that editorial and reports in the media about potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey, on Nov. 30, [DOJ’s National Security Division] requested additional information from Lt. Gen. Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group Inc.,” reads a Jan. 27 spreadsheet sent to then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. (RELATED: Here’s What Prompted Michael Flynn To Register As An Agent Of Turkey) The spreadsheet, which contained a list of high-profile Justice Department issues, noted Flynn’s Nov. 8 op-ed at The Hill which “expressed views that were critical of the Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen similar to those previously expressed by the president of Turkey and other Turkish officials.” Follow Chuck on Twitter Tags: Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, Robert Mueller, Turkey Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Emails and Notifications Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

But if the $849 price is right, AMD will be charging less than half the cost, at $1150 cheaper. For that cost, you could get the motherboard and a good kit of DDR4 RAM and still have change left over.   Intel's upcoming 16C/32T chip is $1699, which is still massively more expensive than the rumored $849 price on the Ryzen ThreadRipper 16C/32T processor. If we are going to be in a world where AMD is charging $849 for a processor with similar performance to Intel's CPU that costs $2000... well... we're going to be in for a wild ride. >> NEXT STORY: OnePlus 5 to be announced on June 15th << PREVIOUS STORY: Need for Speed Payback may have microtransactions Related Tags AMD Intel Computex 2017 AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper ThreadRipper 16C/32T Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD Radeon RX series cards are hard to buy right now New iPhone 8 rumors leak from trusted source Huawei to unveil the Honor 9 on June 12 ASRock delivers with an X299 mITX motherboard GDDR6 arrives in early 2018, GDDR5X hits 16GbpsView More News Posts Forum Activity Z97 Extreme won't go past BIOS - dead mobo?? i have a very problem,help please ASRock C2550D41 Stuck Booting Up Amped Wireless Helios-EX AC2200 Range Extender Review z68x-ud3-b3 REVIVED?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 1 Problem for Intel Corporation’s Kaby Lake-X Chips Nice chips, but they'll soon be made obsolete by the next round of Intel updates. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 11:30AM In addition to announcing its high-end Skylake-X chips for desktop personal computer enthusiasts this week, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) also announced a family of chips known as Kaby Lake-X. The two Kaby Lake-X chips are the Core i7-7740K and the Core i5-7640K. These chips are based on the company's Kaby Lake architecture, and indeed, are based on the same exact silicon that powers the Core i7-7700K and Core i5-7600K, respectively, (codenamed Kaby Lake-S) that launched earlier this year. An Intel Kaby Lake-X chip. The main differences between the Kaby Lake-X chips and the current Kaby Lake-S chips are the following: Kaby Lake-X can work in the same motherboards as the Skylake-X chips, while the Kaby Lake-S can't. The Kaby Lake-X chips come rated at slightly higher speeds out of the box than the Kaby Lake-S chips, and are also rated at higher thermal design power levels (112 watt versus 91 watt). The integrated graphics processor inside of the Kaby Lake-X chips is disabled and can't be used; the one on the Kaby Lake-S chips can be used. The Kaby Lake-X and their corresponding Kaby Lake-S counterparts are otherwise the same, and are even priced identically. Although I understand why Intel offers these chips (I don't believe they're pointless as some others do, but that's a topic for an upcoming column), here's why I don't think these Kaby Lake-X chips will succeed in the marketplace. The Coffee Lake-S "problem" Intel originally planned to release the successor to its Kaby Lake-S processor family, known as Coffee Lake-S, in the first quarter of 2018. However, various credible leaks suggest that the enthusiast/gaming-oriented SKUs of Coffee Lake-S will now launch in August, representing a three-quarter pull-in. Coffee Lake-S promises to bring several compelling improvements over Kaby Lake-S. For one thing, while Kaby Lake-S (and, by extension, Kaby Lake-X) tops out at just four cores, Coffee Lake-S will pack up to six cores. Coffee Lake-S should also be manufactured in a higher-performing 14nm++ manufacturing technology (Kaby Lake-S/X are built using a lower-performing 14nm+ manufacturing technology). On top of all of that, motherboards that support Coffee Lake-S should start at much lower prices than the motherboards that support Kaby Lake-X. So, once Coffee Lake-S is out, if somebody came to me asking whether she or he should build a system using Coffee Lake-S or a system using Kaby Lake-X, it would be an easy decision: I'd tell them to go with Coffee Lake-S without any reservations. Now, obviously this isn't exactly bad for Intel -- an Intel chip being more compelling than another Intel chip, which leads users to purchase an Intel chip, clearly isn't a situation that should bug the company or its stockholders. However, it seems that Intel is determined to make its high-end desktop platform (the one that Kaby Lake-X is a part of) into the platform of choice for gamers and enthusiasts, and having the entry-level chips on the high-end desktop platform become obsolete after just a couple of months isn't conducive to that goal. What Intel can do, then Leaks suggest that Intel is planning a "Coffee Lake-X" chip for its high-end desktop platform at some point in the future. Presumably, this will be like Kaby Lake-X -- that is, the same fundamental silicon that's used in Coffee Lake-S, but reworked to be compatible with the high-end desktop motherboards. If Intel can get this part out in a reasonable time frame (say, for the holiday shopping season), that would go a long way toward keeping the low-end of Intel's high-end desktop platform relevant to gamers and personal computer enthusiasts. But if this chip won't arrive until, say, mid-2018, then that'll simply be too late to be relevant -- just as the Kaby Lake-X chips are. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

By Liam Tung | June 2, 2017 -- 13:27 GMT (06:27 PDT) | Topic: Developer The UP Core can run full Windows 10, Android Marshmallow, and various Linux options. Image: UP UP has launched a crowd-funding campaign for its new developer board, the Intel-powered QuadCore x86 UP Core. The UP Core claims the title as the "smallest quad-core x86 single board computer in the world", and measuring just 56.5mm x 66mm (2.22in x 2.6in), it's about half the size of a smartphone, and a thumb-length shorter than the Raspberry Pi 3. The device can run full Windows 10, Windows IoT Core, Android Marshmallow, and Linux options, including Ubuntu, ubilinux, and Yocto. UP Core runs on a the Intel Atom x5-Z8350 QuadCore, aka Cherry Trail, offering a newer CPU than Intel's own Minnowboard. The UP Core is available in 1GB, 2GB, and 4GB RAM variants. The 1GB with 16GB eMMC storage unit is available for the early-bird price of €69 ($89), while the 2GB RAM and 32GB storage version is available for €85 ($95), again for early birds. If you pledge €129 ($145) or more, you'll get the 4GB RAM variant with 64GB storage. Prices exclude shipping. With built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support, the UP Core comes with a USB port, HDMI port, and 5V DC jack. It also has 100-pin I/O connector for up to three stackable expansions, compared with the 40-pin GPIO on the previously released standard UP board. UP also has high- and low-speed expansion boards for the UP Core as well as a custom chassis, which can be acquired as a package with pledges above €195. Though 2GB isn't much memory to run a PC, the UP Core will function as a simple, pocket-sized computer once a monitor, keyboard, and mouse are attached, as UP developers have demonstrated in this video of it booting up Windows 10. The UP Core is UP's third and tiniest developer board, following the UP and the UP2. The device is available on Kickstarter with an estimated shipping date of August for the 16GB units, and October for larger storage options.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Ubergizmo’s Best of Computex 2017 By Hubert Nguyen on 06/02/2017 08:00 PDT Another Computex comes to an end, and once again, there are a flurry of great announcements and products related to the PC industry and derivatives such as VR/AR and Gaming. We have run around to check as many things as we could (check our Computex 2017 coverage), but we didn’t stray too far from our normal regimen of laptops and key components such as CPUs and GPUS. We’ve compiled this list (no particular order) of what we thought were the best products of the show, so congratulations to those companies and team who built them. The goal for next year: see and try even more products! ASUS Flip S convertible laptop Gallery: Asus Zenbook Flip S, Hands-On ASUS came in force to Computex 2017, and the ASUS ZenBook Flip S is the most interesting laptop the company showed. At 10.9mm and 1.1Kg, t is the thinnest convertible laptop. It is also a powerful computer, with up to Core i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD and a digitizer pen. Add to that a good battery size and a starting price of $1099, and you have a laptop that provides excellent value. NVIDIA Max-Q design for thin gaming laptops The NVIDIA Max-Q design is a set of technologies and design rules from NVIDIA that enables PC-makers to build “real” gaming capable laptops into a thin and light form factor. By putting an extreme emphasis on power-efficiency, Max-Q design laptops can run the most demanding games without requiring a huge chassis and the weight associated with it. Not only gamers can benefit from this, but designers and creative users can too. Qualcomm Mesh Networking Reference Design WiFi connectivity remains a challenge for millions of users: bad connectivity, poor range, no line of sight and other problems abound in the real world. Qualcomm has been driving the next-generation mesh-based WiFi self-organising networks. They are easier to setup, have longer range, and use technologies originally developed for cellular telephony.  Qualcomm’s new mesh networking reference design will help build new commercial products faster. Intel Core X-Series CPUs With renewed competition from arch-rival AMD, Intel has announced a new line of “enthusiast” CPUs called Core X, which closes the performance gap and offer an extreme X cores version which should become the new speed leader. More importantly, Intel has adjusted its prices to the new reality, with deep cuts at every level of performance where it needs to compete. The consumer wins. PS: keep an eye out for the 8th generation of Intel Core processors — they should get a nice speed boost. Acer Predator Triton 700 gaming laptop Gallery: Acer Predator Triton 700 Acer is among the first OEMs to build a thin and powerful gaming laptop around NVIDIA’s Max-Q design. The ACER Predator Triton 700 is a powerful machine, with a fast Intel Gen 7 processor, NVIDIA’s 1080 GTX graphics chip, up to 32GB of RAM and two PCIe SSD. Add to that support for 2x USB 3.0, 1x USB 2.0, 1x Thunderbolt 3, 1x full-size HDMI, 1x DisplayPort and Killer networking. Despite this power, the chassis is only 0.74” thick. The only downside is its price of $2999+. ASUS Vivo S Laptop The ASUS Vivo S is a laptop designed for the average user who wants a good computing experience. To achieve this, ASUS has built a computer with good looks: there’s an aluminum design (17.9mm thin), and an 80% display to body ratio for the 1080p/FHD screen. For games and creative apps, there’s an optional discrete graphics chip, and there’s a fingerprint reader built-in for convenience. The best part: it starts at $499. ASUS Zenbook 3 Deluxe Gallery: Asus Zenbook 3 Deluxe, Hands-On In the 14” ultrathin laptop space, ASUS hits hard with the Zenbook 3 Deluxe, a laptop that made some noise at CES, but that is set to ship in the next few weeks. With a 12.9mm thickness (and 2.42 lbs), it should be the thinnest 14” laptop when it becomes available for sale at a starting price of $1199. It comes fully loaded with up to Core i7, 1TB PCIe SSD, and Thunderbolt 3 support. Gigabyte Brix Gaming VR PC Gallery: Gigabyte Brix Gaming VR PC Desktop Gaming PCs are mostly huge towers, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The Gigabyte’s Brix Gaming PC is small (110 x 110 x 220 mm) but can be configured to be VR-capable (GeForce 1060+Core i7). Additionally, it comes with a lot of ports: 2x USB-C 3.1, 3x USB 3.0, 3x mini-DP, 1x HDMI. There’s integrated WiFi and Gb Ethernet, support for SATA and M.2 SSDs, two memory slots. Price remains the unknown, but we love the idea. MSI GS63VR 15” thin gaming laptop Gallery: MSI GS63VR 15 Gaming Laptop MSI’s GS63VR laptop is a 15” mobile gaming rig that is compact (17.7mm thick, 4.2 Lbs) but packs a punch at the same time. It has a powerful NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 graphics processor and a 120Hz HDR display that has a 3ms response time. The compactness is made possible by using an impressive heat pipe cooling system that is shared among CPU and GPU units to dissipate heat efficiently. ARM Cortex A55 CPU Core Design ARM has announced a new graphics processor, along with two new CPU cores that will start to appear in many 2018 smartphones. The Cortex A55 CPU Core is probably the one that will have the most impact on the everyday life of Billions of phone users. The Cortex A55 is the piece of silicon that runs your phone most of the time: when it is in standby mode. The new power optimizations it has will bring power efficiency to a new level, and everybody loves to have a little more battery life. Filed in Computers.

We know there’s a new high-end, 16-core variant, dubbed Threadripper, on its way in the not-too-distant future, and now we’ve got some early rumors on what clock speeds might be. Oh — and AMD has trimmed the price on existing Ryzen 7 CPUs as well, in case you’re interested in buying into that family, but were hoping for a bit of a price cut first. Let’s talk about the price cutting first. It’s not clear yet if the current price trimming is permanent or not, but Tech Report reports that the Ryzen 7 1700 has gotten trimmed from $329 to $315, the Ryzen 7 1700X has dropped to $350 from $399, and the Ryzen 7 1800X is dropping from $500 to $460. The cuts are fairly modest, ranging from about 5 percent to ~13 percent. AMD hasn’t given any reason for the price trimming, but if I had to guess, I’d guess that the company is testing the waters at various prices to see how consumers respond. CPU prices have been static for so long, it’s easy to forget that these kinds of periodic price cuts used to be the norm. Back when AMD and Intel were in direct competition with each other, it was normal for prices to drop on a regular basis as new, faster parts were introduced. Both companies still enforced price banding and kept their mainstream, high-end, and server parts separate, but it wasn’t unusual to see chip prices fall on a regular basis. Neither AMD nor Intel launch new parts at the speeds they used to, and Ryzen 7 is relatively new, so I suspect something different may be happening here (assuming, of course, that these aren’t just temporary prices to goose sales a bit during Computex). AMD’s Ryzen 7 is the most competitive desktop CPU the company has launched in over a decade. Phenom II (aka Deneb) was a good part for its day, but it didn’t compete particularly well against Nehalem, which had been in market for over a year by the time Deneb debuted in early 2009. Ryzen 7, in contrast, takes the fight directly to Intel’s top-end HEDT markets, and it does so at dramatically lower prices. Our own benchmark comparison of Ryzen 7 1800X versus its various Intel counterparts like the 6900K and 6950X are shown below, and our full review is here. The flip side to this, however, is that AMD is retaking some degree of market share in spaces where it hasn’t competed for a number of years. It’s hard to accurately guide on price when there’s no near-term market data to draw on, the response from your primary competitor is uncertain, and the PC market is moving in different directions depending on where you look. Overall PC unit shipments have fallen from 365 million units in 2011 to 269.7 million units in 2016, while gaming and enthusiast markets have continued to grow throughout that period. It’s not surprising, therefore, to see AMD playing a bit with Ryzen 7 pricing, and again, all of this assumes that the new prices aren’t temporary. AMD’s Threadripper Lineup Meanwhile, on the Threadripper front, Hot Hardware has a rumored spec sheet of future Ryzen Threadripper parts. There isn’t just one Threadripper SKU — there are nine, ranging from the R9 1955 (10 cores, 20 threads, 3.1GHz base, 3.7GHz Turbo) to the R9 1998X (16 cores, 32 threads, 3.5GHz base, 3.8GHz Turbo). AMD’s top-end 10-core part would be a 125W TDP core with a 3.6GHz base and 3.9GHz Turbo, as compared to Intel’s Core i7-7900X, with a 3.3GHz base clock and 4.3GHz Turbo. As always, all of these specs should be taken with a substantial grain of salt. But while these are rumored specs, they’re rumored specs that make reasonable sense based on what we know about Ryzen’s performance, frequency scaling, and overall capabilities. I’d expect the final figures to be within 5-10 percent of these clocks and TDPs. There’s only so much, however, that these spec sheets can tell us. Even if they’re accurate, the big question will be how effectively these big-core chips can maintain their clock speeds, and at what core counts. The more cores on any given piece of silicon, the harder it’ll be to move heat out of that die effectively and to keep the chip running at top frequency. Which company does a better job on this front could be critical to determining which company pulls ahead in the inevitable benchmark wars. It’s interesting to watch AMD and Intel fight this battle now compared with AMD’s original surge, from 1999 through 2006. Back then, AMD started with a relatively high-end consumer CPU (Athlon), followed by a lower-end budget chip (Duron). It had a server platform for K7 (the AMD 760MP and less-expensive 760MPX), but didn’t get serious about that market until Opteron debuted in 2003. AMD is being much more aggressive this time around, taking on Intel’s entire product stack in desktop, high-end desktop, and in servers via Epyc, while simultaneously prepping updated APUs with Vega graphics for mobile and budget desktop markets. No matter what else happens, the next six months are going to be very interesting for the CPU market.

According to a new report, Apple’s legal dispute with Qualcomm is going to have an effect on iPhone 8 components, and Apple might have to substitute some Qualcomm chips with Intel components. Given the inferior quality of the Intel chips in last year’s iPhone 7, that’s not good news. Don't Miss: 10 best new movies and shows coming to Netflix in June According to a Digitimes report, Apple will shift supply of iPhone baseband modems away from Qualcomm and towards Intel, starting this year. The report says that 50% of the iPhone 8 modems could be supplied by Intel, with that number rising to 70% for the 2018 iPhone lineup. Intel’s modems have historically been cheaper but worse-performing than Qualcomm’s solution. A worse modem means less power efficiency but also a worse cell signal with lower speeds — all important things for Apple, especially considering new LTE technologies are being deployed this year, and wireless speed is set to take on a new level of importance. Qualcomm generally supplies the modem for every Android flagship worth talking about, and the iPhone’s reputation is all about reliability and speed. Apple could be forced to make a bad choice here: make an unpleasant legal settlement with Qualcomm, which would likely eat into Apple’s profit margins; or accept an inferior component in nearly half of its brand-new iPhone range. Apple’s dispute with Qualcomm is related to the licensing fees Qualcomm charges for its patents. Qualcomm’s intellectual property is used inside every single iPhone — which Apple acknowledges — but Apple contends that Qualcomm charges unreasonably high patent fees. Apple has sued Qualcomm over the issue in the past, and even instructed its manufacturing partners like Foxconn to stop royalty payments to Qualcomm. The chip manufacturer has countersued in the Southern District of California; if the case there fails, Qualcomm could even take the issue to the US International Trade Commission, and seek a ruling banning the import of iPhones into the US. Nothing’s yet indicated that Qualcomm is prepared to go that far. But the rumors about Apple shifting as much of supply as possible away from Qualcomm is telling. Apple’s bunkering down and preparing for a war with a vitally important component supplier; let’s just hope iPhone customers don’t get caught in the crossfire.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Report: Intel Corporation Could Benefit From the Spat Between Qualcomm, Inc. and Apple Inc. This chipmaker could see an increase in its cellular-modem shipments due to increasing animosity between Apple and its primary cellular-modem supplier. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 2, 2017 at 7:30AM A fresh report from DigiTimes says that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) currently sources 30% of the cellular modems used in the iPhone 7-series devices from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with the remaining 70% coming from longtime iPhone supplier, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). Losing a portion of Apple's iPhone cellular modem orders certainly impacted Qualcomm's financial performance, as well as, arguably, the perception of the value of Qualcomm's technology. Previously, only Qualcomm built stand-alone models that could meet Apple's iPhone needs, but with Apple's use of Intel modems in its flagship smartphones, that perceived value may have lessened among investors. Image source: Apple. Per DigiTimes, because of the increasingly bitter litigation between Qualcomm and Apple, Intel is expected to see its iPhone modem allocation as a percentage of Apple's total flagship iPhone shipments increase over time. "Apple's outsourcing proportion to Intel for the next-generation iPhone baseband chips has risen to about 50% for orders running through the end of 2017," DigiTimes says. It will get worse for Qualcomm and better for Intel if DigiTimes' reporting is accurate. The report says that Apple is "likely to shift even more baseband chip orders away from Qualcomm with Intel to supply over 70% of the baseband products for iPhones by 2018." Good thing Intel's XMM 7560 supports CDMA One of the key factors that will enable Intel to potentially capture the bulk of Apple's iPhone modem orders is that its upcoming cellular modem, known as the XMM 7560, is expected to support the CDMA standard, a feature that's lacking in the company's current XMM 7360 (used in the iPhone 7-series) and the upcoming XMM 7480 (likely to be used in this year's iPhone models). With CDMA support, iPhones incorporating Intel's modems will be usable on CDMA-capable networks like Verizon and Sprint, as well as on the GSM-capable networks that the current Intel-based iPhone models support. In other words, iPhones with Qualcomm and Intel models would be, for all intents and purposes, interchangeable. However, Apple doesn't gain this flexibility -- and Intel doesn't enjoy this potential opportunity -- until the product cycle after the coming iPhone 7s/8 cycle. What this could mean for all parties involved Obviously, the loss of additional share at Apple would sting Qualcomm's chip business. Now, it wasn't the end of the world for said business when Qualcomm lost that initial part of Apple's modem orders to Intel, and it certainly wouldn't be the end of the world for Qualcomm to lose additional share here. Remember that Qualcomm sells mobile applications processors, often with additional support chips, to a wide range of customers, and Apple is just one customer -- albeit a reasonably large one. For Intel, the impact of additional share gains at Apple would be a boost to its relatively small wireless chip business, which is just one small part of the company's overall Client Computing Group, or CCG, business. The impact to said wireless business would be large, and it would give Intel additional incentive to continue to develop cellular modem technologies, but the impact to the company's overall revenue and profits would be quite small -- as was the impact of the initial Apple modem revenues to Intel's business. Finally, Apple would further lessen its dependence on Qualcomm, with whom it's in a bitter legal battle. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Tesla's self-driving systems are just the start of what could be a massive change in the economy Credit: Bloomberg Alan Tovey, Industry Editor 2 June 2017 • 11:24am Self-driving cars will revolutionise the way we travel, work and live and create a $7 trillion-a-year industry by 2050, according to Intel. The US tech giant is forecasting what it terms a “passenger economy” that will create massive opportunities for new businesses as people transform from drivers into riders with time - rather than a steering wheel - on their hands. Some of the more outlandish predictions from the Intel research include what it calls “car-venience” applications such as onboard beauty salons in cars, as well as mobile health clinics and treatment pods. It even imagines that self-driving vehicles could “platoon” together to form pod hotels. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich warns that companies that do not adapt face extinction Credit: Getty “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel chief executive. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. “This is why we started the conversation around the passenger economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data-generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” He warned that companies that do not prepare for this “explosive” change face failure and even extinction, drawing parallels with the disruption caused by the rise of mobile phones, which has “reconfigured entire industries.” Driverless cars will unlock a 'cognitive surplus' allowing people to use travelling time for more productive applications Credit: Volvo Mr Krzanich also predicted an “unlocking of cognitive surplus” - giving people back time spent driving to think and do other things. Self-driving cars are expected to free up more than 250m hours per year of commuters’ time in the world’s most congested cities. The research predicts this new economic sector will be worth $800bn a year by 2035, rising to $7 trillion 15 years later. Of this amount, 98pc is expected to come from “mobility as a service”, broadly split between consumers abandoning traditional car ownership models and summoning driverless vehicles as and when needed, and business using self-driving vehicles for transportation and freight delivery. The remainder - some $200bn -  will be generated by new and emerging applications in sectors such as hotels and hospitality, tourism, entertainment and healthcare. Driverless technology could also help passengers use their time to watch movies, play games or shop, further driving spending in the economy. How Rolls-Royce imagines the driverless car of the future will look Credit: Bloomberg The research - carried out for Intel by Strategy Analytics - forecasts a huge expansion of existing businesses to support driverless cars, as well as companies offering entirely new services. These could include companies “going mobile” by developing pods that could take their services out to customers, with suggestions that fast-food restaurants or coffee shops could create “driverless kiosks” that go to their customers rather than the other way round. Fleet management companies are also set to enjoy a boom as traditional car ownership dies out, and "recharging farms" will be needed to support the explosion in electric vehicles. Another new feature of this environment could be “storages lakes” where fleets of vehicles could recharge, restock or temporarily park. These could take the form of “mothership” vehicles. “It is easy to envision an electric Uber delivering people and goods on a nearly around-the-clock-schedule as needed,” said the report. “It is also realistic to expect that trucks transporting goods between distribution centres and retail outlets will be able to run on an almost 24-hours a day, seven days a week schedule. These high-utilisation rates will spawn a very active secondary market for used pilotless vehicles as companies replace and refresh their fleets.” Share this article Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn View comments If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Please review our commenting policy Follow Telegraph Business Follow on Facebook Follow on Twitter Follow on LinkedIn Related Topics Global economy Self driving cars Apps Passengers Uber Industry Driverless cars Show more Galleries Gallery 02 Jun 2017, 4:30pm Gallery: Nine things you could buy with this week's £131m EuroMillions jackpot Gallery 30 May 2017, 6:46pm Gallery: Ten things you didn't know you could do on Amazon Gallery 26 May 2017, 4:15pm Gallery: Apple Park: Apple's new 'spaceship' campus - in pictures Business latest 05 Jun 2017, 12:01am Another slice of Domino's Pizza set for London listing 05 Jun 2017, 12:01am Manufacturers shrug off economic fears as export orders continue to flow 04 Jun 2017, 10:27pm The week ahead in business and finance 04 Jun 2017, 10:19pm SEGRO to embark on major development programme 04 Jun 2017, 10:13pm Big business eyes collaboration to combat dearth of innovation 04 Jun 2017, 10:01pm BMI Regional ‘actively considering’ replacing quarter of fleet with larger craft 04 Jun 2017, 9:55pm Comment: Trump is correct: German surplus is bad news for everybody else Roger Bootle Premium 04 Jun 2017, 9:01pm Global recovery drives World Bank triple growth upgrade for UK economy 04 Jun 2017, 7:22pm AO World set to reveal consumer confidence at annual results 04 Jun 2017, 7:06pm Italy faces borrowing shock when ECB removes support, warns Pimco 04 Jun 2017, 7:00pm Car industry hopes for recovery after sales plunge on new tax on emissions  04 Jun 2017, 6:58pm Mars bars, Ford GT40s and David Brent: The Slough Trading Estate as it nears 100   04 Jun 2017, 6:29pm Biometric data and fingerprint scans could help India get its records straight 04 Jun 2017, 6:11pm Ex-soldiers on civvy street back at the controls for Army helicopter training 04 Jun 2017, 2:20pm Ocado finally strikes first overseas deal 03 Jun 2017, 7:45pm Theresa May wins over economists as Corbyn risks taking UK 'back to the 1970s' 02:28 03 Jun 2017, 7:44pm General election 2017: City braced for market jitters 03 Jun 2017, 7:44pm British Airways owner IAG urged to add IT experts to board 03 Jun 2017, 7:44pm Brexit boosts BT pension fund assets by £7bn 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Investor warns Tesco its backers disapprove of Booker takeover 03 Jun 2017, 7:30pm Price comparison site Kelkoo takes Google to High Court over abuse of search dominance Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Branded Content Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2017 We've noticed you're adblocking.

The details have been reported by French site Consmac, and relate to regulatory filings made in a Russian-language regulatory filing. Five model numbers for personal computers carrying the Apple trademark are listed. The model numbers registered in this filing are A1289 A1347, A1418, A1419, and A1481. The expectation is that these model numbers represent updates to a number of existing Mac machines rather than Apple recycling the model numbers; A1289 is the older boxlike Mac Pro, A1347 is the Mac mini, A1418 is the iMac, A1419 iMac, and A1481 is the cylindrical Mac Pro The inclusion of significantly older machines like the Mac Pro and the Mac mini clouds the issue of what exactly is being refreshed, but the obvious answer is that some of the Mac machines are going to join the MacBook line-up with an update to use Intel’s Kaby Lake chip architecture. There are already major signals that the three MacBook Pro machines announced in October 2016 will pick up the seventh-generation Intel chipsets. As previously discussed on Forbes, Apple’s decision to release one final iteration of MacBooks in 2016 with the sixth-generation Intel chips has meant the Windows 10 competition captured a lead in terms of specifications over the last six months.

International Business Times UK UK World Business Politics Fintech Technology Science Sport Entertainment Opinion Video Pictures Log out Newsletter Signup Smartphones Cybersecurity Innovation Social Media Games Motoring Technology Motoring Life-saving robot car industry to be worth $7 trillion by 2050 Intel also predicts the autonomous vehicle industry will save 585,000 lives between 2035 and 2045. By Alistair Charlton June 2, 2017 11:11 BST Autonomous vehicles like the Navya Arma bus will create a $7tn industry, says IntelNavya Autonomous cars will create a 'passenger economy' worth $7 trillion (£5.4tn) annually by 2050, technology company Intel has claimed. In a report compiled for Intel by Strategy Analytics, the company says the self-driving industry will grow from $800bn in 2035 to $7tn just 15 years later. Intel also predicts that, between 2035 and 2045, some 585,000 lives could be saved thanks to autonomous cars being safer than those driven by mistake-prone humans. The report states: "Autonomous driving technology will enable a new passenger economy worth $7tn in 2050. It will drive change across a range of industries, displacing vehicle ownership with mobility-as-a-service, and defining a new landscape of concierge and ride-hailing services, as well as pilotless vehicle options for businesses in industries like package delivery and long-haul transportation." On that last note, Google's self-driving car division Waymo announced this week it is working on creating a self-driving truck, no doubt similar to those of Otto, the autonomous road haulage branch of Uber. Intel believes that $7tn will be split fairly equally between consumer mobility-as-a-service ($3.7tn) and a business-facing equivalent ($2.9tn), while the remaining circa $200bn will come from what the report calls "new and emerging pilotless vehicle services". These could include entertainment services for self-driving car passengers, or even services like medical checkups. At this point, it is worth pointing out that Intel has a strong vested interest in the autonomous vehicle market becoming a success. It has invested countless millions of dollars into developing the underlying technology to make driverless cars function. It recently bought Israeli autonomous vision company Mobileye for $15bn, will spend $250m over the next two years on self-driving technology, and is working with BMW to put robot-driven cars on the road later in 2017. As well as the enormous potential financial gain from a society shuttled by autonomy, Intel sees a near-future where more than 250 million hours of wasted commuting time is saved every year, helping consumers to be more productive (or distracted by paid-for streaming media services) when stuck in traffic. Panasonic's autonomous car concept allows the driver to either control the car or socialise with passengers.Panasonic A common theme in the report is that of autonomous "pods" used for a variety of purposes. For example, delivery pods will "use autopilot to deliver items as received from their dispatch location", while "experience pods" can offer "on-board beauty salons or touchscreen tables for remote collaboration". Such pods could also be managed on a fleet basis, autonomously ferrying passengers or delivering goods, then recharging and restocking at a "larger mother-shop vehicle", the report envisions.

So let’s talk about the CPUs and make a few comparisons, though before we get too far into it please note we don’t have any official model names, clock speeds or pricing info for the Threadripper series, while the clock speeds for Intel’s higher-end Core i9 series is yet to be revealed as well. So on Intel’s side, sitting at the head of the family is their answer to AMD’s 16-core/32-thread Threadripper CPU: the eye-watering Core i9-7980XE -- and I say eye-watering not because it boasts an incredible 18 cores and 36 threads, but because it will set you back $2000. The price might be extreme even for the flagship model, but Intel will also be releasing 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16-core models, in what looks to be an outright assault on AMD. The Zen architecture has clearly lit a fire under Intel and all this competition is good news for us, the consumer. Intel will also be releasing 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16-core model, in what looks to be an outright assault on AMD The Core X series includes both the Skylake-X architecture as well as the Kaby Lake-X architecture. All CPUs that have a core count of 6-18 cores are based on Skylake-X, leaving just the quad-cores to use Kaby Lake-X. AMD has already fired shots with their 4-core, 6-core and 8-core models and we are expecting 10, 12, 14 and 16-core versions soon. Not wanting to simply match AMD’s core count Intel has gone one step further with the Core i9-7980XE by hitting 18-cores. This is essentially the Titan XP of the CPU world, so it’s not really that relevant. Anyway if you have money to burn and the 18-core model is indeed worth whatever premium it ends up being over Threadripper, what does all that mola land you? Well, Intel says the i9-7980XE is the first ever teraflop desktop PC processor, so there’s that. You also get a CPU with a truly massive 18MB L2 cache. That is 1MB per core and then there’s a shared 24.75MB L3 cache. The operating frequency is yet to be revealed (base frequency) but using Turbo Boost Max 3.0 a core or two should be able to hit 4.5GHz. For such a monstrous processor you might be expecting a thermal design power rating in excess of 200 watts. But the good news is the TDP rating has been set at just 165 watts. That should make thermals quite manageable, but Intel is also selling its own liquid cooler designed for the 165W TDP and 140W TDP chips. It's estimated retail price is between $80 and $100, and will work with some previous generation CPU models as well. For those that can’t drop $2K on a CPU there’s the Core i9-7960X for a much more wallet friendly $1700 -- of course! What’s interesting here is that this model boasts the same core count as AMD’s upcoming flagship Threadripper CPU, rumored to be called Ryzen 9 1998X. All AMD Ryzen Threadripper CPUs will have quad channel DDR4 support as well as the full 64 PCIe Gen3 lanes. That is 20 more lanes than Intel’s highest end Skylake-X Core i9 processors and incredibly 40 more lanes than its 8-core and 6 core Core i7 models. So AMD has Intel against the ropes when it comes to PCI Express lanes, those X399 motherboards are going to be quite incredible. Intel says the i9-7980XE is the first ever teraflop desktop PC processor, so there’s that. So with the 8-core Ryzen 7 1800X at $500 and the 1700 model which is essentially the same thing that’s currently selling for as little as $310, how much can a 16-core Ryzen CPU really cost? It would have to be well over double the price of the most expensive 8-core model to come even close to the i9-7960X, so that’s something to ponder. Anyway, the Core i9-7960X will feature a 16 MB L2 cache, again 1MB per core, as well as 22MB’s of L3. Memory support is the same for all Skylake-X processors and remains at Quad Channel DDR4-2666. The TDP is also locked at 165 watt and again for now, the base clock of this model is yet to be announced. Image credit: IDG Intel says that compared to Broadwell-E chips such as the $1700 10-core i7-6950X, the new 10-core model offers 15 percent faster single thread performance and is 10 percent faster on multi-threaded tasks. So naturally for multi-threaded workloads the 7960X is going to crush the 6950X albeit for the same ludicrous price. Dropping down to the low, low price of $1400 we find the Core i9-7940X, a 14-core model with a 14MB L2 cache and a 19.25MB L3 cache. Again you get quad-channel DDR4 and the same 165 watt TDP. The 12-core Core i9-7920X comes in at $1200 and now we’re starting to nudge towards that original extreme price of $1000. With this one you get 12 MB of L2 cache with a 16.5 MB of L3 cache. The TDP has been lowered to 140 watts but you still get quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory support and all 44 PCI Express lanes enabled. Stepping in for my 6950X is the Core-i9 7900X, the new 10-core/20-thread model. This model comes in at the same price as the earlier Extreme Edition models such as the Core i7-965 Extreme Edition, so $1000. We know that this model will operate all cores at a base frequency of 3.3 GHz and that’s a nice little 10% boost over the 6950X. That said the new 7900X does only sport a 13.75MB L3 cache and that’s almost half that of the 6950X. However whereas the 6950X only has a 2.5MB L2 cache the 7900X has a huge 10MB L2 cache by comparison. L2 is considerably faster so having more should help boost performance substantially. Finally the 10-core model has been given the same 140 watt TDP rating as the 12-core model, quad-channel memory and 44 PCIe lanes. Okay, so this is where it gets really interesting, the 8-core/16-thread Core i7-7820X featuring an MSRP of $600. That means we are seeing a notable 40% reduction in price when compared to the 10-core model and just a 20% reduction in core assets. This also means that the 7820X will come in 20% more expensive than AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X and awkwardly almost twice the price of the 1700 model, so it could be a good deal next to the 1800X, but unlikely to be with the existence of the 1700. It comes clocked at 3.6 GHz for all cores but can boost as high as 4.5 GHz. So that is a higher clock speed than what Ryzen can currently achieve. This is another 140 watt part but PCIe lanes have been reduced to 28, though this is still plenty for most power users. Still as noted earlier this is a massive 56% reduction in lanes when compared to even the base Ryzen Threadripper CPU. Now for the 6-core/12-thread model and Intel has a lot riding here. As you probably know the Ryzen 5 1600 is considered to be the golden chip of the entire Ryzen lineup and at just $220 it’s hard to beat. It seems like Intel’s not even going to try as their 6-core Core i7-7800X is set to come in at $390. That’s not a significant saving over the current 6-core Broadwell-E chip, about 10% cheaper when compared to the 6800K. This model can boost as high as 4GHz out of the box with a base clock frequency of 3.5GHz. It also packs 6MB of L2 cache and 8.25 MB of L3 cache. Again this is a 140 watt model with 28 PCIe lanes. With the 6-core model still coming in at almost $400 that still leaves some room for some lower tier models. Intel is offering quad-cores on the X299 platform, the fastest of which will be the Core i7-7740X. Priced at $340 it comes in at the same price as the Core i7-7700K and this model is based on the new Kaby Lake-X architecture. I think most will agree with me though when I say, I don’t really get this model. It’s not a great deal cheaper than the 6-core model and yet it only offers dual channel memory support and a mere 16 PCIe lanes. Why offer such a measly CPU on a flagship platform that will no doubt be dominated by premium and expensive motherboards? It’s almost a joke that the entry level Threadripper CPU will support three times as many PCI Express lanes. As you probably know the Ryzen 5 1600 is considered to be the golden chip of the entire Ryzen lineup and at just $220 it’s hard to beat. Perhaps even more puzzling is the $240 Core i5-7640X which is another quad-core part, though it lacks Hyper Threading support so just 4-threads are on offer here. So for $20 more than the Ryzen 5 1600, Intel is giving us a traditional Core i5. I won’t bother reading out the specs, I’m pretty sure this is going to be another Core i3-7350K situation where I'll simply tell you guys, don't buy it. Before wrapping things up I checked out two X399 motherboards over in the Asrock booth. The first is the X399 Taichi and this board does a pretty good job of trying to tackle all those PCIe lanes with four PCIe x16 slots and three M.2 slots. As you can see that massive TR4 socket occupies a huge amount of space on the board, as do the 8 DIMM slots. Asrock also had their X399 Professional Gaming on display and the core specifications were very similar though this board does pick up a Creative audio solution and 10 gigabit Ethernet which is very cool. I also spotted this Mini-ITX X299 motherboard. Looks like you'll be able to make an 18-core Core i9 rig in a shoebox size PC if you want. This tiny board wasn’t light on features either offering six SATA ports, three M.2 ports -- I know, three on a Mini-ITX board. There’s also loads of USB ports, numerous networking options and support for quad-channel memory via four laptop style DIMM slots. Impressive stuff and I can’t wait to check these new boards out when time comes. In a nutshell, Intel’s new Core X series certainly looks very interesting and a bit confusing at the same time. They are clearly feeling the Ryzen heat and going with an all-out assault. The release date for the first wave of chips is June 19 and I should have on hand for testing the 10-core Core i9-7900X and 4-core Core i7-7740X.

Computex 2017: Intel unleashes NVMe RAID for X299 by Tony Thomas  11:45 AM on June 1, 2017 The unveiling of Intel's X299 chipset has made a big splash here at Computex 2017. The major motherboard manufacturers are all aflutter showing off all the RGB LEDs—ahem, compelling features that set their X299 boards apart. Buried in all the noise are hints of new RAID functionality that Intel developed to accompany X299. The company doesn't seem to have directly disseminated any information about what it is or how it works, but we've managed to cobble together a rough idea by talking to Intel's motherboard partners. For starters, the new RAID functionality is called Virtual Raid On CPU, or VROC. Users dropping high-speed NVMe storage into M.2 and spare PCIe slots can select arbitrary subsets of those drives to create a blazing-fast RAID 0 array. Here's where the waters get muddied a bit. Some Asus guy with pretty solid storage credentials who goes by the Gasior surname asserts that those arrays are bootable. However, Gigabyte told us that VROC depends on Intel's RSTe driver, which is software you run on top of Windows. These two claims would seem to be at odds, at least at first sight. VROC header on EVGA's X299 FTW K At the end of the day, it would appear that Intel's out to make a quick buck (my words, not the manufacturers'). X299 boards may optionally include a VROC header on the PCB. Support for RAID 0 NVMe arrays is free, but you have to shell out $99 for a physical VROC key to plug into the header to unlock RAID 1 and RAID 10. For RAID 5, there's a more expensive key (we heard both $199 and $299 are possible). These keys aren't being channeled through motherboard manufacturers, so as far as we know Intel will be selling them directly. Since the implementation details of VROC are nowhere to be found, we don't know whether the key contains any real mojo or not. All signs point to it merely being a sort of physical DRM. We'll keep you posted as we learn more. Tags: Motherboards Storage Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

G.Skill floors it and cranks its DIMMs to 4800 MT/s by Wayne Manion  3:00 PM on June 1, 2017 Intel's X299 high-end desktop platform has a lot to offer PC enthusiasts, but the HEDT ecosystem is incomplete without high-speed memory modules. G.Skill demonstrated a number of new products at Computex that look to occupy all availabe X299 niches. At least some X299 buyers are going to run their memory in dual-channel mode. Intel's Kaby Lake-X chips only have two memory channels to work with, and Skylake-X overclockers might choose to leave two channels unoccupied when chasing high clock rates. G.Skill has shown off its Trident Z DDR4-4800 CL19 16GB (2 x 8 GB) kit, capable of running with tight CL19-19-19-39 timings. The demo system was built with ASRock's X299 OC Formula motherboard. Some folks need some bling to go with their high-speed memory, and G.Skill showed off its Trident Z RGB DDR4-4400 16GB (2 x 8 GB) to that crowd. G.Skill touts the kit as the fastest memory on the block with RGB LEDs. The DIMMs' timings are set at CL19-19-19-39. For this set, G.Skill's demo system was assembled using Gigabyte's X299 SOC Champion motherboard. I would imagine most X299 buyers want their system to have a lot more than 16 GB of memory. Someone at G.Skill must think along the same lines, because the company also showed off the Trident Z RGB DDR4-4200 64 GB (8 x 8 GB) kit, which, as the long-winded name suggests, consists of eight rainbow-lit 8 GB DDR4 DIMMs running at 4200 MT/s. Timings are a bit looser at CL19-21-21-41, but having 64 GB of RAM spread across eight sticks in the same system at that speed is an impressive feat. This particular demo system was built around an Asus Prime X299-Deluxe motherboard, suggesting that such feats may is possible on "entry-level" X299 boards. Buyers might also want DIMMs larger than 8 GB each. G.Skill meets this demand with its Trident Z RGB DDR4-4000 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) kit, which has a pair of 16 GB modules running at 4 GT/s. Timings are extra-tight at CL17-18-18-38. The demo system for these modules used another ASRock X299 OC Formula board. Intel's X299 chipset hasn't made an appearance in laptops yet, but G.Skill didn't want to leave laptop buyers out of the party. The company showed off an EVGA SC17 gaming laptop packed with two 16 GB 3466 MT/s DDR4 modules running at CL16-18-18-43 timings, for a total of 32 GB of RAM. G.Skill did not provide pricing or availability information for any of the new high-speed kits. Tags: Memory Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

By Tas Bindi | June 2, 2017 -- 06:53 GMT (23:53 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Fully autonomous vehicles will bring forth a new "passenger economy" worth $7 trillion by 2050, according to new research from Intel and Strategy Analytics. The passenger economy does not include the autonomous vehicle industry itself; rather, it's a "peripheral" economy or a "side-effect" of autonomous vehicles becoming mainstream, Doug Davis, VP of Intel and GM of Intel's Automated Driving Solutions Group, told journalists on Thursday. While the predicted value can be disputed, Intel's overarching point is that fully autonomous vehicles will generate new types of products, services, and business models as today's drivers become tomorrow's idle passengers. what's hot on zdnet Cyberweapons are now in play What to expect at Apple WWDC 2017: Sure bets and long shots Autonomous driving will spawn $7 trillion 'passenger economy': Intel Password manager OneLogin hacked, exposing sensitive customer data Given autonomous vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers' commuting time per year in some of the most congested cities in the world, a key opportunity will be how to capitalise on all of the time people will save when they're no longer having to drive, according to the Intel-Strategy Analytics study. Due to the scope of the opportunity, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said it would be wise for businesses to start thinking about their autonomous strategy now. "Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early: To wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding," Krzanich said. "Mobility-as-a-service" will be the dominant business model, disrupting traditional patterns of vehicle ownership, maintenance, operations, and usage, according to Intel. In fact, the chip giant envisions a future where individual vehicle ownership is less important, and shared commuting on autonomous vehicles is the norm. "Half of commuters in Manila are not driving ... some take jeepneys, which are these old diesel minibuses [that carry] 20 people. When those become electric, autonomous, algorithmically guided, and massively more efficient, you're giving those time savings back to people. You suddenly have this whole new form of mass transportation," Roger Lanctot, director of Automotive Connected Mobility at Strategy Analytics and author of the Intel-commissioned study, said on Thursday. While some posit that the popularity of autonomous vehicles will increase congestion on roads, the study argues that the vehicles of the future will be able to retrieve and share real-time traffic data, and subsequently optimise routes and tasks such as finding parking. Davis added that autonomous vehicles will not kill off public transport; rather, it will reinvent it, providing commuters with a vastly different experience to what they're accustomed to today. Transport -- such as buses, ferries, trains, trams, and taxis -- could even become "experience pods", places where people get their nails and hair done, conduct business meetings, consult healthcare practitioners, or have dinner with friends, according to the study. Lanctot believes the technology will bring forth new vehicle types that are adapted to local circumstances. "The autonomous vehicle is not going to be a four-seat Sedan; it's going to start as that, and then rapidly evolve into minibuses. I think we'll see a whole new class of vehicles spawned for dense urban environments, like autonomous electric bicycles that are ultra lightweight, clean, emissionless. It will pedal itself to you and then electrically assist you to where you want to go or convey you there," Lanctot said. "At the extreme end, we could eventually start to see the evolution of RVs into autonomous houses that can trundle along, create nomadic communities, going from place to place." Davis believes autonomous vehicle technology will "democratise transportation", bringing mobility to those who currently struggle with it such as those who are older or living with disabilities. "When you look at ageing populations around the world, like in Japan for example, autonomous taxis could be used to help people age in place and preserve old towns," said Greg Lindsay, senior fellow at the New Cities Foundation. The study predicts the B2B sector to be among the first to experience change as a consequence of autonomous vehicle technology advancing. For example, businesses involved with package deliveries and long-haul transportation will no longer be impacted by driver shortages. While it will take decades to reach full integration of autonomous vehicles, the projected $7 trillion global value will come from three major areas, according to the study: $3 trillion, or 43 percent, is expected to come from business use of mobility-as-a-service; $3.7 trillion, or 55 percent, will come from consumer use of mobility-as-a-service; and $203 billion would be generated by new vehicle services and features. Davis wrote an article in May saying the reason he decided to postpone his retirement from the company, in which he spent more than 30 years, is because of Intel's potential in the autonomous driving sector. Davis believes Intel is not getting enough credit for its role in autonomous driving technology, saying that many autonomous vehicle carmakers are not talking about "who is powering the brains in their test cars lest they give away secrets". Davis said that he firmly believes Intel is best equipped to address the data challenge associated with autonomous driving technology. According to Intel, autonomous cars will generate about 4TB of data -- from cameras, LIDAR, RADAR, and other sensors -- every 90 minutes of operation. special feature Cybersecurity in an IoT and Mobile World The technology world has spent so much of the past two decades focused on innovation that security has often been an afterthought. Learn how and why it is finally changing. Read More To prepare for this, Davis said the company has set up the first of several planned datacentres dedicated to autonomous driving, which will be used for algorithm development and training, as well as understanding the infrastructure required for autonomous driving data movement and storage. At an event in San Jose, California, Intel and BMW also unveiled the first of approximately 40 autonomous cars built on the 7 Series platform that it will be testing on the road. The vehicles will include technologies such as cameras for road scanning from Israeli company Mobileye, which Intel acquired for $15.3 billion in March. Under its partnership with Intel, BMW will be responsible for driving control and dynamics, component integration, and evaluation of functional safety including setting up a high-performance simulation engine. All the cars are expected to be on the road by the end of the year. Intel also unveiled its Advanced Vehicle Lab in Silicon Valley, which it said will explore artificial intelligence, connectivity, in-vehicle computing, sensing, and other technologies required to make fully autonomous vehicles a reality. It joins the company's other labs in Arizona, Oregon, and Germany. Intel is among a growing cohort of tech companies looking to capitalise on autonomous driving technology, including Apple, Baidu, BlackBerry, Google, Lyft, Nvidia, and Uber.

The giant chipmaker made the announcement as it reported lower-than-expected sales for the first quarter. This as industry analysts say an extended slide in global PC sales is showing no signs of leveling off. Intel, which has long been the world’s leading maker of PC chips, is now trying to expand into other types of computing. “It’s time to make this transition,” CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts. While calling the job cuts “difficult,” he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas. The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014, and analysts say they may not be the last. “These companies are so big that it takes time” — and sometimes multiple rounds of restructuring — to change direction, said Patrick Moorhead, a longtime industry expert at Moor Insights & Strategy. Krzanich has been pushing Intel to change its focus from PCs to other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit. These include making microprocessors for “cloud computing” data centers, along with chips for Internet-connected gadgets, wearable devices and drones. “We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices,” he said in a statement. Intel said the job cuts will include “voluntary and involuntary departures” over the coming year, some of them occurring as Intel consolidates some of its PC chip operations into fewer locations. A spokeswoman declined to say exactly which jobs or locations would be affected. Intel has large campuses in Portland, Oregon; Chandler, Arizona; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; and Santa Clara and Folsom, California. It also has facilities in countries including Israel and China. Most of the affected workers will be notified in the next 60 days. The cuts are likely to involve divisions making and selling chips for traditional desktop and laptop computers, Moorhead said. He noted Intel has signaled its plans to continue investing in chips for gaming consoles and new “two-in-one” devices that resemble tablets with detachable keyboards. Those devices are still seeing strong sales growth. Krzanich has been trying to change Intel’s focus since he became CEO in 2013, and he’s replaced several top executives in recent months. Intel said Tuesday that longtime Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will transition to a new position in coming months. But aside from the data center business, which now contributes nearly a third of Intel’s revenue, the markets for Intel’s other new products are still “very embryonic,” according to Mark Hung, an industry analyst at the Gartner research firm. “It’s going to take two to three years before they provide meaningful growth for the company,” Hung said. Krzanich cited Intel’s first-quarter financial performance as evidence the transition is working. Intel reported revenue of $13.70 billion for the first three months of 2016, up 7 percent from the same period a year earlier. That was slightly lower than the $13.73 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting. Global demand for PCs fell 9.6 percent in the first quarter, according to figures released earlier this month by Gartner. The industry has been in decline for the last four years, Hung noted, but some analysts had expected PC sales to level off this year. Instead, he noted quarterly PC shipments fell below 65 million for the first time since 2007.

Announced as part of a new partnership during this year’s Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835-enabled Windows 10 devices could be a game-changer for lightweight and portable Windows 10 machines. We already know that desktop-like performance can be had with the 835 thanks to the Samsung Galaxy S8’s Android-powered computer interface. Instead of running a custom-built desktop, future Snapdragon 835 devices will be able to run Windows 10 natively. Don’t think this means that the next wave of smartphones, or the likes of the HTC U11 will suddenly become Windows 10 devices. The Windows 10-compatible Snapdragon 835 is a slightly different SKU to ensure it works better with Microsoft’s OS.  What this really means is a slew of affordable, low-power, lightweight Windows 10 ultraportables running on Qualcomm’s chips. It’s unlikely this means the end of Intel’s, somewhat lacklustre, mobile chips, but it does certainly apply some pressure on the manufacturer. Currently no Snapdragon 835 Windows 10 devices have been unveiled, but we do know that HP, Lenovo and Asus are all working on manufacturing some. It’s expected the first slew will arrive later this year, priced in the $400 – $700 range. Going by the mentioned manufacturers, it’s likely these won’t be phone-like devices, but could be lightweight Windows 10 tablets that can dock into a full desktop experience. Video of Windows 10 on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform Microsoft and Qualcomm claim that this is full-fat Windows 10, not some sort of cutdown OS like Windows RT was. Qualcomm sees the 835 as competing with Intel’s Y chips and, while it’s not going to be the performance beast gamers would want, it should be more than capable enough of simple photo editing and any light workload most users will want on the move. The real benefits of switching from an Intel chip to a Qualcomm one come in the form of better battery life and superior connectivity. Not only is Qualcomm well versed on the connectivity front, trying to create mesh networks for the home and bring superior 5G mobile connectivity speeds, but the Snapdragon 835’s integrated Gigabit X16 LTE means a Windows 10 device could offer always-on connectivity. Combine that with eSIMs and your portable Windows 10 machine could literally always be connected even when you don’t have Wi-Fi. See related  Qualcomm is building the solution to your Wi-Fi woes Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 preview: Better battery life, faster charging and a focus on VR In terms of battery life, the 10nm Snapdragon 835 is smaller and more power efficient than Intel’s mobile chips. Not only does this mean more room to slide in a bigger battery due to Snapdragon 835’s 30% smaller chipboard, but it’s BigLittle architecture allows for the high-power cores to run idle when not in use – meaning your battery isn’t sapped. Qualcomm claims that all of this results in up to 50% longer battery life compared to “a competing solution” and four to five times better connected standby. This, should, result in a truly all-day battery life for a Qualcomm-enabled Windows 10 machine. It’s going to be a little while until we get to see one of these devices in operation, but when they do finally emergy it could completely change the ultraportable market. Only time will tell, but it’s clear Microsoft believes Qualcomm has what it takes to give Intel a run for its money.

The Taipai-based show started on 30 May, and ever since then, we've been gleaning through the press conferences and more to determine what's noteworthy. We managed to narrow it to five products - with a couple of them more overarching concepts than actual hardware. However, they're design templates and processing chipsets that could change the way we perceive PCs and gaming laptops for years to come. Here are our top five tech products at this year's Computex. Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter Intel Core i9 X-Series Intel Intel Core i9 X-Series is a hardcore gamer's delight Desktop processors aren't exactly exciting. With each new one, you can expect more power and more efficiency. So, when a company comes along and introduces a new processor with an insane amount of horsepower, especially at a time when everyone is clamoring for more of it, you take notice. Intel’s Core i9 is the first consumer desktop processor to pack 18 cores and 36 threads into one piece of silicon. That matters when consumers are streaming more 4K video and jumping into more virtual reality experiences than ever before. The more cores and threads there are in a single CPU, the more dedicated tasks it can handle simultaneously without compromising performance. Needless to say, a 18-core, 36-thread processor is a bit much for some people, but for others using intensive apps it's a no-brainer. A video editor, for instance, will want Intel’s $1,700 CPU. Or anyone who compiles code or runs VR experiences or live-streams games or tends to manage several interrelated tasks at once (think: streaming, recoding, broadcasting, chatting, etc -- all simultaneously). Intel even upgraded its Turbo Boost in order to give a pick-up to the two top-performing cores for single-threaded or light-threaded workloads. MSI GS63VR Stealth Pro Pocket-lint MSI GS36VR Stealth Pro preview: Taking gaming laptops to the Max-Q If you want a powerful gaming laptop, you usually have to choose between thick, heavy machines with monster graphics cards or slim ones with lower-performing GPUs. In other words, hefty laptops tend to equal more power. However, MSI's new laptop, the GS63VR Stealth Pro, makes it so we no longer have to compromise. It packs a Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics and a 15-inch HDR (120Hz, 3ms) display. And it's just 17.7mm thick and 4.2 pounds heavy. MSI said it's slimmest laptop available with this GPU and display. While the late 2016 version of the MSI GS63VR had the same exact thickness and weight, it packed Nividia's GTX 1060 GPU. The updated model also has MSI's Cooler Boost Trinity technology with five different heat pipes and advanced "Whirlwind" fan blades to keep your system cool. Other features include a non-mechanical SteelSeries keyboard with customisable backlighting and ESS Sabre audio MSI also has yet to announce detailed specifications or pricing for the laptop. However, we imagine it'll be available with Intel 7th Generation and quad-core CPUs. Asus Zenbook Pro UX550 Pocket-lint Asus Zenbook Pro UX550: Next-level machine with a 4K touchscreen Asus’ Zenbook range has quite the following, thanks to its very competitive prices. At Computex, Asus announced the latest addition to the family: Zenbook Pro UX550. it's is a revamp of the original Zenbook Pro, which launched a couple of years ago, and it looks like Asus has really gone to the next level in terms of battery life and portability. It’s slim, light, rocks some great specs, and is a bit of a looker. Asus shaved almost 2mm off the earlier model, at 18.9mm, and the weight has dropped from 2.26kg to a mere 1.8kg. It still manages to squeeze in a 14-hour battery life and can charge to 60-per cent capacity in 49 minutes. The top-shelf model even runs on Intel’s H-series core i7 processor and boasts a Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics card, up to 1TB of PCIe x4 SSD storage, and 16GB DDR4 RAM. The display is another strong point with a 15.6-inch UHD 4K NanoEdge touchscreen with super slim 7.3mm bezels that give an 83-per cent screen-to-body ratio. There’s also a quad speaker set up by Harman Kardon, two USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, two USB 3.1 ports a full sized HDMI port, and a micro SD card reader, and a fingerprint scanner for Microsoft Hello. And it ships with Windows 10 Pro or Home. Asus said it will start off at just over a £1,000 when it lands in July. Nvidia Max-Q design Nvidia Nvidia Max-Q could ensure your next gaming laptop has MacBook looks Nvidia has unveiled Max-Q, a design approach that major gaming laptop manufacturers can adopt for a series of Nvidia card-packed notebooks. They will be powerful and designed with gaming firmly at the forefront, but they will also be MacBook-thin and useable as a great, travel anywhere, multipurpose laptops. Max-Q laptops will sport GeForce GTX 1080, 1070, or 1060 graphics processing. They will be engineered with sophisticated thermal and electrical design in order to maintain a thin footprint yet keep cool and quite in operation. Nvidia's proprietary WhisperMode technology will also ensure a Max-Q laptop runs quietly. Manufacturers signed on to produce Max-Q machines include Acer, Asus, Alienware, Gigabyte, Lenovo, and MSI. Expect them to appear on the market from 27 June. Asus ROG Zephyrus Pocket-lint Asus ROG Zephyrus: Slim gaming laptop with Nvidia's latest architecture Republic of Gamers' (ROG) has unveiled an exceptionally impressive-looking gaming laptop at Computex: the Zephyrus. Essentially forget everything you think you know about the necessary form factor for a powerful and efficient gaming laptop, because the Zephyrus is packing a vast amount of power in a minuscule package. It's just 17.9mm thin at the thickest point and 16.9mm at the thinnest. The Zephyrus can run GeForce GTX 1080 without any overheating, thanks to an ingenious cooling system ROG calls Active Aerodynamic System. Essentially, there is a flap on the rear of the base that flips out as you open the lid, allowing for a clear airflow. Plus, heat escapes from the large perforated area above the keyboard. The lid is made of contoured steel and there’s a lovely diamond cut edge. It also boasts a 15.6-inch IPA panel with a 1080p resolution, 7th-generation Core i7 Kaby Lake processor, up to 24GB of RAM, four M.2 PCI ports for super-fast SSD storage, multiple USB ports, including USB-C, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an HDMI video output (no wired Ethernet, though). Unfortunately, it's an expensive machine. It costs $2,699 in the US, which will set you back £2,600.

To earn a chance to win a free SBC, participate in our 3-minute survey of these 98 sub-$200 hacker-friendly SBCs. Over the last year, LinuxGizmos has reported on dozens of new community backed, open spec, hacker- and developer-friendly single board computers that run Linux and Android. We’ve added these to a curated list of earlier boards to publish a catalog of 98 SBCs. The boards included in our survey must be priced under $200 (not counting shipping), have a promised shipment availability by July, and meet our relatively flexible selection criteria for open source compliance (see farther below). This SBC catalog is a companion to our 2017 hacker boards survey launch announcement, held in partnership with the Linux Foundation’s Linux.com community website. Click on over for a discussion of recent hacker board trends, as well as links to a brief survey. Fill it out, and you will earn a chance at winning one of 27 free SBCs from six different vendors (see prize details in our survey launch announcement). We’ll announce the winners in mid-June. In addition to the 98 product summaries farther below, we have also generated a detailed spreadsheet that compares the major features of all 98 boards. Spreadsheet comparing the survey’s 98 SBCs (click image to view complete spreadsheet) Our list of 98 boards has expanded since our early January catalog of 90 SBCs, which did not include a survey component. Our June 2016 catalog and survey had 81 boards, and the May 2015 catalog had 53.   Selection criteria Determining the criteria for community backed, open-spec SBCs is always a challenge. No SBC is completely open source, especially given the state of opaque GPUs and sometimes sketchily documented CPUs, although the RISC-V architecture may change this in the coming years. Few of the boards on our list explicitly claim fully open source hardware licensing. At the very least, however, the projects must post extensive specs, as well as schematics for expansion I/O at a minimum, or for the carrier portion of sandwich-style boards. The projects must also offer at least some community and technical support for individual developers, such as forums, tutorials, and other resources for sharing tips and designs based on the SBCs. More important to most customers is the need for open source Linux or Android distributions for download that can dependably exploit the boards’ resources. In the case of new SBCs, we allow a bit of a grace period to post the above resources in a timely manner. The summaries below provide brief descriptions and specs of each board in our survey, along with links to related coverage here at LinuxGizmos.com and at supplier product pages. The listed prices are the lowest we saw at publication, but the pricing on many of these boards is fairly fluid. Typically, the prices do not include free shipping, or if so, only to certain regions. Sometimes the shipping prices can be considerable, turning a $35 board, for example, into a $50 board. Since LinuxGizmos has an international audience, we did not attempt to include shipping costs in the listed board prices. We welcome reader comments on all of the above, especially in regard to your experiences with software and support. Please participate in the discussion area at the conclusion of this post. And don’t forget to vote for your favorite hacker boards using the resources below.   Next Steps1. Read this survey’s launch post (if you haven’t already) 2. Scan the catalog of 98 SBCs (below) 3.

The boards offer Arduino-compatible expansion, low power consumption, and a modular COM+baseboard design. Features include Fast Ethernet, USB 2.0, and microSD connections, plus 17x digital I/O pins and 6x analog inputs. A $69 One model adds HD audio and more expansion I/O. There’s also an EduCake mini-PC version and a SeeedStudio version of the One. This appears to be a fading project however, with very little activity in the forum.   A20-OlinuXino-Lime2 Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 4GB eMMC version Price — $50 (45 Euros); $61 (55 Euros) for 4GB version Bulgaria-based Olimex’s OlinuXino project is one of the older hacker board projects around, but lately it seems more focused on the open source, but not Linux compatible ESP32 platform. There’s plenty of activity on the oLinuXino forums concerning its Linux boards, however, and earlier this year the project released an open source, Linux-driven Teres-A64 laptop kit based on the Allwinner A64 for 225 Euros. Meanwhile, there’s still interest in the older A20-OlinuXino-Lime2, which offers a Gigabit Ethernet (GbE, or 10/100/1000Mbps) port, microSD slot, HDMI port, LCD interface, 3x USB ports, battery support, and 160x GPIOs. The 84 x 60mm SBC is available with Android 4.2.2 or Debian Jessie with Linux 3.4.1 images. Last year, the Lime2 switched to the same PCB Revision G used by the Lime2-4GB/eMMC, bringing an up-to-date RTL8211E Ethernet PHY, grounded mount holes, and a streamlined shape without the cutouts found on the 4GB model.   A20-OlinuXino-Micro Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 4GB NAND Price — $61 (55 Euros); $72 (65 Euros) for 4GB version The A20-OlinuXino-Micro has all the I/O of the first-gen Lime models, and adds VGA, LCD with touch support, and audio I/O. This larger, 142 x 83mm board offers expansion connectors with optional I/O modules. The 4GB NAND version is otherwise identical.   A33-OlinuXino Company/project — Olimex, OlinuXino, Mouser Product page Processor — Allwinner A33 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB NAND version available Price — $40 (36 Euros) or $49 (44 Euros) for 4GB version The A33-OlinuXino has a faster quad-core Allwinner A33 SoC compared to earlier OlinuXino boards, but it offers a reduced feature set. The only real-world ports are a mini-USB OTG port, audio jacks with 100dB codec, and a 5V jack. Two unassembled 40-pin connectors support GPIO, as well as up to 1280 x 800 LCD and dual MIPI-CSI (5- and 8-megapixel) interfaces. Other features include a debug connector, a LiPo charger, and a step-up converter. The 71 x 66mm SBC is smaller than the A20-based Lime and Lime2 boards. You can download images for Android 4.4 and Debian Jesse with Linux 3.4.39.   Arduino Industrial 101 Company/project — Arduino LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 400MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM; 16MB SPI flash Price — $38.50 The Arduino wars are now over, but we haven’t seen many new official Arduino boards since the reunification except for the non-Linux, Sigfox-ready MKRFOX1200. The two websites have yet to merge, with each offering a slightly different set of features. The Linux-ready, sandwich-style Arduino Industrial 101 is still available on Arduino.org in addition to the Arduino.cc page linked to above. The board injects the Linux/WiFi capability of the Arduino Yun into a COM that is integrated with an Arduino-enabled baseboard. The module incorporates a soldered down Linino Chiwawa LGA module that runs Linino (a version of OpenWrt) on an AR9331 WiFi SoC, accompanied by 64MB DDR2 RAM and 16MB SPI flash. The carrier adds a 16MHz ATmega32u4 MPU along with 2.5KB SRAM and 32KB flash. There’s also a USB OTG port and 20x DIO pins that include UARTs, 7x PWMs, Ethernet, and 12x analog inputs.   Arduino Yun / Yun PoE Company/project — Arduino Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS24k @ up to 400MHz) Memory — 64MB DDR2 RAM Price — $68.20 (Yun) or (Yun PoE) $78.10 This original Arduino Yun is still available at Arduino.org, and the new Arduino Yun PoE version is sold by Arduino.cc (see link above), but not vice versa. The smaller Arduino Yun Mini is listed on both sites, but is out of stock, with no promises of a refresh. For $10 more than the Yun, the Arduino Yun PoE adds Power-over-Ethernet to the original Yun design, letting you power the board over the 10/100 Ethernet port with the help of an included add-on module. Both versions run the OpenWrt-based Linino on Qualcomm’s 400MHz AR9331 WiFi SoC while also processing Arduino code on an Atmel Atmega32U4. Linux-driven components include the 2.4GHz WiFi-n radio, USB 2.0 host port, and microSD slot. Arduino-controlled interfaces on the 5V board include 20x DIO pins, 7x PWM outputs, and 12x analog I/O pins.

The M2 features GbE, WiFi, five USB ports, and a range of display and camera interfaces. We removed the smaller, Allwinner H3 based, SATA-enabled Banana Pi M2+ from our list because it appears to be out of stock. We could only find it at AliExpress in a stripped-down, $22 EDU version without wireless or onboard flash, or as a $27 to $35 offering that appears to be aimed at OEM customers.   Banana Pi BPI-M2 Ultra Company/project — SinoVoip LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner R40 (4x Cortex-A7); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $40 The Banana Pi M2 Ultra can be found for a low of $40 on Amazon with free shipping, but it ranges up to $60 elsewhere. It essentially replaces the similarly 92 x 60mm M2, but offers a faster Allwinner R40, which also enables a SATA connector. In the process, one of the four USB host ports was sacrificed. There’s also a generous 2GB of RAM, which is unusual for a Cortex-A7 SoC. The M2 Ultra is further equipped with GbE, WiFi, Bluetooth, micro-USB OTG, a 40-pin connector that supports Raspberry Pi add-ons, and several display and camera interfaces.   Banana Pi BPI-M3 Company/project — SinoVoip Product page Processor — Allwinner A83T (8x Cortex-A7 @ 1.8GHz); PowerVR SGX544MP1 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $74 fy SinoVoip’s Banana Pi M3 (BPI-M3), which features the octa-core Allwinner A83T SoC, sells for $74 at AliExpress and a dollar more at Amazon, both with 2GB RAM and 8GB eMMC. The M3 has about the same size (92 x 60mm), layout, and features of the M2 Ultra, and similarly integrates a RPi-ready 40-pin link. Like the M2 Ultra, the M3 supplies GbE, WiFi, SATA, 3x USB, and multiple display and camera options. Software support is more extensive than some other Banana Pi boards, although all have improved (see the download locator here). Options include Android 5.1, Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04 Mate, Raspbian Jesse Mate, Kano, Kali, CentOS, Gentoo, OpenSUSE, Arch, CRUX, and Fedora.   Banana Pi BPI-M64 Company/project — SinoVoip LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB to 64GB eMMC Price — $74 SinoVoip’s first 64-bit Banana Pi has a high price ($74 at AliExpress) compared to the similarly Allwinner A64-equipped Pine A64, but it’s loaded with 2GB RAM and numerous peripherals. You get 4K-ready HDMI, MIPI-DSI, and MIPI-CSI, as well as onboard wireless and GbE connections. The 92 x 60mm board is further equipped with 3x USB host ports, a micro-USB OTG, and an RPi 40-pin connector.   Banana Pro Company/project — LeMaker LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A20 (2x Cortex-A7 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $48 Compared to the rival Banana Pi M2 boards from former partner SinoVoip, LeMaker’s own Banana Pi update sticks closer to the original, retaining the dual-core A20 SoC. The Banana Pro features a SATA connector and an RPi-like 40-pin connector. Other features include microSD, WiFi, 2x USB host ports, and a micro-USB OTG. LeMaker also offers a LeMaker Guitar SBC, as well as a 96Boards-compatible HiKey board (see farther below).   BeagleBone Black, Rev C Company/project — BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $48 The Debian-ready BeagleBone Black Rev C, which came in at third place out of 81 in our June 2016 survey, is available from numerous sources, with the $48 MCM Electronics currently offering the lowest price. This industrial-oriented SBC stands out with its numerous expansion interfaces and programmable “PRU” MCUs, as well as its deeply rooted BeagleBoard.org community and ecosystem. In recent years, the design has spawned several BeagleBoard.org authorized clones. In addition to two SeeedStudio BeagleBone Green models, Octavo’s BeagleBone Black Wireless, and BeagleBoard.org’s own BeagleBone Blue (see reports below), these include Element14’s new BeagleBone Black Industrial 4G, which is identical to the BB Black except for its conformal coating and -20 to 85°C support. SanCloud’s feature-rich BeagleBone Enhanced shipped to Indiegogo backers, and although the design is free to use, the board itself is no longer available. As for the long delayed, dual-core Cortex-A15 based BeagleBoard-X15 successor to the venerable BeagleBoard, it’s finally available from locations including Mouser. At a low of $264, however, it’s over our $200 limit.   BeagleBone Black Wireless Company/project — BeagleBoard.org; Octavo Systems LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP with TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCUs; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $68.75 This BeagleBoard.org backed, Octavo Systems built alternative to Seeed’s BeagleBone Green Wireless (see below) similarly adds 2.4GHz 802.11a/b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 BLE to the BeagleBone Black design. Unlike Seeed’s two BB Green models, the BeagleBone Black Wireless retains the BB Black’s micro-HDMI port, but removes the Ethernet port. It is otherwise identical to the BB Black with one big exception: It incorporates the Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP (system-in-package) module, “which integrates BeagleBone functionality into one easy-to-use BGA package,” making it easier to create custom variations.   BeagleBone Blue Company/project — BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP with TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips and PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $80 This robotics-focused BeagleBoard.org collaboration with the UCSD Coordinated Robotics Lab is a BeagleBone clone that adds motion control and battery friendly power. Like the BeagleBone Black Wireless, the BeagleBone Blue integrates a TI WiLink 8 with WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1 LE, as well as an Octavo Systems OSD3358 SiP module that encapsulates the Sitara AM3358 SoC, RAM, and flash along with a PMIC and other features. There’s no Ethernet port or display interfaces, but you get micro-USB 2.0 host and client ports, 8x servo outputs, 4x DC motor outputs, and 4x quad encoder inputs. Other features include an IMU, barometer, JTAG, and GPS and DSM2 radio interfaces. There’s a wide-range 9-18V DC input, a LiPo battery connector, and the usual extensive list of BB Black interfaces. Plenty of user buttons and LEDs are also onboard. The BeagleBone Blue defaults to a real-time enhanced Debian stack, but also runs Ubuntu Core, and supports ROS and ArduPilot.   BeagleBone Green Company/project — SeeedStudio; BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $39 SeeedStudio’s BeagleBoard.org-sanctioned, IoT-focused re-spin of the BeagleBone Black sells for a low of $39 at Banana Robotics. The BeagleBone Green loses the BB Black’s micro-HDMI port and 5V barrel jack connector. However, it costs less, and it adds expansion connectors for Seeed’s Grove sensors. It also replaces the mini-USB connector with a micro-USB port. Seeed offers its own Grove-oriented BB Green developers site in addition to drawing on the support of the larger BeagleBoard community.   BeagleBone Green Wireless Company/project — SeeedStudio; BeagleBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3358 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz) with PRU MCU chips; PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $49.90 The BeagleBone Green Wireless has the same base feature set as the BB Green, with identical additions and subtractions from the BB Black, including the addition of a Grove interface. The Wireless model adds WiFi and Bluetooth, as well as three more USB host ports for a total of four, making it the USB leader among all the currently announced BB Black clones. A TI WiLink8 module is now standard, boosting wireless capabilities to Bluetooth 4.1 LE and 2.4GHz 802.11a/b/g/n with 2×2 MIMO.   Bubblegum-96 Company/project — uCRobotics LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Actions Semiconductor Actions S900 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.8GHz); PowerVR G6230 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $89 Based on an earlier ActDuino S900 prototype, the uCRobotics Bubblegum-96 adopts Linaro’s 96Boards CE spec.

Prices range to $160, but you can get it for a low of $146 at Netgate. The board includes a low-speed expansion header that provides Arduino-like prototyping I/O, as well as a 60-pin high speed connector for add-on boards called Lures. Other I/O includes dual USB ports plus GbE, micro-HDMI, and SATA. Firmware support includes Debian, Ubuntu, Yocto Project, Android 4.4, and Windows 10. The Turbot Dual, has recently been joined by an almost identical MinnowBoard Turbo Quad-core (see item below).   MinnowBoard Turbot Quad-core Company/project — Intel, ADI, MinnowBoard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Atom E3845 (4x Bay Trail @ 1.91GHz); Intel HD Graphics Memory — 2GB DDR3L RAM Price — $190 The MinnowBoard Turbo Quad-core, which began shipping only last week, has the same 99 x 74mm footprint as the dual-core Turbot Dual, and much the same layout and feature set. The Quad advances to the quad-core, 1.91GHz Atom E3845 from the same 22nm Bay Trail generation, and adds a heatsink, a fan, and a faster Intel I210 GbE controller. Almost a year ago, ADI announced a larger (103 x 99mm) MinnowBoard Turbot Dual-E SBC with a choice of dual-core Atom E3826 or quad-core E3845 SoCs. The Dual-E is named for it second GbE port, and it also offers an M.2/micro-SIM combo for WiFi, LTE, or SSD. There’s still no word on pricing or availability.   MYS-6ULX SBC Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 ULL or i.MX6 UL (1x Cortex-A7 @ 528MHz or 696MHz, respectively); 2D PXP GPU Memory — 256MB DDR3 RAM; 256MB NAND Price — $24.80 (i.MX6 ULL) or $26.80 (UL) MYIR is primarily a commercial board vendor, but it has spun several open-spec hacker boards like the MYS-6ULX SBC that have crossover appeal to makers. Others include the Rico Board (Sitara) and Z-turn (Zynq) (see farther below). The $25 to $27 MYS-6ULX offers a choice of i.MX6 UL (UltraLite) or its newer, down-clocked sibling, the i.MX6 ULL. Each SBC model has its own unique super power: The i.MX6 UL version offers -40 to 85°C support instead of 0 to 70°C, and the i.MX6 ULL model features a USB-powered WiFi radio. Otherwise, the 70 x 55mm boards are identical. You get a microSD slot, Fast Ethernet port, USB host and micro-USB 2.0 OTG ports, a debug connector, and an LCD interface with optional touchscreens. The dual 20-pin expansion connectors can be used to attach an optional baseboard, which is not yet available. The MYS-6ULX comes with an open source Linux BSP with a 4.1.15 kernel and either Debian or Yocto Project with ported Qt. There’s no forum or dedicated community site, but you get full schematics and extensive documentation.   NanoPC-T3 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P6818 (8x Cortex-A53 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); Mali-400 MP GPU Memory — 1GB or 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $60 FriendlyElec (AKA FriendlyARM) now offers at least a dozen SBC SKUs, depending on how you delineate them, leading us for the first time to apply our 10-product limit and trim a few from the list. Those that didn’t make it are noted in the blurbs of similar NanoPi models. The 100 x 60mm NanoPC-T3 is one of the few without NanoPi branding. As the PC nomenclature suggests, this is one of the most feature-rich FriendlyElec boards. Equipped with an octa-core Samsung S5P6818, the NanoPC-T3 SBC is almost identical to the earlier, quad-core NanoPC-T2. In addition to the faster processor, the T3 adds a 2GB RAM option. Other features common to both NanoPC boards include an SD slot, GbE, WiFi, and Bluetooth 4.0. The board provides 4x USB host, a micro-USB client, and media ports include HDMI, LVDS, LCD, MIPI-DSI, MIPI-CSI, and audio. In place of the usual 40-pin RPi connector, the NanoPC-T3 provides a 30-pin GPIO header.   NanoPi A64 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $25 The NanoPi A64, which appeared in December, was FriendlyElec’s first 64-bit quad-core NanoPi. It has since been joined by the NanoPi K2 and NanoPi Neo 2, and there’s also the earlier octa-core NanoPi-T3. The NanoPi A64 has a compact, 64 x 60mm footprint that matches that of the NanoPi M3. The board provides two USB host ports, a power-only micro-USB, and HDMI, MIPI-DSI, microSD, audio, and DVP camera connections. The 5V SBC offers GbE and WiFi, but no Bluetooth, and you get the NanoPi-typical 40-pin Raspberry Pi expansion header. Images are available for Ubuntu Core and Ubuntu Mate. Most of the NanoPi boards are available with a growing list of options ranging from cases to heat sinks to camera modules. Shipping to the U.S., however, is expensive. Single-unit prices range from $16 to $36, compared to under $4 for the Orange Pi project.   NanoPi K2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S905 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM Price — $40 If the specs for the video-oriented NanoPi K2 look familiar, that’s because they almost perfectly mimic the $46 Odroid-C2, which aside from the processor is itself a near doppelgänger of the $35 Raspberry Pi 3. The NanoPi K2 has the same quad -A53 Amlogic SoC and 85 x 56mm footprint as the Odroid-C2, as well as similar features like 2GB RAM, 4x USB, GbE, and a 40-pin RPi-like bus. Unlike the Odroid-C2, but like the RPi 3, the NanoPi K2 adds WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0, so you don’t have to use up a USB port. The Amlogic S905 with Mali 450 GPU is considerably more powerful than the RPi3’s Broadcom/VideoCore IV SoC, and [email protected] decoding and DVFS. Android 5.1 is available, with Ubuntu in development.   NanoPi M1 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB or 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $15 or $20 (1GB) The 69 × 48mm NanoPi M1 adopts the quad-core Allwinner H3, the same SoC found on the $10, H3-based Orange Pi One. The M1 offers more features, however, including a CVBS A/V output, an IR receiver, a mic, and two more USB 2.0 host ports for a total of three. Standard features shared by both include microSD, Fast Ethernet, HDMI, DVP camera, and a 40-pin RPi connector. Images are available for Ubuntu MATE and Ubuntu Core. Last year, LinkSprite launched a rebranded version of the NanoPi M1 called the pcDuino4 Nano, selling for $25 with 1GB.   NanoPi M1 Plus Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $35 This recent, more feature-rich version of the $15 NanoPi M1 retains the Allwinner H3, but is slightly smaller at 64 × 60mm. The higher price reflects the standard 1GB RAM and 8GB eMMC, as well as new features like WiFi, Bluetooth, mic, and the advance to Gigabit Ethernet. One of the three USB 2.0 host ports, however, has moved to an onboard header. OS options include Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu Core, Debian, and Android.   NanoPi M2A / M3 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz with 3D GPU) for M2A or Samsung S5P6818 (8x Cortex-A53 @ 400MHz to 1.46GHz with Mali-400MP GPU) for M3 Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $30 (M2A) or $35 (M3) The recently released NanoPi M2A replaces the similarly Samsung S5P4418 driven, $25 NanoPi M2, which we removed from the list due to being out of stock. Aside from the SoC, the NanoPi M2A is almost exactly like the still available, $35, octa-core Samsung S5P6818 based NanoPi M3, so we’ve combined the two SBCs here. The 64 x 60mm footprint, layout, and features appear to be identical except for the M2A’s addition of an onboard mic and a switch from a 5V @ 2A to a 5V @ 3A input. Both SBCs provide WiFi, BT 4.0, and a GbE port, plus media interfaces like HDMI, LCD, LVDS, DVP, and audio. They both offer dual USB 2.0 host ports and two more USB headers, a micro-USB port, and a 40-pin, RPi-ready header. Images listed for the NanoPi M2A include Android 4.4 and 5.1, Debian 8.1, and Ubuntu Core with Qt.   NanoPi 2 Fire Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); 3D GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $29 The NanoPi 2 Fire replaces the earlier NanoPi 2 SBC, and similarly runs Android or Debian on a quad -A9 S5P4418 SoC. The Fire swaps out the earlier wireless module for a GbE port, and adds a PMIC. The 75 x 40mm SBC offers both an HDMI port and an LCD interface, and supplies a DVP camera link. Other features include a microSD slot, a 40-pin RPi connector, a micro-USB OTG port, and a USB host port.   NanoPi Neo/Neo2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-400 MP2 GPU) for Neo or Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-450 GPU) for Neo2 Memory — 256MB or 512MB DDR3 RAM (Neo) or 512MB DDR3 (Neo2) Price — $8 or $10 (512MB) for Neo or $15 for Neo2 Earlier this year, the quad -A7, 40 x 40mm NanoPi Neo was joined by a 64-bit quad -A53 near twin called the NanoPi Neo2. The Neo2 is the same as the Neo except for the faster SoC, GbE instead of 10/100 Ethernet, two more USB headers, and lack of a 256MB RAM option. Both boards, along with a third, wireless enabled Neo Air option (see below) are the world’s smallest and most affordable quad-core ARM SBCs. At 40 x 40mm, they consume only 1,600 square millimeters, compared to 1,950 sq. mm for the 65 x 30mm Raspberry Pi Zero. The NanoPi Neo and Neo2 are further equipped with microSD, USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB OTG ports. All three Neo boards, which run Ubuntu Core or Mate, lack display or camera interfaces. You get 36 GPIO pins instead of the usual RPi connector.   NanoPi Neo Air Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $20 The NanoPi Neo Air is a juiced up NanoPi Neo. This headless, IoT board has the same minisicule 40 x 40mm footprint, and similarly runs Ubuntu Core and Mate on an Allwinner H3. The Neo Air comes standard with 512MB of RAM, and adds 8GB eMMC, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and a DVP camera connector. The Air also sacrifices the Ethernet port and the sole USB host port, however, leaving you only a micro-USB OTG for power and data. You can get more USB ports or a power connection via the split bank of 36 GPIO pins.   NanoPi S2 Company/project — FriendlyElec (FriendlyARM) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung S5P4418 (4x Cortex-A9 @ 400MHz to 1.4GHz); 3D GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $45 The NanoPi S2 is like a pumped up, wireless-enabled NanoPi 2 Fire, sharing the same 75 x 40mm footprint and quad -A9 S5P4418 with Debian and Android support. Other common features include USB 2.0 host and micro-USB ports, a microSD slot, a PMIC, a 40-pin RPi connector, and links for LCD and camera. The NanoPi S2 dispenses with the Fire’s GbE port, but adds WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0. It also shrinks the HDMI port to mini-HDMI. Unlike the 2 Fire, the S2 features 8GB of eMMC, an ADC pin header, an audio jack, and an LVDS interface.   Odroid-C0 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S805 (4x Cortex-A5 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional eMMC 4.5 Price — $30.80 (with $1.80 Connector Pack) Aimed at IoT and robotics, the Odroid-C0 is a smaller (65 x 56mm), somewhat stripped-down version of the Odroid C and C+ (see below). It has the same quad-core -A5 Amlogic SoC, and offers the same Ubuntu and Android 4.4 support with GCC 4.9.2 Linux toolchain. The C0’s only coastline port is an HDMI port. However, an optional Connector Pack lets you solder on real-world connections for unpopulated interfaces including dual USB host, serial console, IR, I2S, and an RPi 40-pin interface. A battery connector with charging circuit supports an optional 3.7V Li-Po battery. Internet connectivity requires an optional WiFi dongle. As with all Odroid boards, the price includes worldwide shipping.   Odroid-C1+ Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S805 (4x Cortex-A5 @ 1.5GHz); Mali-450 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; optional 8GB eMMC Price — $35 The Odroid-C1+ upgraded the earlier, very similar Odroid-C1 with features like a full-size HDMI port, a standard heatsink, and I2S audio and micro-USB-OTG links. The C1+ has a price, footprint, and feature set that is almost identical to the original, 32-bit Raspberry Pi 2, but is more fully open source, has a faster processor, and supports Android 4.4 in addition to Ubuntu 14.04. The C1+ is further equipped with a microSD slot and optional eMMC, as well as GbE, serial console, ADC, and a RPi-compatible 40-pin connector.   Odroid-C2 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Amlogic S905 (4x Cortex-53 @ up to 1.5GHz); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; optional 8GB eMMC Price — $46 The Odroid-C2 came in second out of 81 hacker SBCs in our June 2016 survey. It has the same 85 x 56mm size and layout as the Odroid-C1+ and Raspberry Pi 3, but advances to a quad -A53 Amlogic S905 SoC. It’s faster and more open source than the RPi 3, but there’s no WiFi or Bluetooth, and the price has edged up to be $11 more expensive. The C2 doubles the RAM of the C1+ to 2GB, and offers a choice of optional storage between up to 64GB of eMMC and an 8GB or 16GB SD 3.01 compatible UHS-1 microSD card. The Odroid-C2 can output 4k/60Hz video, and has almost everything the C1+ has, including GbE and HDMI ports, four USB host ports, and a 40-pin RPi connector. Images are available for Android 5.1 or Ubuntu 16.04, based on a Linux 3.14 LTS kernel.   Odroid-XU4 Company/project — Hardkernel, Odroid project LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Samsung Exynos5422 (4x Cortex-A15 @ 2.0GHz and 4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.4GHz); Mali-T628 MP6 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM; optional up to 64GB eMMC Price — $59 While the other Odroid boards have crept up in price, the Odroid-XU4 recently received a $15 price cut. This 83 x 58mm Odroid-XU3 replacement uses the same octa-core Exynos5422 and Mali-T628 GPU. Features include a GbE port, audio-enabled HDMI port, 2x USB 3.0 ports, and a USB 2.0 port. The XU4 offers a 12-pin GPIO header in addition to a 30-pin expansion connector. There’s an option for a USB-based SATA 3 module, an I/O board, and various wireless add-ons. The Odroid-XU4 features several versions of Android up to 7.1 Nougat, as well as Ubuntu 16.04, based on a Linux 4.9 LTS kernel.   Orange Pi 2G-IOT Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — RDA RDA8810PL (1x Cortex-A5); Vivante GC860 GPU Memory — 256MB LPDDR2 RAM; 500MB NAND Price — $9.90 Shenzhen Xunlong sells a lot of dirt-cheap Orange Pi models — adding over a half dozen more since our June 2016 round-up — and they all ship to the U.S. for under $4. The Orange Pi project has been criticized for poor Linux support and HW quality issues, but it appears to be improving. The Armbian community is helping to improve Linux support, and in March, Shenzhen Xunlong partnered with Canonical to launch an Ubuntu snap app store for its Orange Pi SBCs. Linux and Android OS images available on the Orange Pi site vary widely by board. The first Orange Pi on our list is somewhat atypical. The tiny, 68 x 42mm Orange Pi 2G-IOT can withstand -10 to 65°C temperatures, and runs Android 4.4, Ubuntu, Debian, or an RPi image on a single-core, Cortex-A5 RDA RDA8810PL SoC (typically 1GHz) with an integrated 2G GSM/GPRS/EDGE baseband. The $10 board offers WiFi, BT, and a SIM card slot with 2G antenna. Other features include LCD, MIPI-CSI, and audio interfaces, as well as USB 2.0 host and micro-USB OTG ports, and a 40-pin RPi-style connector.   Orange Pi Lite Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $12 The fetchingly priced Orange Pi Lite, a WiFi variant of the Orange Pi One, offers the 1.2GHz version of the quad-core H3 SoC compared to 1.6GHz on the Orange Pi PC. It’s also limited to a half gig of RAM, and lacks an Ethernet port, but you get a second USB host port. Other features include microSD, WiFi, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, micro-USB OTG, and the usual Orange Pi 40-pin RPi header.   Orange Pi One Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); ARM Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $10 The highly affordable Orange Pi One preceded the similar $12 Lite version. It provides 10/100 Ethernet instead of WiFi, and supplies a single USB host port instead of two. Otherwise, the specs are identical, including microSD, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, micro-USB OTG, and 40-pin connections. Comparing only by price, performance, and features, the Orange Pi One clearly beats the $5 to $25 RPi Zero. Meanwhile, the tiny, H3-based NanoPi M1 has a few more features, but has crept up to $15 to $20. A hands-on report on the Orange Pi One can be found here.   Orange Pi PC / PC Plus Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.6GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC on PC Plus Price — $15 ($22 for PC Plus) The $15 Orange Pi PC provides an Allwinner H3, a Raspberry Pi-like 85 x 55mm footprint, and RPi-compatible 40-pin expansion. It has twice the RAM of the Lite and One models, and provides microSD, HDMI, CVBS, CSI, USB OTG, and 10/100 Ethernet connections. A newer Orange Pi PC Plus model adds 8GB of eMMC flash.   Orange Pi PC 2 Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $20 Shenzhen Xunlong’s first 64-bit Orange Pi arrived in November with the same 85 x 55mm footprint, 40-pin RPi header, and many other features found on the Orange Pi PC. However, it offers a quad -A53 Allwinner H5 instead of a quad -A7 H3. The PC 2 is further equipped with 3x USB host ports, as well as micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, CVBS, audio, and MIPI-CSI.   Orange Pi Plus2 / Plus2E Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.6GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $49 ($35 for Plus2E) Like the Orange Pi 2 and the still available, $39 Orange Pi Plus1, the Orange Pi Plus2 and new Plus2E run distributions such as Lubuntu, Raspbian, and Android on a quad-core, 1.6GHz Allwinner H3. Compared to the Plus1, the Plus2 doubles the RAM to 2GB and expands slightly to 108 x 67mm. Other features appear to be identical, including an RPi-compatible 40-pin connector, four USB host ports, a GbE port, and WiFi. The board is further equipped with micro-USB, microSD, SATA, HDMI, CVBS, and CSI connections. The Orange Pi Plus2E swaps the four-port USB hub for three separate USB ports, and loses the SATA connection, but shaves $14 off the price.   Orange Pi Prime Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-450 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM Price — $29.90 Like the $20 Orange Pi PC 2, the $30 Orange Pi Prime offers a quad -A53 Allwinner H5, a 40-pin RPi header, 3x USB host ports, and micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, CVBS, audio, and MIPI-CSI connections. This larger, 98 x 60mm SBC doubles the RAM to 2GB, however, and adds WiFi, Bluetooth, and extended -10 to 65°C support. Images are available for Android 4.4, Debian Desktop, Ubuntu Desktop, Arch Server, Raspberry Pi, and Banana Pi.   Orange Pi Win Plus / Win Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 2GB DDR3 RAM for Win Plus (1GB on Win); optional eMMC Price — $29.90 (Win Plus) or $25 (Win) While most of the new 64-bit Orange Pi models use the Allwinner H5, the 2GB Orange Pi Win Plus and 1GB Orange Pi Win tap the older Allwinner A64, which is much the same except for its weaker Mali-400 GPU. The Win boards, which appear to be named for its upcoming Windows 10 IoT support, can currently run Android 6.0, Ubuntu Desktop/Server Xenial, Debian Server Jessie, and a Raspberry Pi image. The 93 x 60mm SBC is only slightly smaller than the similarly priced and configured, H5-based Orange Pi Prime. Like the Prime, the Win SBCs provide micro-USB OTG, HDMI, GbE, microSD, audio, MIPI-CSI, and 40-pin RPi connections. They similarly furnish WiFi and Bluetooth, and offer -10 to 65°C support. Differences include a MIPI-DSI LCD interface on the Win boards in place of RCA/CVBS/AV, and the availability of 4x USB host ports instead of three. You also get optional eMMC.   Orange Pi Zero Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H2 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 256MB or 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $7 or $9 (512MB) The Orange Pi Zero is the smallest and cheapest SBC in the lineup. Just a bit smaller than the Raspberry Pi Zero, the 48 x 46mm SBC uses an Allwinner H2 SoC that is much like an H3, but is limited to HD instead of 4K video. The headless, IoT-oriented Orange Pi Zero has only a single USB 2.0 host port, as well as a micro-USB OTG for power, but it offers both WiFi and Ethernet. There’s a 26-pin header compatible with older Raspberry Pis, as well as a separate 13-pin high-power interface, 3x GPIO, debug serial, and a mic interface.   Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H3 / Zero Plus 2 H5 Company/project — Shenzhen Xunlong Software LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner H3 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 1.2GHz with Mali-400 MP2 GPU) or Allwinner H5 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 1.2GHz with ARM Mali-450 MP2 GPU) Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM; 8GB eMMC Price — $18.90 or $19.90 (H5) These rev’d up versions of the Orange Pi Zero have the same tiny, 48 x 46mm dimensions, but offer a choice of two more powerful processors. The Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H3 has an Allwinner H3 instead of an H2, which adds 4K support. The Orange Pi Zero Plus 2 H5 advances to a quad -A53 Allwinner H5, which also moves up to a Mali-450 GPU. Otherwise, the H3 and H5 devices are identical and only $1 difference in price. Differences with the still available Zero include the removal of the USB 2.0 host and 10/100 Ethernet ports, as well as the dedicated mic interface. Yet while the headless Zero was limited to an AV-out interface grouped along with other I/O on the still-available 13-pin function header, the Zero Plus 2 boards add an HDMI port and MIPI-CSI camera interface. They also add 8GB eMMC and Bluetooth 4.2, which is provided on an Ampak AP6212 module along with the previously supplied WiFi. It all looks good for low-cost multimedia, except that the H5 version could really use a 1GB RAM option.   Parallella Company/project — Adapteva, Parallella.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Xilinx Zynq-7020 or -7010 SoC (2x Cortex-A9 @ 667MHz plus FPGA); 16-core Epiphany RISC chip Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 Aimed at power-efficient server clustering applications and parallel programming research, the ever popular Parallella features a Zynq ARM/FPGA SoC running an optimized Ubuntu 15.05 distro called Parabuntu, plus a homegrown 16-core Epiphany coprocessor. I/O includes microSD, GbE, micro-HDMI, and dual USB ports. Four 60-pin connectors provide extensions for I/O linked to FPGA and its novel Epiphany parallel processing chip. Adapteva also offers a $75 Micro-Server version with a Zynq-7010 that omits the USB, HDMI, and expansion I/O. Also new since last year is a $29.50 Parallella Aluminum Case with heat spreading plate and thermal pad, but it’s currently out of stock. A new Epiphany-V chip with 4.5 billion transistors is now several months overdue.   pcDuino Lite WiFi Company/project — LinkSprite Technologies Product page Processor — Allwinner A10 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 1GHz); Mali-400 GPU Memory — 256MB RAM; 2GB flash Price — $29 LinkSprite’s pcDuino Lite has been retired, but the similar pcDuino Lite WiFi lives on. The 100 x 52mm board runs Ubuntu 12.04 with Linux 3.0 on the old-school, Cortex-A8 Allwinner A10. The 5V board offers 256MB RAM, 2GB flash, an HDMI port, an Arduino-style interface, and of course, WiFi. LinkSprite appears to have retired several other boards over the last year, including the pcDuino2, pcDuino3, and pcDuino3B. The newer Allwinner A20 based pcDuino3 Nano is listed as “out of stock — check back later.”   pcDuino8 Uno Company/project — LinkSprite Technologies Product page Processor — Allwinner H8 (8x Cortex-A7 @ 2GHz); PowerVR SGX544 GPU Memory — 1GB DRAM Price — $49 The pcDuino 8 Uno isn’t listed on LinkSprite’s main pcDuino page, but a shopping page is buried on the site. The board features an octa-core Allwinner H8 clocked to 2GHz, combined with the usual pcDuino Arduino expansion. The 92 x 54mm board provides microSD, GbE, USB host, USB OTG, HDMI, audio, MIPI-CSI, and IR connections. An Android-only PCDuino 8 STB set-top box version for the OEM market ships with slightly different I/O and an enclosure.   Pepper 43R / 43C Company/project — Gumstix Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3354 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz); PowerVR SGX530 3D GPU Memory — 512MB RAM Price — $169 Gumstix, which is known for its Overo and DuoVero modules and associated carrier boards, has also shipped some Pepper SBCs in recent years, now supported with full schematics. The original, $250 Pepper that appeared back in 2013 has been replaced with three new models, although with a lower-end TI AM3354 SoC rather than the original AM3359. The AM3354 is paired with a 3D-ready PowerVR GPU, but the SoC lacks the PRU units found on some models. The $169 Pepper 43R and 43C are very similar, but the Pepper DVI-D is sufficiently divergent to deserve its own blurb below. The Pepper 43R supports resistive touchscreens while the Pepper 43C supports capacitive, and each are supported with $39, 4.3-inch Newhaven touchscreen options. The 43R version also adds an 8-ch. bidirectional level shifter and a TI step-down converter among other minor variations. Both boards have a GbE port, microSD slot, dual micro-USB ports, a USB console port, and a TI WiLink 8 WiFi/BT 4.1 LE module with access point mode and U.FL connectors. The Pepper 43 boards are further equipped with 20-pin GPIO, an audio jack, LiPo battery support, a PMIC, and LEDs. The board can be further customized in the Gumstix Geppetto online design and manufacturing service.   Pepper DVI-D Company/project — Gumstix Product page Processor — TI Sitara AM3354 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz); PowerVR SGX530 3D GPU Memory — 512MB RAM Price — $119 The Pepper DVI-D has a similar size, TI AM3354 SoC, and 512MB RAM as the Pepper 43R and 43C (see above), but has a much lower price and a different layout and purpose. Instead of supporting touchscreens, the Pepper DVI-D features an HDMI port (via DVI-D) to support HD output instead of 720p. Other features include a microSD slot, GbE port, audio jack, console port, USB host port, and dual micro-USB device ports. As with the Pepper 43 boards, images are available for Yocto, Ubuntu, and Android. A community portion of the site shared with other Gumstix developers provides projects and tutorials. Like the other Peppers, the SBC is designed with the Gumstix Geppetto DIY design service, and supports further user customization of I/O using Geppetto. You can then send your design to the related Gumstix Geppetto short-run, fast-turnaround manufacturing service.   PICO-IMX6UL-KIT Company/project — Wandboard.org; Technexion; NXP LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 UltraLite (1x Cortex-A7 @ 528MHz); WXGA graphics Memory — 512MB RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $65 The sandwich-style PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is last year’s HobbitBoard rebranded and enhanced with 512MB RAM. Instead of supporting Google’s Brillo OS, it comes pre-loaded with Google’s revamped version of Brillo, called Android Things. The PICO-IMX6UL-KIT appears to be the de facto reference platform for the IoT-oriented OS, which also supports the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Intel Edison. Like the HobbitBoard and the almost identical NXP I.MX6UL Development Platform [PDF], the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is based on TechNexion’s PICO-IMX6UL COM (sold by NXP as the NXP Pico). Despite its commercial foundations, the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT’s COM and carrier have been released with full schematics and open licensing. Aside from the RAM and the OS, the PICO-IMX6UL-KIT is identical to the HobbitBoard, and features a low-power i.MX6 UltraLite (UL), plus WiFi, BT 4.0, 10/100 Ethernet, dual USB ports, an audio jack, and a PMIC. The COM can be removed and plugged into the 70-pin Hirose socket on an Intel Edison carrier. When connected to the 100 x 45mm PICO-IMX6UL-KIT carrier, the Edison connector remains active. The board also offers a MikroBus socket for Click add-ons, as well as four Wandboard-compatible board-to-board expansion headers. The kit goes for as high as $90, but can be found for $65 at ARMkits.   Pine A64 Company/project — Pine64, Inc. LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Allwinner A64 (4x Cortex-A53 cores @ 1.2GHz); Mali-400 MP2 GPU Memory — 512MB (standard), 1GB ($19 Plus), 2GB ($29 Plus) DDR3 RAM Price — $15 to $29 This quad-core, 64-bit Raspberry Pi imitator broke new price/performance ground when it arrived last spring, and it’s still very competitive. Standard features include microSD, HDMI, Fast Ethernet, audio, dual USB 2.0 host, and micro-USB ports. The 127 x 79mm board offers a Pi-compatible, 40-pin connector and a 14-pin Euler connector. There’s also an RTC and -20 to 70°C support. The $15 model ships with 512MB RAM, but we recommend the $19 or $29 Plus models, available in 1GB and 2GB configurations, respectively. These higher-end models also boost Ethernet to GbE, and add a touchpanel interface, MIPI-DSI and MIPI-CSI ports, plus display and camera options. Curated OS mainline Linux based images include Android 6.0/7.1, Remix OS 2.0, Debian Jesse Mate, and Ubuntu 16.04 in Mate, Base, and minimal images. The board is further compatible with openSUSE, Armbian, Arch, Fedora, Gentoo, and more. In January, Pine64 released a SODIMM-style SoPine A64 COM featuring the guts of the Pine A64. It also launched an open source Pinebook laptop based on the same A64 processor, sold for $89 (11.6-inch) or $99 (14-inch).   Raspberry Pi Zero Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2835 (1x ARM1176JZFS core @ 1GHz) with FPU and VideoCore IV dual-core GPU Memory — 512MB SDRAM Price — $5 and up Even when factoring in $5 to $25 more to add various cables and adapters — we’re calling it $14 in our comparison spreadsheet — the $5 Raspberry Pi Zero is still a good deal for space-constrained IoT hacking projects. The tiny, 65 x 30mm Zero upgrades the same ARM11 processor found on the Raspberry Pi A+ and B+ to 1GHz speed. The COM-like SBC ships with a microSD slot, a pair of micro-USB ports, and a mini-HDMI port with audio support, as well as an unpopulated composite video header. Missing are all the USB ports, DSI and CSI ports, and audio jacks found on the Pi 2 and 3.   Raspberry Pi Zero W Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2835 (1x ARM1176JZFS core @ 1GHz) with FPU and VideoCore IV dual-core GPU Memory — 512MB SDRAM Price — $10 and up The new Raspberry Pi Zero W is identical to the RPi Zero except for the addition of the same Cypress CYW43438 wireless chip found on the $35 Raspberry Pi 3, providing 802.11 b/g/n and Bluetooth 4.1 with BLE. The Zero W is available starting at only $10 at outlets like Cana Kit and BuyaPi, but you need the same add-ons as the Zero to get real-world video and USB ports.   Raspberry Pi 2 Model B 1.2 Company/project — Raspberry Pi Trading LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM2836 (4x Cortex-A7 @ 900MHz) or on v1.2 model, Broadcom BCM2837 (4x Cortex-A53 @ 900MHz); Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU @ 250MHz Memory — 1GB SDRAM Price — $35 Last October, the Raspberry Pi 2 was revised with a v1.2 model, replacing the quad -A7 based BCM2836 with the same quad-core, Cortex-A53 BCM2837 used on the Raspberry Pi 3. However, the SoC is still clocked to 900MHz instead of 1.2GHz, and the board lacks the RPi 3’s WiFi and Bluetooth module. Otherwise the RPi 2 is almost identical to the faster, wireless-enabled RPi 3, but with no price discount.   Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Company/project — Raspberry Pi Foundation LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Broadcom BCM43437 (4x Cortex-53 @ 1.2GHz); Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU @ 400MHz Memory — 1GB SDRAM Price — $35 The world’s most popular Linux hacker SBC — and the runaway winner of our 2016 survey — is commonly marked up, but it’s still found at the official $35 price at outlets like Circuit Specialists. The Raspberry Pi 3 gives you everything the new RPi 2 v1.2 does at the same price, and adds a higher clock speed plus WiFi and Bluetooth. Some other boards with the same RPI expansion compatibility can beat it on price, performance, and features, and many are more open source than RPi 3, which like its siblings does not provide complete schematics or open source licensing. Yet, if you want guaranteed Raspberry Pi compatibility (and dependability), and membership in the thriving community, this is still your top pick. Last week, the Raspberry Pi Foundation doubled down on its original educational mission by merging with CoderDojo, a non-profit that organizes learn-to-code clubs for kids 7-17. Practically, the Raspberry Pi Foundation is becoming a corporate member of the CoderDojo Foundation, but will otherwise maintain its identify and association with the commercial Raspberry Pi Trading entity.   Rico Board Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — TI AM437x (1x Cortex-A9 core @ up to 1GHz); PowerVR SGX530 GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM (alternatively 256MB or 1GB); 4GB eMMC flash Price — $99 ($149 for full kit with cables etc.) MYIR’s open-spec, 100 x 65mm Rico Board taps TI’s single-core, Cortex-A9, Sitara AM437x SoC. The SBC integrates HDMI, GbE, and dual USB ports, as well as a 24-bit LCD interface that supports optional 7-inch touchscreens. You also get camera interfaces and dual 40-pin expansion connectors with support for CAN and other industrial I/O.   RioTboard Company/project — Newark Element14, RioTboard.org LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo (1x Cortex-A9 @ up to 1GHz) Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB eMMC Price — $79 The RioT (“Revolutionizing the Internet of Things”) board runs Android or Linux on a low-power, single-core Cortex-A9 SoC. The 120 x 75mm SBC offers several advantages over the similar Wandboard Solo, including twice the RAM, built-in flash, and many more USB ports.   SAMA5D4 Xplained Company/project — Newark Element14, Atmel LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Atmel SAMA5D4 (1x Cortex-A5 @ 528MHz) Memory — 512MB DDR2 RAM; 512MB NAND flash Price — $93.50 SAMA5D4 Xplained is a collaboration between Atmel’s Linux4SAM developers site and Newark Element14. The Linux-ready, IoT-focused SBC showcases Atmel’s SAMA5D4 SoC, which like the earlier SAMA5D3, is limited to a single Cortex-A5 core. The SAMA5D4 adds NEON, L2 cache, and security features, and several models support 720p video. The 138 x 88mm Xplained board ships with 512MB each of RAM and NAND flash, and offers partial Arduino compatibility. You also get HDMI, Fast Ethernet, and three USB ports.   SavageBoard Company/project — Poslab Technology LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo, DualLite, or Quad (1x, 2x, or 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Vivante CG880 GPU Memory — 512MB (Solo) or 1GB DDR3 RAM; 4GB (Solo) or 8GB eMMC Price — $59 (Solo); $79 (DualLite); $99 (Quad) The aging, but recently revised, Wandboard now has direct competition from the similarly configured, i.MX6 based SavageBoard. The 125 x 95mm SBC is larger than the Wandboard and lacks the Wandboard Quad’s 2GB of RAM, but it’s $20 cheaper. Unlike the Wandboard, the SavageBoard offers onboard eMMC storage, although it lacks the Wandboard’s second microSD slot. Among other differences, the SavageBoard’s SDIO/UART connected WiFi and Bluetooth module is a $35 option whereas wireless is standard on the DualLite and Quad WandBoards. The SavageBoard lacks the Wandboard’s user-available mini-PCIe slot, as well as its S/PDIF audio interface, although it does provide MIPI-DSI in addition to HDMI and MIPI-CSI ports. Other features are similar, including a GbE port, 2x USB 2.0 ports, micro-USB OTG port, and COM and audio ports. BSPs are available for Android 6.0, Yocto Project, and Arch Linux. Poslab also has posted a page on its website for an apparently open source HobbitBoard. The SBC is said to be available, but has no price or shopping page. The HobbitBoard is nothing like Wandboard.org’s former Brillo-on-i.MX6 UltraLite based board of the same name, now rebranded as an Android Things based PICO-IMX6UL-KIT SBC (see blurb farther above). The HobbitBoard is based on the SavageBoard, but with a different mix of features.   Seeeduino Cloud Company/project — SeeedStudio LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 (1x MIPS 24kc @ 400MHz); Atmel ATmega32u4 MCU @ 16MHz Memory — 64MB RAM; 16MB flash; 32KB flash for MCU Price — $70 SeeedStudio’s Seeeduino Cloud Arduino Yun clone is a variation on its Seeeduino Arduino clone, and similarly adds Arduino support and the ability to connect the company’s Grove sensor and I/O add-ons. By integrating Dragino’s HE computer-on-module, the Seeeduino Cloud provides a Yun-like Atheros AR9331 WiFi subsystem that runs OpenWrt Linux. Other features include 10/100 Ethernet, USB host, micro-USB, 20x DIO pins, 7x PWM channels, and 12x analog inputs. Like the Seeeduino, the Seeeduino Cloud eases the interface between Arduino firmware and complex web services, in this case via a YunBridge library that delegates all network connections and processing of HTTP transactions to the Linux machine.   Tinker Board Company/project — Asus LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Rockchip RK3288 (4x Cortex-A17 @ 1.8GHz); Mali-T760 GPU Memory — 2GB LPDDR3 RAM Price — $60 Asus’ Tinker Board is the first open spec hacker SBC from a major PC manufacturer, and the first Rockchip-based hacker board with a Raspberry Pi style size, layout, feature set, and 40-pin connector. The RPi 3 is $25 cheaper, but the Tinker Board has advantages like a faster, although still 32-bit, RK3288 SoC, a more powerful Mali T760 GPU, twice the RAM, and GbE instead of Fast Ethernet. It also supports upscaled 4K/30fps playback. RPi3-like features include WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, and 4x USB 2.0 ports plus microSD, micro-USB, HDMI, MIPI-CSI, and MIPI-DSI interfaces. A community site is available with a forum and schematics, 2D and 3D drawings, and other open-spec resources. The only currently available image is the Debian-based, LXDE desktop ready TinkerOS, but Android support is in the works.   Udoo Neo Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 SoloX (1x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Cortex-M4 MCU; Vivante GPU Memory — 512MB DDR3L RAM (1GB on Plus version) Price — $49.90 (Basic) $59.90 (Extended), $64.90 (Full) Like the larger Udoo Quad/Dual SBCs, the IoT-focused, 85 x 59mm Udoo Neo runs Linux or Android on a Cortex-A9-based i.MX6. The Neo, however, is optimized for the single-core i.MX6 SoloX variant, tapping its Cortex-M4 MCU to mimic an Arduino. The specs differ slightly from the Kickstarter package referenced in the news link above. The Udoo Neo Basic provides Ethernet, microSD, USB host, micro-USB OTG, micro-HDMI, LVDS with touch, and a Parallel camera interface. There’s also an Arduino connector, as well as GPIO, UART, CAN, PWM, I2C, and SPI interfaces. For $10 more, the Neo Extended bumps the RAM to 1GB, adds 3-axis motion sensors, and replaces Ethernet with a WiFi/Bluetooth module. The Neo Full is identical to the Extended, but offers both Ethernet and wireless.   Udoo Quad / Dual / Dual Basic Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Quad or DualLite (4x or 2x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz with Vivante GPUs); Atmel SAM3X8E Cortex-M3 MCU Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 (Dual Basic); $115 (Dual); $135 (Quad) Seco’s Udoo project offers three SKUs for its flagship Udoo board. They all measure 110 x 85mm, and are enhanced with a Cortex-M3 based Arduino Due subsystem. The Udoo Dual Basic and Udoo Dual provide the dual-core i.MX6 DualLite while the Quad has the quad-core i.MX6 with a higher-end Vivante GPU. The Dual Basic supplies microSD, HDMI, LVDS with touch, audio, and CSI connections, along with dual USB host and dual micro-USB ports, one of which is OTG. There are 76 GPIO pins in addition to the Arduino interface. The Udoo Dual adds WiFi and GbE connections, and the Quad also adds SATA.   Udoo X86 Company/project — Udoo (Seco) LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Braswell quad-core SoCs (Basic: Atom x5-E8000 @ up to 2.0GHz; Advanced and Advanced Plus: Celeron N3160 @ up to 2.24GHz; Ultra: Pentium N3710 @ up to 2.56GHz); Intel Gen 8-LP GPU Memory — 2GB (Basic) or 4GB (Advanced/Plus) or 8GB (Ultra) DDR3L RAM; 32GB eMMC on Advanced Plus and Ultra Price — Basic $125; Advanced $149; Advanced Plus $165; Ultra $259) The delayed, Kickstarter-backed Udoo X86 SBC finally shipped to backers in March, and is now publicly available. All but the $259 Ultra version with a quad-core Atom X5-E8000 are eligible under our $200 limit. This is the most fully open source of any of the new wave of third-party, non Intel/AMD backed x86 hacker board projects. Since our initial coverage, Seco’s Udoo project has added a Pentium N3710 based “Ultra” version with 8GB RAM and 32GB eMMC. The N3710 is from the same 14nm Intel Braswell family as the Advanced versions’ Celeron and Basic models’ Atom. The SoCs range from 5-6W TDP power consumption, which is low for the x86 world. The Udoo X86 also includes an Intel Curie chip with a Quark MCU. The feature list on this 120 x 85mm device is too extensive to cover here, but highlights include M.2, SATA III, HDMI, 2x DP, wireless, and GPIO. It runs Linux, Android, and Windows 7/8.1/10.   UP board Company/project — Aaeon; UP Community LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Atom x5-Z8350 (4x Cherry Trail @ 1.44GHz/1.92GHz burst); Intel HD 400 Graphics Memory — 1GB, 2GB, or 4GB DDR3L RAM; 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB eMMC Price — $89 (1GB/16GB), $99 (2GB/16GB); $109 (2GB/32GB); $129 (4GB/32GB); $149 (4GB/64GB) The UP board shipped in time for our 2016 survey, but we disqualified it for its lack of open source compliance. Like the more powerful UP Squared (see below), and upcoming, small-footprint UP Core version of the UP board, the original UP is not backed up with full schematics. Yet, the UP Community now offers far more extensive documentation, including some schematics, as well as open source downloads, and goes beyond the typical “community” site in offering tutorials and support. The UP board runs Yocto Project or Ubuntu Linux, Android 5.0, or Windows 10 on a quad-core, 1.44GHz/1.92GHz Atom x5-Z8350 of the 14nm Cherry Trail generation. Various memory configurations are available up to a a $149 4GB RAM, 64GB flash version, and 4GB is also available on the Up board inside the Intel RealSense Robotic Development Kit. The 85.6 × 56.5mm board not only looks like a Raspberry Pi, but it offers a 40-pin expansion bus via an Altera MAX V CPLD that is said to provide RPi 2 compatibility. The UP features 16GB eMMC, a GbE port, a USB 3.0 OTG port, 4x USB 2.0 ports, and two more USB 2.0 headers. The board is further equipped with HDMI, DSI, CSI, I2S, and eDP interfaces.   UP Squared Company/project — Aaeon; UP Community LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Intel Celeron N3350 (2x Apollo Lake @ 1.1GHz/2.4GHz) or Pentium N4200 (4x Apollo Lake @ 1.1GHz/2.5GHz); Intel Gen9 HD 500/505 graphics; Altera Max 10 FPGA Memory — 2GB, 4GB, or 8GB LPDDR4; 32GB eMMC 5.0, expandable to 128GB Price — $145 (Celeron with 2GB/32GB), $169 (Celeron with 4GB/32GB), $219 (Pentium with 4GB/32GB), or $269 (Pentium with 8GB/64GB) The “Up2” (or “Up Squared”), which may be the most powerful hacker-friendly single board computer around, began shipping to Kickstarter backers only last week. It features dual-core Celeron or quad-core Pentium SoCs from Intel’s latest Atom-like “Apollo Lake” generation, although the Pentium SKUs are beyond our $200 limit. As noted in the UP board blurb above, the UP SBCs are not fully open source, but they come close. The 90 x 86mm Up Squared offers 4K video encode and decode, dual GbE ports, dual HDMI outputs, a SATA interface, M.2 support, and mini-PCIe expansion. You also get eDP, dual MIPI-CSI, 3x USB host ports, a micro-USB 3.0 OTG, and both a 60-pin GPIO and a 40-pin interface tied to an Altera Max 10 FPGA. OS support includes Linux (Ubuntu, Ubilinux, Yocto), Android Marshmallow, and Windows 10 IoT Enterprise.   USB Armory Company/project — Inverse Path LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX53 (1x Cortex-A8 @ 800MHz) Memory — 512MB DDR3 RAM Price — $123 (with USB host adapter); $112 (100 Euros) without This tiny (65 x 19mm), Crowd Supply funded SBC for secure computing applications features Trustzone security, USB emulation, and a secure boot feature that lets users apply verification keys that ensure only trusted firmware can be executed on a specific device. The fully open source USB Armory is limited to two real-world ports: a USB 2.0 OTG port and a microSD slot, but you can extend that with the adapter. Surprisingly, this thumbdrive-style SBC supports Android, as well as Linux. A 10-Euro host adapter is required for stand-alone rather than USB stick mode.   Wandboard Reload Company/project — Wandboard.org; Technexion LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — NXP i.MX6 Solo, DualLite, or Quad (1x, 2x, or 4x Cortex-A9 @ 1GHz); Vivante GPU Memory — 512MB (Solo) 1GB (Dual), 2GB (Quad) DDR3 RAM Price — $79 (Solo); $99 (Dual); $129 Quad The venerable Wandboard, a modular, sandwich-style, COM+baseboard assembly featuring a replaceable compute module, was recently updated as a Wandboard Reload. The pricing is identical and the feature set is much the same. The Wandboard Reload adds the i.MX6 QuadPlus as an alternative to the Quad model, bringing an improved Vivante GC2000+ GPU. The SBC’s WiFi has been updated to 802.11ac and Bluetooth to 4.1 BLE. There’s a new PMIC, and Wandboard.org has fixed an HDMI EDID + CEC problem. Features include dual microSD slots, analog and S/PDIF audio, plus GbE, HDMI, camera, serial, USB, and USB OTG connections. The Dual lacks the Quad’s SATA connection, and the Solo also foregoes the WiFi and Bluetooth found on the Quad and Dual. The Wandboard now has head-to-head competition from a similar SavageBoard (see blurb farther above.)   Z-turn Board Company/project — MYIR LinuxGizmos coverage Product page Processor — Xilinx Zynq-7010 or -7020 (2x Cortex-A9 cores @ 667MHz, plus FPGA) or optional Zynq-7020 Memory — 1GB DDR3 RAM Price — $99 (7010) or $119 (7020) The Z-turn Board runs Linux on the Xilinx Zynq-7010 or -7020, which combine dual Cortex-A9 cores with different levels of FPGA circuitry. The 102 x 63mm SBC features HDMI, GbE, and dual mini-USB ports, as well as a variety of sensors, buzzers, switches, buttons, and LEDs. Dual 80-pin expansion connectors express the FPGA signals, and can be configured as LVDS pairs. A $139 kit version adds a power adapter, cables, and a 4GB data card.   Next Steps1.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Sports Smart bats and drones deliver more data to cricket fans Scott Collie June 1, 2017 Intel wants drones, VR and smart bats to improve cricket data tracking  View gallery - 5 images Smart technology has given amateur and professional sportspeople access to a huge array of data. The latest suite of smart sports gear from Intel is focused on delivering more info to cricket players and fans alike, with plans to bring drones, virtual reality and a bat sensor to life later this year. Drones NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW So much of cricket is dependent on the pitch, so being able to analyze how the 22-yard strip of grass in the middle of an oval will behave is invaluable – both for fans and players. Intel plans to outfit its Falcon 8 Drone with high-definition and infrared cameras for pre-game pitch reports, with information about grass cover, grass health and topology for commentators to use during broadcasts. The technology will be rolled out at the Champions' Trophy, which kicked off on June 1 in England. Bat Sensor The new bat sensor is powered by Intel Curie – a tiny module design to act as a low-power, multi-use brain for activewear. Sitting at the top of the handle, it's designed to track every shot a batsman plays. Cricket is an intensely technical game, and small tweaks to a batter's backswing, bat speed or follow-through can be the difference between an embarrassing walk back to the pavilion and a game-breaking century. The tech will be making its debut at the Champions Trophy, where information from the current batsman will be shared with commentators. It will also be available to consumers as "Speculur BatSense" in Australia, Britain, India and the USA in the second half of 2017. "Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside has the potential to transform cricket across a varied audience from coaches to aspiring self-taught cricketers," says Speculur Managing Director Atul Srivastava. "Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman's technique." Virtual Reality Bat tracking has more benefits than telling amateurs how poor their technique is. It will allow fans to slap on a VR headset and test their skills against a virtual bowler. The bat tracking technology will allow visitors to The Oval and Edgbaston to pretend they're out there with their heroes, and give them feedback about their bat speed, back-lift angle and a final score from the VR "session."

Both companies have been firing lawsuits after lawsuits at each other for quite some time now. It is undeniable that the relationship has now been strained especially after one calling the other “unfair” and the other retaliating with an import ban. Now, rumor has it that Apple has gained a new ally with regards to the iPhone 8 that may spell disaster to Qualcomm. Over the past few years, Apple has been dependent on Qualcomm to provide its products for Apple’s range of mobile devices. These are mostly broadband or wireless modems used on most of the iPhones in the market. Last year, Qualcomm has controlled the majority of supplies for the iPhone’s modems. The other part of the spectrum was held by Intel, with its subpar chips. Last year, however, Digitimes reports that the supply for wireless modems will be split equally between Qualcomm and Intel. Furthermore, the report also mentioned that Apple is planning on giving Intel much of the supply percentage by 2018. This could potentially mean the end of Qualcomm modem’s inside the future iPhone and iPad devices. Alleged iPhone 8 mockup unit (by Benjamin Geskin) The only real reason that Apple chose Qualcomm is the fact that it has the better technology when it comes to wireless modems. However, since the release of Intel’s XMM 7560 LTE modem, this will soon change. This is because the said chip is capable of reaching a theoretical 1GB bandwidth. The recent counter lawsuits against each other has certainly not helped Qualcomm’s reputation in this regard. It should be noted that Apple, early this year, withheld almost $1 billion of royalties to Qualcomm on the basis of unfair monopoly. After that, Qualcomm fired with a counter lawsuit regarding patents that are used on the iPhones and has sought to get the said devices banned in the United States. Because the court has ruled in favor of Apple, a few companies have started following suit by not paying royalties to Qualcomm. This has infuriated Qualcomm which leads us to the current predicament. Unless Qualcomm does something drastic about the matter, it risks losing quite a big chunk if its earnings. For more tech update, be sure to check us out at The Bitbag.

The move comes as another major planned tech project, the first element of a €1bn data centre campus planned for Dublin by internet giant Amazon, is also appealed to An Bord Pleanála. In 2015, Thomas Reid of Hedsor House in Kildare won a Supreme Court appeal against a decision by the High Court to allow the IDA to compulsorily acquire land he and his family had worked for more than a century. He sued the IDA and the State after an order was granted permitting the development agency to acquire the 72-acre property, which includes a farm and the Reid family home. Mr Reid did not want to sell his land. He claimed the decision to allow the acquisition of it was flawed and unfair and breached his property rights as well as his rights under the Constitution and European Convention of Human Rights. The IDA had argued it was entitled to acquire Mr Reid's lands under powers granted in the 1986 Industrial Development Act. But the Supreme Court found that the making of the compulsory purchase order in 2012 for Mr Reid's lands had gone beyond the powers of the Act. Last month, Kildare County Council approved plans by Intel Ireland to expand its mammoth facility in Leixlip that would put the Irish site in the running for a potential $4bn (€3.6bn) investment. But there's no immediate intention to build, as the Irish unit has to vie with other global Intel sites for investment. "The planning application is part of a strategic initiative by the Intel Ireland site to ensure that the designated campus is optimised and is in a competitively-placed position to compete for next generation investment within the Intel corporation when major future capital investment decisions are being considered," planners for Intel noted. An Bord Pleanála will make a decision by the end of September. It will also make a decision by that date in the appeal taken in the Amazon case. A key opponent of Apple's data centre project in Co Galway, Allan Daly, has appealed a decision by Fingal County Council to grant permission to Amazon for the first part of what could be a €1bn data centre project, amid energy usage concerns. Another objector, architect David Hughes, told An Bord Pleanála that the financial benefit derived from data centre jobs will be eclipsed by EU fines of up to €300m a year. He claims these could be levied if Ireland fails to meet a target of producing 40pc of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.

Two people living near the multinational’s factory in Leixlip have appealed a recent decision of Kildare Co Council to grant planning permission for a new state-of- the-art facility on the site. Local Labour TD Emmet Stagg expressed disappointment that objections to Intel’s plans had been lodged with An Bord Pleanála. It is estimated the project would create 3,000 jobs during the construction phase as well as 850 full-time jobs at Intel’s base at Collinstown Industrial Park in Leixlip. Intel sought planning permission for the development in November in what was effectively a revamp of planning permission it first secured in 2013. The latest proposed facility is about 50% smaller than the original plan but is still a massive 88,740 sq metres. The multinational, which employs 4,500 full-time staff, says the move is part of a strategic initiative to ensure its Leixlip campus is in a position to compete for a new generation of investment. Mr Stagg said Intel’s Irish operations were in competition with some of the company’s other facilities in Israel and the US. Intel bosses have still to decide the location of the new manufacturing plant estimated to be worth €3.6bn. The company, which has been based in Leixlip since 1990, has invested around €12bn in its Irish plant to date. READ MORE Visit the section home page here © Irish Examiner Ltd.

This webinar will show you how to avoid pitfalls when replacing infrastructure, as well as how to create an effective migration plan. View Now! Just when PCs looked to be dying a slow, painful death, they became interesting again. As expected, this week's news coming from Computex in Taiwan is flush with new PCs and PC technologies, but is it enough to reinvigorate a market that has faced declining sales since 2011? The market peaked at just over 365 million units annually, and fell to 269 million units last year, according to Gartner. So, why all the excitement? The excitement is emerging from both the technology driving PCs and the applications leveraging the processing power of PCs. In terms of technology, the battle between AMD and Intel for processor supremacy has heated up again, along with a new core race. High-End Battle Impact AMD kicked off the new battle with its Ryzen processor, featuring up to eight CPU cores with 16 threads, the equivalent of 16 virtual cores. With significantly lower price points, AMD also lowered the starting price for a well-equipped gaming PC to less than $2,000. Intel has countered with a new line of Core i9 processors that will feature up to 18 cores and 36 threads -- but at a price tag that puts the price of the processor alone at around $2,000. In addition, the graphics processing unit soon will get a significant bump in performance, when AMD introduces new products on its Vega architecture and Nvidia launches products based on its Volta architecture. If that weren't enough, the I/O on PCs is being upgrading to USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, and solid-state drives and memory are getting faster with larger capacities. While these extreme systems won't have much of an impact on average consumers in 2017, the impact of a performance battle at the high end of the market is that mainstream PCs will see new technologies and substantial bumps in performance at much lower price points starting in 2018. For people who want to be productive but are more focused on social media, entertainment and light gaming, Microsoft and Qualcomm are pushing the concept of an always-connected PC, leveraging the performance of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 mobile processor. Think of it as the Microsoft version of the Chromebook, but with the Windows 10 ecosystem and Windows Store, and similarly available from a variety of PC OEMs. VR and AR Ahead On the application side, gaming remains the application driving PC technology and market stability. In fact, gaming is the only area where PCs shipments actually have been growing. However, just on the horizon is a new generation of virtual reality and augmented reality head-mounted displays that hold the promise of improving the PC experience in just about every application -- from engineering and design to entertainment and gaming. This is the first new application well suited for the PC in a long time, because VR and AR require increasingly more processing, graphics and I/O capabilities than the industry can deliver today. More Power Users Despite all the activity around PCs, most industry forecasts still point to a down year in 2017. We haven't seen this much innovation in a tech segment in years, so why is the outlook for PCs still so negative? The answer lies in the dynamics of the market. The first thing to consider is the adoption rate of these new PCs. While gamers are anxious to be on the latest and greatest technology, other power users, like enterprises, have longer and planned upgrade cycles. This means that adoption cycles can take a year or two for new technologies. On the positive side, however, is that power users account for more than a third of the overall PC market, by some estimates, and the their ranks are growing. The shift to Windows 10 by consumers and enterprise users also bodes well for the overall PC segment next year. The second issue is the adoption of new applications and technologies. While VR and AR hold promise, the applications are still limited and evolving toward a must-have user experience. In addition, the cost of the high-end HMDs that provide that rich user experience currently are upwards of $800, well out of the price range of the average consumer. As the number of applications increases, the user experience improves, and as the technology evolves, prices will come down to a more reasonable $200-$300 price range, starting later this year. Finally, there is the competition from other platforms. While PCs are a great platform for VR and AR today, game consoles, mobile devices, and other platforms will offer viable alternatives in the future, especially as HMDs move to next generation high-speed WiFi and 5G wireless interfaces, starting later this decade. Keeping the Momentum Going The new surge in technology around the PC might abate the decrease in PC shipments and may even show an uptick in late 2017 and throughout 2018 as the new platforms are introduced and the technology is pushed down into more affordable price bands, in the view of Tirias Research. Products like the new Asus ROG Strix GL702ZC and the new Dell Inspiron gaming desktops announced at Computex, which are based on AMD technology, target lower price points than the traditional gaming platforms like Dell's Alienware products. The technology surge is a positive for the industry, as the same technology will be used for other platforms, ranging from medical systems to gaming consoles. However, the PC still needs to evolve in both form factor and usage models to sustain this brief surge in momentum. Jim McGregor is principal analyst at Tirias Research.

A major self-driving car trend from this year's CES was not how autonomous cars will work, but what passengers will do in them. A new study from Intel suggests not only how passengers will spend their time, but how much that time will be worth. Popular Searches General Motors Co GM ▲ 34.45 +0.02 +0.06% Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 155.45 +2.27 +1.48% General Electric Co GE ▲ 27.88 +0.16 +0.58% Herbalife Ltd HLF ▼ 73.92 -0.19 -0.26% By 2050, the study says, self-driving vehicle services, including ride-hailing, cargo delivery and in-car entertainment, will be worth $7 trillion in what Intel calls the "passenger economy". Paying for a robo-taxi is just the tip of the iceberg in this major economic shift. The study, sponsored by Intel and written by research firm Strategy Analytics, proposes that passengers might use video conferencing for work or have a self-driving car go pick up lunch, making it ready for a meal on the road. The study's dollar figure takes into account advertising served to passengers, delivery services both heavy and light, and passenger time saved due to the fact that this technology allows for more efficient driving, with fewer traffic jams. The current transportation economy, including trucking and car services, is huge, but the need for human drivers means that people in vehicles usually must remain focused on the road. When reliable self-driving cars hit the market, currently projected for 2021, former drivers will be left with little to do. As the vehicles progress, automakers may even design cabins with more social seating, facing each other as opposed to looking forward. The Intel study predicts that all the time drivers currently spend during the daily commute will turn into free time. The largest chunk of the projected sum, about $3.7 trillion, will come from regular people using self-driving car services. Most of these people, representing about 50 percent of current drivers, will probably not own a personal car. Autonomous cargo delivery and other business services make up another $3 trillion slice of the pie, while new services, which could involve anything from a mobile manicure to meal-on-wheels accounts for another $200 billion. Journalist Greg Lindsay, brought in by Intel to comment on the study, said "self-driving cars will make as big of an impact on society as the advent of affordable cars did in the last century." He said that, as in-car time becomes more productive or enjoyable, people might opt for longer commutes and live further away from cities. Aside from the new passenger economy, the study notes that self-driving cars could save 535,000 lives between 2035 and 2045, due to their inherent safety, along with a savings of $234 billion over the same period in costs that would otherwise be caused by collisions. Intel entered the self-driving car fray earlier this year, opening its Autonomous Driving Garage in San Jose. It competes with other tech companies, such as Google and Nvidia, automotive equipment suppliers and automakers themselves.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Business Image Source: Jose Sanchez/AP/REX/Shutterstock Apple’s fight with Qualcomm could hurt the iPhone 8 Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 1st, 2017 at 5:42 PM Share Tweet Apple has been locked in a bitter dispute with Qualcomm, a major chip manufacturer that has historically supplied the wireless modems for the iPhone. According to a new report, Apple’s legal dispute with Qualcomm is going to have an effect on iPhone 8 components, and Apple might have to substitute some Qualcomm chips with Intel components. Given the inferior quality of the Intel chips in last year’s iPhone 7, that’s not good news. Don't Miss: 10 best new movies and shows coming to Netflix in June According to a Digitimes report, Apple will shift supply of iPhone baseband modems away from Qualcomm and towards Intel, starting this year. The report says that 50% of the iPhone 8 modems could be supplied by Intel, with that number rising to 70% for the 2018 iPhone lineup. Intel’s modems have historically been cheaper but worse-performing than Qualcomm’s solution. A worse modem means less power efficiency but also a worse cell signal with lower speeds — all important things for Apple, especially considering new LTE technologies are being deployed this year, and wireless speed is set to take on a new level of importance. Qualcomm generally supplies the modem for every Android flagship worth talking about, and the iPhone’s reputation is all about reliability and speed. Apple could be forced to make a bad choice here: make an unpleasant legal settlement with Qualcomm, which would likely eat into Apple’s profit margins; or accept an inferior component in nearly half of its brand-new iPhone range. Apple’s dispute with Qualcomm is related to the licensing fees Qualcomm charges for its patents. Qualcomm’s intellectual property is used inside every single iPhone — which Apple acknowledges — but Apple contends that Qualcomm charges unreasonably high patent fees. Apple has sued Qualcomm over the issue in the past, and even instructed its manufacturing partners like Foxconn to stop royalty payments to Qualcomm. The chip manufacturer has countersued in the Southern District of California; if the case there fails, Qualcomm could even take the issue to the US International Trade Commission, and seek a ruling banning the import of iPhones into the US. Nothing’s yet indicated that Qualcomm is prepared to go that far. But the rumors about Apple shifting as much of supply as possible away from Qualcomm is telling. Apple’s bunkering down and preparing for a war with a vitally important component supplier; let’s just hope iPhone customers don’t get caught in the crossfire.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel shows how its Compute Card makes dumb appliances smart 06/01/2017 at 2:21 PM by Brad Linder 6 Comments Intel is starting to show what its upcoming Compute Card modules can do. The company has been stuffing PCs into smaller and smaller packages over the past few years, and that’s culminated in a device that’s not much larger than a credit card. First unveiled at CES earlier this year, Intel announced this week that the first Compute Stick devices are due to start shipping in August. And the company is providing the first real-world demonstrations of the platform for journalists at Computex in Taiwan. The Intel Compute Card isn’t designed to work as a standalone computer the same way that the company’s NUC or Compute Stick devices are. Instead, it’s a module that you can be used to turn a docking station into a PC, a dumb TV into a smart one, or a media player into an upgradeable device, among other things. It could also work as a computer module that you can carry with you throughout the day: slide it into a desktop dock at work or school, then take it home and put it in a laptop dock to access all your files, applications, and settings. Here are a few of the concepts/early designs Intel is showing off: LG, ECS, Sharp, and Dell are showing displays that become all-in-one Windows 10 desktops when you add a Compute Card. Smart Tech is showing a convertible laptop/tablet hybrid. Intel’s “Port Jefferson” dock adds all the ports you’d need to use the Compute Card as a desktop computer. There’s also a cash register prototype and a a rugged PC/router designed for use outdoors. Since each system relies on a removable card, it should be possible to upgrade hardware after you buy it. Or you could change operating systems or user environments by swapping out cards, allowing multiple people to use the same laptop, desktop, or display docking station with their own personal Compute Cards. You’ll most likely end up buying a Compute Card from the same company that makes a laptop/desktop/display dock for it rather than buying one from Intel. And it’s not entirely clear at this point if a module bought for a Dell device, for example, will work with an LG dock. While each Compute Card will have a standard interface, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some device makers try to lock down their system with DRM and/or a slot that only accepts cards with a specific shape. At launch Intel will offer Compute Modules with Celeron N3450, Pentium N4200, Core M3-7Y30, or Core i5-7Y57 chips. Each module supports 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2 and has 4GB of DDR3 RAM. The Celeron and Pentium models are based on Apollo Lake architecture and feature 64GB of eMMC storage. The Core/Kaby Lake-Y versions have 128GB of SSD storage. Prices are expected to range from about $140 to $450. MobileGeeks has a brief video showing some of the Compute Card-powered devices including a laptop, a convertible model, a tablet for use in medical environments, and a small desktop computer-style dock. Update: Roland Quandt has also posted a pretty great hands-on video that, among other things, shows what’s inside the case of a Compute Card: via Tom’s Guide, Engadget, The Inquirer, MobileGeeks, and PC Watch Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 6 Comments on "Intel shows how its Compute Card makes dumb appliances smart" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member zdanee Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

I am less interested in the more mobile devices, given the current state of battery science. In mobile devices the trend is to non replaceable batteries, yet it is the battery that limits the device life. Perhaps this tech will reverse that trend!

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Your next notebook will run for days thanks to… Your next notebook will run for days thanks to Qualcomm — not Intel By Mark Coppock — Updated June 1, 2017 12:25 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: For the longest time — as in, forever – most notebooks have run some version of Windows on an Intel processor. A few machines have run with AMD inside rather than Intel, and MacBooks have run MacOS instead of Windows. But in general, your choices were limited to machines that ran hot, didn’t last all that long away from a plug, took a long time to boot up, and were connected to the internet on a part-time basis. Smartphones have changed all that, however. They turn on instantly, last a long time on a single battery charge, and are always connected. And it’s the mobile ARM processor that’s made all that possible. Intel has chased the smartphone ever since, introducing features like Intel Rapid Start in a partially successful quest to make PCs feel as responsive as smartphones. Now, there’s a version of Windows 10 that runs on ARM processors, specifically on Qualcomm’s latest system-on-chip (SoC), the Snapdragon 835. The combination promises significantly longer battery life on machines that start up as fast as smartphones, and packs in a LTE modem that keeps it connected to the internet on a full-time basis. That’s a nice vision of the future of truly mobile computing, but is it real? We’ve been down this road before, with Microsoft’s Windows RT platform that showed up on its original Surface tablet, and was then promptly put to death. What makes us think that this time around, Microsoft’s initiative will make a difference in how we use our Windows 10 machines? Yes, things really are different this time around If we want to predict if Windows 10 on ARM has a chance of being successful, then we need to discuss exactly why Windows RT was such a failure. There are two main reasons why, and we’re already seeing Microsoft, Qualcomm, and PC makers doing some things differently that could make instant-on, long-lasting, and always-connected Windows 10 notebooks a reality. Windows 10 on ARM will run all 16 million of the Windows desktop applications that people have come to know and love. First, Windows 10 on ARM will run all 16 million of the Windows desktop applications that people have come to know and love. The full version of Office 2016, Adobe’s professional suite of creativity applications, and niche software like AutoCAD will run on the platform this time around. Windows RT was limited to only the paltry apps in the Windows Store, in addition to a ported version of Office 2013. That wasn’t good enough. Second, it’s not just Microsoft working on the project. Qualcomm is fully on board, and at least three influential PC makers are already slated to make ARM-based Windows 10 systems. This forms an interesting alliance. Qualcomm wants to sell more processors, and the PC makers want to sell budget computers without paying for expensive Intel hardware. Everyone involved has reason to make Windows 10 work on ARM, and work well. What will ARM-based notebooks look like? This time around, ARM-based Windows 10 machines will offer real benefits that you’re going to love, without major drawbacks. To begin with, ARM processors use less power than Intel processors, which makes sense. They were designed for smartphones, which are all about squeezing as much battery life as possible out of much smaller battery capacities, while still providing decent performance. According to Qualcomm, ARM-based Windows 10 notebooks will provide up to 50 percent more battery life, and will last for 20 hours on average. It will turn the PC into a device you don’t need charged every day. Next, devices running ARM processors are instant-on. People demand that their smartphones wake up instantly — push the button, and they’re ready to go. The iPad and Android tablets have done this forever. Intel, Microsoft, and PC builders have made some headway into building notebooks that respond quickly, but their efforts are most visible in high-end hardware. People who buy budget computers – in other words, most people – must wait. Better still, ARM-based systems use very little power when in standby mode. Again, Windows notebooks have improved here, but smartphones remain the king of standby power. While a good notebook can last a week or more in standby, the Google Pixel smartphone can last 19 days. This, too, will help make ARM-powered Windows PCs last for days on a charge. Finally, ARM-based systems run cooler. That will enable exclusively fanless designs that run completely silently and won’t require unsightly venting and won’t subject their users to blasts of hot air. Some Intel-based systems are fanless as well, but they typically need to throttle performance more aggressively to keep things cool, and most such devices are expensive. ARM-based notebooks running Windows 10 will be thin and sleek, and they won’t weigh much. Many of them will be 2-in-1 devices, and allow the screen to be used independently as a tablet. In other words, they’ll probably look a lot like iPads, Android tablets, and Chromebooks – but they’ll run Windows 10, instead. What about the performance penalty? Windows 10 on ARM won’t match the performance of Intel’s latest Core processors, or AMD’s Ryzen. Aside from the fact those companies build more powerful, more power-hungry chips than Qualcomm, the way software is written is also an issue. Windows is coded for the x86 instruction set, which is what Intel and AMD chips understand. To make Windows 10 work on ARM hardware, Microsoft has written a comprehensive emulation layer. That is certainly going to result in a performance penalty. The size of the penalty is the biggest unanswered question. No one’s going to want a Qualcomm-powered Windows notebook if it feels slow. The real impact will be on low-end Windows notebooks, where ARM’s advantages are more important. Also, some of the largest and most complex applications, like Adobe’s professional video editing application, Premiere, and AutoCAD, which is used for rendering 3D images, already demand high-end, quad-core Intel Core i7 processors, lots of RAM, and fast GPUs for any kind of performance. Today’s ARM processors aren’t yet capable of matching Intel’s performance running these kinds of apps. However, high-end PCs aren’t the target. The real impact will be on low-end Windows notebooks, where ARM’s advantages are more important. What this means for you is that you will finally be able to use all your favorite Windows productivity, media consumption, and communications apps on a machine that can really last a full day on a single charge. You won’t have to wait for it to boot up, and you won’t have to worry about finding a Wi-Fi connection. Windows 10 on ARM is a big deal So, does Windows 10 on ARM matter? Yes, we think it does. It solves some problems that have plagued Windows notebooks for a long time, and it will likely do so for hundreds less than similar Intel-powered notebooks. In the meantime, you’ll still have those powerful Intel-based Windows 10 machines to choose from if you need to do 3D rendering in AutoCAD or play the latest games in VR and at high frame rates. Companies like Nvidia will keep working on initiatives like GeForce GTX with Max-Q Design to bring increasing levels of gaming performance to even more mobile devices. Gaming may in fact be the greatest weakness of Windows 10 on ARM, as it’s doubtful that games will run well on Qualcomm hardware, particularly after translated through emulation. For most people, though, Windows 10 on ARM will make for a better, more affordable experience, and it leaves plenty of room for Intel and others at the higher ends of the market. Choice is a good thing, and that’s what makes this new platform so important. While the timing of production notebooks powered by Qualcomm is still an open question, they’ll seriously disrupt the PC arena whenever they arrive. Unlike Windows RT, which could only run the more limited Windows Store applications, Windows 10 on ARM looks like the real deal.

Amid this constant news cycle of deals and drama, the purpose of all of it can get lost — or at least a bit muddied. What exactly are these companies racing for? A $7 trillion annual revenue stream, according to a study released Thursday by Intel. The companies that don’t prepare for self-driving risk failure or extinction, Intel says. The report also finds that over half a million lives could be saved by self-driving over just one decade. The study, prepared by Strategy Analytics, predicts autonomous vehicles will create a massive economic opportunity that will scale from $800 billion in 2035 (the base year of the study) to $7 trillion by 2050. An estimated 585,000 lives could be saved due to autonomous vehicles between 2035 and 2045, the study predicts. By 2050, business use of mobility as a service will generate about $3 trillion in revenue This “passenger economy,” as Intel is calling it, includes the value of the products and services derived from fully autonomous vehicles as well as indirect savings such as time. This is hardly the first attempt to place value on autonomous vehicles, nor will it be the last. However, Intel’s study offers a few interesting predictions for autonomous vehicles and how a combination of mobile connectivity, population density in cities, traffic congestion and subsequent regulation, and the rise of on-demand ride-hailing and car-sharing services will be the catalysts in this new economic era. Of course, Intel has a vested interest in rosy predictions about the future of autonomous transportation. The chipmaker has promised to spend $250 million over the next two years to develop self-driving technology, and recently acquired Jerusalem-based auto vision company Mobileye for an eye-popping $15 billion. And Intel is working with BMW to put self-driving cars on the road later this year. So when Intel pays for a study that predicts self-driving cars will cause cash to rain from the sky, it should be seen as equal parts industry analysis and wishful thinking. Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries, the study predicts, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector. These autonomous vehicles will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors, says Strategy Analytics president Harvey Cohen, who co-authored the study. This will relieve driver shortages, a chronic problem in the industry, and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues. One of the bolder predictions is that public transportation as we know it today — trains, subways, light rails, and buses — will be supplanted, or at least radically changed, by the rise of on-demand autonomous vehicle fleets. People will flock to suburbs as population density rises in city The study argues that people will flock to suburbs as population density rises in city centers, pushing commute times higher and “outstripping the ability of public transport infrastructure to fully meet consumer mobility needs.” The pressures of mounting traffic congestion and the correlated emissions will drive regulators to include autonomous vehicles as a part of their larger public transportation plans. Some cities may choose to own the vehicle networks not unlike existing public transportation, the study says. The bulk of the revenue generated in the new economy will be driven by this “mobility-as-a-service.” By 2050, business use of mobility as a service will generate about $3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use will account for $3.7 trillion, or 53 percent, the study predicts. The remaining $200 billion in revenue (of the $7 trillion total) will be generated by new applications and services as driverless vehicle services expand. A key opportunity will be how to capitalize on all of this saved time people will have once they no longer have to drive a car. Vehicles could become “experience pods” Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world, the study says. That’s a lot of time that could be filled with streaming video, news, and other content delivered to a captured audience. It could also change the way cars are used. Vehicles could become “experience pods,” places where people can have their hair styled and cut, conduct a meeting, or receive a health screening. Keep in mind, that this reimagined future doesn’t mean people will necessarily spend less time in cars. One of the great promises of self-driving cars is a reduction in congestion because these vehicles will be able share real-time traffic data and optimize tasks like finding parking. However, in a more densely populated world, where cities rely on shared autonomous vehicles for public transit, there will be more traffic than ever before. The question is: how do people want to spend their time?

The Compute Card comes packed with the full functionality of a standard computer, including an SoC, connectivity, storage, and memory in one slim device. The device slots into a range of devices from laptops, tablets, and AIOs to interactive refrigerators and IoT gateways. The devices can be ejected and replaced, thus decoupling compute from the device and allowing for easy upgrades as the card evolves into more powerful variants. That could also make for interesting new laptop platforms with longer shelf lives. Intel Compute Card SKUs   CD1IV128MK CD1M3128MK CD1P64GK CD1C64GK CPU Core i5-7Y57 Core m3-7Y30 Pentium N4200 Celeron N3450 Memory 4GB DDR3 Storage 128GB Intel SSD 64GB eMMC Connectivity Intel Wireless-AC 8265 (2×2 .11ac & Bluetooth 4.2) Intel Wireless-AC 7265 (2×2 .11ac & Bluetooth 4.2) The Compute Card family offers processors that span from Core to Celeron and come in four SKUs. Each respective product has varying compute, storage, and connectivity options, though the processor serves as the only differentiation between the two high-end options. Aside from listing the processors, Intel hasn't given us an indication of performance. Intel has signed on a bevy of partners to develop new products that leverage the device, including Contec, ECS, Foxconn, LG Display, MoBits Electronics, NexDock, Sharp, Seneca, SMART Technologies, Suzhou Lehui Display, and TabletKiosk. Many of these partners will have products on display at Computex 2017. Dell, HP, and Lenovo are also working on new products, but have yet to reveal any of the end devices. Intel also released its Compute Card Device Design Kit, which is a set of guides and reference designs that simplify and speed up the product development process. In many ways Intel's Compute Card signifies the company's continued push for product diversification as it delves into IoT, automated driving, and other lucrative climes. In this case, its efforts also further its objectives in the mobility space, as we can expect new laptops and AIOs to come to market with the new cards installed. The Compute Card will begin shipping in August 2017, but Intel hasn't revealed pricing info.

It needs to always be plugged into a larger shell to be used? Seems like a really limited use case, but hey, at least it's interesting. https://i.imgflip.com/1q6ecr.jpg Reply bobbozzo - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link Hi, what interfaces are available on the card to the docks? PCIe or USB or ? Reply CharonPDX - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Per the original announcement: "The “flexible I/O” is not Thunderbolt (obviously, due to power consumption concerns), but it handles USB, PCIe, HDMI, DisplayPort connectivity and has some extra pins for future/proprietary use." The physical port consists of a standard USB type C port with an "extension" next to it that is about twice as wide as a type C port. They have not yet published (that I can find) the pinout of that extension. Presumably the type C port contains all standard type C functionality - power, USB, and display. I would guess that either the extension contains PCIe connectivity by itself, or that it's really a "not fully compliant" Thunderbolt 3 port plus an extension for added functionality. Reply Meteor2 - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link So you'd need a USB hub to go with this thing -- one which sends power back? Or just run it headless and wireless, though I can't imagine what you could use it for in that configuration. Reply skavi - Friday, June 02, 2017 - link Why would power consumption be an issue? In my understanding, this would slot into a device that either was either power at the wall or was basically a chassis with nothing but battery. Reply cfenton - Thursday, June 01, 2017 - link It would be pretty cool to be able to upgrade your laptop's CPU without replacing the whole thing. Though, at this performance level it would be a huge downgrade from my current laptop. Maybe someday.

With the minimal increase in IPC since Sandy Bridge it's not like there's a particular reason to upgrade a laptop anyway.

By Tiernan Ray June 1, 2017 1:47 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Canaccord Genuity’s Matthew Ramsay today offers up his views on the announcements this week at the Computex computer conference in Taipei, Taiwan, from the Big Three: Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Ramsay, who has a Hold rating on Intel stock, and Buy ratings on Nvidia and AMD, nevertheless finds that all three made some impressive announcements this week. On the Intel side of things, he notes the company’s announcement of new “Core X” parts for "high-end” personal computers, writing that "Core X-series is an impressive lineup." Among its virtues, the Core X “hits all pricing tiers,” at $242 to $1,999, which is good, and it’s “the most capable high-end desktop platform from Intel to date." Still, he thinks AMD can take desktop share from Intel with the “Ryzen” parts it has put out this year: While we believe Intel will maintain dominant market share and a sustainable leading position in the CPU market in terms of software breadth and raw CPU performance (enhanced further by Optane SSD support in certain applications including gaming), we believe AMD's new 14nm Ryzen processor lineup offers both competitive performance metrics and aggressive pricing and could take incremental share from Intel starting in Q3/17. Things are improving for Intel, but it’s still a wait-and-see story for the company and its stock overall, as far as he’s concerned: Combined with the launch of certain 10nm notebook products and the new Skylake/Purley server platform, we anticipate stronger 2H/17 results for Intel overall. However, while we concede Intel shares generate a strong yield and remain inexpensive, we believe shares could remain range bound as overall gross margins stagnate and until investors see proof that new investments in 10/7nm, FPGAs, auto, IoT and memory are capable of generating strong returns within a reasonable horizon. For AMD, he was surprised that the company didn’t give more details on its “ThreadRipper” chip, first disclosed at its analyst day two weeks ago, which is the part that’s comparable to Intel’s Core X: In light of Intel's announcement during Computex of its Core X- series of high performance CPUs including its ultra high end i9 topping out at 18 cores and 36 threads (at a $1,999 ASP), we had hoped AMD's management would discuss pricing details for their ultra high end Threadripper processors. While no pricing details were discussed, we believe AMD will aggressively price Threadripper and believe the inclusion of 64 lanes of PCIe I/O will prove an important feature. He liked a presentation on the company’s forthcoming notebook part, Ryzen Mobile: EVP Jim Anderson from the C&G group demonstrated for the first time publicly Ryzen Mobile, the ultra-portable APU, with 4 cores, 8 threads and Vega architecture-based graphics in a sub-15mm thickness notebook. We believe the Ryzen Mobile adds strategic flexibility to the rapidly growing notebook gaming segment for AMD, but will face tougher competition versus Intel's 10nm designs in 2H/18. And he’s enthusiastic about AMD CEO Lisa Su’s discussion of OEM partnerships for Ryzen-based PCs: CEO Lisa Su announced partnerships with all of the top global PC OEMs (Acer, Asus, Dell, Lenovo and HP) to have Ryzen CPU-based designs in the market by the end of Q2'17, ranging from high end gaming towers to notebooks to all-in-ones, powered by both Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 desktop processors with many also featuring AMD GPUs. We believe these partnerships and channel strength further solidifies our conviction in the Zen core lineup as we look towards 2H'17 to deliver strong sales growth and margin expansion. Also, the release date of June 20th was announced for the “Epyc” server chip that was also introduced at the analyst day. "While we model under $100M in EPYC revenue this year,” writes Ramsay, "we believe the more important ramp will materialize in 2018 as OEM systems begin shipment and believe a $1B+ server business is achievable by 2020." For Nvidia, Ramsay notes the introduction of “HGX,” a “reference design” to help computer makers construct servers for artificial intelligence computing, which others have commented on. And there was also the debt of “Max-Q,” a set of designs for gaming laptop computers. "As competitor AMD begins to market integrated CPU/GPU single-chip gaming systems, we believe the Max-Q program will prove critical for NVIDIA to maintain leading market share in the emerging gaming notebook market." He likes both announcements: "While neither announcement changes our overall thesis or estimates, we do believe both announcements continue to broaden the NVIDIA ecosystem and increase the runway for Pascal and Volta adoption in gaming notebooks and in the datacenter."

Intel spent several billion dollars - the exact amount is a closely guarded secret - to build and equip a massive Hillsboro factory designed for new generations of computer microprocessors. The chipmaker hired Hoffman Construction in 2010 as the general contractor for the enormous project, called D1X, and court documents show it ordered the company to move rapidly. Work did proceed quickly, according to legal filings. Intel wrapped up the first phase in 2013 and is now developing its next generation of 10 nanometer computer chips there. Construction on a second phase called "Mod 2" began in 2012 and is largely complete, awaiting future iterations of computer technology. Together, the two phases constitute more than 2 million square feet of clean rooms to develop and produce computer chips, plus more than 1 million square feet in associated support buildings. It's the most advanced factory of its kind in the world and among the biggest. Somewhere along the line, though, something went wrong between Intel and Hoffman. The construction firm placed a $50.8 million lien on D1X in 2015, according to Washington County records. Nearly two years later, records show, the lien remains in place. Meanwhile, a complaint filed this year by another contractor indicates Intel and Hoffman are in private arbitration related to what Hoffman charged Intel for changes in construction plans. Details of that dispute are not public, and it's not clear whether that dispute led to the 2015 lien. Intel declined comment. Hoffman and attorneys for the companies did not respond to requests for comment. Attorneys say liens are common in construction disputes, sometimes merely to preserve the option of additional legal action later. And while the amount of the lien is large in this case, it's proportionate to the scale of the project. "In the construction environment, the proceedings tend to be a little more adversarial than in some other settings," said Darien Loiselle, a partner at the Portland law firm Schwabe, Williamson & Wyatt, which does not represent any party in this case. "Liens are used to ensure that validly established claims are in fact paid because the liens attach to the real property if properly litigated," Loiselle said in a written statement. "These claims also allow for a statutory right to attorney fees and costs for the prevailing party, a right that may not otherwise exist under the contract between the parties. Parties asserting them also do so often as a bold statement about the merits of the claim being pursued. " Hoffman's lien on Intel's Ronler Acres campus does not contain details of its dispute with Intel, and the companies' arbitration proceedings are private. However, some issues are visible through a related case brought by another contractor, Harder Mechanical Contractors. The Hillsboro Tribune noted that case in May. In its complaint, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Harder alleges that Intel and Hoffman were sharing some of Harder's proprietary information during arbitration to settle a dispute. Harder's filing indicates that "change orders issued by Hoffman resulted in a dispute between Hoffman and Intel regarding the price Hoffman was charging Intel for Hoffman's work on the Mod 2 project." According to Harder's complaint, Intel and Hoffman disagreed on how to value labor costs and are seeking to resolve their dispute out of court, through the American Arbitration Association. It's not clear from Harder's filing whether the dispute over labor costs is what prompted Hoffman to file the $50 million lien against Intel, or the status of the dispute between the companies.

(CSCO) and eBay Inc (EBAY) The charts aren't favoring INTC or CSCO stock, but EBAY shares indicate a buying opportunity Jun 1, 2017, 12:45 pm EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group     View All   The technology sector has been one of the better groups to be trading this year, as the Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 are outpacing the S&P 500 by more than double. While technology stocks have performed well as a group, some of the more notable names have been stuck in a bearish rut that has potential to worsen. Today’s three big stock charts look closely at Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), as their charts indicate technical tests that may lead to more selling and in one case, an opportunity to “buy the dip.” Intel Corporation (INTC) The semiconductor sector has been on fire for the year, as the group has returned more than 15% year-to-date. Despite the sector performance, Intel has remained a relative strength laggard and it appears that the situation could get worse. After a mixed earnings results, INTC stock vacillated around $37 before the sellers stepped in to take shares to their current $36 and change. This is a critical technical test for Intel shares and their near-term outlook. Intel’s 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages all reside between the prices of $36.00 and $36.20, staging a technical test that will determine the next 5-10% move for INTC stock. A break below these technical trendlines will target $34 for Intel stock, as the sellers will react to the triple technical break, which should be able to provide enough support for this technology bellwether. The bull case, which is less likely, is that INTC stock finds support for a short period of time and rallies from the triple-barreled support. In this case, the stock should target a short trip to $37 and then reverse back to another critical test, which would be more likely to fail. Bottom line is that there are much better stocks to pick from within this sector other than the best-known name of Intel. Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Another tech giant that is struggling to keep up with the market and its peers is Cisco Systems. The networking giant has spent years trying to nail down the direction of product line and services, but the small moving networking companies have been more nimble to adjust to the fast-moving market. Technically, CSCO stock took a beating after its latest earnings announcement, so badly that it moved almost instantly into a technically oversold condition. That has helped the stock from deepening its recent losses, but time is running out for the bulls. The move in Cisco took shares below their 200-day moving average. The move has also put the final touches on transitioning the 50-day moving average of the stock into an intermediate-term bearish trend. This will add to pressure if/when there is a short-term bounce. Traders will take their cue from CSCO stock’s ability to move back above the 200-day trendline within the next week or so. Currently, this moving average is sitting at $31.75 and starting to rollover itself, which would add more selling pressure to Cisco. As if it weren’t enough, CSCO shares are also bouncing on their 20-month moving average. A close below this trendline will mark its official entry into a long-term bear market trend.

You can get a brief overview of the highlights of ASRock's exhibition stand via its blog post overview article. In summary, ASRock is offering a new range of Intel X299 chipset motherboards, Mini-ITX AM4 motherboards, new Bitcoin mining specialist motherboards, a pair of SFF chassis, and its X10 IoT router. However, today I'm going to highlight ASRock's Mini-ITX motherboards for Intel Core-X based, and AMD Ryzen based-systems. The ASRock X299E - ITX/ac is claimed to be "the world's first and only mini-ITX X299 motherboard". It's a tiny size but this motherboard can accommodate a good selection of integrated components and expansion. For example it includes 4x SO-DIMM sockets, two Intel Gigabit LANs, dual band 2.4/5GHz 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, 6x SATA ports, plus triple M.2 sockets onboard. There's a single PCIe 3.0 x16 slot for your graphics accelerator of choice. As AnandTech observes, the board is rather tightly packed, and it reckons that the close integration of the LGA 2066 socket, four DIMM slots, and high-capacity VRMs is a "remarkable engineering achievement". A possible negative side effect could become apparent depending upon your go-to cooling solution, especially as the vertical slot-based USB 3.1 controller, SATA ports and an M.2 slot could encroach on the vital space surrounding the CPU socket. Full specs are tabulated below, next to ASRock's Mini-ITX AM4 motherboard specs. ASRock is also pioneering Mini-ITX for AMD Ryzen users. The ASRock Fatal1ty X370 Gaming ITX/ac features the X370 chipset, if you had not guessed. It features all the essentials you might wish for in such a compact motherboard. ASRock is also launching the Fatal1ty AB350 Gaming-ITX/ac. Standard features of the two tiny AMD Ryzen motherboards include two (APU friendly) HDMI outputs, an 802.11ac Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.2 solution, 7.1-channel sound with Realtek ALC 1220 codec, and custom heatsinks.

That’s the conclusion of an analysis funded by computer-chip maker Intel Corp., which is heavily invested in the driverless car field. If the projections are accurate, the impact of those vehicles, once they become prevalent in coming decades, could touch on areas of life you haven’t considered yet. “Autonomous vehicles will reconfigure time and then space, to some extent, and will ultimately to changes in land use and services,” said Greg Lindsay, a senior fellow at the New Cities Foundation, a nonprofit promoting connected cities. “...Just as automobile ownership in the post-war era led first to a reconfiguring of peoples’ lives... then over decades led to a massive reconfiguring of the U.S. in the form of suburbia and malls.” Intel defines the passenger economy as “the economic and societal value,” including products and services “that will be generated by fully autonomous pilotless vehicles.” It will most likely lead to a sharp decrease in the ownership of personal vehicles as people begin to adopt the mentality of “mobility-as-a-service” in which they arrange for transportation on an as-needed basis. While it will take decades to reach full integration of driverless vehicles, the projected $7 trillion global value will come from three major areas: ■43 percent, or $3 trillion, is expected to come from business use of mobility-as-service. ■55 percent, or $3.7 trillion, would from consumer use of mobility as service. ■Another $203 billion would be generated by new pilotless vehicle services and features. “Ride-hailing companies, such as Uber and Lyft, are pursuing pilotless fleets with the ultimate goal of (eliminating) the need for drivers and converting what is currently a taxi alternative into, in essence, a public transportation network of shared vehicles...,” the report reads. “Some cities may choose to own the vehicle networks not unlike existing public transportation.” Automakers would be forced to shift their focus from sales to individual consumers to the ride-sharing and car-sharing economy. “Carmakers may ultimately vie to operate particular networks of vehicles for particular cities — not unlike cities in China today where local taxi franchises are assigned to particular carmakers (also partially owned by the cities,” the report reads. “What is clear is that carmakers will themselves become fleet operators. With electrification, new market participants may challenge existing incumbent car manufacturers for these franchises.” Companies will no longer be handcuffed by driver shortages, as pilotless fleets boost efforts for industries like package deliver and long-haul transportation. Of the $7 trillion impact predicted by Strategy Analytics, $3 trillion will be generated by businesses utilizing mobility-as-a-service. Apartment buildings, hotels and condominiums will likely provide driverless vehicles to tenants and guests as an amenity, and companies could do the same as a perk for employees. For those who want to hang on to their personal vehicles, there will be new opportunities to capitalize on all of that time when cars are not in use. One study estimates those vehicles sit idle 92 percent of the time, and Personal Vehicle Sharing Networks would allow owners to make their cars available for ride-sharing. With the ability of passengers in driverless cars to utilize their ride time more efficiently, the idea of longer commutes may not be so daunting. “Eventually, you’ll see changes in land use, where you start to see, perhaps, the rise of massive new exurban suburbs where people are willing to commute two or three hours a day each way because of how they are able to use their time,” Lindsay said. And those longer commute times, where passengers inside the vehicle are no longer required to have their eyes on the road, create all kinds of opportunities for on-board productivity or entertainment. “The enhanced safety offered by pilotless vehicles will enable the vehicle to finally become a media and entertainment hub,” the report reads. “The number of screens in vehicles will expand and the use of heads-up displays for rich media and other content presentation and viewing will grown steadily.” That sounds like good news to Jim Daniels, manager at WoW Electronics in Eastpointe. The company has been installing electronics in vehicles, old and new, for nearly a decade and a half. And the prospect of autonomous vehicles becoming a moveable entertainment center is intriguing. “I think that might be a boost for us with people having the ability to spend more time with the technology,” he said. “If the car is driving itself, you could have the whole family in the back seat watching movies or going on the internet.” jlynch@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2034 – 23 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2ruDFjz TOP VIDEOS Impressions of Wednesday's Mackinac Conference 6:41 Flyover of the Little Caesars Arena neighborhood 0:38 Spirit airlines unveils new maintenance hangar at DTW 1:24 Raw video: Taking a hot lap on Belle Isle 3:58 Little Caesars world headquarters hosts 'topping out' ceremony 1:33 Entrepreneur/actor Hill Harper an admirer of Detroit 2:55 Construction continues on M-59 1:51 Packard site owner: 'We will not fail' 2:56 QLine prepares for its debut 1:35 Patterson concerned about job skills gap 2:51 Small businesses Editorial: Connectivity will drive state’s future The Detroit News Ford Foundation president stresses collaboration Neal Rubin Column: Trump tax cuts will put America back to work Stephen Moore Column: Winning the race in connected technology Wright Lassiter III WeWork, Quicken hand out $2.5M in business contest The Detroit News Grand Rapids loves the high-flying Griffins Ted Kulfan

Anita Balakrishnan | @MsABalakrishnan Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 12:58 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Asa Mathat for Vox Media Brian Krzanich at the 2017 Code Conference on June 1, 2017. "Powered by Intel" was a familiar tagline when personal computers ruled the Earth. With the PC market in a slow but stabilizing decline, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said consumers will start seeing the hearing the slogan with a new suite of products. Krzanich spoke on Thursday from the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The chipmaker and enterprise technology company has been investing in technologies like virtual and augmented reality headsets — tools that have cropped up in the sports industry, one of the content areas that really "brought people to the internet," Krzanich said. Intel announced a new deal on Thursday to provide live and on-demand virtual reality experiences for the next three years for Major League Baseball. The deal comes after Intel's high-profile Super Bowl promotion, which let viewers see the game through the eyes of the players. Intel has faced an uphill battle in its traditional arenas, with Qualcomm powering many popular Android phones, and Nvidia becoming increasingly powerful in high-end computers. Meanwhile, PC shipments posted a year-on-year decline of 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. But Krzanich pushed back on the idea that Intel is lagging, noting that Intel is among the top companies when it comes to patents, and defends them when needed. (Rival Qualcomm is also near the top of the pack, according to IFI Claims data). Intel has been investing behind the scenes in technologies like cloud servers, drones and self-driving cars, working with regulators and ethics experts on privacy and safety issues.

This self-driving market includes consumer mobility, business-to-business mobility and pilotless vehicle services. Phil LeBeau | @Lebeaucarnews Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 1:00 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters The future of driverless cars    Thursday, 1 Jun 2017 | 1:15 PM ET | 00:59 Why are so many automakers, tech firms, components suppliers and ride-hailing companies pouring billions of dollars into developing self-driving cars and trucks? In part, it's because the payoff could eventually be worth $7 trillion. That's the estimate of a new study from the research firm Strategy Analytics and Intel, one of several tech giants investing heavily in autonomous-drive systems. "This technology is driving big changes," said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel's Automated Driving Group. "Time will be freed up by people not driving, there will be increased productivity and new goods and services to be consumed." The study predicts a global "passenger economy" will start to grow after the first fully autonomous-drive vehicles hit the market in the next four to five years. At first, there will not be many, and their use will be limited, but by 2035 Intel expects the passenger economy will climb to $800 billion worldwide. In 2050, Intel estimates, the global passenger economy will be worth $7 trillion. While it's too soon to know which companies will profit the most from the new world of transportation, Intel estimates the money will come in three primary areas. $3.7 trillion from consumer mobility-as-a-service Includes: Vehicle car-share and ride-share companies. $2.9 trillion from business/business-to-business mobility-as-a-service. Includes: Freight and self-driving delivery companies. $203 billion from pilotless vehicle services Includes: Consumer businesses like restaurants, health-care providers, entertainment companies. Initially, many of the autonomous vehicle services and benefits will be found in cities and suburban areas with large populations. However, analysts believe self-driving vehicles will also reach rural areas. "There are probably people in a rural area who have as much of a need for autonomous-drive vehicles as someone in a city," said Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility in the global automotive practice at Strategy Analytics. While the dollar impact of the coming passenger economy is huge, the other benefits of widespread adoption are enormous. For example, Intel estimates pilotless vehicles will save at least 585,000 lives between 2035 and 2050.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Intel predicts autonomous cars will spawn a ‘passenger economy’ Dean Takahashi@deantak June 1, 2017 10:00 AM Above: Intel is working with BMW to make self-driving cars a reality. Image Credit: Intel Intel and market researcher Strategy Analytics have applied their collective brainpower to the impact of self-driving cars, and they’re predicting that we’ll see a “Passenger Economy” emerge from all of the services targeted at people while they are no longer driving their cars. By 2050, Intel and Strategy Analytics made the astounding prediction that the passenger economy will have a $7 trillion economic impact. The companies estimated that the passenger economy (services to fill the idle time while you ride in a car) would be more than twice the size of the sharing economy (based on companies such as Uber or Lyft that share resources across many people) by 2050. I have to remark how easy it is to ridicule this research. Economists have a hard enough time predicting economic change on a monthly basis. Intel paid Strategy Analytics to look at the economy 33 years from now, and it came up with a figure for the passenger economy being worth $7 trillion in 2050. Despite my light-hearted skepticism, Intel and the researchers are dead serious about the huge impact that self-driving will have. Above: Intel believes 5G wireless will bring lots of services to cars of the future. Image Credit: Intel Qualcomm recently looked into the same thing, starting with some very different assumptions. Qualcomm paid for a research paper created by David Teece, professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and market researcher IHS Markit to assess the impact of 5G mobile technology — which Qualcomm is playing a big hand in bringing about — on the economy. That report said 5G would create 22 million jobs and $12.3 trillion in impact on goods and services by 2035. These predictions are surely going to be wildly off the mark, but I won’t be around to check — unless of course there are some real breakthroughs in biotechnology that will keep my brain intact. My prediction is that, thanks to Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the climate change accord, that the headquarters of both Intel and Qualcomm will be underwater by 2050. That said, I find the discussion that these reports trigger to be very interesting. When I think back to debates about the mobile Internet, I recall a lot of fears that Europe and Japan were going to jump ahead of the U.S. because they set aside the proper amount of bandwidth early for it. And in fact, these fears came to pass. Europe and Asia are far ahead in some respects, with faster wireless broadband and better services on top of those networks. Indeed, maybe companies such as WeChat, Kakao, Supercell, and NCSoft would be based in the U.S. if policy makers had moved faster and planted the seeds for a mobile economy. Qualcomm’s study found that 91 percent of those surveyed expect 5G to create new products and services that have yet to be invented. The report assumes that it may take something like a decade for autonomous cars to become mainstream and make a real impact on society. By 2035, the passenger economy will only be about $800 billion. The real growth comes from 2035 to 2050, which is about the same time period when we’ll need to have flying or floating cars because of climate change. Above: Intel and self-driving cars. Image Credit: Intel Greg Lindsay, urbanist, mobility futurist, and coauthor of Aerotropolis: The Way We’ll Live Next, said in a press call about the Intel report that the $7 trillion figure might be really conservative because self-driving cars could be the biggest change in transportation since the creation of the “horseless carriage.” The idea of “mobility as a service” will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations, and usage. Indeed, if I’m not going to drive my car, maybe I don’t need to own it. And if I don’t own it, I won’t take it to Jiffy Lube, and Jiffy Lube will have to serve some giant self-driving car rental agency instead. Mobility as a service is expected to be a $3 trillion industry by 2050, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Above: The breakdown of a $7 trillion passenger economy by 2050. Image Credit: Intel Consumer use of mobility as a service is expected to be about $3.7 trillion of the passenger economy, or 55 percent of the total. And another $200 billion is expected to come from consumer use of innovative applications and services. From 2035 to 2045, the report estimates 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving cars. Collectively, autonomous cars could save us more than 250 million hours of commuting time a year. Reductions in public safety costs could amount to more than $234 billion of the passenger economy from 2035 to 2045. Hmm. Maybe that means there won’t be so many highway patrol jobs? On the other hand, Lindsay said that if it is no longer such a chore to drive, people might not mind traveling to work over a longer period of time, like maybe two hours, because being a passenger isn’t so taxing as driving. Intel envisions onboard beauty salons, touchscreen tablets for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile health care clinics, and treatment pods. And who needs to use valuable real estate to park cars anymore? In fact, it might make a lot of sense for an apartment landlord to offer an autonomous car service as a part of the rent for an apartment. Above: An artist’s illustration was part of the “When Cars Can Talk: Readying the Network for 5G and the Autonomous Driving Era” presentation at Intel’s one-day autonomous driving workshop. Image Credit: Intel Roger Lanctot, director of automotive connected mobility at Strategy Analytics and a coauthor of the report, said that we could actually cram more vehicles onto the road because they will be so good at avoiding collisions. That could help us deal with all of the trucks that Amazon puts on the road because it has wiped out stores. And I’m sure that advertisers will find ways to blast us with location-based advertising. Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s automated driving solutions division, said in a call that Intel thinks the history of technology is worth remembering here. We’ve seen massive societal transformations as digital business models were ushered in by personal computing, the Internet, ubiquitous connectivity, and smartphones. She believes autonomous driving will do the same. It’s like looking back at the space race and seeing the unpredictable things — like the semiconductor chips that Intel itself makes — that came from it, Lindsay said. “We started thinking about other evolving economies,” Winter said. “Why do we care about this passenger economy? As more of us understand the future, the more we can plan and adapt. This massive new economy is driving big changes in the way we do things.” In short, I find it fascinating to think about the changes that will come in society as technology advances. But I still have a hard time thinking about these reports as scientific. By the way, I asked if that $7 trillion estimate had a big margin of error. “Based on studies looking on similar market sizings like the adoption of 5G, many come out in a similar vicinity,” said Lanctot said. “There is enough to suggest an acceptable margin of error.” VB Recommendations Why shortcuts for Google Home are a total waste of time Are chatbots just another fad?

The Democratic nominee in last year’s bitterly fought White House race addressed a technology conference in California, speaking at length about what she termed a Moscow-led campaign of “disinformation” against her that influenced the vote. “The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the Intel and counter-intel people I’ve talked to, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided,” Clinton told the Recode conference, referring to an avalanche of false information, social media bots and hacks of Clinton campaign emails. Some of those people helping the Russians, she said, had access to “polling and data information.” Asked by a moderator who those individuals might be, Clinton said: “We’re getting more information about all of the contacts between Trump campaign officials and Trump associates with Russians before, during and after the election. So I hope that we’ll get enough information to be able to answer that question.” “I’m leaning Trump,” she said of the connections. “I think it’s pretty hard not to.” The Republican president struck back in a tweet late Wednesday, criticising Clinton for failing to take responsibility for her loss. “Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC,” he said. He was referring to Clinton’s assertions during her talk that fake news about her was spread on Facebook, and that the Democratic Party, unlike the well-funded Republicans, did not have a sophisticated data system. Clinton snapped back at the president in a brief message on Twitter. “People in covfefe houses shouldn’t throw covfefe,” she wrote. Trump used the non-existent word in an incomplete sentence tweeted just after midnight Tuesday. The tweet remained online for some 5.5 hours, sparking worldwide ridicule. The message was finally deleted early Wednesday, and Trump joked about it in a subsequent tweet. When White House spokesman Sean Spicer was asked about the cryptic word he told incredulous reporters that Trump “and a small group of people know exactly what he meant.” He gave no further explanation. Several US congressional committees have launched investigations into Russia’s efforts to influence the 2016 election and its possible coordination with Trump campaign aides or associates. The Department of Justice has appointed a former FBI director as a special counsel to head a separate, independent investigation. Clinton, who ruled out a new election bid, told Recode that the best example of such coordination took place in October. WikiLeaks released emails hacked from her campaign chief John Podesta within an hour of a 2005 video of Trump boasting about how he could get away with groping women was leaked to the press. “They had to be ready for that, and they had to have a plan for that and they had to be given the go-ahead; ‘OK, this could be the end of the Trump campaign. Dump it now,’” she said. As she had done previously, Clinton also said that then-FBI director James Comey dealt her campaign “a tremendous hit” when he briefly reopened an investigation into her use of a private email account and server just days before the election. “He dumps that on me on October 28, and I immediately start falling,” she said. The presidential vote was November 8. While she said she takes “responsibility” for the loss, Clinton appeared reluctant to publicly discuss her own campaign mistakes. Despite losing the indirect but all-important state-by-state electoral college count, “I won three million more (popular) votes than the other guy,” she said.

Despite inferior performance, Intel has gone from supplying around 30% of iPhone 7 baseband chips in 2016 to 50% in 2017. And experts say it could be supplying over 70% of the baseband products for iPhones by 2018. Earlier this year, Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in a California district court for charging unfair prices to license its tech. Qualcomm has since countersued Apple, and withheld around $1 billion in royalty rebates from the iPhone-maker as retaliation for its participation in a Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation. Given the nature of this feud, don’t be surprised to see Apple work to dramatically reduce its reliance on Qualcomm over the next several months. The company recently hired Esin Terzioglu, Qualcomm’s VP of Engineering, to head up a new chip project. It’s believed they are developing their own, in-house baseband modems.

Any tech company will always walk on someones toes until they figure a way of doing something differently but hopefully Apple can achieve this. Niclas Using inferior chips in a flagship product of Apple is just redicious, especially when it comes to something so essential as the baseband.

Shareholders Have Something to Worry About The chipmaker’s future relies heavily on its rivals dropping the ball. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jun 1, 2017 at 11:00AM AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), which rallied nearly 140% over the past 12 months, is a highly divisive stock among tech investors. The bulls believe that AMD's new x86 Ryzen CPUs and upcoming Vega GPUs can strike critical blows against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) in their respective markets. The bears meanwhile note that AMD repeatedly failed to beat both bigger chipmakers in the past, and that too much of its future relies on the Ryzen and Vega's success. While I'm not bearish on AMD, I believe that investors should still worry about several major headwinds facing the company. Image source: AMD. The ongoing battle with NVIDIA AMD stole the spotlight from NVIDIA last June by launching the RX 480, which was the cheapest "VR ready" card on the market at $200. But over the next few months, NVIDIA struck back across the low-end market with the GTX 1050 ($109), GTX 1050 Ti ($139), and the GT 1030 ($80). The GTX 1050 Ti was approved by Oculus last October, making it the cheapest VR ready card on the market. AMD responded by lowering the price of its VR-ready RX 470 from $179 to $169, but that low-end card still remained pricier than the GTX 1050 Ti. AMD's next big push against NVIDIA will be the launch of its next-gen Vega cards this summer, which could overtake NVIDIA's current-gen Pascal cards in terms of raw graphical horsepower. However, it's unclear how long that lead will last, since NVIDIA will likely launch its next-gen Volta GPUs for mainstream consumers in early 2018. This upcoming clash could follow the same cycle as the low-end GPU battle last year, with AMD winning the initial benchmarks but provoking a fierce retaliation from NVIDIA. Other potential pain points... The two major gaming consoles -- the PS4 and Xbox One -- are both powered by AMD SoCs. The revenue from those consoles is the core pillar of growth for AMD's EESC (Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom) unit. However, NVIDIA's Tegra chip now powers the Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Switch, which has been stealing the spotlight from the PS4 and Xbox One with its hybrid design and well-received launch titles. The Switch's success shows that NVIDIA's Tegra has the graphical muscle for hybrid devices, which bodes well for its future in other smaller devices -- like AR/VR headsets, set-top boxes, gaming tablets, or other handheld devices. Image source: Nintendo. When NVIDIA's graphics licensing deal with Intel expired earlier this year, NVIDIA stopped receiving $66 million in "free" revenue per quarter. Earlier this month, rumors suggested that Intel would sign a graphics deal with AMD to replace that deal and give AMD a much-needed injection of "free" revenue. However, Intel later claimed that report was false. The upcoming battle with Intel AMD's new Ryzen chip recently impressed investors when initial benchmarks showed that the top-tier Ryzen 7 1800X matches Intel's 8-core Core i7-6900K in single-threaded performance, and beats it in multi-threaded performance -- for half the price. But here's the catch -- the 14nm Ryzen is considered a next-gen chip for AMD, while the Core i7 in the comparison is Intel's current-gen 14nm Kaby Lake chip. AMD also plans to loosen Intel's iron grip on the data center market with Naples, a high-end Zen processor that has more cores than Intel's current-gen Skylake-based Purley CPU. But once again, this is technically a next-gen to current-gen comparison. Intel isn't sitting idly by and letting itself get overtaken by AMD. On the PC front, it plans to launch its newer Coffee Lake (14nm) and next-gen Cannonlake (10nm) chips near the end of 2017. On the server front, Intell could soon release an updated version of Purley which boasts just as many cores (32) as Naples. Why AMD remains a speculative stock The problem with AMD is that it needs its next-gen chips to gain enough traction against NVIDIA and Intel before those bigger rivals strike back with potentially faster chips. If you're a PC owner who wants to upgrade an aging desktop PC, you're likely wondering if you should buy AMD's Ryzen and Vega chips this year, or wait and buy Intel's Cannonlake CPUs and NVIDIA's Volta GPUs instead. Big companies will likely want to see comparisons between Naples and the new Purley chips before authorizing any sweeping upgrades. I'm not saying that AMD is a bad buy at current levels -- it's actually fairly cheap at 2.2 times sales (relative to the industry average of 4 for semiconductor makers). But investors would be foolish not to worry, since AMD's future depends heavily on NVIDIA and Intel's new chips falling short of market expectations.   Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News politics Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air SENATE Senate panels dueling for witnesses in Russia Investigation By Brooke Singman Published June 01, 2017 Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Email Print   Two powerful Senate committees are probing alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election - and possible collusion with the Trump campaign,  but only one panel has managed to line up key witnesses. Both the Senate’s Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are leading separate investigations, but the two panels are dueling for information—and the Senate Intel Committee is winning. Fox News has confirmed that former FBI director James Comey will testify before the Senate intelligence committee on June 8. On May 19, the fired FBI chief declined Judiciary’s request to testify—but this wasn’t Judiciary’s first disappointment. “The Judiciary Committee has primary responsibility for FBI oversight,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who sits on the Judiciary Committee said when Comey declined the panel’s request. “If former Director Comey testifies, he should do so before both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.” Days after Comey’s May 9 ouster, the Intelligence Committee heard testimony from Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. On that same day, Intel committee members met with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who penned a letter to the president recommending Comey’s firing. The day after, the Judiciary Committee followed Intel’s lead, and requested the same committee briefing with Rosenstein on May 12, and invited McCabe for one as well, but the committee received no response. Judiciary also requested the Comey memos which reflected conversations he had with President Trump regarding the investigation, and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who reportedly will hand over subpoenaed personal and business records to the Intelligence Committee.  “The FBI said it is still reviewing the request to provide Comey memos following the announcement of special counsel,” a Judiciary committee spokesperson told Fox News in an email on Wednesday. “We’ve not heard back on our requests for briefings from McCabe and/or Rosenstein.” But the Department of Justice downplayed the Judiciary Committee’s concern with a lack of response from Rosenstein, noting he briefed the full Senate May 18. “This request came in before the Deputy Attorney General appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel and before he had briefed all 100 members of the U.S. Senate,” DOJ Director of Public Affairs Sarah Flores told Fox News. “Since that appointment, briefings related to that ongoing investigation from the Department would now be coordinated with Special Counsel Mueller’s office.” When asked about a possible McCabe appearance or response to the Judiciary Committee’s request, an FBI spokesperson told Fox News that the bureau works with “all of our oversight committees on their requests.” But former FBI special agent and former bureau national spokesman John Iannarelli told Fox News that it makes “perfect sense” for top witnesses to choose to provide testimony before Intelligence, rather than Judiciary. “Choosing the Intelligence Committee over Judiciary makes perfect sense because this is for intelligence purposes—has the president or his staff compromised intelligence?” Iannarelli said. “This is an intelligence-based inquiry, anyway.” Iannarelli added: “This could also be further indication that nothing is here that actually compromised sensitive intelligence, especially because Comey agreed to testify in an open setting.” But the Judiciary Committee isn’t giving up. On May 20, Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-IA, took to Twitter and said the Committee would continue. JudiciaryCom must continue FBI oversight even w SpecCounsel Can't wait months for Mueller report Judiciary needs to know so we can act&clear— ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) May 20, 2017 “JudiciaryCom must continue FBI oversight even w SpecCounsel Can’t wait months for Mueller report Judiciary needs to know so we can act&clear,” Grassley tweeted. Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., sits on both committees, and will have her opportunity to press Comey when he testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Feinstein’s office told Fox News they would not comment. Despite media reports that Comey has been cleared by Special Counsel Mueller to testify in public next week, a Mueller spokesperson told Fox News that he had no information on Comey’s potential testimony, or whether Mueller cleared him for public testimony. Congress is currently out of session, and will resume business next Tuesday. Comey will testify before the Intelligence Committee on Thursday, June 8, in an open session, followed by a closed session.  Brooke Singman is a Reporter for Fox News.

Intel’s camera pods will help provide VR streams to fans this season. Photos via Intel. You can now watch MLB games in virtual reality. Starting June 6, MLB will launch a VR livestream of one out-of-market game each Tuesday in June. It’s part of a new 3-year deal with Intel, which is helping power the experience via its Intel True VR app and 4K-resolution camera pods set up at various stadiums around the league. The feed, which is free to access and available on Samsung Gear VR headsets, will let viewers select from five camera angles — home plate, first base, third base, center field, and a special pitcher-batter view — that offer 360-degree views of the live action. Or, they can choose a “sit back” mode that is a fully-produced VR broadcast experience. There are also real-time statistics and exclusive in-app commentary available on the stream. After the game, highlights and on-demand replays of each game will be made available in VR. Here are the four games: Cleveland Indians vs. Colorado Rockies on June 6 at 5:40 p.m. PT / 8:40 p.m. ET Kansas City Royals vs. San Francisco Giants on June 13 at 7:15 p.m. PT / 10:15 p.m. ET Detroit Tigers vs. Seattle Mariners on June 20 at 7:10 p.m. PT / 10:10 p.m. ET St. Louis Cardinals vs. Arizona Diamondbacks on June 27 at 6:40 p.m. PT / 9:40 p.m. ET You can download the Intel True VR app here via the Oculus store. David Aufhauser, managing director of strategy and product for Intel Sports Group, told GeekWire that “there will be opportunities for advertisers and sponsorships to be apart of this,” but didn’t offer more details.  This is separate from the VR-ish offering that is going live on MLB’s At-Bat app today. Those feeds, streamed for each game, don’t provide a 360-degree view but instead a two-dimensional format with the normal broadcast view. It’s available for Google’s Daydream View headset. Intel, which partnered with MLB last year during the All-Star Game, continues to push forward in the sports industry. In March, Intel livestreamed the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in virtual reality via a partnership with the NCAA and Turner. It also aired a virtual reality feed from the Players’ Championship last month. This past fall, the company established its Intel Sports Group, right around the time it acquired virtual reality startup Voke. Much of the Intel True VR experience is powered by technology that Voke helped develop — you can hear from Voke co-founder Dr. Uma Jayaram at our upcoming GeekWire Sports Tech Summit. Intel continues to build products and services with wearable computing, connected devices, and more that have application in the sports industry. MLB, meanwhile, isn’t the only league testing virtual reality. The NBA offered its own VR streams this season in partnership with NextVR; NASCAR did something similar last year. MLB announced a live streaming deal with Facebook last month.

Google Cloud has updated its Compute Engine with virtual machine instances, making it the first cloud provider to offer Intel’s Skylake. Google Cloud has become the first major cloud provider to offer Virtual machine instances using Intel’s Skylake processors. The Skylake Xeon processors, which are now generally available, include up to 64 vCPUs and 455GB of RAM supporting a range of compute-intensive workloads, data analytics and engineering simulations. Google Cloud revealed that the customer demand for Intel’s Skylake has increased and since its launch for the Compute Engine in February, customers have run several hours of compute Skylake VMs. According to Google, the new general availability release enables customers to create new VMs with Skylake across all the VM instance types in Compute Engine. This includes standard, highmen, highcpu, Custom Machine types and Preemptible VMs. Read more: Google Cloud boosts machine learning portfolio with Nvidia GPUs The decision to begin offering virtual machine instances using Intel’s processors is a smart move made by Google to compete against its rival cloud providers such as AWS, which announced a set of Skylake-powered C5 instances for its Elastic Compute Cloud in 2016 but are still yet to launch. The Google Cloud Platform also released several updates to its Compute Engine to allow developers to easily select their preferred CPU platform for VMs within a particular Google Cloud region, whilst also being able to choose the suited CPU features. Developers were previously restricted with the amount of RAM space per vCPU they were entitled to, but Google has now extended the memory and removed the restrictions to up memory space to a maximum of 455GB per VM instance. This helps Google offer a wider memory space to user applications that may benefit from flexible memory configurations for better performance. Google Cloud has made Skylake available in three of its regions, Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific with general availability across every region at no extra cost for a limited time.     Tags Google Cloud Platform Intel Processors Previous Article5G – A building block for the smarter city Next ArticleOneLogin data breach: Encrypted info at risk following hack on password manager Most read Bluewolf taps Einstein & Watson to bring AI to telecoms Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 UK General Election hacked – 80% think it could happen Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 Cisco Enterprise Agreement revolutionises software licensing James Nunns 31st May 2017 Latest White Papers How Intel IT’s Integrated Analytics Platform Helps Sales and Marketing By Intel Le stockage de demain By Kaminario Overcome the Attacker Advantage with McAfee Endpoint Security By Intel Editor’s Pick OneLogin data breach: Encrypted info at risk following hack on password manager Ellie Burns 1st June 2017 Red Hat CEO on being an open source zealot James Nunns 31st May 2017 IBM, Cisco team up to fight cyber crime across networks and cloud Ellie Burns 31st May 2017 Related News Using Data Gravity to Accelerate your Business Ellie Burns 2nd June 2017 Adobe Document Cloud adds Scan & Sign James Nunns 2nd June 2017 The Great OpenStack Delusion – how open source cloud infrastructure can overcome a crisis James Nunns 2nd June 2017 Latest in 4th Revolution 4th Revolution Qualcomm patent issued for ‘The Internet of Shoes’ Joe Clark 19th May 2017 4th Revolution Report: Automation boosts revenues 15% and creates, not steals, jobs Ellie Burns 10th May 2017 4th Revolution Self driving car push by Intel sees BMW tie-up and Autonomous Driving Garage Joe Clark 4th May 2017 Latest in Analysis The CEO’s Guide to Data Security – Protect your data through innovation Ellie Burns 3rd May 2017 Why a 3D David Attenborough points to a Planet Earth driven by virtual customer experience Ellie Burns 20th April 2017 Exploring Antarctica with Eugene Kaspersky: From art and penguins, to the Glaciator robot Ellie Burns 18th April 2017 What Is About Us Editorial Team Advertise With Us Contact Us Help Privacy Policy RSS Feeds Site Map White Papers © 2016 COMPUTER BUSINESS REVIEW.

In the market for a virtual reality headset? You might want to wait. That seemed to be the consensus of industry insiders who gathered at the Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara, Calif., this week. The first mainstream consumer VR headsets, among them the HTC Vive and Sony PlayStation VR, just hit the market last year, and a new crop will likely be ready for shopping carts before the 2017 holiday season. But the quality of the experiences they'll offer isn't quite what many in the industry are striving for. Deficiencies persist in the hardware that powers the headsets as well as the games and other apps that are designed to run on them, experts say. One of the most egregious in terms of how it affects the health of the headset wearer is latency, or the amount of time it takes a nod of the head or other movement to be recognized by the headset's motion processors and displayed on the screen. For Achin Bhowmik, Intel's general manager of perceptual computing, the latency of the first crop of VR devices is better than that of the last, but still leaves a lot to be desired. "I think that we are on this verge of something exciting about to happen, and yet virtual reality has been there before, where it didn't live up to its promises," Bhowmik said at the Expo on Wednesday. "There's a lot of work for us to do." Intel expects the first headsets based on its Project Alloy reference design to hit the market this year. Like other companies, it is striving to get latency below 20 milliseconds, but even that isn't good enough, according to Bhowmik. "I can guarantee that [20 milisecond latency] will not be enough" to eradicate vestibular mismatch, or the feeling of losing your balance, he said. Of course, whether or not you'll get motion sickness in VR depends a lot on the app, too, and Bhowmik implored game developers not to include scenes of, say, a character flying above the Earth at jet-like speeds. But if you are interested in VR because of the potential to experience flight or something else that's impossible in real life, you'll also likely be disappointed with your current options, since programming those experiences requires a different mindset than what is needed for a conventional video game. "In the virtual world, there are no tricks, there are no shortcuts," explained Zvi Greenstein, General Manager at Nvidia's GeForce team. "All the objects must be collidable." In other words, chain-link fences must rattle when you shake them and you should not only see the movement but hear the rattle, too. That's something that you don't often find even among the most heavily-produced first person shooters today. Greenstein is hoping for a VR headset that can power extremely realistic apps. While Nvidia isn't known for software, the company has taken to writing code for things like its recently-unveiled HoloDeck as a way of demonstrating its vision. HoloDeck is a collaboration platform that allows multiple people to examine and manipulate an object—a car, for instance—in virtual reality. It's a good first step, but it's far from perfect, according to Greenstein. Related The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 The Best VR (Virtual Reality) Headsets of 2017 "We're nowhere near the limits of human perception," he said of the VR industry. Still, there is reason to be excited for the future, even if it means holding off on a planned headset purchase. The next crop of devices will be completely wireless and have better eye tracking, according to HTC Vice President Rikard Steiber. "This is the year where PC-powered VR will go wireless," he said at the Expo. Such incremental hardware improvements may seem minor, but they're worth waiting for because they could prepare the VR industry for its iPhone moment. If that happens, Steiber said, "it's not just a different computing platform, it's an evolution of how we interact with computers."

Callaghan is a 30 year veteran in the high-tech industry. His career of 21 years with Intel Corporation (INTC) included roles as an investor for Intel venture capital arm Intel Capital as well as Business Development roles in the company’s Internet of Things business.   Sensum is a software company whose technology enables businesses to understand and react to how and why people emotionally respond to brands, products, services and experiences. Using emotion AI algorithms, Sensum can show a deeper, contextually aware understanding of the emotional digital self. The Sensum emotional response platform consolidates and interprets multimodal biometric data from wearable-tech, facial coding and eye tracking. The platform also utilises contextual data from surveys, implicit tests and emoji analytics to acquire conscious and unconscious responses, providing a full 360° emotional understanding. In a discussion about Sensum’s future, Damien said  „The next paradigm shift in the development of the digital self is ‚How do I feel?’ – Sensum delivers on this.  Entrepreneurs created the digital platforms to express ‚Who am I?’ via companies such as Facebook and LinkedIn, ‚What am I doing?’ via companies such as Twitter and Instagram and ‚Where am I?’ via companies such as Foursquare and now ‚How do I feel?’ with Sensum.  The application of Artificial Intelligence to emotions to digitally express how one feels is a hugely exciting opportunity.  Sensum have developed algorithms to enable industries to monetize this opportunity.” Commenting on Callaghan’s appointment, Gawain Morrison, CEO & Co-founder of Sensum said, „We are growing fast and building our team and business capabilities to achieve the vision of becoming number one in the field of multimodal emotions AI. It is fantastic that Damien Callaghan has joined us as Chairman to help us accelerate our growth.” Sensum has worked with the likes of Unilever, Red Bull Media House, Jaguar, BBC and many more brands to help them understand the emotions and biometric responses for products, advertising and unique PR events. Their creativity and innovation has featured in New Scientist, The Telegraph, CNBC, Marketing and Impact magazine. Showcased at SXSW, Channel 4’s Fuel4 events, Channel 5’s Gadget Show, the Nordic Games Conference, Nesta, Mobile World Congress, Future Foundation, ESOMAR and AdWeek Europe.

Tech Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic Data Sheet Data Sheet—Thursday, June 1, 2017 Aaron Pressman,Adam Lashinsky Jun 01, 2017 Happy Thursday. Aaron standing in today for Adam, who is traveling to Canada. With the Computex trade show going on in Taiwan this week, we're certainly being treated to a flood of announcements from the formerly forlorn state known as the personal computer market. I got a chance to speak with Gregory Bryant ahead of the show. He's the 25-year Intel veteran who was thrust to the top of the chip giant's PC business just a few weeks ago. The head of Intel's server chip unit, Diane Bryant, had to take a lengthy leave of absence and the company tapped Navin Shenoy, who had only been running PC chips for a year, to fill in for her, creating the opening. Bryant is so bullish on PCs in 2017 you might never know that the industry sold only 260 million units last year, down 26% since 2011. He's also very bullish on Intel, telling me they are "really the only company that can power every segment of this emerging smart connected world all the way from the cloud through the network to the edge devices and kind of everything in between." The 1.5 billion smartphone buyers last year (triple the number from 2011) would probably beg to differ. Aaron Pressman @ampressman aaron.pressman@fortune.com NEWSWORTHY Taking stock. In earnings land, Wednesday was a day for reports from some of the tech companies oriented towards the corporate market. Box said revenue grew 30% to $117 million, more than Wall Street expected. Same story at security expert Palo Alto Networks, where revenue rose 25%. Not so for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which saw revenue decline 22% to $9.9 billion. Moving in the right direction. Results also came on Wednesday for a very large but not yet public company: Uber. The Wall Street Journal reported that first quarter revenue of $3.4 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and its net loss declined 29% to $708 million. Oh, and head of finance Gautam Gupta is leaving. The future of TV. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings repeated his analysis that traditional cable TV "is all going to move to the Internet-it’s all going to be on-demand." But maybe some people in cable land were finally listening. Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav said his industry needs to develop an $8 Internet TV bundle to compete with Hastings. David Marchese at New York magazine has a deeper read about how show creators are handling the changes. John Podesta needs a time machine. Google announced it would better protect Gmail users from hackers with new anti-phishing security checks. Lots of loot. Rumors have been flying about what new hardware Apple might introduce at its upcoming developer conference, WWDC. According to Mac Rumors, the haul could include new MacBook and MacBook Pro models along with a refreshed iPad Pro. MOAR data. Don't have time to review all 355 slides in Mary Meeker's annual state of the Internet report? Fortune's Leena Rao has pulled some highlights, including that global Internet advertising is finally expected to pass TV spending in the next six months and 20% of mobile searches were made using a voice query in 2016. The full report is also online at Kleiner Perkins web site. Look, up in the sky. Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank Group, had a vision to combine his OneWeb satellite Internet startup with longtime player Intelsat SA. But Intelsat's bondholders wouldn't go along. FOOD FOR THOUGHT Andy Rubin got lots of attention this week, including from Data Sheet, for his new smartphone. But Eric Limer at Popular Mechanics tried to cut through Rubin's rhetoric and analyze just how essential the Essential Phone might be. His conclusion? Not very. What is maybe more noteworthy is the ways it is like other phones out there: It's a $700 rectangular screen with a camera that (probably) runs vanilla Android. In fact, it's quite an awful lot like Google's Pixel, though prettier and without the headphone jack. The things that make it 'special' are unproven at best, meaningless at worst.

Under a three-year pact, Intel will live-stream one free out-of-market game each week (on Tuesdays) via its Intel True VR app on Samsung Gear headsets starting June 6. The broadcasts will include post-game highlights and on-demand replays for each game. Related MLB to Launch VR-Enhanced Broadcasts, but Live Games Won’t Be in 360 Video The Intel-MLB virtual-reality deal represents another experimental push into VR entertainment. For Intel, the pact will serve largely as a branding opportunity to get in front of early tech adopters. According to Intel, there’s demand for baseball in VR. The company commissioned a survey of 500 MLB fans ages 18-64, conducted by Turnkey Intelligence, which found that 71% would be interested in watching an MLB game in VR that they are unable to attend. It isn’t clear, however, whether those consumers would be willing to pay a premium for the VR experience. The “Intel True VR Game of the Week” will let viewers control their vantage point by selecting from up to four camera angles per game; alternatively, they can opt to watch a produced VR broadcast experience. In addition, the Intel VR baseball experience will provide live player and team stats throughout the games plus exclusive commentary. “As a VR partner of MLB, Intel is delivering a truly immersive virtual reality live-stream where fans can experience the excitement of being at the ballpark every week,” said James Carwana, GM of Intel Sports Group. Separately, on Thursday MLB’s At Bat app is scheduled to launch a VR mode, initially for Google’s Daydream headset and Android smartphones. The new VR option will let users access live stats and scores while watching games in HD video, and includes a 3D strike-zone cube as well as a collection of 360-degree on-demand videos. But to watch games in VR video, fans will have to turn to Intel’s VR app for the Samsung Gear. Here’s the lineup of MLB games for the Intel True VR experience in June: Cleveland Indians vs. Colorado Rockies on June 6 at 8:40 p.m. ET Kansas City Royals vs. San Francisco Giants on June 13 at 10:15 p.m. ET Detroit Tigers vs. Seattle Mariners on June 20 at 10:10 p.m. ET St. Louis Cardinals vs. Arizona Diamondbacks on June 27 at 9:40 p.m. ET Updates on the Intel True VR Game of the Week are available at intel.com/truevr.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Mobileye Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results JERUSALEM, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — First Quarter 2017 Highlights: Total revenue of $124.7 million, an increase of 66% over the same quarter last year GAAP Net Income of $33.5 million; Non-GAAP Net Income of $60.0 million – an increase of 53% and 73% over the same quarter last year, respectively GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.14; Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.25 Generated GAAP net cash from operating activities of $56.6 million; Non-GAAP free cash flow of $41.2 million (NYSE: MBLY) – Mobileye N.V., the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems („ADAS”) and autonomous driving technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. „Mobileye delivered solid first quarter results, growing both revenue and net income by over 50% on a year over year basis while generating cash at a high conversion rate,” said Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Mobileye.  „Strategically, we added revenue visibility with new ADAS design wins, bolstered alliances with existing and new partners, and took a major step forward with our proprietary high-definition mapping product (REM™) by signing definitive collaboration agreements with several major automakers.” „The pending acquisition of Mobileye by Intel will combine best-in-class technologies from both companies and accelerate delivery of a comprehensive value proposition for the automotive industry, while delivering compelling cash value to our shareholders,”  Mr. Aviram noted.    First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue:  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $124.7 million, compared to $75.2 million in the prior-year period, representing a 66% increase.  Within total revenue, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue was $94.5 million, compared to $61.4 million in the prior-year period representing a 54% increase.  EyeQ chip volume increased to 2,032 thousand EyeQ units, compared to 1,322 thousand units in the prior-year period.  EyeQ Average Selling Price (ASP) per unit for the first quarter of 2017 was $45.1, up from $44.2 during the same period last year.  The increase in OEM revenues is the result of new launches and the roll-out of Mobileye technology to more models within existing programs compared to the same quarter last year.  After market (AM) revenue contributed the remaining $30.2 million of total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $13.8 million in the prior-year period representing a 188% increase. The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus.

The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading „Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission („SEC”) Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the „Mobileye Campus”) that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon („Kisalon”) formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation („Intel”) and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the „Purchaser”) pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the „Offer”), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company’s Notice of Annual General Meeting („AGM”).  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as „believes,” „intends,” „expects,” „projects,” „anticipates,” and „future” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company’s current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search What Is Windows 10 on ARM, and How is It Different From Windows RT? By Chris Hoffman on June 1st, 2017 Microsoft is working on a version of Windows 10 that will run on ARM hardware. Unlike Windows RT, the version of Windows 8 that powered the original Surface and Surface 2, this will be a full version of Windows 10 with an emulation layer that allows it to run traditional desktop apps from outside the Windows Store. Why Is Microsoft Putting Windows 10 on ARM? RELATED ARTICLE ARM vs. Intel: What It Means for Windows, Chromebook, and Android Software Compatibility ARM PCs have some advantages over x86 ones. They have built-in LTE cellular connectivity, often offer better battery life than Intel and AMD CPUs, and the hardware is less expensive for manufacturers. Future ARM CPUs could pull even more ahead of Intel and AMD CPUs and offer much more battery life, for example. Microsoft would like Windows 10 to run on ARM hardware so it can reap those benefits. Sure, you probably won’t use an ARM desktop any time soon, but ARM could be a great choice for tablets, 2-in-1 convertibles, and even smaller laptops. Rather than creating a more limited version of Windows for this platform, Microsoft has decided to release a full version of Windows 10 for ARM hardware, one that can even run traditional Windows desktop applications. Microsoft first announced a partnership with Qualcomm to create Windows on ARM at WinHEC in December, 2016. It Can Run x86 Desktop Programs This isn’t just Windows RT all over again. Windows RT didn’t allow you to run traditional desktop software. It even blocked developers from compiling their desktop applications for ARM processors and offering them to users. Windows RT only allowed apps from the Windows 8 Store. Windows 10 on ARM is completely different. This is the full Windows desktop experience. Microsoft has created a special emulator layer that allows traditional 32-bit desktop applications to run on ARM processors, so everything should “just work”. Microsoft even showed off a version of Windows 10 Professional on ARM, and said it supports all the usual advanced features you’d find on Windows 10 Professional. The emulation works completely transparently to both users and the programs they run. It uses the same WOW (Windows on Windows) technology that Windows uses to run 32-bit applications on 64-bit versions of Windows today. However, the x86-to-ARM emulation happens entirely in software. That software emulation could be an issue, however. While Microsoft demonstrated Windows 10 on ARM running the desktop version of Photoshop and said it “runs perfectly” on the Qualcomm processor, there’s almost certain to be some slowdown in demanding desktop applications compared to running the same apps without software emulation on an Intel or AMD system. We’ll have to wait to see performance benchmarks when Windows 10 on ARM is released. Don’t get distracted by the emulator, however. This isn’t just an emulated Windows 10 operating system. The Windows kernel, hardware drivers, and all programs included with Windows are native ARM code. Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the Windows Store are also native ARM programs. The emulator is only used when running traditional x86 Windows desktop software. Much of this information comes from a video Microsoft released during BUILD 2017. Support for Older Hardware Devices May Be a Problem While Windows 10 on ARM can emulate traditional desktop applications, it won’t be able to install hardware drivers written for traditional x86 or x64 Windows operating systems. It will need ARM versions of those hardware drivers to support different hardware devices. Microsoft promises that Windows 10 on ARM “will have great device support for USB peripherals using the in-box class drivers”. That’s great for modern USB peripherals. But read between the lines: Devices that aren’t supported by the built-in drivers won’t work. Printer utilities and other hardware driver utilities may not work, either. This could be an issue for older or more obscure hardware peripherals. Windows 10 S Is the New Windows RT It doesn’t matter which type of CPU Windows is running on. You get a full Windows desktop experience with Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Professional, even if you’re using Windows 10 on ARM. RELATED ARTICLE What Is Windows 10 S, and How Is It Different? However, Microsoft did just announce Windows 10 S, a more limited edition of Windows 10 that can only run software from the Windows Store—just like Windows RT did. This has nothing to do with Windows 10 on ARM. In fact, the Windows 10 S devices Microsoft announced all run on standard Intel or AMD processors. Microsoft hasn’t mentioned Windows 10 on ARM and Windows 10 S together yet, presumably to avoid any confusion. However, even if Microsoft does ship Windows 10 S on ARM PCs, you’d be able to pay to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro and get the ability to install desktop apps, just as you can with Windows 10 S on Intel and AMD PCs. In other words, with Windows 10, ARM is just another hardware platform that’s treated the same—it just needs an emulation layer to make that possible. Windows 10 S is a limited version of Windows that can run on any hardware platform. When Will It Be Released? Microsoft said devices will be released “later this year” in 2017. Qualcomm also told investors that the first Windows on on ARM laptop would be released sometime in the fourth quarter of 2017. It will pair Windows 10 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (17 REPLIES) Got Feedback?

JERUSALEM, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- First Quarter 2017 Highlights: Total revenue of $124.7 million, an increase of 66% over the same quarter last year GAAP Net Income of $33.5 million; Non-GAAP Net Income of $60.0 million - an increase of 53% and 73% over the same quarter last year, respectively GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.14; Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of $0.25 Generated GAAP net cash from operating activities of $56.6 million; Non-GAAP free cash flow of $41.2 million (NYSE: MBLY) – Mobileye N.V., the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ("ADAS") and autonomous driving technologies, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. "Mobileye delivered solid first quarter results, growing both revenue and net income by over 50% on a year over year basis while generating cash at a high conversion rate," said Ziv Aviram, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Mobileye.  "Strategically, we added revenue visibility with new ADAS design wins, bolstered alliances with existing and new partners, and took a major step forward with our proprietary high-definition mapping product (REM™) by signing definitive collaboration agreements with several major automakers." "The pending acquisition of Mobileye by Intel will combine best-in-class technologies from both companies and accelerate delivery of a comprehensive value proposition for the automotive industry, while delivering compelling cash value to our shareholders,"  Mr. Aviram noted.    First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue:  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $124.7 million, compared to $75.2 million in the prior-year period, representing a 66% increase.  Within total revenue, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) revenue was $94.5 million, compared to $61.4 million in the prior-year period representing a 54% increase.  EyeQ chip volume increased to 2,032 thousand EyeQ units, compared to 1,322 thousand units in the prior-year period.  EyeQ Average Selling Price (ASP) per unit for the first quarter of 2017 was $45.1, up from $44.2 during the same period last year.  The increase in OEM revenues is the result of new launches and the roll-out of Mobileye technology to more models within existing programs compared to the same quarter last year.  After market (AM) revenue contributed the remaining $30.2 million of total revenue for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $13.8 million in the prior-year period representing a 188% increase. The increase in Aftermarket revenues is primarily the year-over-year effect of sequential revenue increases we experienced over the course of 2016.   Net Income and Earnings per Share: GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $33.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares to GAAP net income of $21.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share for the prior-year period. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 26.9% of revenue compared to 29.1% for the prior-year period. GAAP results include share-based compensation expense, net of tax, of $19.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $12.8 million for the prior-year period. In addition, GAAP net income during the first quarter of 2017 included $6.5 million in expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction. The decline in profit margin is mainly the result of the incurrence of Intel transaction related expenses. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $60.0 million, or $0.25 per share based on 238.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding.  This compares to non-GAAP net income of $34.7 million, or $0.15 per share based on 236.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding during the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 represents 48.1% of revenue, an increase in profitability compared to 46.2% for the prior-year period, which is the result of better gross margins and lower operating expenses as percentage of revenues.  Non-GAAP net income excludes share-based compensation expense, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017, and the applicable income tax effect.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. Cash and Cash Flow: As of March 31, 2017, Mobileye had cash and cash equivalents, restricted bank deposits, and marketable securities of $677.2 million, compared to $633.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Mobileye generated $56.6 million in net cash from operating activities for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $32.5 million for the prior-year period.  Mobileye generated $41.2 million in non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $30.4 million for the prior-year period.  Free cash flow generation during this quarter reflects the payment of the $12.9 million purchase price of the land for our new headquarters, as well as $6.1 million of transaction related expenses incurred in connection with the Intel transaction.  Non-GAAP free cash flow represents GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  See the reconciliation information below for a more detailed discussion of this non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures has been provided in the financial tables included in this press release.  An explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures and how they are calculated is included below under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."  Mobileye has updated its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income taking into account the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") Staff guidance and added to the reconciliation the applicable tax effect on share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. Acquisition of Land In March 2017, Mobileye closed its purchase of land in Jerusalem, which we intend to use for the construction of a new R&D and innovation center (the "Mobileye Campus") that also will host our headquarters.  As a result of this transaction, Mobileye now owns 74% of the equity of a company called Azorei Kisalon ("Kisalon") formed to own the land.  This equity interest, together with a long-term lease agreement, and an agreement with the minority shareholders of Kisalon will enable us to build the Mobileye Campus.  Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, we intend to begin construction, and intend to invest approximately $195 million in the development of the Mobileye Campus. Suspension of Conference Calls and Guidance As announced on  March 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with Intel Corporation ("Intel") and Cyclops Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel (the "Purchaser") pursuant to which the Purchaser will offer to purchase all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of the Company, par value EUR 0.01 per share, for cash consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) of $63.54 per ordinary share (the "Offer"), as further detailed in the Tender Offer Statement and amendments filed by Intel with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schedule 14D-9 filed by the Company and the Company's Notice of Annual General Meeting ("AGM").  The Company will hold the AGM on June 13, 2017. In light of the pending transaction, the Company will not host an earnings conference call and will not provide guidance relating to its expected financial results for future periods.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains certain forward-looking statements.  Words such as "believes," "intends," "expects," "projects," "anticipates," and "future" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These statements are only predictions based on the Company's current expectations and projections about future events.  You should not place undue reliance on these statements.  Many factors may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement, including the risk factors and other matters set forth in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, we provide financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our financial results and believe they are useful to investors as a supplement to GAAP measures.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures also provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating our ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with those of other companies in our industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or considered as an alternative to, operating income, net income, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Our non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.  A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release. Non-GAAP net income. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income, we exclude share-based compensation, expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction during the first quarter of 2017 and the applicable income tax effect from our GAAP net income.  We believe that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and share-based compensation and the applicable income tax effect is appropriate because the uniqueness of the expenses associated with the pending Intel transaction and treatment of share-based compensation expense item may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance. These items are mostly non-deductible expense.; We use this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with our GAAP financial measure for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; and We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides better comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates better period-to-period comparisons of operating results and may facilitate comparisons with similar companies, many of which may also use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP reporting. Non-GAAP free cash flow.  We define non-GAAP free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.  Non-GAAP free cash flow is important to reflect the cash that can allow us to pursue business strategies and opportunities and fulfill our goals.  A limitation of using non-GAAP free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities as a means of evaluating our company is that non-GAAP free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period because it excludes cash used for capital expenditures during the period.  Management compensates for this limitation by providing information about our capital expenditures on the face of the cash flow statement.

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Batsmen Will Use Smart Bats During Current Champions Trophy Aadil Shadman 3 days ago Cricket is all about technique and for viewers, it’s all about real-time information and statistics. To add more excitement to the game of cricket, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has partnered with popular chip maker, Intel. Together, they plan to introduce smart bats during the upcoming Champions Trophy 2017 in England. These smart bats will actually use chips, dubbed BatSense, that allow them to sense the bat swings. Batsensing Bats Three players from all international teams will have a Bat Sensor installed on top of their bats. The chip will generate data on each swing of the bat. In a statement, ICC said “The new bat sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays.” The statement adds, “With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed, and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich story-telling in broadcast.” Impact of BatSense The sensors are developed by Intel and sports startup Specular. Useful insights like the back-lift angle, bat speed, impact momentum and follow-through will be measured using the sensors. These figures will be transmitted back to coaches for immediate analysis while broadcasters will be able to use the info to bring exciting content to the viewers. Following Hawk-Eye, which changed the whole cricketing scenario thanks to the use of high speed cameras and ball tracking technology, the new sensors can revolutionize the batting aspect of cricket. Studio pundits will be able to explain a player’s performance or weaknesses and how certain players can improve their gameplay or technique. Coaches and players will benefit the most and will be able to fine-tune training sessions. Players Who Will Use BatSense While it is almost confirmed that three players from each team will have BatSense-installed bats, the names of these players are yet to be announced. For now, we know of Indian and English players who will have the chips on their bats. England: Ben Stokes, Alex Hales, Jason Roy India: Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin More in Tow ICC plans to modernize the game by bringing upcoming technologies to the cricketing field. While similar bat-sensing tech has already been used in baseball bats, tennis racquets and golf clubs, it’s a first for cricket. Now, ICC is ready to incorporate VR and pitch reading drones. Everything is explained in the video below: What About Us? Specular has revealed that a consumer version of BatSense will be released later this year. People will no longer need expensive trainers or months of trial and error to improve their skills. If anyone wants to bat like AB de Villiers or Chris Gayle, they will be able to use VR technology and the bat sensors along with a digital trainers. Cricket fans, expect great times ahead with new ways of improving your game.

Vinod Yalburgi   June 1, 2017 15:56 IST ICC to bring advanced technology for analysing pitch and player's bat-swing stats at ICC Champions Trophy 2017Intel Newsroom The use of technology in sports has become a norm these days as tech gadgets have often proved invaluable in analysing a player's strengths and weaknesses. International Cricket Council has now revealed that it has been working with American tech giant Intel to bring pitch analysis tech, bat sensor and new virtual reality (VR) experience to the audience at the Champions Trophy 2017. The Champions Trophy kicked off on Thursday, June 1, with England taking on Bangladesh at The Oval, London, and avid cricket fans can get the best cricketing experience with the advent of new technology into the game. According to ICC, we will be seeing a new drone technology for handling advanced pitch analysis and a new VR experience for fans at the stadium. Team data analysts and coaches could now get busy with the new bat sensor technology from Intel, which enables accurate analysis of bat speed, the batsman's back-lift angle, and time to impact with the bat after the ball is released by the bowler. The new bat sensor is powered by Intel's Curie technology and can be attached to any cricket bat to collect stats on the player's bat-swing. Thereby players and coaches can monitor the batsman's strokes and help him correct his bat swing for improving his overall game. Here are a few excerpts from Intel's official post: With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen will use these bat sensors in the games at the 2017 Champions Trophy, enabling new insights on stroke play and rich storytelling during broadcasts. Virtual reality (VR) experience zones at The Oval and Edgbaston will allow fans to experience facing a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment. Using a head mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skills against a virtual bowler. Avid cricket fans can now entertain themselves in an immersive world of virtual reality at select matches, wherein they will be allowed to test their batting skills while facing deliveries from a virtual bowler, using a head-mounted display (HMD). Apart from England and Bangladesh, six more nations including India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka and England will take part in the ICC Championship Trophy 2017.

Elmor, a processor performance enthusiast overclocked Intel Core i9-7900X. This deca-processor has a base clocking of 3.3 GHz. It clocks to a staggering 4.3 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 and to 4.5 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. However, Elmor overclocked i9-7900x to an unbelievable 5.7 GHz using Liquid Nitrogen cooling setup. This high end desktop platform scored 3181 points setting up a Cinebench world record. Also Read: How Intel's Compute Card Can Shape Up the IoT Market in The Year 2017 The feat was achieved on the following setup, ASUS Rampage V1 Apex X299 motherboard with G.Skill DDR4 memory and an ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Strix Gaming graphics card. Elmor had previously overclocked the AMD Ryzen 7 1800X at 5.8 GHz which scored 2454 on Cinebench. The competition will certainly heat up once Intel starts shipping its latest line of processors later this year. AMD's more than successful Ryzen series is about to face a tough competition from its arch rival. The 10 core, 20 threaded i9-7900X has been priced at $999 (approx Rs.) which is half the price consumers will pay for i9-7980XE. There are also series of 16, 14 and 12 core processors from Intel ready to be shipped. Everything said and done, the overclocking tests are interesting to watch however the practical implication of the Liquid Nitrogen cooled setup is still a possibility awaiting exploration.

Tech Search Search aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps CybersecurityBritain PM Theresa May Calls to ‘Regulate Cyberspace’ And Critics Are Going Ballistic Intel Intel’s New Head of PC Chips Faces Revived Competition Aaron Pressman Jun 01, 2017 Gregory Bryant, Intel's new head of desktop and laptop processors, picked a good time to take over the volatile and long-challenged business unit. Personal computer shipments industrywide showed small signs of growth in the first quarter—rising 0.6% according to market tracker International Data Corp. But no matter the size of the uptick, it was the first growth in five years. Intel's own PC chip unit saw revenue shoot up 6%, as sales of higher-priced CPUs aimed at gamers and content creators more than made up for slipping sales at the low end. And after years of delays and disappointments, Intel's CPU roadmap for 2017 and 2018 looks strong and on schedule. "I can say that we're kind of in a little bit of a renaissance," Bryant tells Fortune in his first interview since taking the new post a few weeks ago, formally the head of Intel's $33 billion client computing group, or CCG. Bryant reports to group president Murthy Renduchintala, the former Qualcomm (qcom) executive brought in at the end of 2015 to stabilize Intel's PC and mobile businesses. Promoted from running strategy and product development for the connected home products unit at Intel (intc), Bryant points to the rash of new applications requiring higher performance computing, from virtual reality to e-sports video gaming, that have lately been driving sales higher and enticing new manufacturers, like Chinese phone giants Xiaomi and Huawei, to make PCs for the first time. "There's just a lot of kinds of new innovation that's happening in the industry and then we're even seeing some new entrants," the 25-year Intel veteran says. "It's a good indication of some of the return to innovation and health in the business." Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. Intel offered a host of its own innovations at the Computex trade show in Taiwan this week. Bryant unveiled the chip giant's newest line of CPUs, dubbed the Core X series, led by a monster chip called the Core i9 Extreme Edition, which will have 18 cores and cost about $2,000. The high-end processor, suited for 4K video editing or rendering complex virtual reality game environments, can hit a performance benchmark once reserved for supercomputers: the teraflop, or one million million floating point operations per second. "It's hard to get your head around if you’ve been in the industry for a long time like I have," Bryant says. "But just imagining that in terms of raw compute that we essentially have a teraflop CPU in a desktop PC form factor is kind of amazing." Intel famously built the first supercomputer capable of a teraflop. Known as ASCI Red, the behemoth was made for the U.S. government to simulate the decline of weapons in the country's nuclear arsenal after the end of live explosive tests. Put into operation almost exactly 20 years ago, ASCI Red was the fastest supercomputer in the world for three years running and wasn't retired until 2006. If it's humility that you're expecting, Bryant isn't offering any. Intel completely missed the smartphone revolution and has zero market share in phone processors, which have been dominated by chips based on ARM Holdings designs and made by Apple (aapl), Samsung and Qualcomm. In corporate and cloud data centers, Intel is doing well but has no graphics chip-based products, a rapidly growing niche dominated by rival Nvidia (nvda). But there don't seem to be any holes in Intel's product line according to Bryant. "We really believe we're a leading company and really the only company that can power every segment of this emerging smart connected world all the way from the cloud through the network to the edge devices and kind of everything in between," he says. Despite the confidence and the improving market conditions, Bryant and Intel face a renewed competitive threat in 2017 from Advanced Micro Devices (amd), the only other chipmaker compatible with Intel's own x86 architecture. AMD's new Ryzen line includes CPUs that can match the performance of much more expensive Intel chips. And AMD announced its own monster chip, perhaps anticipating the Core i9 announcement, dubbed the Ryzen Threadripper and including 16 cores. At the Computex show, AMD disclosed that the Threadripper chip will have considerably more bandwidth to connect to graphics cards, disk storage and other peripherals than any of Intel's newest chips. It likely will be months before reviewers and analysts can benchmark real world systems pitting the two monster chips against each other, however. Towards the end of the year, Intel will counter again, introducing systems with its 8th generation CPU design. Bryant wouldn't say much, except to note that the new chips are performing much better than Intel initially expected. The chipmaker had said it was expecting a 15% gain from the new line compared to the current 7th generation Kaby Lake line. But Bryant now says that the gain looks to be about 30%. That will come in handy as AMD pushes its Ryzen architecture further and faster over the next few years as well. "We really recognized the opportunity in the enthusiast space and we really stepped on the gas, we really stepped on the accelerator in this space, a while back," Bryant says. "And I think you're seeing that play through now." Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 review: It seems like $1,500 should get you more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/29 9:57am PDTMay 29, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 14 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares73 Android Wear Reviews Wearable Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 3.1 Design and hardware 3.2 Display 3.3 Performance and battery 3.4 Software 3.5 Conclusion: No Smartwatches haven't exactly taken off. In fact, a number of electronics companies have pulled back on plans for Android Wear including Motorola, Sony, and Asus. That's left fewer smartphone makers in the fray, but there are also fashion designers and traditional watch designers dabbling in Wear. We will see a lot more of these smartwatches in 2017, and one of them is the extremely spendy Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This is the second Android Wear device from Tag Heuer, and like the first one, it's being produced in partnership with Intel. It has a lot in common with the company's other watches, for example the high price tag. The Connected Modular 45 starts at $1,500 and can reach around $5,000 if you really go all out. However, it's not better at any of the typical smartwatch things than other devices—actually, it's worse at some of them. It's a real head-scratcher. Specs Processor Intel Atom Z34XX, dual-core up to 1GHz RAM 512MB Storage 4GB Display 1.39-inch round AMOLED at 400 x 400 Battery 410mAh Measurements 45mm case, 13.75mm thick, 116g with strap Connectivity Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, NFC Sensors Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Ambient Light Sensor Software Android Wear 2.0 The Good Design The titanium case and sapphire screen are durable materials. Customization There are tons of combinations with different cases, lugs, and straps. NFC Supports Android Pay, which is very much appreciated when some other watches have omitted it. Strap The deployant clasp is sturdy and very convenient. Software Comes with the latest version of Android Wear. My brand It's got the Tag Heuer brand stamped on it, if you care about such things. The Not So Good Design again It's a very blocky watch, which a lot of people won't like. Price The $1,500 starting price is a bit crazy considering the features. Performance Despite having an SoC that should be snappy, the watch is sluggish. Watches that cost a fraction as much are noticeably faster. Missing hardware No heart rate sensor or speaker? Not what I'd expect for a $1,500 watch. Display It's mediocre with middling brightness and a dingy image quality. Size This watch is huge. It's too large for someone with small wrists to wear—the band doesn't even get small enough me. Strap again All the lugs and straps are proprietary, so you have to buy them from Tag Heuer. They too are very expensive. Design and hardware The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is a colossal watch. The "45" indicates the 45mm width of the body, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The lugs and the frame of the watch extend far away from the face—those black trapezoid shapes (Tag calls this a "wing") at the top and bottom of the face better illustrate how large the watch is. If you have small wrists like me, this watch looks unnaturally big. Most watches are made of plastic and (if you're lucky) aluminum. The case of the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is milled from a solid block of titanium. The lugs and the clasp are also titanium, but the anodized bezel is aluminum. The watch is nearly indestructible, but it's heavy because of the titanium chassis. It's 116g with the strap, but a Zenwatch 3 is only 60g. Looking at it another way, the watch is only slightly lighter than the LG X Style, a 5-inch smartphone that came out last year (121g). The crown button is dead center on the right edge. It has just the right firmness with a tactile click when pressed. However, this is only a button. There's no rotating action to scroll through items in Wear 2.0. The base model watch comes with a thick rubber strap, which is fine. I wouldn't call it visually impressive, though. For $1,500 I would expect a nice leather or metal band of some sort. The band and lugs disconnect with a button on the underside, which is the "modular" part of the Connected Modular 45. You can swap lugs and bands, but this is a completely custom design. You have to buy all these accessories from Tag Heuer, and they too are extremely expensive. I'm a big fan of Tag Heuer's latch mechanism, which Asus copied on the original Zenwatch. It's a deployant clasp that's super-easy to put on and take off. After you size it, simply fold the mechanism closed and it latches. Then, press the buttons on either side to release the latch. It allows for a very clean look as the excess band is tucked inside against your wrist. In the case of the stock rubber band, the latch is a bit annoying for me. The band tapers, which limits how much you can adjust the size. Even when it's as small as I can make it, the Connected Modular 45 is slightly too loose. The aesthetics are, of course, highly subjective. That said, my opinion of the Connected Modular 45's design is not positive. I don't think I'd call it an ugly watch, but it's aggressively masculine with all the sharp angles and blocky frame. It just looks overwrought to me. I showed the watch to a number of people, most of whom were unimpressed by the design; a few said it was downright ugly, too. I did hear one thing a lot, though. No one could believe this watch costs $1,500. Inside, the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 has an Intel Atom Z34XX SoC, GPS, NFC, and the usual raft of orientation sensors. Having NFC for Android Pay is cool, but you have to do some wrist contortions to place the face of the watch on the payment terminal. The setup process is a bit of a pain, too. You need to authorize your card all over again like you were using a new phone. It is frankly baffling to me that this $1,500 smartwatch doesn't have a heart rate sensor. I mean, surely such a high price tag should get you a sensor that's found in cheap fitness bands, right? Apparently not. There is a microphone cutout on the side of the watch, but there's also no speaker. Again, this is a really expensive smartwatch, and it lacks features that you get in watches that cost a fraction as much. Display This is a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 400x400. It's completely round, which is thankfully more common these days. There is an ambient light sensor under the screen, so you don't have to set the brightness manually. It doesn't get particularly bright, though. Using the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 outside is a bit of a chore, which isn't helped by the fact that the display is weirdly "deep" under the glass. Most devices go for the gapless look, but Tag Heuer wanted the screen to be at the same depth as the face on its mechanical watches. I don't think it worked very well in practice. The Watch Style and Connected Modular 45 Since this is an AMOLED, the blacks are truly black. The colors seem weirdly muted for an AMOLED, and the white balance is way too warm. The panel also has a fuzzy quality that's especially visible on gray background. That's something Wear 2.0 has in spades. I don't know the providence of this screen, but it looks a lot like LG's P-OLED technology from several years ago—it's dingy and I don't like it. There's also noticeable ghosting on the Modular 45's screen compared to any other modern watch. Perhaps one upshot here is that you probably won't scratch the display. It's covered with a sheet of sapphire glass, which is much harder than the Gorilla Glass used on other devices. Performance and battery The dual-core Intel Atom chip in this watch should be more than fast enough to power Android Wear, at least on paper. In practice, this watch is insultingly slow. It doesn't outright lag most of the time, but it's not responsive. The watch is always rushing to catch up with my finger as I scroll and swipe. Again, I feel it necessary to bring up the price. If I spend $1,500 on a smartwatch, it had better be blazing fast, and the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is not. I suspect the SoC is tuned very conservatively. After all, this chip came out several years ago and is based on an inefficient 22nm process. Launching apps—which is a thing we have to do on smartwatches now, like it or not—is also quite sluggish on the Tag Heuer watch. This is never particularly fast on watches, but the Connected Modular 45 is at least a second or two slower compared to the Watch Style. And by the way, you could buy six Watch Styles for the price of one Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has a respectable 410mAh battery inside. It gets pretty standard battery life for a Wear device: around 18-20 hours. I have not had to worry about charging the Connected Modular 45 while I'm still out and about, except for the first day when it drained oddly fast in just a few hours. That seems to have been an outlier, though. You'll still be charging this watch every night, but it'll make it through one day comfortably. When you do have to plug the watch in, the charger is actually quite good. It's a pogo pin situation, as are many smartwatches. However, the charging puck attaches with strong magnets that ensure it's aligned the right way. Software The Connected Modular 45 ships with Android Wear 2.0, and I suppose that's a good thing. Devices shipping with current software is nice in theory, but I still can't get over some of the decisions Google made in Wear 2.0. To be clear, these are not specific complaints to the Connected Modular 45, but you should know what you're getting into when you pick up this $1,500 watch. The way notifications are handled in Wear 2.0 continues to baffle me. Basically, any app that uses the standard notification bundling API gets its notifications split up on the watch. You see this most often with Gmail, which gives each email its own screen. That means a lot of scrolling to get through everything. This is made more annoying by the lack of a digital crown on the Connected Modular 45. Disconnecting the watch's do not disturb from the phone's is also a negative, in my opinion. Previous Next All the watch face improvements in Wear 2.0 are great, but Tag Heuer didn't take advantage of them. The stock watch faces, which you can see in the gallery above, look nice enough with the standard Tag Heuer aesthetic. There's almost no interactivity, though. Only one of them supports complications, a few others have built-in chronographs, and the others let you choose between several dial colors. Actually, the fully editable "Tag Heuer Studio" face is done quite well, and the resulting watch faces do look very different. Still, there are plenty of third-party watch faces that are just as pretty and include many more features. But hey, these are official Tag Heuer TM watch faces. Some people care about that sort of thing.   There is a Tag Heuer app for your phone, which I was hoping would offer some unique features to help justify that high price tag. Nope—the Connected app lets you create customized watch faces in the Tag Heuer Studio, but the settings are the same that are available on the watch itself. Conclusion: No I think the kindest thing I can say about the Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 is that the build quality is very good. It's a big chunk of titanium, so yes, it's solid. Tag Heuer knows how to make watches, so everything fits together well. Despite the fact that the lugs can be swapped out, the Connected Modular 45 feels like a single unit. I'm not really a fan of the overall design, and it's a very, very large watch. I have small wrists, and it looks comically big on me. The stock rubber strap is very nice as far as such bands go, but this is a $1,500 watch. It seems like a nice leather band should come with it, but you have spend at least a few hundred more for those. Yes, you need to buy bands for this modular watch from Tag Heuer. The connection to the modular lugs is not standard, and additional rubber straps are $115. The leather ones will set you back $275, which is enough to buy a cheaper smartwatch. The metal and ceramic bands are priced between $700 and $1,000. If these prices are at all surprising, let me just remind you this watch only starts at $1,500. While Tag Heuer clearly paid attention to the watch aspects of the watch, it dropped the ball when it comes to much of the technology. The Connected Modular 45 has NFC, which is nice to see. However, there's no digital crown for scrolling, the screen is mediocre at best, and there's no heart rate sensor or speaker. The biggest issue for me is the sluggish performance, which is omnipresent and hugely annoying. The software simply is not well optimized for the Intel Atom chip in this watch. It definitely needs more work, but I don't know if anyone is going to do it. You can't buy a smartwatch without considering the state of Android Wear. Notifications, do not disturb, and app management are all in need of work. It's hard to justify spending a few hundred on an Android Wear device right now, let alone $1,500. That's what it comes down to: the price. Before you get worked up about all the little issues with this watch, you have to confront the high price tag. The Tag Heuer Connected Modular 45 does many of the same things as other smartwatches, but it has a titanium case with the Tag Heuer logo. You could make the argument that an expensive mechanical watch at least partially justifies the price because the internal mechanisms are of higher quality. However, the Connected Modular 45 is still just a regular smartwatch inside. It has a supposedly more powerful SoC, but one that isn't doing it any favors. It's unlikely many AP readers were considering purchasing this watch, but this is something to keep in mind as more fashion companies and watch makers get into Android Wear. It's still just a smartwatch—stamping a big name on the outside doesn't mean it'll be better than a $250 smartwatch. In fact, it might be worse.

Does your apology mean that you are going to stop doing that? T4rd "It seems like $1500 should get you more." Pretty much my thoughts on any jewelry that expensive or more. But yeah, even the best smart watches seem to be more of an annoyance than an aid so far. The last thing I want is another device to charge every night, or even every other night. tiger Like first gen, this Tag is pure crap. Lazy design. Feature anemic. Compare this to an Apple Watch Series 2 Hermes and you can see how this Tag is a POS. b_freeman I personally like the style of the new Tag, but I prefer classic chronograph and diver style watches. I agree it is over priced and feature anemic. I believe the Apple Watch is one of the ugliest smartwatches out there. tiger Yeah ok. Lol b_freeman Thats why smartwatches are having problems. Everyone has different opinions about what looks good on their wrist, and no smartwatch as yet to deliver on must have features; so it all comes down to aesthetics's and specs. I personally don't care what specs/features the Apple Watch has I thinks it's ugly and won't wear one and I'm enough of a tech guy that I don't care how nice I think the Tag watch looks if its specs/features aren't in the right place. tiger Apple Watch is selling just fine.... Fitness and health are the next frontier and are what will make Apple Watches a must have. Android Wear cannot even deliver on heart rate on most of its models! b_freeman I never said it wasn't selling fine. I just said I think its ugly. EarlyMon While I agree with the utility of a heart rate monitor (my Huatch has one) I don't think the fact that Android Wear has a wider selection of devices with different features, including many without HRM, is somehow cause for slagging Android Wear per se, much less with an exclamation point. Marty I guess rich people need something to spend their money on. 🙄 JD It's titanium and sapphire. Regular tech geeks need not apply. This is for lovers of Ti.... And for Some reason Android Wear. <- this is usually mutually exclusive. b_freeman Although I like the overall design, I believe anyone who buys this watch has more money then sense. They would be much better served to buy a real watch. EarlyMon You do realize that is exactly what has been said about every smart watch to date yeah? :D JD When you got FYM you don't need sense EarlyMon When you got FYM, sense has nothing to do with it. It's not FY except when I respect your sense M, it's just FYM. Anthony Russo I'll keep my $300 Watch. This watch doesn't do anything different than mine.. Amarus Kh I'm glad that you guys chose someone capable of handling the review objectively to write the article about this Tag Heuer watch, not like the one when the article and the writer's comment were basically "lol, people who care about expensive watches are idiots". Ahmad Zaim Hilmi As with any Swiss watch, which is merely overpriced mechanical watch coupled with some fancy ads, Tag expect to pull the same trick with a smartwatch and hope people would go for it. Well, they are sorely mistaken. Def Ref I paid $1400 for my 65" 4K HDR TV and $17 for my Timex Marathon digital watch. My priorities are in order. Anyone who would buy this needs to be donating more to charity, starting with $1500. EarlyMon So if someone without a TV because they can't stand it buys this watch do they owe a charity $17? I'm not sure if you thought through your whole priorities thing before offering that advice. :D Rob "It seems like $1,500 should get you more" ...it seems that if you're dumb enough to spend $1500 on a watch, you're getting exactly what you deserve. icwhatudidthere Lol so I just got back from Monaco and the Tag Heuer store there said they had trouble keeping them in stock because they constantly sell out. It's one of their highest volume products. It's jewelry that happens to run Android Wear. Also note the sluggishness might have been due to a software bug. A subsequent software update fixed that. Mine is no longer sluggish.

Intel just took the wraps off its long-awaited Core X-Series processors and accompanying X299 chipset, which bring enough horsepower and bandwidth for everything from professional content creation to hardcore gaming. Intel's new X299 platform and accompanying Core X-Series processors raise the bar for CPU and memory performance with up to 18 cores and 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 memory. And they add bandwidth for multiple graphics cards and NVMe SSDs with up to 44 PCIe lanes through the CPU and even more from the chipset. It's an incredibly potent platform we've used to create the Prime, TUF, and ROG X299 families.     Based on Intel's X299 chipset, the ROG, Prime and TUF series feature state-of-the-art connectivity and control options designed for gamers, power users and prosumers   ROG has three models expertly tailored for different priorities: the Rampage VI Extreme lives up to its name for drool-worthy dream machines with custom liquid cooling and ultra-fast networking, the Rampage VI Apex unabashedly targets peak game performance and record-breaking overclocking, and the Strix X299-E provides gamers the powerful tuning, cooling, and personalization options they need to get the most from their rigs. ROG does more than just offer checkbox features-we take the time to ensure each one is empowering for enthusiasts and accessible for beginners.   The Prime and TUF models are designed for differing audiences: new Prime X299-Deluxe is for high-end builders who want it all, the Prime X299-A eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics, the TUF X299 Mark 1 stands out from its competitors with protective armor and advanced cooling options, while the TUF X299 Mark 2 strips down to the essentials for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula. The new ASUS Prime and TUF X299s series are a breath of fresh air at a time when far too many motherboards offer more of the same.   Shared innovations define the ROG X299 family All three boards share the same DNA - essential features that enthusiasts in the Republic of Gamers demand. That starts with critically acclaimed overclocking and cooling controls for liquid and air. There are dedicated pump headers for powering custom loops and all-in-one coolers, plus intelligent fan controls for optimal efficiency and quiet acoustics. Sensor grouping lets your cooling react to a mix of workloads, including GPU-heavy gaming via direct temperature monitoring for select graphics cards. Tuning your gaming PC is easy whether you want to perfect your setup with manual tweaking or automatically configure and overclock the whole thing with a single click using our 5-Way Optimization utility.   Gaming PCs provide unprecedented options to express your style, including through personalized lighting. The RGB LEDs embedded on our boards are augmented by headers for multiple RGB LED strips to illuminate your entire chassis. All of the lighting is part of our Aura Sync ecosystem, which synchronizes harmoniously across compatible ROG graphics cards, peripherals, and monitors, along with other components from our partners.   Equipped with the latest generation of SupremeFX integrated audio, ROG's new X299 motherboards boast enhanced recording quality for streamers who want their voice to come through clearly. Graphics cards plug into reinforced SafeSlots that protect against damage from heavy GPU coolers and rough handling.   Intel's VROC technology combines with our optional add-in card to enable insane M.2 RAID arrays made up of a stack of parallel drives with a direct line to the CPU. You can hit ludicrous speeds with enough capacity for overflowing game libraries. You get all the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports and internal headers pushing speeds up to 10Gbps. Onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking are standard equipment, and you can add Intel's new Optane memory as a high-speed cache.   Imagine your dream machine with the Rampage VI Extreme The flagship of this new family is the Rampage VI Extreme, which balances power and design to elevate showcase PCs. It's made specifically for machines with custom liquid cooling. Along with all of the usual fan and pump headers, we added dual flow headers that let you monitor the coolant coursing through your loop. There's also a special connector that lets water blocks designed for the Extreme provide flow, temperature, and leakage data.   Almost every aspect of the Rampage VI Extreme has been enhanced to give you more. The Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller is bolstered by an onboard 10Gbps chip capable of increasing networking throughput by an order of magnitude. We've also upgraded the Wi-Fi to the latest 802.11ad standard, increasing wireless bandwidth up to 4.6Gbps.   To help avoid unsightly wiring, three M.2 SSDs can be added to the board without using the VROC card. One slots under the Extreme's outer skin, while the other two ride our DIMM.2 module next to the memory slots. The onboard Thunderbolt header lets you extend high-speed connectivity to external devices with our optional add-in card.   New for X299, the Rampage VI Extreme integrates a LiveDash OLED screen that lets you monitor system temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds right on the board. The dashboard also displays custom messages and graphics to add a little extra flair to your build. It's complemented by enough onboard LEDs and strip headers to put on a show.   Set performance records and game with the Rampage VI Apex ROG's commitment to pursuing the highest overclocks and top performance manifests in the Rampage VI Apex. This model is purpose-built for setting records at sub-zero temperatures - not just with LN2, but also with exotic liquid helium. Our overclocking experts have already used the Apex to take 8 world records and 20 global records with the Core X-processor reaching 7.560GHz, and we're just getting started. Expect more records to fall as we cement ROG's legacy as the absolute performance leader.   Less is more on the ragged edge. The Apex has only one DIMM slot per channel, which allows optimized trace routing that can improve stability with the fastest memory kits. You can load the board with 64GB of DDR4 memory running at blistering speeds and extremely low latencies. Memory is flanked by dual DIMM.2 slots that take up to four M.2 SSDs between them.   The Rampage VI Apex proudly wears its attitude on its sleeve - or rather PCB. The distinctive shape visually sets the Apex apart from the competition, while the customizable name plate provides space to add a personal touch. You also get the latest I/O, including USB 3.1 Gen 2 with Type-C ports, onboard Wi-Fi and Intel Gigabit networking plus SupremeFX audio technology for those times when you want to game instead of setting records.   Game in style with the Strix X299-E Where the Rampage VI Extreme and Apex are highly specialized, the ROG Strix X299-E takes a more straightforward approach. It represents an affordable entry point into the Republic of Gamers without sacrificing the looks and features that define the number one gaming brand.   Like its Rampage siblings, the Strix wears a monochrome motif that won't clash with other components or your lighting choices. Featuring standard ATX dimensions, the Strix still comes with all of the slots, ports, and headers you expect from ROG. This includes dual M.2 slots for NVMe SSDs, Intel Gigabit networking, onboard Wi-FI, USB 3.1 Gen 2, SupremeFX audio technology with Sonic Studio III and class leading RGB options featuring Aura Sync.   Ready for liquid cooling and RGB lighting, the Strix X299-E has headers for dual pumps and both standard and addressable LED strips. We also include a couple of extension cables that make it much easier to get the look you want.   Prime time for X299   Built for power users and prosumers, the Prime series represents the culmination of decades of experience refining all aspects of motherboard technology. These boards mate state-of-the-art connectivity with accessible tuning options to provide a premium experience everyone can enjoy.   All of our X299 motherboards have extensive overclocking and cooling options available in both the UEFI and software. The Primes go one step further with 5-Way Optimization, which intelligently overclocks your system and tunes the cooling based on the individual characteristics of your components. Beginners can effortlessly optimize their entire PC with a single click, while experienced users can adjust tuning parameters to meet their needs.   Refinement extends to the styling, whose predominantly black-and-white theme lays the perfect foundation for understated builds-or much flashier ones with RGB lighting. Our Prime X299 boards feature multiple headers for LED strips that can light up your entire chassis. They're part of a rich ecosystem of Aura Sync products that can synchronize colors and effects across a complete system.   Intel's new Core X-Series processors demand serious cooling, which is why all of our new X299 motherboards have dedicated headers for all-in-one liquid coolers and stand-alone pumps. Our Prime X299 series also support up to three-way graphics configurations, and their x16 slots incorporate structural reinforcements with our SafeSlot technology to prevent damage and protect your investment.   PCIe lanes left unused by graphics can be devoted to storage with VROC, which combines multiple M.2 SSDs in a bootable RAID array connected directly to the CPU. An insane number of drives can run in parallel across multiple VROC cards to deliver staggering throughput and warp fast access for system drives. Intel's Optane Memory technology is supported, which provides a solid state cache to accelerate other storage devices.   This new Prime series receives our latest on-board audio enhancements, including a Realtek S1220A codec paired with an amplifier and premium components that produce immersive and crystal clear sound which rivals some dedicated sound cards.   The Prime X299-Deluxe has everything Our Deluxe motherboards set the template for high-end builders who want it all, and the new Prime X299-Deluxe continues that proud tradition. It adds pretty much everything you could want on a high-end motherboard, from ultra-fast I/O to cutting-edge aesthetic enhancements.   After setting the bar for RGB lighting with Aura Sync, we're raising it with new customization features that take personalization to the next level. Chief among them is support for addressable lighting strips that offer independent control over each LED on the line, setting the stage for considerably more advanced effects. The Deluxe has headers for addressable and conventional RGB LED strips, plus dual onboard light bars that run down the I/O shield and chipset heat sink.   The chipset heat sink also houses the all-new LiveDash, an integrated OLED screen capable of displaying valuable system information and custom graphics. You can see vital stats like temperatures, frequencies, and fan speeds without alt-tabbing away from games and other full-screen tasks. LiveDash can also display text messages and graphical animations to set your rig apart from the rest.   Ultra-high-speed storage is available in multiple form factors, and the Deluxe supports them all. In addition to offering a U.2 port for enterprise-grade SSDs, it comes with dual M.2 slots for gumstick-sized NVMe drives. Both M.2s are situated with thermals in mind; the main slot sits under the chipset heat sink, which reduces drive temperatures, while the secondary one mounts drives vertically near the DIMM slots, where they can be exposed to airflow generated by system fans.   Networking gets a boost from next-gen Wi-Fi with an integrated 802.11ad module. The dual-band solution can push wireless rates up to 4.6Gbps-several times the speed of most wired connections. And the Deluxe has you covered on the wired front, too, with dual Intel Gigabit Ethernet controllers delivering fast and reliable connectivity.   There's only so much we can squeeze onto a motherboard without exceeding standard ATX dimensions, so the Prime X299-Deluxe comes with a couple of sidekicks. Our ThunderboltEX 3 card is included, providing 40Gbps of bandwidth to external peripherals. We also bundle our Fan Extension card, which expands the board's already generous assortment of fan headers and temperature sensors. If you want one board with everything, the Deluxe is it.   Distill the essentials with the Prime X299-A Although the Prime X299-A features many of the same technologies as the Deluxe, it eschews certain extras in favor of a straightforward approach that gets back to basics. The combination of core Prime features with the latest Intel platform produces an enticing board.   Like its big brother, the X299-A supports up to three-way graphics configurations across a trio of x16 slots. You can add VROC arrays via our add-in card, if the two onboard M.2 slots are not enough. Essential I/O is fully covered, including an USB 3.1 Gen 2 internal header for chassis' that support the new 10Gbps standard, plus Type-A and reversible Type-C ports at the rear.   With a more sedate design than its sibling, the Prime X299-A can still light up your PC with RGB effects. The board has dual headers for off-the-shelf LED strips, each of which supports up to two meters of lighting at optimal brightness. The colors, effects, and tastefulness of the resulting glow is entirely up to you.   The Prime X299-A shows that affordable Core X-Series motherboards need not skimp on the features you crave. It has everything needed for an entry-level build, plus room to grow into something much more formidable.   TUF enough to endure Our Prime X299 motherboards are balanced by entries from the TUF family. These models march to a different beat that prioritizes reliability and durability for PCs built to go the distance. They use tougher components than conventional counterparts, and they're subjected to more stringent testing.   Shifting focus requires a new outlook, and TUF answers with distinctive designs that meld industrial sensibilities with a touch of space marine. Stealthy by nature, the new boards minimize RGB lighting to concentrate on different priorities.   Arm yourself with the TUF X299 Mark 1 A new coat of reinforced armor makes the TUF X299 Mark 1 stand out from its predecessors. The protective cover streamlines airflow over the board and prevents dust from accumulating in nooks and crannies. Airflow beneath the surface is generated by a dedicated fan that also directs cool air toward the primary M.2 slot that further improves thermals.   Managing thermals is critical to maintaining stability when systems are pushed to the limit, especially on a high-end desktop platform. The TUF X299 Mark 1 is laced with additional temperature sensors to monitor different zones on the motherboard and in your system as a whole. Sensor data is fed into Thermal Radar 3 software that intelligently manages your cooling to keep temperatures and acoustics low.   The updated armor is our strongest yet, but the Mark 1's real strength comes from its Fortifier backplate. This rear reinforcement uses a carefully shaped and folded metal plate to stiffen the board against warping that now includes a removable GPU Holder that supports the weight of sagging graphics cards. And, as an added bonus, it helps dissipate thermal energy from multiple hot spots on the back of the PCB.   TUF Detective reprises its role as smartphone-powered troubleshooter and monitoring utility. Unlike previous iterations, which require a wired USB connection, the latest version performs diagnostics wirelessly over Bluetooth using the included USB adapter.   As the flagship of the TUF family, the Mark 1 also adds several perks. The glowing logo at the center of the board changes based on the load to show how hard the system is working. There are dual Intel Gigabit LAN controllers plus all the flavors in the USB 3.1 Gen2 rainbow: old-school Type-A, reversible Type-C, and internal header.   Welcome the X299 Mark 2 into the TUF family TUF strips down to the essentials with the X299 Mark 2. Like the Prime X299-A, the board delivers all the features of the new Intel platform, plus must-have ASUS innovations like advanced overclocking, cooling and tuning options. It removes the armor and backplate in favor of a naked PCB with a darker motif that blends into the shadows. The Mark 2 makes TUF more accessible for X299 builders who want to deviate from the conventional formula.   AVAILABILITY & PRICING   ROG Rampage VI Extreme, Rampage VI Apex and ROG Strix X299-E motherboards will be available at leading resellers starting in late June with the Strix series arriving first.

The Alphabet subsidiary says that Skylake Xeons are now generally available and that it is “the first and only public cloud to deliver Intel’s next-generation Xeon server processor”. That's the kind of thing server-makers used to trumpet in the hope those with a need for speed would shop with a perhaps-unfamiliar supplier to get their hands on more clock cycles. The arrangement with Google looks similar: The Register understands that Intel cut a custom Xeon for the Alphabet subsidiary to use in the knowledge it would shout long and loud about the new Xeon's many fine qualities. Google's not, however, sharing a lot. It is saying that Skylake-Xeon-powered instances have clock speed of 2.0 GHz and let you build virtual machines with up to 64 vCPUS and 455 GB of RAM. We still don't know exactly what's inside Skylake Xeons, which is no surprise given that Intel's only revealed branding for the CPUs and plans to reveal specifics about their their innards in coming days ahead of their mainstream launch. For now we have Google's assurance that the CPUs are well-suited to demanding applications, but that they're nonetheless ready to roll inside its standard instances, as well as the gruntier highmem, highcpu, Custom Machine Types and Preemptible VMs. For now they're only offered in Google's Western US, Western Europe and Eastern Asia Pacific regions, but the company says “we have more capacity arriving every day, and support for additional regions and zones coming in the near future.” Google's also added a new “Minimum CPU Platform” feature that lets you specify the worst CPU you're willing to use in its cloud. The company has admitted it has a fleet mixing Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Broadwell silicon. The new feature means if you specify Haswell, you'll never run on the older Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge. ® Tips and corrections Post a comment MORE Google Intel Cloud Skylake Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Supermicro sockets it to Skylake rivals Comment Word to your motherboard 7 Comments Supermicro boasts of secret super server Silicon Valley win 30,000+ into a single 'valley data centre - but whose is it? 9 Comments SuperMicro, IBM hook up Adding POWER servers yo its Xeon Ultra line Fancy a wee quasi-DRAM?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 1 June 2017 | MYT 8:00 AM Cricket: England trio to pioneer bat sensors in Champions Trophy Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. — AFP Relaxnews England trio Jason Roy, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes will be among the players from around the world pioneering new bat sensors during the upcoming Champions Trophy, it was announced Tuesday.  Technology giant Intel has developed a sensor, placed on top of the bat handle, that provides previously unseen precise details about a player's bat speed and angle of back lift. The aim is to both provide more information to television audiences and, longer term, develop a coaching aid. Former England captain turned cricket broadcaster Nasser Hussain told a news conference at The Oval: "How many times have we spoken about people having 'fast hands' or 'great bat speed'? "But what does that mean? We've never quantified it." Hussain, speaking ahead of the Champions Trophy opener between England and Bangladesh at The Oval on Thursday, said he would have benefitted had this technology been available in his career. "When I first played for England, I had never really seen myself on television. I remember playing in Jamaica, getting out and walking through the hotel lobby and Geoffrey Boycott shouting at me 'Hussain, you'll never get any runs with that open bat face'. "Something like this can show you the exact angle of your bat." Hussain said Roy, going through a run drought that has yielded four single figure scores in his last five one-day international innings, might gain from the new system. "Take Jason Roy, struggling a little bit at the moment. Say this technology had been in place for two or three years, he could have a net tomorrow, play normally, and then take the data from two years ago and say 'is everything I'm doing with my bat exactly the same as it was?' and if you know it was, you know that's not the issue." Hussain added: "There will be traditionalists thinking 'is this relevant?'. "But if it gives you that one percent to improve the game, someone will be using it." Other innovations at the Champions Trophy include the use of high-technology drones to provide more in-depth pitch analysis and a virtual reality system that allows fans to experience what it's like to face the world's best bowlers. International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson, speaking alongside Hussain, welcomed the developments by saying: "If the technology is available to enhance and amplify the cricket experience, over the years we've shown a real willingness to trial and support it. "Our long-term vision is to make cricket the world's favourite sport and really there's only one way to achieve this – to keep the fans engaged and interested in the game." The former South Africa wicket-keeper added:  "That's all about offering the fans premium content and embracing technology." — AFP Relaxnews   Related Stories You May Be Interested Snapchat’s ‘Spectacles’ go on sale in Europe Naspers to shut down Turkish e-commerce business Markafoni Australia's old media moguls unite to fight online giants 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read AirAsia Free Seats promotion starts tomorrow Alize Cornet vs. Caroline Garcia - player profiles Netizens want PJ‘s precious icon retained advertisement Latest News Google’s Chrome browser to start blocking annoying ads next year Bansen Labs adapter allows gamers with disabilities to connect with technology Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Microsoft’s weapon in high-stakes cloud-computing battle with Amazon?

Huawei P10, P10 Plus launch in South Africa Samsung Galaxy S8 review: a great phone, but not Galaxy S7 great Computers / Intel Core i9: six things worth knowing By Hadlee Simons on 31 May, 2017 Intel made a huge splash this week when it announced the Core i9 processor. Of course, 9 is higher than 7 (duh), so you’d expect it to be powerful (bigger duh). But what are the key things to know about the new chip? A lot of cores and threads The Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition has a monster 18 cores and 36 threads, clearly being designed for the one-percenter wanting to one-up their middle class friends. Otherwise, the company says the new chips are made with “advanced gaming, VR and content creation in mind”. It’s part of Intel’s new X-Series family Yep, the Core i9 isn’t the only new chip brought to market by Intel, as it’s actually part of a family of ultra high-end processors. Other chips include the standard Core i9 7900X (10 cores/20 threads), the Core i7 7820X (8 cores/16 threads), Core i7 7800X (6 cores/12 threads), the Core i7 7740X (4 cores/8 threads) and Core i5 7640X (4 cores/4 threads). Pricing? The Core i9 Extreme Edition won’t be cheap though, receiving a suggested price of US$1999. Sheesh. How about the Core i9 7900X? Well, you’re looking at a US$999 price tag. Able to pay more than US$999 but not willing to go to the US$2000 mark? Well, Intel is also readying 12, 14 and 16 core variants of the Core i9 chip, with suggested prices of US$1199, US$1399 and US$1699 respectively. Otherwise, the cheapest chip in the family (Core i5 7640X) has a US$242 price tag. About the socket Intel has confirmed that the X-Series family takes advantage of a new LGA 2066 socket. In other words, you’ll need to buy a new motherboard as well. Then again, if you’re buying the most expensive chip, it’s a small price to pay. How powerful is it? Intel claims that the family also includes their first teraflop CPU. But it’s not just due to sheer number of cores, apparently. Although that helps massively. The company’s new boost tech sees the two best cores being identified, with heavy lifting then being directed to them for a performance boost. Intel adds that you should be able to edit, transcode, animate and render simultaneously (presumably on the higher end chips). What about gaming? For starters, the company says it represents the best gaming performance in an Intel chip. Obviously. But Intel says you can game, stream, record and transcode simultaneously too (again, we presume you’ll want to try this on the higher end processors). Otherwise, the firm says the new chips have support for up to four graphics cards Author Bio Terrible puns make Hadlee Simons difficult to work with, but he brings over seven years of tech journalism experience to the table. When he's not at work or watching motorsport, he's in the foetal position on a jiu jitsu mat.

ASRock displays its trove of funky motherboards at Computex by Zak Killian  8:00 AM on May 31, 2017 We've yet to look at the company's wares, but ASRock is in attendance at Computex, too. ASRock has a reputation for making some of the zanier products around, although it might prefer the word "innovative." This year, the company is showing off some unique motherboards for both Intel and AMD systems, along with what might be the coolest application of the Mini-STX form factor we've seen yet. ASRock has the usual array of high-end X299 boards on display. Although we don't have specific details on the models, the company is showing X299 motherboards bearing Johnathan "Fatal1ty" Wendel's sobriquet as well as the name of champion overclocker Nick Shih. While the X299 Fatal1ty Professional Gaming i9 hails from the "does everything" school of motherboard design, the X299 OC Formula by Nick Shih is more stripped-down, with just four memory slots and a 14-phase voltage regulator. Perhaps more interesting to gerbils (given you folks' affection for PCs en miniature) is the X299E-ITX/ac. Yes, ASRock's engineers crammed an X299 motherboard into the Mini-ITX form factor. To support the LGA 2066 socket's quad-channel memory, the board uses a quartet of SODIMM slots. It also packs on six SATA ports, three M.2 sockets, dual Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet ports, and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Intel's X299 platform isn't the only one getting the ITX treatment from ASRock. The Socket AM4 X370 Gaming-ITX/ac is exactly what it sounds like: a Mini-ITX motherboard for AMD's Ryzen CPUs. You only get two DIMM slots, but they're for full-sized sticks instead of SODIMMs. The board supports the Ryzen CPU's native USB 3.1 ports and has a pair of HDMI outputs, should you wish to stick an APU in it. ASRock also has a version of the board coming out with an AMD B350 chipset onboard. In case you haven't heard, cryptocurrency "mining" has come back into vogue lately because of newer "alt-coin" algorithms that can't easily be accelerated on custom hardware. Generally speaking, GPUs are once again the chosen platform, and since such work is primarily done in chunks that fit entirely on a graphics card and its local memory, the host system's performance is less relevant. Miners could spend a bundle on expensive X299 systems to host their hashing, or they could buy something like ASRock's H110 Pro BTC+. This stripped-down platter has twelve PCIe x1 slots and a single x16 slot. All those slots can be filled with enough graphics cards to power a heavy-duty mining rig. Finally (at least as far as PC parts go), ASRock will be showing off some mini-PCs at its Computex booth. We don't know much about the new boxes yet, but the company says it is launching a line of DeskMini RX and DeskMini GTX products based on products like its new Z270M-STX motherboard. Mini-STX is the proper name of the form factor formerly known as "5x5", since it's just five inches square. ASRock says the Z270M-STX mobo supports MXM graphics cards and a staggering three M.2 slots. Hopefully our guys on the ground will get a chance to stop by the ASRock booth to see this stuff in person. If not, you'll surely be hearing about some of these products in the coming months, so keep an eye out. Tags: Motherboards Systems Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Almost everyone has a smartphone or a tablet or notebook, and some people have all three. Customers want these devices to be light, thin and portable. But, looking at the venerable PC, it seems this same trend has not really caught on. PC enthusiasts are well aware of the Mini-ITX form factor, but the wider market still seems to think of the PC as the stereotypical ATX sized box that has been with us for decades. Most people are simply unaware that they can have a fully capable PC in the size of a paperback book (such as a NUC) or have a gaming capable PC, even capable of 4K gaming, in a package the size of a CD player or shoebox. We have gathered some popular PC components and we’ll be putting them into a Silverstone Fortress FTZ01 and see just what a mini PC is capable of. Let’s start off with our component choices. The Components The Case – Silverstone FTZ01 $185 SGD The case is obviously a key component when considering a mini build. Silverstone is a company that consistently release and refine small form factor products including power supplies and coolers, so it was really easy to choose Silverstone for the chassis and PSU. The Silverstone FTZ01 is among our very favorites. It’s one of the best-designed ITX cases available. It is surprisingly easy to work with,  especially with its GPU riser system that allows the use of large, high-powered video cards, all the while packing a slim, low profile chassis with a 14L capacity. At 14.8″ (W) x 4.21″ (H) x 13.82″ (D), it’s one of the smallest cases capable of holding a high end system without compromise. The FTZ01 is is a premium metal body case which offers the flexibility of being placed vertically or horizontally. It retains flexibility with regards to cooling, it will accept a 3.5″ HDD if needed and includes a slot for a DVD or Blu Ray player at its front. It’s size is about what you’d see from a typical Hi-Fi component. Naturally a small form factor case will come with some considerations, including the choice of cooler, but these are easily worked around with the knowledge of what you need. The Power Supply– Silverstone SX700-LPT 80Plus Platinum $248 SGD The Silverstone SX700-LPT  is a 700 watt power supply, meaning its capable of powering essentially any system including overclocked CPUs with high core counts and a single graphics card. It will also power many systems with dual GPUs too, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a small form factor build. The key reasons for choosing this unit are its small size and the fact that it is 80Plus Platinum rated. This means it has very good efficiency, which in turn means less heat output and a lower power bill. This is a key consideration for any small form factor build where cooling is usually not as efficient as a full sized build.   The Motherboard– MSI Z270I Gaming AC $329 SGD For our motherboard, we chose a MSI Z270i Gaming AC. This board has a raft of high end features, including quality audio, AC Wi-Fi, M.2 support, USB 3.1 and even full RGB lighting.   The CPU – Intel i7-7700 – $475 SGD The CPU was a tougher choice. While we could have gone with a 7700K, its TDP is significantly higher than our eventual choice of a i7-7700. The 7700 means we have a turbo frequency of up to 4.2Ghz while keeping TDP at an impressive 65w. This compares to 91w for a 7700K. So, with a 3.6Ghz base clock and 4.2 Ghz boost clock, the i7-7700 still provides 8 threads and will easily power the latest games and have enough grunt on hand for demanding tasks. it will also be easy for a modest CPU cooler to handle. The CPU Cooler – Cryorig C7 – $55 SGD The Cryorig C7 cooler is specifically designed for small form factor builds. It has the same footprint as a stock Intel cooler, which fit’s into the Intel socket area where no other components are allowed. This means it won’t interfere with tall memory heatsinks, chipset or PWM heatsinks. It’s still much better than the standard Intel cooler thanks to the addition of heatpipes, greater fin surface area and a more efficient fan. It is easily capable of keeping the 65w i7-7700 cool. The GPU – AMD Radeon RX480 8Gb $409 The choice of GPU for a small form factor build will depend on the users budget and usage scenario. The FTZ01 case can handle cards up to 13″ in length and supports dual slot cards. We chose a reference AMD RX480 with its exhaust blower configuration. This is key as all the heat is dumped outside the case. The card performs well at 1080p and offers a good range of technologies including HDMI 2.0b and Display Port 1.4 for driving high resolution displays. It also brings native HEVC Main 10 support making it a good choice for playback of 4k60p content on modern televisions. A GTX 1060 3Gb or 6Gb would be another good choice for the same reasons. We also have a GTX 1080 Ti reference card here that would be the ultimate choice, but its expense is something to consider. If you want to game on your sexy 4k TV or display though, its the only choice. Do you fancy gaming on a 4k OLED 65″ TV? Droooooool… Of course if you’re playing less demanding games such as DOTA or CS:GO, then you can save dollars and go with a cheaper card, though do be aware that a cheaper card might not be capable of pushing to the 120 or 144fps levels that many gamers prefer.   The Memory – G.Skill 2x8Gb DDR4-3200 $239 SGD G.Skill make the highest speed memory you can get, and high speed memory just so happens to run very well on dual slot motherboards. 2x8Gb of DDR4-3200 is a good sweet spot choice of speed, capacity and performance.   The Storage – Zotac 240Gb SSD $149 + Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD $499+ Seagate 2Tb HDD $115 These days, a 128-256Gb SSD simply runs out of space once you put a few programs on there. Think Grand Theft Auto 5 or similar which takes up the best part of 70Gb! For this reason we chose a smallish 240Gb Zotac Premium SSD for the OS, then a Western Digital 1Tb Blue SSD for games and and a Seagate 2Tb SSD for media storage. You can omit the HDD of course if you have a NAS or external drive. This will make the system much quieter. Mechanical drives really do make an annoying whirring noise that is really noticeable when they spin up.   The Build Moving onto the build, as we see below, the Silverstone FTZ01 has a unique GPU cage/holder with PCIe extender which allows the card flat relative to a normal GPU/MB installation. This alone allows the case to be several centimeters thinner than would otherwise be possible. Here is the PCie Extender card itself. Inside the cylindrical hole is where you place the GPU into the slot. Here is the RX480 attached to the GPU mechanism. The little black plastic piece in the middle is designed to support the weight of the GPU. This a is a good idea since GPU sagging is become more of an issue as GPUs seemingly get ever heavier. Below is the system prior to installing the GPU cage. This gives an illustration of some of the options available with the FTZ01. If you don’t install the cage and use the IGP, you could install a dual radiator watercooler. Some users might wish to skip gaming altogether and this would allow you to run a heavily overclocked i7-7700K if you like, or even the likes of an ASRock X99ITX or one of the upcoming X299 or AM4 ITX motherboards. On the outside of the case, the fans have magnetized dust covers which seal up the system very nicely.   Here is the system in its complete state minus the WD 1Tb SSD and hard drive (which would be located just underneath the main power cables at the top right). The GPU is located below the SSD. The space to the bottom right is where an optical drive can be placed. Cable management is usually a bit of a nightmare in smaller form factor builds where space is the primary consideration, but in the Silverstone FTZ01 the cables can be routed quite well, which improves airflow and assists with cooling. The scale of the system is well illustrated here with the I/O of the motherboard and graphics card clearly visible. Below is a good comparison of the size if the unit vs a full sized Corsair 760T case. As you can see, it’s a lot smaller in every dimension!   But how does it perform? Here is the main spec of the system. 8 cores at 4Ghz+ at 65w.. Nice!   One of the supposed weaknesses of a compact system is the compromising on cooling. The FTZ01 has no problems with airflow, and the i7-7700 stayed under 80c, which is quite good for a Kaby Lake processor under 100% load. Obviously the Cryorig cooler isn’t as good as a top end air cooler, let alone a water cooler, but under 80c is perfectly worry free.   The beauty of 8 threads is you can do some serious work with them. As you can see below, a i7 7700 smashes an overclocked 2600K at video encoding. The 2600K is one of the best processors Intel ever made, but its starting to show its age now. the i7 -7700 is a good 25% faster without an overclock. We ran a few game benchmarks to see how we’d go. With the RX480, 1080p is the real sweet spot for high quality gaming. Once you go to 1440p, you’ll have to dial back the quality a bit to maintain 60fps. Rise of the Tomb Raider with Very High settings held at 70fps, Far Cry Primal 61fps and Ashes of The Singularity 47.5fps when set to Extreme with DX12 mode enabled. These are difficult games to run, but all are easy with a RX480. Of course you can add about 10% of performance if you go with a RX580. Don’t forget that games like CS:GO, Overwatch or DOTA can get by with a low end card, but to get the best experience in these games, high FPS is still desirable. If you’re running a 120hz+ monitor with freesync, you’ll need a decent card to get the best out your games.   Summing it up The Total for the system is $2700. Of course you’ll need a monitor and peripherals to go with it. This is certainly not cheap, but we think this is a good balanced system. You can easily put a top end graphics card in there and game happily at 4K, alternatively you could go for a cheaper CPU or skip the graphics card altogether. Even a Kaby Lake dual core will do the job for non compute intensive tasks. Another option might be to go for some generic memory, for example 2x8Gb of DDR4-2400. Why ITX? It’s just more convenient! You get the full power of a modern PC, whilst combining it into a small form factor. A smaller footprint adds a lot of flexibility when it comes to the uses of the system. A living room gaming PC? A portable LAN PC? Living in a university dorm room? Not everyone wants a huge snarling beast of a system decked out in Christmas RGB lights. Some people want their systems to be functional and blend in. The wolf in sheep’s clothing. Having experience in PC sales in a previous life, it’s amazing how many people automatically assume a small PC is a weak PC. It is not! The point here isn’t so much to build a top end system or a budget system, it’s to show what an ITX system is capable of. Other than really high end multi GPU systems, a well though out ITX build can do everything a full sized build can do. We all like Ultrabooks, slim phones & compact tablets. Why not apply the same thinking to your next PC? Bigger doesn’t always mean better!   James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Dell Specials at The PC Show and the Consumer Electronic Exhibition!

Climate Deal Decision Watch These NSFW Deadpool Bloopers While We Wait For The Sequel Companies Think President Trump's Withdrawal From The Paris Accord Is Stupid Matt Novak Jun 3, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  apple climate agreement climate change donald trump google jack dorsey mark cuban paris accord president trump tim cook video feature Share President Donald Trump stood up in front of the world yesterday and withdrew the United States from the Paris Accord, a global agreement to combat climate change. The agreement had nearly universal support, but Trump said withdrawing is good for American business. But American business leaders disagree. President Donald Trump demonstrates for the cameras how little thought he gave to withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) CEOs from companies in practically every sector of American life issued statements yesterday denouncing Trump's decision. Business leaders such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Robert Iger even signalled that this was the last straw, and announced that they'd no longer act as advisers to the US president. Even before Trump's decision yesterday, the Paris Accord had broad support in the business community. On 26 April 2017 a group of companies wrote an open letter to the president, asking him to stay in the agreement. Companies as diverse as Walmart and DuPont and Intel all signed the letter. Even energy companies like ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron also implored Trump not to drop the Paris Accord in the lead up to yesterday's announcement from the White House Rose Garden. But he didn't listen.

We can only imagine that this list will continue to grow in the coming weeks. Twenty years from now, we have no idea what the defining moment of Trump's shameful presidency will be. But with climate change already impacting the world in disastrous ways, his decision to needlessly shun the environment should at least crack the top 10. But who knows? Trump still has so much time to inflict very real damage on both the United States and the rest of the world — a world that increasingly sees America as a joke that elected a neo-fascist reality TV star as its president.

"We will keep working toward the ambitious goals of a closed-loop supply chain, and to eventually stop mining new materials altogether. Of course, we're going to keep working with our suppliers to help them do more to power their businesses with clean energy. And we will keep challenging ourselves to do even more."

"If the US exits international accords like the Paris agreement it will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our environment and relationships among the world community."

"For our part, we've committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy. Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it's too late."

Our call for an international agreement on this issue is more than a decade old, and we first voiced our support for the Paris Agreement in 2015 when it was negotiated," said IBM in a statement.

"We will continue to honour the core commitments of the American Business Act on Climate Change Pledge, including reaching 100 per cent renewable energy in all Nike-owned or -operated facilities around the world by 2025, participating in the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Challenge and advancing materials innovation globally."

Comments lee978 @978lee Jun 3, 2017, 7:32am Where does Trump get his facts about economic benefits vs costs of responding to climate change? How is this even "costing" the economy anything as there are clearly benefits in jobs, manufacturing and HUGE export potential. It's one thing to deny science but now economics too. Reply 0 tonyintsv @tonyintsv Jun 3, 2017, 10:16am So all these successful business leaders can see that the Paris Accords are a good thing but the failed business leader can't? Why is that not surprising? All you need to know about Trump's business acumen is that he sent a successful Casino into bankruptcy. Reply 0 thelovedog @thelovedog Jun 3, 2017, 1:15pm Editors, Reading your ABOUT page title states, "Gizmodo loves technology + entertainment" and goes further to explain what the website is about, "We're obsessed with the gadgets, car tech, science and geek culture that change the way we live. Gizmodo covers Australian science and entertainment news with a team of award-winning journalists — and localises the best posts from the US + UK editions." All well and good, so in light of this information, why are you publishing poilitical news about Trump, surely this would be better off in the BUSINESS INSIDER arm of your publications. I come to GIZMODO to read about TECHNOLOGY and ENTERTAINMENT, not about poilitics. Regards. Reply 0 djbear @djbear Jun 4, 2017, 11:19pm If you dislike these articles. THEN DONT READ AND COMMENT ON THEM. Reply 0 steve f. Guest Jun 3, 2017, 2:28pm Because all these mega millionaires and their companies really, really deeply care about ordinary people like you. Ha.

Here's what they had to say. NYPD Fails To Convince Court Its Deafening Sound Cannon Is Just A 'Communication Tool' Sidney Fussell 03 Jun 2017 1:00 PM On Wednesday, a US federal judge ruled that the sound emitted from the NYPD's Long Range Acoustic Devices -- portable sound cannons that blast noise -- could be considered a use of force, contrary to the police department's claims. The LRAD can blast sound as loudly as 136 decibels. That's louder than a jackhammer or a jet engine and above the 120 db threshold for immediate human hearing loss. Want Gizmodo's email newsletter?

Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} June 02, 2017 3:59pm   Comments Share: Related AMD Hooked On Horsepower: Intel To Sell 18-Core Processor For Speed Freaks 4 Takeaways From Advanced Micro Devices' Recent Trade Show Product Update Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)'s high profile Ryzen 7 desktop processors launched in early March amid much fanfare and expectations is made cheaper in about three months following its commercial launch. Ryzen Rising Ryzen 7 is AMD's 8-core desktop processor, which has a Zen core and comes in three models, namely the flagship 1800X model and the 1700X and 1700 models. The company had then demonstrated the Ryzen 7 1800X's superiority over a similarly configured 8-core, 16-thread core Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) i7-6900K in Cinebench R15 multi-threaded and Handbrake-based video transcoding, while also showing comparable 4K gaming performance. The launch pricing of the Ryzen 7 models: 1800X: $499. 1700X: $399. 1700: $329. After First 'Ryzen Quarter' Results, Stock Tumbled Following the release of its first-quarter results, which revealed largely in-line results and positive second-quarter guidance, the stock plunged 24.2 percent to $10.32 on May 2. This is despite the hype-surrounding the first Ryzen quarter. Analysts attributed the weakness to profit taking after the strong run up seen since early 2016. In 2016 alone, the stock gained 295.1 percent. Source: Y Charts Subsequently, in April, AMD launched its Ryzen 5 processors, with experts claiming the 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 1600X gaming processor would give Intel's K-series Corr i5 chip a run for its money. Upcoming Launches Abound With several upcoming catalysts, namely the impending launch of Ryzen 3 series meant for Mainstream consumers, Naples server processor and RX Vega gaming card to be released at the end of July, it looks like the stock would recover from its post-earnings swoon in the near-to-medium term. Vega is AMD's high-end graphics architecture pitted against NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)‘s GTX 1080. It is against this backdrop the news concerning AMD slashing prices of its Ryzen 7 series emanated. The new pricing reads: 1800X: $450. 1700X: $350. 1700: $315. Why Announce The Price Cut Now? At its Financial Analyst Day on May 16, AMD announced details of its Ryzen Threadripper CPUs — that it would have 16 core, 32 threads, built on an "all new HEDT platform." The company also indicated that it would be launched in the summer. The Ryzen Threadripper is seen as a competing product to Intel's Core i9 line up, which would cost $2,000 for the 18-core model and $1,700 for a 16-core mode, according to Digital Trends. Given the Ryzen Threadripper has double the count of the Ryzen 7 chips and AMD's focus on performance-price ratio, Digital Trends estimates that the Threadripper could be priced at $900. It is not uncommon for companies to slash prices when a new series of the product is to be launched. However, Digital Trends does not see this as the case. AMD's wont of offering an appealing performance-price ration could have driven the decision to cut prices ahead of the Threadripper launch. There is also a view that the price cut is the company's attempt to find out how consumers react to various price points. With a lot going on with the company, it remains to be seen if AMD regains its lost glory and emerge as the frontrunner in the chip market.

Much like all Intel board partners Supermicro is cooking up something nice as well. And I do say nice with a reason, as previously the designs (aesthetically) have been lacking a bit in our opinion. Things are about to change. And that chance is for the better alright, we spot a nice black CB series, metal shielded PCI-Express slots, Realtek ALC1220 audio and hey now, even a 5 gbit Ethernet jack, Jack! The C7X299-PG obviously has Socket LGA 2066 for the new Intel  Core X-Series processor family. It supports up to 128GB DDR4 memory, has four reinforced PCI-E slots, one Gbit and one 5Gbit LAN port, USB3.1a and c ports, two M.2 and two U.2 ports. In addition, the latest Realtek chip (ALC1220). The C7X299-PG Supero series will be reelased in two models: C7X299-PG C7X299-PGF – includes remote management via IPMI IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is a server feature that allows remote control and monitoring of the PC. Supermicro is the brand behind Supero. SMC traditional makes servers and part of that quality translates itself towards their motherboards. More information will become available soon including details on pricing and availability. Here is a sneak peek. I requested some more photos which hopefully I can in the next hour or so.

Introduction, value and design 2. Performance, features and verdict Our Verdict With smooth graphics and high performance, the Leopard Pro makes gaming look good both in and out of VR – just be sure to bring headphones. For Responsive 120Hz screen Loaded with brand name parts Relatively inexpensive Against Short battery life Noticeably loud fans Don’t expect Ultra all the time Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of the supposed VR-era is the increase in affordable high-performance technology for gaming. This being the case, the 17-inch MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro packs plenty of gaming power for a mid-range gaming PC. The notebook represents a significant value even if you have little interest in taking advantage of its VR capabilities.  However, it sports a suite of name brand components inside, such as a SteelSeries gaming keyboard, 4-position surround sound powered by Dynaudio, and a Killer Gaming Networks Ethernet card to reduce latency during online games. All of it is topped with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU backing a 120Hz, 1,920 x 1,080 FHD display for liquid smooth graphical performance. Other components include a 2.8GHz Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD. You might not always be able to push your game settings to ultra, but you can enjoy all the still-beautiful mid-to-high settings most games currently have to offer. Spec Sheet Here is the MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ (quad-core, 6MB cache, up to 3.8GHz with Turbo) Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (3GB GDDR5 VRAM) RAM: 16GB DDR4 Dual Channel SDRAM (1,201MHz) Screen: 17.3-inch FHD screen, 1,920 x 1,080, 120Hz, 5ms, wide viewing angle Storage: 512GB NVMe M.2 SATA SSD; SD card reader; Super Multi DVD drive Ports: 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C; 2 x USB 3.0; 1 USB 2.0; 1 mini DisplayPort; 1 x HDMI 1.4 (4K supported); 1 Killer Gaming Networks Gigabit RJ-45 Ethernet port; 1 headphone jack; 1 microphone jack Connectivity: 802.11ac Wi-Fi; Bluetooth 4.2 Camera: 720p webcam Weight: 5.95 pounds (2.7kg) Size: 16.49 x 11.29 x 1.14 inches (41.9 x 28.7 x 2.9cm; W x D x H) Pricing and availability You can pick up an MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro for around $1,399 (about £1,090, AU$1,880) depending on the configuration, which represents a significant value when compared to some similar systems. For example, the Gigabyte Aero 15 goes for around $1,899 (about £1,471 and AU $2,541) with very similar hardware, including the memory, SSD storage and GPU.  The Gigabyte’s smaller 15-inch screen supports a higher QHD (3,840 x 2,160) resolution, but that might not be enough to balance out the significant price difference.  Neither system can match the Dell Inspiron 15 Gaming’s maximum $1,099 (£1,299, AU $1,999) price tag, and you can get a well-configured version for the bargain cost of $849 (£1,099, AU$1,999).  However, this 15-inch gaming notebook would have an Intel i5 processor, an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti video card, 8GB of memory and a 256GB SSD. In other words, the savings get you quite a downgrade. Design At a glance, the GP72VR Leopard Pro doesn’t stand out among other MSI gaming notebooks. It sports MSI’s signature minimalistic black aluminum chassis, shaped to look like the hood of a sports car, decorated with a backlit dragon shield logo. However, the understated appearance works well for MSI, because it’s what’s under the hood that counts. Players are greeted with the multicolored backlighting of the SteelSeries-designed gaming keyboard, accented by a rather large wrist rest area underneath, and two hard buttons below the touchpad. Although the keyboard is ideal for first-person shooters, like Overwatch, the entire top row of keys are half-sized, and all the keys are positioned very closely together. It can take some getting used to unless you’re already familiar with SteelSeries’ design because the layout could lead to higher typo rates when talking in chat or performing other everyday tasks, like web browsing or email. Everything from the keyboard lighting to overclocking and fan speeds can be easily managed using the MSI Dragon Center, an application that can be launched at the push of a dedicated key on the upper right side. Next to it is a separate key that forces the cooling fans to run at max speed indefinitely.  Although they aren’t the loudest fans we’ve ever heard, the noise is very noticeable even on automatic mode. They kick in very quickly during gaming sessions, and their sound may interfere with the enjoyment of the otherwise superb 4-point surround sound system. Even with the fans going at full blast, we can feel a small amount of warmth coming through the keyboard. Perils of weight loss Generally speaking, the mid-range notebook weighs almost 6 pounds (2.7kg), which is about expected for a notebook of its size, but we hardly feel it when carrying it around. The configuration we tested is lighter than others because it doesn’t include a spinning drive, thereby reducing its weight to 5.5 pounds (2.49 kg) with a DVD-ROM drive.  That’s surprisingly lighter than the Dell Inspiron 15’s 5.76 pounds (2.61kg), but not by much, and heavier than the Gigabyte Aero 15’s 4.62 pounds (2.1kg).  However, the weight reduction comes with a big trade-off. A single 512GB SSD means lower weight and lightning fast boot and load times, but it also means that you can’t install more than a handful of high-end games onto the system. Together, Overwatch, Mass Effect: Andromeda and Grand Theft Auto V ate up about 126GB, which is about one-quarter of the SSD. That doesn’t even account for for the space needed for Windows 10, other apps, and downloading game installers and updates.  This issue is compounded by how the SSD comes partitioned into two halves, further limiting what you can install without tweaking the settings.   A need for speed Given its hardware and features, it’s clear that the MSI GP72VR Leopard Pro is designed with gaming specifically in mind, especially first-person shooters. Although it does have the power to support virtual reality headsets, such as the Oculus Rift of HTC Vive, it seems like an incidental effect of the system’s overall capabilities.  What’s more impressive to those of us who decide to stay in actual reality is the 120Hz screen, which has excellent left and right viewing angles.  The colors start to look washed out when the display is tilted back too far, which is a problem that presents itself when watching videos while the notebook is on your lap, but it is an otherwise slick and quite bright screen.  Graphics are liquid smooth during gaming sessions, making the Leopard Pro’s multi-monitor capabilities (where you can attach two external displays) seem either completely superfluous or completely appetizing.  1 2 Current page: Introduction, value and design Next Page Performance, features and verdict Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Lenovo’s 2nd gen ThinkPad X1 Yoga now available for purchase 0 by Sean Chan Jun 2, 2017 at 17:22 GMT2 days ago Lenovo updated its ThinkPad X1 Yoga device with improved specs and security earlier this year at CES 2017. After almost 6 months, the device is finally available for purchase and users can get one for themselves right now from Lenovo’s official website. In terms of specs, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga includes all the usual high-end specs you’d expect to see on a premium business laptop. The device packs Intel’s 7th-gen Core i7 (7600U) processor, Intel’s HD Graphics 620 for the GPU, and up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM. The display of the ThinkPad X1 Yoga is a 14-inch WQHD OLED panel — but an IPS panel and an FHD variant are also available. For the internal storage, Lenovo has packed a whopping 1TB of SSD PCIe storage. The device’s battery is also very good, and Lenovo says it can offer up to 15 hours of battery life. The ports of the device include 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, 3 USB 3.0 ports, one HDMI port, one MicroSD slot and a MicroSIM slot as well. Interestingly, Lenovo initially announced that the device would pack n IR camera with face recognition support for Windows Hello at CES but that no longer seems to be the case as the device only includes a fingerprint scanner now. The new ThinkPad X1 Yoga starts at $1,682 and you can get one for yourself from the official Lenovo website here. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

The move means Mueller’s politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters. Alptekin’s company, Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynn’s consultancy $530,000 between September and November to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric living in the United States. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup last July. Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, told Reuters he hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen is “poisoning the atmosphere” between Turkey and the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynn’s business associates involved in the work for Inovo, two people familiar with the probe say. The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynn’s work for Inovo or Mueller’s investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed. BROAD POWERS Mueller’s move to take over the Virginia grand jury’s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened, but its existence has been previously reported. Until now the investigation has been led by Brandon van Grack, an espionage prosecutor in the Justice Department, and federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia. It is not clear whether Van Grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Mueller’s inquiry. Mueller’s appointment followed an uproar over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats and some of the president’s fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of November’s election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and Russia, has decried the investigation as a “witch hunt.” One of Trump’s most trusted aides during the election campaign, Flynn had a long career in the military. He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. UNFINISHED DOCUMENTARY Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House. Flynn’s work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey. Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group also produced a 75-page report on Gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made, according to three people familiar with the project. Alptekin, who is chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters he was satisfied with Flynn’s research because it had helped him understand how Gulen’s network operates in the United States. He said the $530,000 payment to Flynn’s firm came “mostly” from his personal funds. On Nov. 18, the day after Flynn was appointed Trump’s national security adviser, Trump transition team lawyer William McGinley raised concerns on a call with the Flynn Intel Group and others involved in the Inovo project over who had paid for Flynn’s commentary, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Flynn did not participate in that call, they said. At the time of the call, Flynn had not disclosed that his work for Alptekin meant he was being paid to represent Turkish interests during the election campaign. Flynn Intel Group had said in a September 2016 filing that it was lobbying for Inovo but did not disclose its Turkish links. In March, Flynn retroactively registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In a letter accompanying the March filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Kelner, said the disclosure was being made because Flynn’s work for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey,” which he noted was seeking to extradite Gulen. The House of Representatives intelligence committee, which is also investigating Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senate’s intelligence committee, which has a separate probe under way, has also served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and earlier this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials.—Reuters Tagged Flynn Turkey ties Turkish President Post navigation Previous Previous post: Nisar vows to implement decision of merging FATA into KP Next Next post: Editorial: Stunning blow to Paris agreement Tweet Related Posts Earthquake rocks Washington area US troops in Niger to set up drone base for Mali operation Iran opens trial of 3 Americans on spy charges Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Events WWDC 2017: Everything Apple is expected to announce on Monday Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 2nd, 2017 at 11:38 AM Share Tweet Andy Williams actually got it wrong. The most wonderful time of the year isn’t Christmas; it’s the two weeks around the end of May when Apple holds its annual developer conference. In one speech, we normally get a mix of new hardware and software updates, and Apple lays out the direction it’s going to take for the next 12 months. This year, we’re expecting a big one when WWDC 2017 starts on Monday at 1:00PM Eastern. In this post, we’ll roundup all of the most notable WWDC 2017 rumors so you know what to expect during Apple’s big WWDC keynote next week. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again New MacBooks Right now, the safest best for new hardware at WWDC 2017 is an update to the MacBook lineup. It might be a little odd, considering Apple just launched an all-new MacBook Pro back in November, but all the leaks, rumors and retail supply chain leaks have pointed towards some kind of new model. That’s the good news. The bad news is that we’re probably not going to see a new MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a few more ports. Instead, the smart money is on the current MacBook range getting a spec bump on the inside, most likely with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor. Improvements have also been made to the graphics cards for portable machines, so you could also expect the MacBook Pro to get a graphics bump. Siri Speaker We’re also expecting to see a new Siri-powered home speaker to pop up looking a lot like the Amazon Echo. Smart speakers have emerged as the obvious portal for controlling the smart home, so Apple can’t let Amazon and Google run away with the prize. It’s challenging to innovate on the concept of “kitchen speaker with an AI and a microphone built in,” so Apple has two options here: launch a keep-up-with-the-Joneses product that demonstrates its commitment to the product and lays the groundwork for something revolutionary to come; or try the classic Apple move, and make a much more expensive version to capture the high end of the market. It’s unclear what a “high-end” home speaker would look like, but a focus on audio quality using Beats branding isn’t out of the question. New iMacs Just like the new MacBooks, it’s possible that we’ll see a spec bump for the iMac. Intel’s new processors sure would look good inside, and it would lessen some of the cries we’ve been hearing that Apple doesn’t produce ‘“pro” computers any more. New iPads Finally, there’s rumors going around that we’ll see a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at WWDC. It likely won’t be a “new” form-factor, as there’s already a 9.7-inch iPad Pro on the market (and it recently went on sale!) Instead, look for much thinner bezels enabling a bigger screen in the existing body. Software iOS 11 Apple uses WWDC to show off the newest version of iOS every year like clockwork, and there’s zero reason to imagine that this year will be different. Bloomberg rumors suggest that iOS 11 will see a design overhaul, not as severe as the iOS 7 update that scrapped skeuomorphic design, but still significant. One of the biggest new features could be the introduction of a “dark” mode across the entire OS, something that jailbreakers have been doing for years. It’s a quick and easy way to save a little battery life and appease some of the more hardcore fans. We’re also expecting updates to apps, including a possible peer-to-peer payment function in Apple Pay, and more videos in Apple Music to tie in with Apple’s first original series launching soon. One thing we haven’t heard much about are updates to Siri. Google’s recent developer conference focused heavily on the Google Assistant, and how it’s finding its way across the entire platform. If Apple is expecting the Siri Speaker to do anything well, Siri’s going to need some major updates, and fast. One of the big interface differences between the Assistant and Siri is the ability to have written conversations and type queries; it’s quite possible that Apple builds that functionality right into iOS 11. macOS Of course, we’re expecting to see a new version of macOS, but it’s unlikely to be anything big. We said above that Siri needs to be a focus of WWDC overall this year, so that’s one obvious thing for Apple to focus on for the Macs. Siri found its way to the desktop at WWDC last year, so some new features could be in order. “Hey Siri” functionality could be expanded, and third-party features don’t currently work for Siri on MacOS. What we won’t see Some bad news: we almost definitely won’t see a new iPhone. Although the iPhone SE is technically due an update, the timing would be terrible. Apple is expected to announce three new phones of some kind this fall; the last thing it needs is a new cheap iPhone undercutting the “super-cycle” of people upgrading to the iPhone 8. A new Mac Pro is also probably off the table. Although the timing for a preview announcement makes sense, Apple execs previously hinted that a new Mac Pro would come by the end of the year. That also gives Apple time to integrate Intel’s newly-announced Core i9 chips, which are an obvious thing for Apple to stick inside its premiere video-editing machine.

 FBI expands Russia probe to include grand jury investigation into ex-Trump aide Michael Flynn Nathan Layne, Mark Hosenball, and Julia Edwards Ainsley, Reuters Jun. 2, 2017, 11:17 AM 2,910 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE PHOTO - U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Flynn boards Air Force One at West Palm Beach International airport in West Palm Beach Thomson Reuters WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible ties between the Trump election campaign and Russia, is expanding his probe to include a grand jury investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, three sources told Reuters. The move means Mueller’s politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters. Alptekin’s company, Netherlands-based Inovo BV, paid Flynn's consultancy $530,000 between September and November to produce a documentary and research on Fethullah Gulen, an exiled Turkish cleric living in the United States. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan blames Gulen for a failed coup last July. Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, told Reuters he hired Flynn to provide research on how Gulen is “poisoning the atmosphere” between Turkey and the United States. Gulen has denied any role in the coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. The grand jury in Virginia has issued subpoenas to some of Flynn’s business associates involved in the work for Inovo, two people familiar with the probe say. The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynn's work for Inovo or Mueller's investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed. Broad powers FILE PHOTO - Robert Mueller reacts to applause from the audience during his farewell ceremony at the Justice Department in Washington Thomson Reuters Mueller’s move to take over the Virginia grand jury’s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Mueller’s inquiry. Mueller’s appointment followed an uproar over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats and some of the president's fellow Republicans had demanded an independent probe of whether Russia tried to sway the outcome of November's election in favor of Trump and against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who has said there was no coordination between his campaign and Russia, has decried the investigation as a “witch hunt.” One of Trump’s most trusted aides during the election campaign, Flynn had a long career in the military. He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. Michael Flynn Win McNamee/Getty Images Unfinished documentary Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House.  Flynn's work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey. Along with the editorial, the Flynn Intel Group also produced a 75-page report on Gulen based mainly on news reports and some video footage for a documentary that was never made, according to three people familiar with the project. Alptekin, who is chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters he was satisfied with Flynn’s research because it had helped him understand how Gulen’s network operates in the United States. He said the $530,000 payment to Flynn’s firm came "mostly" from his personal funds.

News & Analysis Qualcomm Enters Intel PC Stronghold Alan Patterson 6/2/2017 11:01 AM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — With Qualcomm’s announcement of its Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC platform, the company is entering Intel’s CPU turf, where the world’s biggest chipmaker has held more than half of the market for more than three decades. The new Snapdragon draws on ARM’s processor portfolio, fulfilling a plan that Microsoft announced for Windows 10 with Qualcomm at a Shenzhen, China event late last year. For the first time, Windows will work with all the usual apps, peripherals and enterprise capabilities on a mobile, power efficient, always-connected cellular PC, Microsoft said at the time. Windows 10, released in 2015, introduces what Microsoft calls "universal apps" that can run on multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code‍, ‌including platforms such as PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded systems and Xbox One. (Photo: Qualcomm) While Qualcomm rolled out endorsements from a number of PC OEMs, including Asus and Lenovo at this week’s Computex show in Taipei, some analysts had reserved praise for the new Snapdragon chip. “On paper, it's quite promising if it can really achieve such long battery life and always-on connectivity that x86-based systems might struggle with,” said Bryan Ma, vice president of devices research with market researcher IDC. “The trick, though, is in the emulation. I actually just got a demo this morning, and it was better than I thought it would be, but wasn't perfect.” The Snapdragon 835 is a work in progress, Ma said, adding that he’s waiting for more test results after PC systems finally reach the market. It may still take as many as five years before there’s a noticeable impact on Intel from the Qualcomm chip, according to Ma. In the meantime, Intel can count on strong OEM marketing programs that Qualcomm isn't accustomed to. Intel is likely to dominate the hardcore desktop space that Qualcomm isn't touching with this solution. Even so, Qualcomm appears to be winning over OEMs with this latest effort that exploits Intel’s weakness in the mobile systems market. "The PC ecosystem continues to evolve, and this evolution requires new innovations in an ever-increasing mobile computing world," said Jerry Shen, chief executive officer of Asus. "With the Snapdragon Mobile PC Platform powering our new lineup of Windows 10 devices, our users now can take advantage of new always on, always connected experiences available to them." The world’s largest PC maker, Lenovo, also endorsed the new Qualcomm chip. "We're excited to work with Microsoft and Qualcomm Technologies to bring a whole new class of devices to consumers that will change the future of personal computing," said Jeff Meredith, a Lenovo senior vice president. The Snapdragon 835 SoC built into the Mobile PC Platform features the Qualcomm Kryo 280 CPU, the Adreno 540 GPU and the Hexagon 682 DSP to manage separate heterogenous workloads. The 10nm Snapdragon 835 provides devices with superior thermal handling and greater power efficiency, enabling fanless designs with longer battery life, according to Qualcomm. With an integrated Snapdragon X16 Gigabit LTE modem, devices will be able to support peak download speeds of up to 1Gbps. The Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform will also feature 2x2 802.11ac MU-MIMO for optimal Wi-Fi connectivity on the go, Qualcomm said. The Qualcomm-Microsoft partnership widens a split between Intel and Microsoft, the two companies that have up to now dominated the PC business in what has come to be known as the Wintel alliance. "We are thrilled that OEMs are sharing our vision to bring the Windows 10 experience to the ARM ecosystem, powered by Qualcomm Technologies," said Matt Barlow, corporate vice president of Windows marketing for Microsoft. "This collaboration offers consumers something new that they have been craving – the best of a mobile computing experience with the best of Windows 10, all in one thin, light, connected device." —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times.

The move means Mueller’s politically charged inquiry will now look into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election. Federal prosecutors in Virginia are investigating a deal between Flynn and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin as part of a grand jury criminal probe, according to a subpoena seen by Reuters.

The subpoena seen by Reuters seeks bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, his company, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo. Flynn's lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to questions about Flynn's work for Inovo or Mueller's investigation. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment. Alptekin declined to comment when asked about the investigation into Flynn and whether he or anyone he knows has been subpoenaed. BROAD POWERS Mueller’s move to take over the Virginia grand jury’s criminal investigation highlights his broad powers as special counsel. Reuters could not determine when the grand jury was first convened, but its existence has been previously reported. Until now the investigation has been led by Brandon van Grack, an espionage prosecutor in the Justice Department, and federal prosecutors from the Eastern District of Virginia. It is not clear whether Van Grack and others who have been working on the case will continue to do so. Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, on May 17 to oversee an investigation into any links or collusion between Russia and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Rosenstein also gave him authority to pursue “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation." Some members of Congress have asked the Justice Department to define the scope of Mueller’s inquiry. Mueller’s appointment followed an uproar over Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

He set up the Flynn Intel Group, an Alexandria, Virginia-based intelligence consultancy, after President Barack Obama dismissed him as head of the military’s Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. UNFINISHED DOCUMENTARY Mueller, who takes over leadership of an FBI investigation that began last July, can present evidence to grand juries and hear testimony from witnesses. Trump fired Flynn in February after it became clear that he had falsely characterized the nature of phone conversations he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, just after the Obama administration imposed new sanctions on Russia for what U.S. intelligence agencies had concluded was a Kremlin-led effort through computer hacking, fake news and propaganda to boost Trump’s chances of winning the White House.  Flynn's work for Inovo came under scrutiny after he published a commentary on a political news website on Election Day calling Gulen a “radical Islamist” who should be extradited to Turkey.

He said the $530,000 payment to Flynn’s firm came "mostly" from his personal funds. The rest came from Inovo's corporate revenues, Alptekin said. On Nov. 18, the day after Flynn was appointed Trump’s national security adviser, Trump transition team lawyer William McGinley raised concerns on a call with the Flynn Intel Group and others involved in the Inovo project over who had paid for Flynn's commentary, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation. Flynn did not participate in that call, they said. At the time of the call, Flynn had not disclosed that his work for Alptekin meant he was being paid to represent Turkish interests during the election campaign. Flynn Intel Group had said in a September 2016 filing that it was lobbying for Inovo but did not disclose its Turkish links. In March, Flynn retroactively registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In a letter accompanying the March filing, Flynn's lawyer, Kelner, said the disclosure was being made because Flynn's work for Inovo "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey," which he noted was seeking to extradite Gulen. The House of Representatives intelligence committee, which is also investigating Russian interference in the election, subpoenaed records from Flynn on Wednesday. The Senate's intelligence committee, which has a separate probe under way, has also served subpoenas on Flynn and two of his businesses, and earlier this week Flynn indicated that he would start turning over relevant materials.

Cricket is hardly synonymous with technological innovation, but the sport is taking strides to smarten up its game – starting with the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. For starters, the tournament – which kicked off on June 1 – sees Intel's Falcon 8 drone being used for pre-match pitch analysis. The UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) is equipped with HD and infrared cameras, which allow it to capture images and feedback reports on pitch conditions, including grass cover, health, and topology. As well as helping groundskeepers better maintain the pitch, it also means commentators are armed with more information for their broadcasts, and fans can glean additional insights. Speaking of which, the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy also heralds the arrival of the Speculur BatSense, an intelligent cricket accessory that features Intel's Curie technology. It mounts on to any cricket bat and generates rich data for every stroke played, covering parameters like back-lift, bat speed, and follow through. During the Champions Trophy, this stands to further add to the punditry arsenal, with a number of top players deploying the sensor. It might sound a bit superflous to all but the most diehard cricket enthusiast, but I saw it in action during the opening England vs Bangladesh match, and even as a casual fan, it genuinely enriched the experience – by which I mean, helped me make smarter bets. Better still, Speculur plans to launch a consumer version of the BatSense later in the year, so it stands to aid cricketers of all ability levels – a bit like the Zepp Golf 2 sensor does on the driving range. It'll be launching in Australia, India, the US and the UK in H2 2017, according to the company. Lastly, this year's tournament will see fans able to enjoy new VR experience on match days at Edgbaston and the Oval, where HMDs (head mounted displays) will allow punters to test their batting skills against virtual bowlers and even receive a mock score, in addition to various data on their strokes. If you want to see the new tech in action, the ICC Champions Trophy runs until June 18, and the latest ticketing info can be found here.

The activities focused on nutritional education for children to improve their height and health for the next generation, especially in rural areas. On May 27 around 900 students of Bình Khánh Primary School in HCM City’s Cần Giờ District received 3,600 free glasses of milk. Đặng Thái Bình, principal of the school, said donating milk is very useful for the school’s students because a large number are malnourished and stunting is very high. Many of them are children from poor and near-poor families, he said. The school’s teachers were also trained in nutrition education, he added. Three thousand glasses of milk were also provided to children attending Bay Vào Thế Giới (Fly into the World), a programme held in HCM City’s District 1 on May 28 by Mathnasium Việt Nam, which runs centres to teach maths to children. Another 40,000 glasses of milk were provided to students of 20 schools built nationwide under the Đèn Đom Đóm programme by FrieslandCampina Việt Nam since 2012. The activities, carried out by FrieslandCampina, are a part of its campaign called Drinking Milk- Exercising-Healthy, which has been expanded this year. The development and growth of a child is affected greatly by its daily diet, nutrition and exercise, according to the company. Quang Ninh to host int’l conference on sexual health The ninth Asia Pacific conference on reproductive and sexual health and rights (APCRSHP) will be held from November 27-30 in the northern province of Quang Ninh. The Vietnam Public Health Association (VPHA) announced the information at a press conference on June 2 in Hanoi, adding that it is the first time Vietnam host the biggest forum on reproductive and sexual health in the Asia – Pacific region. Young people will gather in the first day of the conference themed “Leave no one behind! Justice in sexual and reproductive health”. The days after, representatives will discuss issues, such as overcoming social, cultural and regional barriers; towards an economic order, strengthening the justice system, making good quality education and advancing justice and equality in sexual and reproductive health and rights.  The event is expected to welcome 1,500 representatives from over 40 countries and organisations, of whom some 200 researchers will be speakers. The conference will be the biggest sexual and reproductive health and rights dialogue to be viewed at different angles like culture, religious policy, healthcare system and education, said Dr. Le Vu Anh, President of VPHA. He added that as a host, Vietnam will introduce five typical solution models for sexual and reproductive health at the event. The conference will offer an opportunity for Vietnam’s health sector to introduce its achievement and exchange experience with other countries in region and the world, according to a representative of the country’s health ministry. Initiated by civil society organisations in 2001, the biennial APCRSHP has been held in the Philippines (twice), Thailand, India, Malaysia, China, Indonesia and Myanmar.  Deputy PM Dam urges reduction of hospital overcrowding in Ho Chi Minh City Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam worked with leaders of the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee to discuss solutions to reduce high-level hospital overcrowding as well as improve the quality of medical facilities. Speaking at the meeting, Deputy PM Dam appreciated the trial of health stations in Ho Chi Minh City as well as urged the managers to draw lessons and experience from this model. He asked relevant agencies to continue to invest more in infrastructure, equipment and human resources to meet the requirements of caring for people’s health. The Deputy PM called for more investors to promote their investment in the development of medical facilities towards the non-profit model. The trial of health facilities should ensure the proper function and tasks as well as service of medical facilities at the grass-roots level, added Deputy PM Dam. The City’s healthcare sector should create favourable conditons for medical facilities at the grass-roots level to create dossiers in managing and monitoring the health of all local people, noted the Deputy PM. Two overpasses near Tan Son Nhat airport ready this month Two overpasses at Truong Son Intersection and Nguyen Thai Son-Nguyen Kiem Roundabout can be partly opened to traffic late this month, helping ease chronic traffic congestion in Tan Son Nhat International Airport area. Work on the Y-shaped concrete overpass at Truong Son Intersection is being sped up so that it can be in place two months ahead of schedule, according to Urban Traffic Management No.1 under the HCMC Department of Transport. Its first bridge beams have just been installed after nearly four months of construction. Meanwhile, the N-shaped steel overpass at Nguyen Thai Son-Nguyen Kiem Roundabout has had the first bridge beams installed. Urban Traffic Management No.3 expected the first branch connecting Hoang Minh Giam and Nguyen Thai Son streets to be completed two months earlier than planned. Work on its second branch linking Nguyen Kiem and Hoang Minh Giam streets starts early this month. It is scheduled for completion in September. But work on the last branch from Nguyen Kiem to Nguyen Thai Son has been delayed by the longer-than-expected land compensation process for 30 affected households. The project is slated for completion at the end of this year. Another priority project is to construct two overpasses connecting Nguyen Van Cu Bridge and Vo Van Kiet Avenue. They may be opened to traffic later this month, reducing traffic congestion around the nearby intersection of Nguyen Van Cu and Tran Hung Dao streets. Two branches of Nguyen Van Cu will be in place by June 30 while the riverside road section and other construction items will be done by August 30, according to the Saigon River Tunnel Management Center. When the two exits are in place, they will directly link downtown districts 1 and 5 with districts 4, 7, and 8 to the south of the city. Nha Nam joins Children’s Book Festival Nha Nam Media and Publishing House will bring its new works to the Children’s Book Festival organized by Hanoi City’s Department of Information and Communication from June 1 to 7 at Hanoi book street on December 19 Street, adjacent to the Hanoi People’s Court and Ly Thuong Kiet Street in Hoan Kiem District. As part of the festival, Nha Nam in collaboration with the French Cultural Center L’Espace and the book club Sach oi mo ra (Open Book) will hold a meeting on literature called “La Fontaine in the eyes of children” at 3 p.m. on June 3 at L’Espace, 24 Trang Tien Street in Hanoi. During the festival, Nha Nam will bring young readers hundreds of new publications as well as promotional programs on the occasion of International Children’s Day (June 1). The event will also feature two noteworthy books, namely “A handbook for children’s safety” and “A handbook to teach courtesy for kids” written by artist Vu Tuan Anh and his companions. The author will exchange with and give autographs on his books to fans at Nha Nam book stall at the book street from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on June 4. Localities asked to be well prepared for coming rainy season Many mountainous localities suffered heavy losses from natural disasters in 2006 due to their failure to take account of forecast, prevention, monitoring, risk assessment and communication work, according to an official of the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.  Van Phu Chinh, head of the committee’s standing office, made the assessment at a meeting in Hanoi on June 1 that looked into natural disaster prevention and control in 18 mountainous provinces from the northern region to the central province of Ha Tinh. He noted in 2016, the mountainous areas were affected by 24 strong cold spells, four storms and follow-up floods, along with whirlwinds and hailstorms.  Up to 109 people were killed and went missing in these disasters while about 940 houses collapsed or washed away and 44,220 others were inundated, more than 134,000ha of rice and other crops were devastated. Natural calamities also killed 37,180 livestock and 127,530 poultry and damaged 56km of canals and ditches. Material damage exceeded 5.8 trillion VND (255.4 million USD), Chinh said. He blamed authorities at all levels, especially grass-roots level, for the problem, adding that their supervision activities are still lax. While there remain many obstacles in the resettlement of residents in vulnerable areas, the planning of residential areas has yet to take into account disaster risks. Communication activities to raise public awareness of flash floods in many mountainous provinces haven’t been effective. Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Hoang Van Thang, who is a deputy head of the central steering committee, said human and property damage caused by natural disasters in mountainous provinces remains a challenge for many years and haven’t been settled thoroughly as expected. Meanwhile, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Hoang Duc Cuong said the forecasting of natural disasters in mountainous areas, especially in the north, is flawed and hasn’t completely satisfied the growing demand in disaster prevention and control. To minimise human and property losses, the localities should be well-prepared in terms of leadership, forces, means and materials, and logistics. They also have to appropriately exploit natural resources to ensure sustainable socio-economic development, he added.  To respond to this year’s rainy season, the central steering committee ordered the provinces to review all residential areas and structures to locate flood- and landslide-prone areas while adamantly relocating households at risk.  It said they must devise flood response plans and pay special attention to communication methods to ensure all residents will be updated with disaster information. Rescue staff and vehicles also need to be geared up in case of emergencies.  Gia Lai ensures settlement for 3,000 nomad ethnic households Nearly 3,000 ethnic minority households have been resettled in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai thanks to the province’s efforts to complete more than 100 resettlement projects during 2013-2016. Over 52 billion VND (2.3 million USD) was splashed out on ten concentrated resettlement projects for more than 660 ethnic minority families. The money was used to level 24 hectares of land, reclaim 29 hectares of production land, construct 13,000 kilometres of road, ten electricity facilities and 21 water facilities and erect six community houses and seven classrooms. With efficient infrastructure and a production zone, H’Lang village in Chu R Cam commune, Krong Pa district is a standout resettlement area helping alleviate poverty among ethnic minorities. The village was established in 2012 with total investment of 11 billion VND (484,000 USD). Meanwhile, 94 alternative resettlement projects were carried out to benefit another 2,260 households. Nearly 60 billion VND (2.6 million USD) was spent to build 37 kilometres of roads, four water facilities, 12 community houses and four kindergartens.  Ta Chi Khanh, Vice Chairman of the Krong Pa district People’s Committee, said that ten alternative resettlement areas were built for more than 270 households and two concentrated resettlement zones were completed for some 500 families in the district.  The resettlement sites have adequate facilities for production, he said, adding that capital has been cut for some resettlement projects, posing challenges for the locality. More than 123 billion VND (5.4 million USD) was allocated to Gia Lai province to implement resettlement projects during 2013-2016.  According to the ethnicity board of the provincial People’s Council, resettlement projects are significant to ensure a stable life for minorities. Upgrades of infrastructure together with high-tech economic models have helped tackle poverty in the province. However, the board also stated drawbacks when carrying out the projects, with financial support lacking and disbursement of that support slow. Italy’s Republic Day marked in Hanoi The Vietnam – Italy Friendship Association organised a friendship exchange in Hanoi on June 1 to celebrate Italy’s 71st Republic Day (June 2, 1946 - 2017). Speaking at the event, Chairman of the association Nguyen Van Nam lauded Italy’s development and contributions to world peace and cooperation in the past 71 years, particularly as a founding and key member of the EU and a responsible member of the UN and many other multi-lateral organisations.  He said his association is proud to help strengthen the friendship between the two countries. He also praised the Hanoi University’s Faculty of Italian Studies, which is emerging as an Italian language and culture centre in Vietnam. Italian Ambassador to Vietnam Cecilia Piccioni said Vietnam and Italy are enjoying a fruitful period of their relationship, with cooperation opportunities opening up in defence and security. She said students, researchers and artists are ideal ambassadors of each nation. Quang Tri honours US invention prize winner High school student Pham Huy from Quang Tri province has won third prize in the robotics and intelligent machine category for a prosthetic arm designed for the disabled at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair 2017 in the US. He was honoured at a ceremony held in the locality by the provincial Department of Education and Training With a prosthetic arm designed for people with disabilities, Pham Huy’s work was one of the eight selected to attend the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair 2017 held in the US, eventualy winning third prize at the prestigious science competition.

All products for sale meet the Community Eco Market’s strict environmental policy, guaranteeing shoppers can purchase unique creations without straining their wallets or the earth’s resources, according to the organisers. They warned visitors to bring reusable bags or purchase an eco-friendly cloth bag at the market to ensure the market is single-use plastic free. The proceeds from the event will be donated to Education for Nature Vietnam, an organisation which investigates wildlife crimes in Vietnam. The market will open from 9am to 1pm at the Green Shoot International School at 414/7 Cua Dai Road.  Czech President to pay State visit to Vietnam President of the Czech Republic Milos Zeman will pay a State-level visit to Vietnam from June 6-8. The visit will be made at the invitation of President Tran Dai Quang, the Foreign Ministry announced on June 1. HCM City leader hosts Slovak Deputy Prime Minister Chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee Nguyen Thanh Phong has called on Slovak and Vietnamese businesses to step up their cooperation in such areas as chemical industry, electric equipment, food industry and tourism.  HCM City is willing to create the best possible conditions for Slovak firms to run long-term business in the locality, the official told visiting Slovak Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Robert Kaliňák on June 1.  Phong said Robert Kaliňák’s visit contributes to enhancing the fruitful time-honoured cooperation between Slovakia and Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh City as well.  He called on the Slovak Government to continue facilitating the Vietnamese’s integration into the Slovak society as well as their role of bridging the two countries.  Robert Kaliňák said he was impressed by achievements Vietnam has recorded over the past time, saying with a lot of similarities, the two countries can support each other in national construction and development.  The long-standing cooperation and friendship should be demonstrated through specific, effective economic projects and programmes, he said.  Slovakia stands ready to cooperate with Vietnam, including HCM City, in fields like machinery and tourism in order to turn the two sides’ potential into practical projects, thus contributing to tightening the bilateral ties. Quang Tri celebrates World Oceans Day with exhibition on islands The central province of Quang Tri marked World Oceans Day (June 8) on Cua Tung beach with the opening of a mobile exhibition on historical and legal evidence affirming Vietnam’s sovereignty over Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos. The exhibits include a large number of maps, documents and photos of different periods, which were collected by international and domestic researchers. The materials demonstrate Vietnam’s continuous exercise of sovereignty over and safeguarding of the archipelagos, rejecting China’s distorted versions of history. The same day, the province held a meeting in response to the World Oceans Day and the Vietnam Sea and Islands Week 2017. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Vice Chairman of Quang Tri People’s Committee Ha Sy Dong said the Vietnam sea and islands week, themed “for future of next generations”, sends out an appeal for communal efforts in protecting the marine environment. During the week, local authorities and agencies will hold communications campaigns on policies and laws on sea and islands, and the role and potential of sea and islands in national development. Thua Thien – Hue spends 5 billion VND to aid fishermen The central province of Thua Thien – Hue has released a decision to allocate more than 4.96 billion VND to assist fishermen in offshore fishing. Accordingly, Phu Vang district will receive over 4.2 billion VND (184,800) and Phu Dien 762 million VND (33,528 USD) to help local fishermen buy fuel for fishing trips, communications devices, and ship insurance. Meanwhile, under the Government’s Decree 67/2014/ND-CP on policies for fisheries development, the province in the past two years have provided preferential loans worth 177.49 billion VND (7.8 million USD) for the upgrade and building of 40 fishing vessels. In Phu Vang alone, 29 boat owners have gained approval for their applications seeking concessional loans for building and upgrading fishing boats under the decree. Can Tho prepares for APEC week on food security The Mekong city of Can Tho has finalised a coordination plan on the hosting of the APEC week on food security and high-level dialogue on food security and sustainable agriculture development in response to climate change. Addressing a meeting on June 1, Vice Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Dao Anh Dung asked the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to complete the plan to launch it in early June. He also stressed the need to strengthen communications and ensure security and safety for the event, while promoting the economic and tourism potential and strengths of the city. Within the framework of the events, about 14 workshops and conferences as well as bilateral meetings between leaders of Can Tho and ministers of some APEC members will take place from August 18-25. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will chair two major events, the APEC Week on Food Security and high-level dialogue on food security and sustainable agriculture development in response to climate change on August 21-25. The events are good chances for Can Tho to introduce the nation and people of Vietnam and Can Tho in particular to foreign friends. On the occasion, the Can Tho Centre for Trade Promotion-Investment and Exhibition will hold a safe farm produce fair from August 20-24 with about 300 booths to boost trade on the products. Denmark helps clear leftover ordnance in Thua Thien-Hue The People’s Committee of central Thua Thien-Hue province and the Danish Demining Group (DDG) signed a memorandum understanding on a project to minimize risks of ordnance left by the war in the province on June 1. The project is funded by the Embassy of Japan in Vietnam and the A.P Moller Support Foundation of Denmark with a total sum of about 1.2 million USD. The project will cover ten communes of A Luoi district and other prioritized areas as suggested by the provincial People’s Committee. It will survey bomb and mine pollution in the communes and launch activities to handle ordnance there. In addition to that, it will make further surveys to define and classify areas with ordnance, and assess post-demining impacts. The project will also help enhance capacity in information management and connecting plans of action in the province. The MoU also allows DDG and Thua Thien Hue to set up cooperative relations to settle leftover explosives from the war, contributing to improving safety to locals and socio-economic development in affected communities through the humanitarian mine action programme. Addressing the event, Vice Chairman of the provincial People’s Committee Nguyen Van Phuong thanked the Japan Embassy in Vietnam, the A.P Moller Support Foundation and the DDG for helping the province overcome the war aftermaths. He expressed his hope that activities of the project will be implemented effectively, benefiting localities’ people and socio-economic development. Workshop talks energy transition in connection with social equity The Central Institute for Economic Management (CIEM) and the German Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) foundation co-organized a workshop on energy transition in connection with social equity in Hanoi on June 1. The event is part of the FES’s comparative study on energy transition and social equity targeting eight Asian countries, including Vietnam. Deputy Director of the CIEM Nguyen Thi Tue Anh said apart from hydropower, renewable energy is little used in Vietnam. Meanwhile, the utilization of fossil fuels to develop industrial sectors and transport is increasing rapidly. Vietnam has built a number of programmes and policies to cope with climate change and develop the energy sector, she said, noting that energy transition could ensure social equity by increasing quality of energy services for everyone, generating jobs, modernizing industry, improving economic efficiency and growth, enhancing environmental quality, and mitigating climate change. Experts suggested Vietnam developing a new long-term energy vision to enhance the capacity of accessing energy and improve the efficiency of energy in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and striving toward using 100 percent of renewable energy. It is necessary to invest in energy storage capacity and the electricity grid, experts said, also stressing the need to enhance technical and financial transparency of State groups in the field of energy to ensure fair competition, raise productivity and benefit consumers more. Besides joining policy dialogues on energy development, Vietnam should devise fiscal policies and regulations to promote the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency, especially in remote and ethnic minority areas and labour-intensive sectors, as well as among women and low income earners. Creating playgrounds in urban area It would seem that children’s playgrounds are a ‘luxury’ in big cities, when all available areas are used either for trading or parking. But through their efforts, the Think Playgrounds group has called upon the community to create playgrounds, bringing joy to children. Since beginning operations 2 years ago, the group has built 60 playgrounds in many regions across the country. In the first few days of June, a new 300 metres square playground has been opened in Chuong Duong ward, Hoan Kiem district, Hanoi, with many games such as climbing system and swings. Nguyen Thanh Thuy in Phuc Tan Street, Hoan Kiem district, said “the playground is not very wide, but to us this is a very precious thing. For a long time, urban kids have lacked the space in which to play. During the summer vacation, their parents have to work and can’t always take them out. With the aim of helping children to stay away from social evils, many families have "detained" their children in the house, forcing them to make friends with television and play video games all day. With the playground, we worry much less". The playground at Lane 1, Vong Ha street, Chuong Duong ward is the result of a month of construction by the Think Playgrounds group’s members, with the financial support of the HealthBridge Foundation of Canada and the help of the local government. In large cities, the construction of children's playgrounds has not been properly addressed. Specifically, at some wards in Dong Da and Hoan Kiem districts, the population has risen by tens of thousands, but public spaces only cover several hundred square meters. The city is currently building more flower gardens and parks. However, the distance from home to the flower garden or the park is a barrier and not every child has a chance to go and enjoy them. With young kids, the playgrounds in residential areas are most accessible, but these playgrounds are always used for a variety of purposes, from sales and parking to badminton or adult football. Chu Kim Duc and Nguyen Tieu Quoc Dat, two members of the Think Playgrounds group, have long entertained the idea of creating spaces for children in the city. However the idea was only gradually turning into reality until they met Judith Hansen, a 70-year-old American visitor who holds a deep love for Vietnam. She has since helped the young people to create a playground, providing financial support. These young people formed the Think Playgrounds group. ‘Think Playgrounds’ formed their first playground for children of migrant workers or peddlers, who call the alluvial ground along the Hong River their home. The playground, which cost over VND10 million was open to the elation of the kids and their parents alike, who could now rest assured that their children would steer clear from perilous ‘water games’ in the river. As was the hope of the two founding members Kim Duc and Quoc Dat, the success of this playground has "awakened" the minds of many people. Such a shortage of outdoor play areas has left urban kids growing increasingly dependent on digital devices for leisurely activities, resulting in their imbalanced mental and physical growth as well as creating other issues. Acutely aware of such problems, many communities have sought to "reclaim" public space. However, the group members have encountered immense hurdles ‘reclaiming’ public land from illegal occupants, who generally would not return the plots to public use. Undaunted, these young people sought out help from local authorities and residents in the specific neighborhoods to talk the illegal occupants into giving the plots back to the public, for the group to build playgrounds on. Speaking about the activities of the group, Nguyen Tri Quoc Dat shared that the group operates under the social enterprise model, using revenue from the sale of playground designs to agencies, in order to maintain an income for the team members and raise funds to build the playground. The playground in the street is a bridge between social organisations, benefactors and communities who need to build a playground. Some organisations and businesses have made a great contribution in building their playgrounds, including HealthBridge, ACCD, or Hoang Vu enterprise. In addition, the group usually makes use of recycled materials and self-design and construction to ensure safety and sustainability. After more than three years of operation, the group has 11 members and has coordinated with other agencies and social organisations to successfully build 40 playgrounds in Hanoi. Not only in Hanoi, the group has also coordinated with social organisations and other volunteer groups to build more than 20 playgrounds in various localities, including remote and mountainous areas such as Ha Giang or Ly Son Island (Quang Ngai). Some playgrounds cost up to VND65 million, as with the new playground inaugurated in Chuong Duong ward. Through their activities, these young people have shown great effort and have managed to change public perceptions concerning the need for child entertainment. Hospitals in HCMC review kidney dialysis process After the medical incident killed seven dialysis patients in the northern province of Hoa Binh, health authority in Ho Chi Minh City asked hospitals to review the process. As per the department of Health’s document to facilities, medical staffs at the artificial kidney department in hospitals must follow the Ministry of Health’s guideline on dialysis process to ensure patients’ safety.  Deputy Head of the municipal Department of Health Dr. Tang Chi Thuong said that medical institutions providing kidney dialysis services are requested to review their technical process, examine patients’ health condition, clean and test all their equipment in accordance with instructions from the health ministry on kidney dialysis to avoid medical complications. After seven out of 18 kidney patients receiving dialysis at Hoa Binh Province General Hospital died of suspected anaphylactic shock and ten of them were sent to Hanoi-based Bach Mai Hospital for further treatment, hospitals in HCMC have reviewed dialysis techniques and process. Dr. Luong Hoang Liem of a hospital in Thu Duc District said that the hospital has checked all dialysis process on 130 patients and 10 other patients in its satellite infirmary in Binh Chieu Ward. However, the hospital transferred dialysis patients in the satellite hospital to Thu Duc Hospital five days ago for patients’ safety. Nephrology and dialysis medical experts said that anaphylactic shock complication is likely to happen in dialysis patients with low rate. Importantly, medical workers must early detect and provide timely treatment. Prior to the incident, a patient’s heart with kidney failure stopped beating on dialysis process in Hoa Binh Hospital.  Loan level for students lifted The Prime Minister decided to lift the loan for a student to VND1.5 million a month.   The Vietnam Bank for Social Policies said that from June 15, 2017, the maximum loan for a student will be VND1.5 million a month as per the circular 751. The rate increased by VND250,000 a student  for a month compared to the old level taking effect on January 9, 2016. The PM asked the Ministry of Investment and Planning to balance and pour capital to the bank as per the law. The bank is responsible for providing loan and recovering the debts. Exhibition on Paracel, Spratly archipelagos in Quảng Trị An exhibition showcasing evidence that affirms Việt Nam’s sovereignty over Hoàng Sa (Paracel) and Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelagos opened on June 1 in Quảng Trị Province’s Cửa Tùng Town. The exhibition, held to celebrate 2017 Việt Nam Seas and Islands Week, displays historical and legal evidence in the form of maps, documents and pictures, collected in Việt Nam and other countries. “The Việt Nam Seas and Islands Week themed, For Our Future, has significant meaning. It  conveys the message to people to join hands to protect the marine environment, to be aware of their responsibility in cleaning beaches and seas, and to not sacrifice the marine environment for economic gain,” said Deputy Chairman of Quảng Trị province’s People’s Committee, Hà Sỹ Đồng. “Seas and islands have an especially significant role in the cause of country’s establishment and protection as well as in the socio-economic, security, defence development strategy of the country. Therefore, for generations, Vietnamese people have been united together to protect the country,” said Đồng. It is also important to do awareness campaigns about the role, importance and potential of the seas and islands of Việt Nam in terms of protecting the nation, Đồng added. The exhibition, which opens till Sunday, displays historical evidence that affirms Việt Nam’s sovereignty, which will help other countries, including China, form a deeper understanding of Việt Nam’s history as well as the legitimate desire of Vietnamese people to protecting their territory and sovereignty. On the occasion, the central province asked all localities and their authorities to continue promulgating Việt Nam’s policy, stance and law on its seas and islands; and to strengthen communications regarding the historical and legal evidence that affirms its sovereignty over Hoàng Sa (Paracel) and Trường Sa (Spratly) archipelagos.

Southern fruit festival opens The southern fruit festival, the 13th of its kind, opened in Ho Chi Minh City on June 1, attracting visitors from far and wide.  Opening the event was a parade show with the participation of hundreds of artists and tens of carriages decorated with giant and striking fruits, and a fashion show “Vietnam – Endless Beauty” featuring typical cultures of the north, the central and the south.  Attracting crowds was a floating market where more than 40 boats sell 150 kinds of fruits such as guava, rambutan, durian, strawberry, custard apple, grapefruit and palm fruit, among others, at 20-30 percent off market prices.  Additionally, visitors could contemplate fruit creations by artisans during a fruit decoration art competition.  Throughout the festival lasting August 30, a number of activities will be held, including the ninth contest on southern delicious and safe fruits, the Asia food festival and folk games.  The organising board will partner with 40 hotels of four to five stars to offer fruit parties to guests and broadcast a video clip popularising the festival to visitors at home and abroad.  Speaking at the event, Director of the municipal Tourism Department Bui Ta Hoang Vu said the event is expected to promote tourism and develop signature tourist products in the city.  The festival is a joint effort among the municipal Tourism Department, Suoi Tien Cultural Theme Park and relevant departments and agencies.

Life is Strange is getting a sequel, but it might be getting a prequel too Intel’s Compute Card wants to keep devices smarter for longer By Alessandro Barbosa Posted on June 2, 2017 2 min read 1 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Pinterest Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Technology is advancing at a blistering pace, and as a result, it’s pretty easy for your shiny new tech of today to look a little less impressive tomorrow. Advances in processing and computing make devices obsolete pretty quickly, which is a problem when everything is being injected with some smart functionality. You wouldn’t want to replace your all-in-one PC two years after purchase, nor would you want to get a new fridge because its brain just isn’t ticking the way it used to. Intel’s Compute Card is attempting to solve those problems. Shown off again at Computex, the Intel Compute Card is essentially what the name implies. Intel has managed to squeeze a fully functioning PC into the space that a credit card sized power bank usually occupies, with the device interfacing over USB-C to slot into a number of devices. Intel showed off laptop shells, smart appliances, and large all-in-one monitor setups that simply required the card to operate. Slide it in, and you’re good to go with a fully functioning, Windows-powered device, albeit with some slight drawbacks. Given the size, Intel’s Compute Cards aren’t meant to set your world on fire when it comes to performance. But for the uses Intel is envisioning – Chromebooks, smart TVs and slower all-in-ones – they more than fit the bill. They start with anything from Celeron or Pentium processors with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and scale up to m5 and m5 processors with 128GB of storages. Intel expects the cards to cost anywhere between $140 and $450 depending on your specifications, which is a lot lower than you might expect from an electronic marvel of this size. Read  Asus, HP, and Lenovo to bring Windows 10 PCs based on smartphone technology Still, it needs adoption, and that’s where Intel might face the biggest hurdles. Manufacturers like Dell, Asus, MSI and more will need to get onboard with this new standard, but the idea of it all is promising. Intel expects each card to last as long as 10 years, but if all it takes is simply popping out the old one and replacing it, it’s an enticing offer for nearly every type of consumer.

Asus/Republic of Gamers Asus has announced a new gaming laptop called the ROG Zephyrus GX501. It’s the world’s slimmest portable gaming system, according to Republic of Gamers. It launches near the end of June and ships in July. The new ROG portable gaming system houses a 7th gen Intel Core i7 (Kaby Lake) processor and the latest Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics. It comes with Windows 10 Creators Update, which optimises gameplay by way of the all-new Windows Game Mode. The Zephyrus is considerably slimmer at 0.67 inches compared to Acer’s new Predator Triton 700 “ultra-thin” gaming laptop, which measures 0.74 inches. “The Zephyrus has a blade-inspired design, resulting in an ultra-slim and sleek profile that tapers from 17.9 mm down to just 16.9 mm at its thinnest point,” according to the Taiwanese multinational tech giant. “Its compact dimensions make it the world’s thinnest gaming laptop.” The 15.6-inch GX501 incorporates the Republic of Gamers’ exclusive Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) cooling system. The device’s Asus Aura RGB lighting effects are, of course, customisable. The 120 Hz panel has wide-view technology and support for Nvidia G-Sync and 100 percent sRGB color gamut. The new Asus gaming laptop situates its keyboard in front of the chassis for improved internal cooling and better positioning. Anti-ghosting keys ensure precise commands each and every time, even when up to two dozen keys are pressed all at once. Rounding out the keyboard features are the innovative touchpad, which is positioned to the right, and the 10-key functionality. The Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501 will be available to pre-order in the US and Canada starting June 27, with shipping to begin in July. The GX501VI variant starts at US$2,699 (AU$3,659) while the GX501VS model will be offered from US$2,299 (AU$3,119). According to Republic of Gamers, other configurations will be launched by region in the next few months.

At Newegg, one of the biggest online retailers in the US, AMD's whole 8C/16T range has benefitted from moderate pricing cuts, improving their price to performance ratios even further. To be clear, this is a retailer-lead cut rather than new pricing by AMD. In brief the US dollar price action is as bullet pointed below: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X down from $499.99 to $459.99 AMD Ryzen 7 1700X down from $399.99 to $349.99 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 down from $329.99 to $314.99 You can see above that Newegg is delivering greater price cuts to the more expensive 1700X and 1800X processors. The 1700X gets the biggest price cut of all with a full $50 chop. However, the Ryzen 7 1700 provides plenty of 8C/16T goodness with a lower 65W TDP, and comes with AMD's Wraith Spire RGB cooler in the box. Looking at the price adjustments, I'd guess that the cheapest Ryzen 7 was already easily outselling its more expensive brethren. The price cuts, which retailers are free to instigate without interference from AMD, provide a quick retort to Intel's recent launch of the Core-X Series processors. As a reminder, new Intel 'Extreme' processors within this kind of price range will include the 4C/8T Core i7 7740X, listed at $339, and the 6C/12T Core it-7800X, listed at $389. To purchase an Intel processor with 8C/16T you are looking at recommended pricing of $599. Of course Intel processors have their own particular strengths and at this price level the Core i7 7740X has broken several OC and benchmarking world records at Computex this week (scalping several Pi and Prime number calculation benchmarks, several 3DMark0X benchmarks, Geekbench, Cinebench and more). The current AMD Ryzen 7 discounts on Newegg aren't highlighted as time limited or on promotion, so hopefully we will see similar level cuts at other retailers, and here across the pond.

Posted by scaryjim - Fri 02 Jun 2017 11:43 afiretruck Wouldn't that just be something incredible, eh? 10 cores/20 threads, clock speeds comparable to a 1700 (if you believe the rumours), for $499? Interestingly, once you balance out the extra threads with the lower clock speed, I reckon you'd end up with a chip that has lower single threaded and similar multithreaded performance to an 1800X. It'd only really be worth the money if you *needed* the extra memory channels and PCIe lanes X399 is going to offer. That or if you want to overclock, but with the TDP at 125W already, you might be better off going for the 1700….? *shrug* However it falls out, it looks like it's going to be good value high core counts and lots of PCIe lanes all round. Competition is good, right? ;) Posted by MercutioUK - Fri 02 Jun 2017 11:50 afiretruck scaryjim Making pricing room so the low end threadripper CPUs can come in ~ $499, perhaps? Wouldn't that just be something incredible, eh? Well, I'm holding out on a purchase till X399 and threadripper launches, just to see what occurs. I have PCIe lane requirements (+ maybe cores+memory for PC test lab/virtuals) but… no way I'm paying what Intel are asking so it's this or Ryzen and be happy with it/throw some stuff in a second box. $499 for a low end threadripper would be kinda special.

Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from $800 billion in 2035 to $7 trillion by 2050. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same, Intel says. Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding. —Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Intel and Strategy Analytics suggest that Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and “cognitive surplus” it will unlock. The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector. The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues. —study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicle commercialization will gain steam by 2040—generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate $3 trillion in revenues, or 43% of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for $3.7 trillion in revenue, or nearly 55% of the total passenger economy. $200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than $234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. The Passenger Economy report was sponsored by Intel and developed by Strategy Analytics.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Did Samantha Power ask for American citizens to be “unmasked” in intelligence reports? posted at 6:41 pm on June 1, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES A leftover from yesterday that shouldn’t be missed. Thanks to Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intel Committee and the man who first raised suspicions about improper “unmasking” in March, subpoenas have been issued to three Obama-era officials. Two are natsec people — Susan Rice and John Brennan, both of whom might have had good cause to “unmask” the identities of Trump staffers in the course of reviewing intelligence reports. But the third was a surprise. It’s Samantha Power, formerly the U.S. ambassador to the UN. Why would she be caught up in an “unmasking” review? She’s a diplomat, not an intelligence specialist. “Unmasking” is the revealing in intelligence reports of the identities of Americans whose communications (or information about whom) have been “incidentally” intercepted during foreign-intelligence-collection operations. Of course, the fact that a subpoena demanding information is issued does not necessarily mean the information exists. Nevertheless, the issuance of a subpoena implies that the issuer has a good-faith basis to believe it does. On that score, it has previously been reported that the committee’s chairman, Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), has reviewed intelligence reporting and detected instances of unmasking. Were there to be information indicating that Ms. Power was involved in unmasking American identities in intelligence reports, significant questions would be raised. As ambassador to the U.N., Power, a long-time Obama adviser, held a diplomatic position. She was not an intelligence analyst. It is not immediately clear why the U.N. ambassador would be involved in the disclosure of American identities in intelligence reports — after the agencies that collected and analyzed the intelligence had decided such identities should be masked. “Unmaskings are supposed to be rare,” noted the Wall Street Journal in an editorial, “and if the mere ambassador to the U.N. could demand them, what privacy protection was the Obama White House really offering U.S. citizens?” Watch the report Fox News ran on this embedded below. At 2:00, James Rosen flags an unusual question that Trey Gowdy asked Brennan at a hearing recently: “Do you recall any U.S. ambassadors asking that names be unmasked?” Hmmmm. Brennan doesn’t give him a categorical “no” either. Double hmmmm. One big wrinkle, though. Technically, neither Power nor anyone else can “demand” that American citizens be “unmasked.” They can request it; the decision then falls to the NSA or FBI (whichever agency has the relevant surveillance transcript), which can deny the request if it has no obvious intelligence purpose. That is, if it’s true that Power was keeping tabs on Trump staffers, this scandal would be much bigger than her. It would implicate the NSA and/or the FBI in approving a dubious request, especially if, as Nunes has claimed, the “unmaskings” he saw had no obvious foreign intelligence rationale. There’s another possibility, though. Maybe, notwithstanding Gowdy’s question, Power’s not being looked at because she requested an “unmasking.” Maybe someone else in a more plausible natsec position requested it and the unmasked transcript somehow found its way into Power’s hands. Remember, one of Nunes’s complaints in March about the intelligence he’d seen was that unmasked material had been “widely disseminated” within the Obama administration. If even someone as far-flung from the IC as Power had gotten hold of the material, that might explain what he meant. Power may have been subpoenaed so that the committee can find out who was passing intelligence to whom once they’d received it, properly, from the NSA or FBI. Since we’re on the subject of improper sharing of intelligence, an intriguing report (also left over from yesterday) via John Crudele of the New York Post: The Justice Department has gotten a warrant from the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court — also known as the FISA court — to conduct electronic surveillance on a group of journalists who’ve been the recipient of leaked information, the source said. The journalists are not the target, according to my source — and I say, thank goodness for that. Instead, the Trump administration is looking for the leaker. Who could it be? Some in the administration are focusing on a retired, high-ranking military officer who held important posts in the intelligence service, according to the source. A retired, high-ranking former military officer who held important intelligence posts and is supposedly being fed info by “holdovers from the Obama administration” in the White House? That points to James Clapper or Michael Hayden, and Hayden didn’t serve in the Obama administration (except for a few weeks very early on while he was waiting to be replaced). Triple hmmmm.

Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles doubling as security cameras. Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as these cars can spot a specific license plate 'quite rapidly'. Scroll down for video  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles, such as Uber's models (pictured) doubling as security cameras INTEL'S TAKE ON SELF-DRIVING CARS  Brian Krzanich recently said in an interview that he foresees autonomous vehicles doubling as security cameras. Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as these cars will have the power to spot a specific license plat 'quite rapidly'. Intel also sponsored a study this month that discussed how passengers of autonomous vehicles will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. This means riders will be able to stream movies during their travels and surf the web – providing advertisers with new outlets for targeting ads. This will create a 'personal economy' sector that is said to be a $7 trillion business by 2050.  On Thursday, Krzanich spoke at the Code Conference in California, where he discussed the benefits of self-driving cars – other than reducing road accidents, CNBC reported. He also acknowledged the fact that using the vehicle's cameras to 'look' at license plates and other cars on the road could be intrusive on people's privacy. 'We'll have to put limitations on it,' he said. 'We'll have to encrypt that data and make sure I can't tell that it's John's [car] necessarily,' said Krzanich. 'I think there will be rules and new areas we'll have to explore, but the amount of social good that can come from that far outweighs those concerns.' 'We just have to deal with them.' The semiconductor manufacturer also sponsored a report written by researchers at Strategy Analytics, which discussed how passengers of these autonomous vehicles will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. The study, entitled 'Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy', has suggested that by 2050, passenger economy (services to fill the idle time while you ride in a self-driving car) will be a $7 trillion business.

The report shared that pilotless vehicles will free more than 250 million hours of consumers' commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. 'We'll have to put limitations on it,' said Krzanich (pictured) in the interview  'We'll have to encrypt that data and make sure I can't tell that it's John's [car] necessarily' Although many are concerned about privacy issues, the ability to have 'eyes' on the road could be beneficial during Amber alerts, as the cameras, like those used by Google's Waymo (pictured), can spot a specific license plate 'quite rapidly' This means riders will be able to stream movies during their travels and surf the web – providing advertisers with new outlets for targeting ads. The study has deemed mobility-as-a-services as the driving factor of the $7 trillion business. 'These mobility service providers will offer both on-demand and contract or subscription models that offer transportation as an amenity to their core retailing products or services,' the report reads. Intel sponsored a report that discussed how passengers will spend their time when they no longer have to keep their eyes on the road. The study has deemed mobility-as-a-services as the driving factor of the $7 trillion business called 'personal economy' 'They will compete with a rising tide of service providers from across a range of consumer industries, including web/internet and retailing powerhouses who offer transportation as amenities of their core product/service offerings.' 'Mobility services will be an element of the value proposition of an office building, apartment complex, university campus or home.'  Read more: Intel CEO Krzanich: Self-driving cars will double as security cameras newsroom.intel.c...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Unless you have a very good reason not to. And get a laptop with a SDD, or have one fitted from the shop you buy from .

But that architecture has not come to the laptop market yet. So I would probably stick to an intel chip for a laptop. I do have an AMD A10-5630 or something, and its fine, but I also have an intel i7-4620Q in my other laptop and that is far more powerful. simon14 1815 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 18 Trusted   Reply # 1763827 13-Apr-2017 14:13 Thanks guys,       Ideally looking for a laptop with good processor, 8gb ram and touch screen.

If the machine is low on RAM (4GB or less) it makes the whole machine faster as the swap file is on the SSD instead of a slow spinning disk.   128GB is fine for a SSD for a general machine for email, web, that kind of thing. My PC has a 128GB SSD, of which only 50GB is used, and that's with a LOT of stuff installed - Office, Photoshop, Development tools, etc, but no games.   AMD CPUs are probably fine for general use machines as well. @dazhann If you put up a link to the machines you'll get more advice.

A 7 year old i3 CPU gets 3600. However the AMD is about half as fast as my old i7 single threaded, so it's probably ok for general use. Complex web pages and multiple tabs might not be as fast as you'd like, but should be ok I think.

I'm also limited here in Hawkes Bay because other than Noels and Harvey, we don't have any physical computer stores to go to cash in hand. timmmay 12484 posts Uber Geek +1 received by user: 2008 Trusted Subscriber   Reply # 1793979 2-Jun-2017 21:26 The AMD should be fine.

The 360-degree folding touchscreen converts the Chromebook to a tablet experience. The built-in pen is designed for a natural drawing and writing experience enabling employees to remain productive no matter where they are. They can take notes with Google Keep or Squid, and sign digital documents with apps like DocuSign. You can also work offline with the Samsung Chromebook Pro to create and edit documents, spreadsheets and presentations, view PDFs and other locally stored files, and even reply to emails, which are then sent automatically when the device connects to Wi-Fi again. Security and easy device management at the core Like all Chromebooks, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is built with security in mind, from the time employees bootup and until they shut down. That means the Chromebook includes a tamper-proof Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and also Verified Boot feature, which helps ensure the device is running uncompromised software. Chrome OS also runs each browser tab and application in a sandboxed state to avoid malicious modification of the system software or other applications. User data is encrypted as well, helping to protect both your employee’s information as well as your company’s data. And automatic updates every six weeks help maintain the security of Chrome OS. IT admins can easily deploy and manage this new Chromebook from a centralized management console with more than 200 device policies. That means providing employees with the apps and services they need to get work done, and even pre-configuring network connections for them. The Samsung Chromebook Pro is available now in the U.S. for $549, with additional launch regions expected later. Learn more about the Samsung Chromebook Pro here and see how it can safely enable your business in a variety of uses or buy now through the Shop Chrome store.     Print       Email Published: 3 days ago on June 2, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: June 2, 2017 @ 7:14 am Filed Under: Business, Computer Technologies, Economics, English, Global Economy, Google, MIL OSI, MIL OSI Economics, Open Source Intel NEXT ARTICLE → Visualize data instantly with machine learning in Google Sheets ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE Post Disaster Needs Assessment and Disaster Recovery Framework Workshop for Thailand About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts Market Price of Important Means of Production in Circulation, May 21-30, 2017 Average Price of Food in 50 Cities, May 21-30, 2017 Fujitsu and SAP Expand Global Partnership Speech by CE at World Sustainable Built Environment Conference 2017 Hong Kong (English only) Residents urged to have their say on liveability of Shire © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

Following a quiz session which featured corporate teams, and a solo singing competition, it was time for a fascinating discussion on 'Careers - Many Pathways to Success'. On the panel was Raj Jain (CEO, BCCL), Saurabh Kumar (co-founder, Grofers), Warren Patrick (chief 'learning' officer and senior president, YES Bank), Debjani Ghosh (ex CEO, Intel) and Ritesh Agarwal (founder and CEO, OYO Rooms), with Swapan Seth acting as the eloquent moderator. So, what is success all about? Are there different paths to success? Is failure a necessary stopover on the road to success? And if you're a college dropout, do you have a better chance of being successful in life? "Success is about being grateful when you wake up every morning, for what you have, what you've done, and where you are. It's also the zeal and energy to make tomorrow better than today," shared Jain. Patrick felt success was the achievement of a goal, whether personal or professional, while Kumar believed if you're happy with what you are doing, then you are successful. For Agarwal, if what you're doing can create a positive impact around yourself, you've achieved success. "Success is a state of mind. It's a time when, and a place where, you feel good with where you are and what you have achieved, and you're ready to move on to the next level," said Ghosh, who quit as Intel CEO at the top of her game. As for yardsticks of success, they differ from person to person. "Acceptance and acknowledgment by your peers fuels your journey to success, a journey that is never-ending. And you keep raising the bar higher, each step along the way," said Patrick. Kumar believed how one defines success comes from within, while Agarwal felt that success is directly proportional to ambition. And what are the attributes of success? Well, topmost are the values and principles that one is taught, and embraces. Also, learning from people who have been there, done that. To these Agarwal added the spirit of contrarianism. "Whatever you do, do it differently to everyone else." Jain mentioned inquisitiveness and a desire to learn all the time. "I would love to be an Uber driver one day - it's such a fun life, doing what you want, when you want! "But there's also no substitute for good old hard work," added Jain. Still, in any conversation about success, failure cannot be too far behind. "Failure without deep reflection has no meaning. You have to learn from failure," Jain advised. According to Agarwal, failure is a stepping stone to success. "It should be considered a badge of honour!" Kumar believed every failure makes you a better person, but insisted it shouldn't be glamourised. "It should be a part of the journey - it's important to take learnings from failure." Patrick took the philosophical approach. "If you haven't experienced the darkness, you won't appreciate the light. If you haven't experienced failure, you won't taste the fruits of success." Failure is part and parcel of life, admitted Ghosh, adding that if success isn't fun, it isn't success at all. It's probably best to conclude by paraphrasing Rudyard Kipling: 'If you can meet with 'Success' and 'Failure' / And treat those two impostors just the same', then the sky truly is the limit.

Intel Predicts Autonomous Driving Will Spur New ‘Passenger Economy’ Worth US$7 Trillion Study Estimates the Value of Goods and Services in the Early Years of the ‘Passenger Economy’ Will Be More Than Twice the Size of the ‘Sharing Economy’ NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel predicts a new “Passenger Economy” will emerge to support the idle time when drivers become riders The economic opportunity will grow from US$800 billion to US$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream Mobility-as-a-Service will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations and usage A new study by Intel Corporation and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy," the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. (Graphic: Intel Corporation) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail June 01, 2017 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Intel Corporation revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. History has proven that technology is the catalyst for massive societal transformation and that businesses need to adapt or risk failure, or worse, extinction. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and cognitive surplus it will unlock. Read the Report: Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy “Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, today’s announcement is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge,” said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. “The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue. I am excited to partner with Intel, take this discussion on the road and look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to startups.” The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector,” said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. “The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues.” The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicles commercialization will gain steam by 2040 – generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate US$3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Here's what that means It's as fast as a turn-of-the-century supercomputer. By Rob Verger posted Jun 1st, 2017 at 1:26pm Intel's Core i9 Extreme Edition processor costs about $2,000. Intel Corporation Earlier this week in Taipei, Intel announced the most powerful desktop chip for consumers that it has ever sold. With 18 cores and a price tag of $1,999, the processor is known as a teraflop chip, meaning it can accomplish a trillion computational operations every second. Called the Core i9 Extreme Edition processor, the chip is not for the average computer user, someone who just wants to check email, read the news, and watch “House of Cards.” Instead, the processor is for people who want to do extreme stuff, like playing a game in 4K while simultaneously livestreaming it—oh, and also doing two other things at the same time. In a cute turn of phrase, Intel calls this “mega-tasking.” This is Intel’s first time making a consumer desktop chip that breaks the teraflop barrier, and Gregory Bryant, an Intel senior vice president, calls it “by far the most extreme desktop processor ever introduced.” From megaflops to teraflops to petaflops To get a sense of what a teraflop can do, it helps to know what FLOPS, a unit of computing speed, are. FLOPS stands for floating-point operation per second; one floating-point operation means taking two numbers that have a decimal point in them and doing some math on them, like multiplying them together. One teraflop is a trillion floating-point operations every second. “There was a time, when if someone said ‘teraflop,’” says Brandon Lucia, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, “you would expect them to be talking about a supercomputer that had many, many processor chips.” In fact, if you wind back the clock to 1976, the Cray-1 supercomputer could do just 160 megaflops (that’s a million FLOPS), meaning this singular new Intel chip is about 6,000 times as fast as that machine, says Steve Scott, a senior vice president and chief technology officer at Cray, Inc. The Cray-1. Cray Inc In the late 1990s and 2000s, supercomputers were still measured in teraflops, and an important machine called ASCI Red at Sandia National Laboratory reigned as the fastest machine in the world from 1997 to 2000. It could do over a teraflop. Today, these powerful machines are measured in petaflops (that’s a thousand trillion FLOPS). As just one example, Mira, the supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, is a 10-petaflop machine that has been used to model complex scenarios like a potential Ebola outbreak in the United States. “Supercomputing technologies have now filtered down into the consumer space,” Scott says. “If you can build a petaflop system for many millions of dollars, that means you can build 10 teraflop systems that companies or smaller organizations can afford to buy, or one teraflop systems that individual consumers can afford to buy.” When a chip like the new Intel processor is doing floating-point operations, the math is not done just for the sake of doing math—it’s the computation powering the software you’re running. “This isn’t just to make the computer into a calculator,” Lucia, of Carnegie Mellon, says. “Those floating point numbers represent the kind of important workloads that we care about, whether it’s video editing or virtual-reality environments.” In short: a powerful chip like this can make virtual reality, gaming, streaming 4K video, or video editing all go faster and more smoothly. A PlayStation 4 has a graphics processing unit that can do over a teraflop, if you’re keeping score at home. The Trinity supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Los Alamos National Laboratory Computer processors have cores The Intel chip boasts more cores than a rival processor called the “Threadripper,” which packs 16 cores and is made by AMD. The comparison gets pretty nebulous, however, unless you consider what a core actually does. Envision a supermarket checkout line, says Lucia. Let’s say there’s just one open register, and the cashier is checking out one customer at a time; that’s like a single-core chip. (And if you’re standing in that line with your bananas and ramen, you’re likely feeling frustrated.) Now imagine that 18 checkout lines are open, all of them staffed with cashiers who are checking customers through in parallel with each other. In this utopian scenario, everything moves much, much faster. That represents an 18-core processor. This new chip does even more than that, because it uses an Intel technology called hyper-threading, which means that each core can actually do two things at once. In our supermarket analogy, that’d be as if the store hired robots that could check out two people simultaneously in each of the 18 lines—now they’d be able to help 36 people a time. Similarly, this new Intel chip can actually do 36 tasks at once. So why would we want a chip like this? And all that matters because something like an interactive virtual-reality landscape places a huge demand on the processor. Sure, computers and processors already on the market can power, say, an Oculus Rift headset, but the idea behind a powerful chip like this is that it could do several intense things at once; it could also make for smoother interactions between people and computationally-demanding software. “We want to run these [intense programs] efficiently so that we can do things that are responsive and appear to react in realtime to our interactions with them,” Lucia says. “This is the direction that a lot of computing is going.” All of which means that not only can a chip like this power a virtual reality experience, it could also power other complex endeavors that require tons of computing heft—like simulating how a protein (a large molecule made up of amino acids) interacts with another protein. Intel hasn’t said when this chip will be available, but a company representative said that other chips in the same family (called the X-series) with fewer cores will be available in the next few weeks.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque    FACT CHECK: Did 17 Intel Agencies ‘All Agree’ Russia Influenced The Presidential Election? David Sivak 1:35 PM 06/01/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP During an interview Wednesday with the tech news outlet Recode, former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton discussed at length her belief that Russian interference in the 2016 election harmed her chances of winning. “Read the declassified report by the intelligence community that came out in early January,” said Clinton. “Seventeen agencies, all in agreement – which I know from my experience as a senator and secretary of state is hard to get – they concluded with ‘high confidence’ that the Russians ran an extensive information war against my campaign to influence voters in the election.” Verdict: False While the intelligence report she mentions does express ‘high confidence’ that Russia sought to undermine her campaign, it only represents the views of three agencies – the FBI, CIA and NSA. Clinton incorrectly claims this report shows consensus among 17 intelligence agencies. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper himself appeared in front of Congress and explicitly pushed back on the idea that “17 intelligence agencies agreed,” stating flatly that it was just three. Fact Check: The intelligence community is comprised of 17 civilian and military agencies including the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI). Another of these agencies – the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) – speaks on behalf of the intelligence community and orchestrated the January report. “The [intelligence community assessment] was a coordinated product from three agencies: CIA, NSA and the FBI, not all 17 components of the intelligence community,” said former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during a congressional hearing in May. “Those three under the aegis of my former office.” A handful of experienced analysts were chosen from the three agencies to investigate and draw independent conclusions. Each agency reached the same verdict about Russian interference. So while the DNI published the report as an intelligence community assessment, Clapper clarified at the hearing that the report reflects the views of those three agencies alone. In fact, when questioned by Democratic Senator Al Franken, Clapper resisted the notion that all 17 agencies had reached a consensus. Franken: The intelligence communities have concluded, all 17 of them, that Russia interfered with this election. And we all know how that’s right. Clapper: Senator, as I pointed out in my statement, Senator Franken, it was- there were only three agencies that directly involved in this assessment plus my office. Franken: But all 17 signed on to that? Clapper: Well, we didn’t go through that process. This was a special situation because of the time limits and […] the sensitivity of the information, we decided – it was a conscious judgment – to restrict it to those three. I’m not aware of anyone who dissented, or disagreed when it came out. DHS published a joint statement with the DNI back in October expressing the same verdict about Russian interference, so it’s fair to say a handful of agencies have publicly drawn conclusions. But simply because the DNI speaks for the intelligence community as a whole doesn’t mean all 17 agencies reached independent conclusions, let alone conducted independent investigations.

Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Get Flash to see this player. Zenith Extreme and Rampage VI Extreme lead the way for AMD and Intel chipsets. Asus has gone to town on high-end consumer motherboards. We say this because the company has loaded the proverbial kitchen sink on its premier AMD and Intel offerings. Starting off with AMD, Asus is one of the few guys to produce the X399 chipset reserved for the upcoming 'Threadripper' CPU. The Zenith Extreme features premium components all round - integrated OLED screen, Aura Sync lighting, 802.11ad WiFi, RGB strips, and 10Gbe Ethernet - and should be available as soon as Threadripper launches in the summer. Arguably, the X299 Rampage VI Extreme is even more out there, but we won't spoil the surprises until you watch Jonathan from Asus give you the rundown in the video above. Tempted by either ultra-premium platforms?

The PCIe V3.0 lane count is the killer feature and it is going to be NVMe that chews it up. Fair enough the gaming and graphics enthusiasts will be lapping up the dual and perhaps triple x16 V3.0 potential but the slowest part of any PC / Workstation will always be the storage and with ThreadRipper we can potentially start thinking about hitting 10Gb/s in the very near future without the need for a crazily expensive HBA or RAID cards. 2 x Samsung 960 Pros in RAID 0 will be hitting 5Gbs, what will 4 give us? :) - Throw in quad channel to keep the beast fed from a memory perspective and it is beginning to feel like the late 90's and early 00's when the CPU's and platforms were getting some real design and innovation. AMD has completely caught Intel offside with their pricing / PCIe lane restrictions. I was looking at getting a Ryzen 7 + an Asus Sabertooth X370 but now will save a bit more and wait till Oct and build myself a monster 16C, 64GB Ram, 2TB Nvme, 18TB HDD, Vega, watercool the lot and then load up Win 10 Pro, Centos 7 and for giggles OS/2 in its latest Arca Noae 5.0 (Blue Lion) guise.

Then take a look at the components system integrators are employing in their latest builds. With the goal of selling as many PCs as possible, the best boutique builders keep their finger on the pulse and utilise hardware that is favoured by many and easy to work with. Cyberpower has been around long enough to identify current trends. Originally founded in the US and now serving UK customers from a Gateshead HQ, Cyberpower promises "the most up to date hardware for your needs" and has sent in the £1,999 Infinity X77 Titanium for evaluation. Designed with gaming in mind, this enthusiast base unit immediately catches the eye courtesy of a Cooler Master MasterCase Pro 5 Nvidia Edition chassis. We're quite fond of the MasterCase aesthetic, and the GeForce makeover works surprisingly well as the green-and-grey accents add extra interest without overstepping the mark. Build quality is good throughout, with Cyberpower doing a decent job of cable management and overall tidiness, but what's telling is that Intel and Nvidia's stranglehold on high-end PCs appears unbreakable. AMD ought to be back in the race with its competitive Ryzen CPUs, yet Core i7 and GeForce GTX continue to rule the roost - we've yet to hear from a single vendor who is eager to send in a Ryzen PC for review. Multi-threaded goodness obviously isn't a high priority for gaming machines, and Intel's lead in IPC keeps the latest-generation Core i7 'Kaby Lake' at the top of most users' wish list. Sticking with the tried-and-trusted, Cyberpower straps a Core i7-7700K to a Cooler Master MasterLiquid 120 cooler and overclocks the chip to 4.7GHz across all cores. Accompanying the CPU is 16GB (2x8GB) of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4-3000 memory on an MSI Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon motherboard outfitted with a liquid-cooled MSI GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Sea Hawk graphics card. No major surprises thus far, though Cyberpower does try something different with regards to storage. Rather than adopt the usual SSD primary, HDD secondary configuration, the Infinity X77 Titanium comes equipped with a 3TB Seagate Barracuda hard disk and a speed injection courtesy of a 16GB Intel Optane M.2 accelerator. A 600W Cooler Master MasterWatt Lite PSU is par for the course at this price point, as is a DVD writer and a clean 64-bit install of Windows 10, though it's nice to see Cyberpower employ a sleeved set of green Phanteks extension cables to maintain the overall theme. The default component selection makes sense, and though there's plenty of choice for customisation using the online configurator, we don't see any obvious reason to make changes at first glance. The question for enthusiasts is why buy a pre-built machine when you can buy all of the aforementioned components for roughly £1,850? Well, for an additional £150 premium, Cyberpower takes away the guesswork, guarantees a 4.7GHz overclock and backs the machine with a three-year warranty that includes two years of parts cover as standard. Tempted? Then let's see what the benchmarks have to say.

Intel Predicts Autonomous Driving Will Spur New ‘Passenger Economy’ Worth US$7 Trillion Study Estimates the Value of Goods and Services in the Early Years of the ‘Passenger Economy’ Will Be More Than Twice the Size of the ‘Sharing Economy’ NEWS HIGHLIGHTS Intel predicts a new “Passenger Economy” will emerge to support the idle time when drivers become riders The economic opportunity will grow from US$800 billion to US$7 trillion as autonomous vehicles become mainstream Mobility-as-a-Service will disrupt long-held patterns of car ownership, maintenance, operations and usage A new study by Intel Corporation and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy," the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. (Graphic: Intel Corporation) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail June 01, 2017 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Intel Corporation revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realized economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the “Passenger Economy” by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from US$800 billion in 2035 to US$7 trillion by 2050. History has proven that technology is the catalyst for massive societal transformation and that businesses need to adapt or risk failure, or worse, extinction. New digital business models ushered in by personal computing, the internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same. “Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” Autonomous driving and smart city technologies will enable the new Passenger Economy, gradually reconfiguring entire industries and inventing new ones thanks to the time and cognitive surplus it will unlock. Read the Report: Accelerating the Future: The Economic Impact of the Emerging Passenger Economy “Not unlike the space race of the 1960s, today’s announcement is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge,” said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. “The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue. I am excited to partner with Intel, take this discussion on the road and look at solutions through the lens of the diverse industries that will shape our future – from automakers to investors and policy makers to startups.” The new report frames the value of the economic opportunity through both a consumer and business lens and begins to build use cases designed to enable decision-makers to develop actionable change strategies. Press Kit: Autonomous Driving at Intel “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector,” said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. “The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues.” The research firm further points out that autonomously operated vehicles commercialization will gain steam by 2040 – generating an increasingly large share of the projected value and heralding the emergence of instantaneously personalized services. Key report highlights include: Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate US$3 trillion in revenues, or 43 percent of the total passenger economy. Consumer use of Mobility-as-a-Service offerings is expected to account for US$3.7 trillion in revenue or nearly 55 percent of the total passenger economy. US$200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of new innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services expand and evolve. Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of the Passenger Economy from 2035 to 2045. Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than US$234 billion over the Passenger Economy era from 2035-2045. Highlights of future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard beauty salons to touch-screen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile healthcare clinics and treatment pods, and even platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: Location-based advertising will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers and agencies will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for presenting content brands and location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, office buildings, apartment complexes, university campuses and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Andrew Grove served as chairman and CEO of Intel at different points during his career, and he had a famous philosophy about why the two jobs were separate. “Is a company a sandbox for the CEO, or is the CEO an employee? If he’s an employee, he needs a boss, and that boss is the board,” Grove, who died in 2010, once said. “The chairman runs the board. How can the CEO be his own boss?” Facebook’s stockholders will have to answer those questions about chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg at today’s annual meeting. Four Facebook investors, joined by the consumer watchdog group SumOfUs, have put forth a proposal which would “require the Chair of the Board to be an independent member of the Board.” The measure is included as part of Facebook’s proxy statement. “We believe the combination of these two roles in a single person weakens a corporation’s governance,” the shareholder statement reads. The group’s main problem with Zuckerberg’s monopoly involves an independent committee’s decision last year to alter Facebook’s stock structure.  Every stockholder in Facebook — including Zuckerberg — received two new shares of so-called “Class C” stock for every existing share. The new stock had no value—its sole purpose was to create new shares that Zuckerberg can sell off in order to fulfill his promise of giving away 99 percent of his Facebook shares to charity. What’s more, Zuckerberg’s ownership stake in Facebook is not affected, no matter how much Class C stock is sold off—he still has voting control over the company’s board. As The New York Times reported, “(The deal) ensures that Mr. Zuckerberg will have lifetime control over Facebook.” Marc Andreessen. Kimberly White/Getty Images What makes the deal even more ethically dubious is that one member of the “independent” committee which approved the stock split, entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, texted Zuckerberg with updates during deliberations. These actions have affected the company’s stock market standing—the advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has given Facebook a corporate governance score of 10 (the highest level of risk). SumOfUs is using all of this as ammunition—last week the group sent a letter to all Facebook shareholders urging them to vote for an independent chair. “We believe that independent oversight of management would improve the ability of the Facebook board to support Facebook executives as they formulate appropriate responses to these challenges,” the letter reads. For its part, Facebook’s board of directors is lobbying members to vote against the SumOfUs proposal. “Forcing a division between our Chairman and our CEO could harm our performance and be detrimental to interests of our stockholders,” their response reads. “Mr. Zuckerberg, as our founder, has guided us from inception and is invested in our success. We do not believe that requiring the Chairman to be independent will provide appreciably better direction and performance, and instead could cause uncertainty, confusion and inefficiency in board and management function and relations.” This is not the first time SumOfUs has fought Facebook—last year, it was among 80 organizations which accused the social media giant of “racially biased” post moderation. Among the other proposals which will be voted on at the annual meeting is a request for Facebook to compile a report assessing its role in spreading fake news. The board is also opposing this measure, calling it “unnecessary.” SEE ALSO: Facebook Spaces Changes Reality for VR Entrepreneurs Business & Technology Observer Delivered to Your Inbox Sign Up Submit Must Reads Observer Politics Entertainment Lifestyle Arts Health Contact About Newsletters Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP We noticed you're using an ad blocker.

News & Analysis Nvidia CEO Says Moores Law Is Dead Alan Patterson 6/1/2017 12:01 PM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet TAIPEI — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has become the first head of a major semiconductor company to say what academics have been suggesting for some time: Moore’s Law is dead. Moore’s Law, named after Intel cofounder Gordon Moore, reflects his observation in 1965 that transistors were shrinking so fast that every year twice as many could fit onto the same surface of a semiconductor. In 1975, the pace shifted to a doubling every two years. The enablers of an architectural advance every generation — increasing the size of pipelines, using superscalar tweaks and speculative execution — are among the techniques that are now lagging in the effort to keep pace with the expected 50 percent increase in transistor density each year, Huang told a gathering of reporters and analysts at the Computex show in Taipei. “Microprocessors no longer scale at the level of performance they used to — the end of what you would call Moore’s Law,” Huang said. “Semiconductor physics prevents us from taking Dennard scaling any further.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang notes the divergence between semiconductor technology and microprocessor performance at Taipeis Computex show. Dennard scaling, also known as MOSFET scaling, is based on a 1974 paper co-authored by Robert H. Dennard, after whom it is named. Originally formulated for MOSFETs, it states, roughly, that as transistors get smaller their power density stays constant, so that power use stays in proportion with area. The diminishing returns from Moore’s Law and Dennard scaling have seen the semiconductor industry enter a mature stage in which just a handful of chipmakers can afford the multibillion dollar investments required to push the process technology forward. By now, only a few chip designers have the deep pockets to double down on fabricating silicon at the 16nm and 14nm nodes, design rules where the distinction has become increasingly blurred. That stagnation in the progress of technology has also led to rapid industry consolidation in recent years that’s resulted in a flurry of multi-billion dollar mergers and acquisitions. Nvidia’s Huang predicts further advances to come from GPU computing. Even so, Huang suggested a modus vivendi for the semiconductor industry that plays into graphics processors, the products that Nvidia expects will enable continuing advances for years to come. Deep learning will use the processing power of GPUs that Nvidia makes as part of a new architecture that will take the company into artificial intelligence, outside the computer gaming business Nvidia has dominated, according to Huang. The semiconductor industry is exploring a number of pathways beyond Moore’s Law. Some upstart Chinese chipmakers are taking a stake in Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator FD-SOI.  Others see a future in going beyond planar design to three-dimensional chips. Nvidia’s bet on artificial intelligence to take the silicon industry forward is bullish, according to Randy Abrams, an analyst with Credit Suisse in Taipei. Nvidia has highlighted its Volta GPU on 12nm at an 815mm die size, taking up the same surface area as 7 iPhone processors, and connected to 16GB of high bandwidth memory using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s (TSMC) silicon interposer technology. A configuration of eight of these chips in Nvidia’s DGX-1 deep learning / high performance computing machine sells for $149,000. NVIDIA’s data center business has grown 186 percent annually to a $1.7 billion run-rate in the recent quarter, Abrams said. That chunk of business is worth $500 million to TSMC, or about 1.5 percent of its total revenue. AI will need more time to offset mobile as a major driver, Abrams said. —Alan Patterson covers the semiconductor industry for EE Times. He is based in Taiwan.

Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Rookie lots of mixed messages, Moores Law is alive and well IraRal   6/2/2017 2:46:52 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate This guy is really ful of mixed messages. Let's start with his first quote: "Microprocessors no longer scale at the level of performance they used to — the end of what you would call Moore's Law," Moore's law was never about anything but economics and transistor density. With that in mind, Moore's Law is actually doing better than ever. Intel's 10nm is bumping against the 100 million transistors per square millimeter and with Bohr's recent interview at Semicondcutor Engineering he suggested that their 7nm node will retain a consistent 0.7x scaling which would put them at over 200 million transistors per square millimeter. Since Nvidia uses TSMC, despite their silly node naming, they are well well behind with respect to desnity. But nonetheless Moore's Law is still alive and better than ever. Let's use Nvidia's very own flagship AI product: their new V100 which is manufactured on TSMC's "12nm FFN" (which is obsucation for their 16nm FinFET which it in itself just their 20nm BEOL with a planar switched to FinFET to get better power reduction). It has 21B transistors on a 815 mm²  die. Given TSMC's reticle limit is around 832mm² (roughly 32mm by 26mm), it's very clear Mr. Huang is in desperate need for more of Moore's Law. The problem is exacerbated when you take into account the power and heat limits. Calling the law dead is premature given Nvidia insatiable appetite for more transistors. I do understand that he is trying to call for a paradigm shift since our traditional performance enablers (logic techniques, NOT Moore's Law!) running out of steam and we need to look into smarter utilization of our available resources but he is not saying that and his products are not exactly any different than how they've always improved - through Moore's Law enablement. Since the author decided to mention the 1975 paper, it's worth noting that Gordon Moore himself coined the term "circuit and device cleverness" in that very paper suggesting that cleaver use of the higher transistor density will be necessary along with scaling to improve products.

Here's what you can expect when the first Alloy-based headsets go on sale later this year. In one corner of a guest room at the Hyatt Regency in Santa Clara, Calif., there's a spinning tower of molten metal that will spew across the bed if you put your finger in it. But you won't be able to see it unless you're wearing a "mixed reality" headset like Intel's Project Alloy. First announced last August, Project Alloy is a reference design for an untethered headset that can display a virtual world with elements from your physical environment mixed in. At the Santa Clara Hyatt this week, Intel showed off Alloy's latest iteration, a headset that looks vaguely like the Sony PlayStation VR but is completely wireless, so you can roam around the physical world with nothing to trip over. When you first put the headset on, you're immediately transported into an intriguing hybrid of the physical and virtual worlds. While Microsoft's HoloLens or Qualcomm's augmented reality glasses superimpose computer-rendered objects on your normal field of view, with Alloy you initially feel as if you're wearing a traditional VR headset like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. You're completely immersed in the virtual world, until you step close enough to a physical object—a hotel bed, for example—which will materialize in the virtual world as if it was magic. It isn't magic, of course. You can see the bed thanks to Alloy's RealSense camera, which is capable of depth perception, 3D imaging, interior mapping, and object tracking. The data is fed back not to a high-powered gaming PC or PlayStation, as is the case with Oculus or Sony, but instead to a CPU and graphics card contained within the headset. Intel designed the hotel room demo with fairly high filtering of the physical world so you didn't see real objects unless they were about 2 feet in front of you. That distance perfectly demonstrated what is perhaps Alloy's most ground-breaking feature: you can see your hands and the rest of your body in the virtual world, and software developers can design interactive elements that respond not to electronic inputs from controllers like the Oculus Touch, but from your actual hands. The end result was that you could touch the spinning tower of metal with a pointer finger and it would immediately deform, with molten droplets flying everywhere. (If you're less adventurous, you also could have also held a pen or other physical object and used it to interact with the spinning tower). In theory, this opens up augmented reality to a host of non-video game applications that would be awkward or impossible with glasses like the HoloLens or regular VR headsets like the HTC Vive. For instance, surgeons could fire up an immersive simulation of a patient in an operating theater, using their hands to interact with virtual scalpels and other tools. There are a few downsides, however. Perhaps the most obvious is the development time required to devise realistic-looking virtual worlds that respond to motion-tracking inputs. Creating virtual objects for a HoloLens app is remarkably simple using the Unity game engine, and you're not necessarily worried about their realism because users will expect them to look rudimentary compared to objects from the physical world that they can see through the lens. But with Alloy, hands, feet, and other physical objects are intruders in an otherwise virtual world, and the less realistic that world looks, the less time viewers will want to spend in it. Unfortunately, the Alloy demo in the hotel room definitely looked cheap. Everything virtual, from the spinning metal tower to a deformable blob on the other side of the room, was pixelated. There was a static snow effect that covered the display, likely a result of the RealSense cameras picking up light disturbances. And the borders of everything physical—like hands, shoes, or the bed—were jagged, as if they had been badly Photoshopped. Intel can't be faulted for all of this mediocrity, since Project Alloy is simply a reference design for other companies to emulate. The content for Alloy-based headsets, which could go on sale by the end of the year, will almost certainly get better over time. And Intel has rapidly improved the hardware since Alloy was announced—there's now an Intel Core i7 inside instead of an M-series processor, and the number of RealSense cameras has been shaved from three to two in order to improve efficiency and battery life. The fact remains, however, that the industry is a long way off from realizing the full potential of something like Project Alloy. Even Intel, which has pivoted away from desktop and server chips to become one of the VR industry's biggest cheerleaders, readily admits that there is a long road ahead. "I think that we are on this verge of something exciting about to happen, and yet virtual reality has been there before, where it didn't live up to its promises," Achin Bhowmik, Intel's general manager of perceptive computing, said at the Augmented World Expo here in Santa Clara on Wednesday. "There's a lot of work for us to do."

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun JERUSALEM Mobileye (MBLY.N), a maker of driverless vehicle technologies, reported a jump in quarterly profit that topped estimates, boosted by higher sales of its advanced driver assisted systems. The Israeli-based company, which is in the process of being acquired by Intel Corp (INTC.O), said on Thursday it earned 25 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the first quarter, up from 15 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 66 percent to $124.7 million. Mobileye was forecast to have earned 24 cents on revenue of $118.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it posted new advanced driver system wins, forged alliances with new partners and moved forward with its proprietary high-definition mapping project by signing definitive collaboration deals with several major automakers. In March, Intel agreed to buy Mobileye, which develops camera-based systems to help drivers avoid collisions, for $15.3 billion in a deal that promises to escalate the arms race among the world's carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. In light of the pending transaction, Mobileye said it would not hold an earnings conference call and will not provide and outlook for its financial results for future period. Nissan (7201.T), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) have already signed up to share data from Mobileye's camera-equipped advanced driver assistance systems to generate HD maps for self-driving cars, and Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua has said four more manufacturers were in talks about joining the program.

Intel fought back with its new Core X-Series announcement and the new $1999 flagship CPU with Core i9-7980XE.     AMD might not have a consumer CPU with 18C/36T, but it will be offering 16C/32T with their flagship ThreadRipper 1998X processor. Interestingly, AMD has nailed the TDP on ThreadRipper where they're offering far superior TDP numbers on their processors. For example, Intel's new 6C/12T right up to the 10C/20T have 140W TDPs, while AMD sips 125W. It's only 15W, but traditionally it has been Intel that has superior TDP numbers.     There will be 9 different Ryzen ThreadRipper CPUs in total, with the 'X' models featuring XFR (Extended Frequency Range), which allows the ThreadRipper CPUs to scale their clock speeds past the traditional boost clocks, and it scales the CPU clocks with cooling. So if you have air cooling, you'll hit a certain frequency, but AIO water cooling and LN2 setups will benefit more with XFR.     AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper CPUs   16C/32T   ThreadRipper 1998X: 3.5/3.9GHz, XFR, 155W ThreadRipper 1998: 3.2/3.6GHz, 155W   14C/28T   ThreadRipper 1977X: 3.5/4.0GHz, XFR, 155W ThreadRipper 1977: 3.2/3.7GHz, 155W   12C/24T   ThreadRipper 1976X: 3.6/4.0GHz, XFR, 125W ThreadRipper 1956X: 3.2/3.8GHz, XFR, 125W ThreadRipper 1956: 3.0/3.7GHz 125W   10C/20T   ThreadRipper 1955: 3.1/3.7GHz, 125W ThreadRipper 1995X: 3.6/4.0GHz, 125W NEWS SOURCES:Zdnet4.cbsistatic.com >> NEXT STORY: Pokemon Company profits soar by 2400% << PREVIOUS STORY: Intel Core i9-7900X @ 5.7GHz on LN2, sets world records Related Tags AMD Computex 2017 ThreadRipper AMD ThreadRipper 16C/32T Intel Subscribe to our Newsletter Latest News Posts AMD Radeon RX series cards are hard to buy right now New iPhone 8 rumors leak from trusted source Huawei to unveil the Honor 9 on June 12 ASRock delivers with an X299 mITX motherboard GDDR6 arrives in early 2018, GDDR5X hits 16GbpsView More News Posts Forum Activity Z97 Extreme won't go past BIOS - dead mobo?? i have a very problem,help please ASRock C2550D41 Stuck Booting Up Amped Wireless Helios-EX AC2200 Range Extender Review z68x-ud3-b3 REVIVED?

MSI X299 SLI Plus is ready for heavy lifting by Eric Born  9:30 AM on May 31, 2017 Nothing shakes up the hardware market quite like a processor launch. In advance of Intel's Core X-series processors, manufacturers have been keeping us busy with a rapid-fire succession of new X299 motherboards. In addition to the slate of boards announced yesterday, MSI has another variant to add to the mix: the X299 SLI Plus. The X299 SLI Plus is a spacious ATX motherboard designed for systems that need a lot of memory and even more GPU horsepower. Builders can populate the board's eight memory slots with up to 128GB of quad-channel DDR4 RAM. MSI claims that the motherboard's optimized traces and isolated memory circuits help ensure stable memory performance even at high frequencies.  As users may well be loading up the board with heavy graphics cards, MSI used steel to reinforce the PCI-e slots. Other niceties include titanium chokes and ESD protection around the mounting holes. In the storage department, there are dual M.2 slots with support for Intel's Optane memory, along with a U.2 connector and eight SATA ports. The board also ships with a cooling solution for one of the M.2 slots. The rear I/O panel provides further connectivity with a USB 3.1 Type-C port and nine previous-generation USB connectors. Ethernet connections come courtesy of dual Intel Ethernet adapters, while audio services are provided by a Realtek ALC12220 codec. As with many of our other motherboard announcements this week, we don't have information on pricing and availability. Do expect manufacturers to get these products onto shelves in time to be purchased alongside Intel's Core X processors, though.

EK Fluid Gaming kits make custom loops easier and cheaper by Wayne Manion  4:00 PM on May 31, 2017 Liquid-cooled PC components are all the rage these days, and custom open-loop setups have the highest cool factor in both senses of the word. Those full-bore systems with their discrete pumps, reservoirs, and CNC-machined copper waterblocks tend to be much pricier than their all-in-one siblings, though. EK Waterblocks' Fluid Gaming line of open-loop kits wants to put custom liquid-cooling gear within the fiduciary capabilities of more gamers. There are three different kits: one with a universal CPU waterblock and a 120-mm radiator, a set with a CPU block and a 240-mm radiator, and finally one with both CPU and GPU waterblocks and a 240-mm radiator. Aluminum parts are generally frowned upon in open-loop liquid-cooling setups owing to their position close to the top of the metal reactivity series. Mixing parts made of aluminum and less-reactive metals in the same loop is usually a bad idea since it makes the aluminum vulnerable to corrosion. EK's solution is to offer complete kits with aluminum radiators, waterblocks, and fittings, along with an aluminum-compatible reservoir-and-pump unit. It's worth noting that AIO makers are free to use aluminum because they have complete control over the composition of the metals and the liquid. EK says the radiators have dense fin arrays and a profile less than 1.1" (28 mm) thick, and has branded them with an EK-Alustream label. The EK-Supremacy AX CPU block is made from CNC-machined aluminum and fits Intel sockets with 1150 to 2011 pins, as well as AMD's AM4 socket. The company didn't mention Intel's shiny new LGA 2066 socket, though LGA 2011 coolers should be compatible. Support for AMD's upcoming Threadripper TR4 socket seems unlikely without some kind of upgrade kit. Gerbils clinging to Core 2 Quad and AMD FX CPUs need to look elsewhere. The top-of-the-line kit includes an EK-AC GeForce GTX Pascal aluminum water block designed for use with GeForce GTX 1060, 1070, 1080, and 1080 Ti cards, as well as the Titan X Pascal and the Titan Xp. EK said that a Vega-compatible kit will be offered in the future, though it made no mention of other Radeons. Owners of cards based on non-reference PCBs might want to do a little investigation before clicking any "buy" buttons. All the fans in the kits are EK Vardar models, and the included pump-and-reservoir is an SPC-series unit. Standard gear for all the kits includes transparent flexible tubing EK-ACF aluminum fittings, EK-CryoFuel coolant, and the required cabling. The company says that all the kits come with detailed instruction books, though its promised installation tutorials on YouTube sounds like they'll be more helpful. The Fluid Gaming A120 kit with a CPU block and a 120-mm radiator costs $150, the A240 set with a CPU block and 240-mm radiator costs $160, and the A240G kit with both CPU and graphics card blocks plus a 240-mm radiator will run you up $240. The kits are available through EK's web store immediately and will be offered at TR-favorite Newegg soon. Guru3D has already gotten its hands on the Fluid Gaming A240G kit.

A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., June 2, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK NEW YORK Technology shares have led U.S. stocks to record highs and are expected to continue to rise, but as market value becomes concentrated in the largest companies, some are beginning to look for the next rally leader. The technology sector of the S&P 500 .SPLRCT has risen roughly 20 percent so far in 2017, led by Apple (AAPL.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O). The only other company with comparable gains in market value this year is Amazon (AMZN.O), a market darling not in the tech sector despite being a big player in cloud services and data storage. "These are the dominant players in their specific spaces and the hottest areas in tech," said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, highlighting their exposure to the cloud and artificial intelligence. "You will continue to see money flowing into those names. People want to be exposed to the hottest areas," he said. (To view a graphic on 'The Five Horsemen: growing influence of largest technology companies' click reut.rs/2sntpYb) Active funds have continued to throw their money behind the leaders with a record overweight on the technology sector, according to BofA/Merrill Lynch data going back to 2008. But more than a third of the 2017 gains in the S&P 500 have come from these five companies, and the concentration of the advance has some investors jittery. "Given how significant the (large cap) leadership has been year to date, I kind of think you need to find another group to produce that leadership," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of concentrated U.S. growth at AllianceBernstein in New York. Echoing Dell[DI.UL], Cisco (CSCO.O), Intel (INTC.O) and yes, Microsoft itself, the leaders of the Y2K tech boom, these new "five horsemen" have added more than $612 billion in value to the stock market this year. Their 2017 gains alone could buy the 85 smallest companies of the S&P 500. Their combined value, near $3 trillion, is not far from the market value of all the other components of the Nasdaq 100. NOT THAT EXPENSIVE, BUT... This tech rally has come hand in hand with heightened expectations for profits. Investors are currently paying $18.50 for every $1 in earnings expected over the next 12 months in the sector, compared to the more than $40 they paid during the dot-com bubble and even the $20-plus seen during the most recent market peak in 2007. Tech sector earnings are expected to grow 11 percent in the second quarter after rising near 21 percent in the first, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. However, with gains of more than 33 percent for Apple, Facebook and Amazon, near 25 percent for Alphabet and 15 percent in Microsoft, compared to a gain of 8.5 percent for the S&P 500, the room for more upside is declining. Despite expecting gains upward of 20 percent for the rest of the year on the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - and their ilk, analysts at Fundstrat recommended in a Friday note balancing portfolios by scooping up the year's underperformers: banks, energy and telecoms. They are not alone in searching for exposure outside technology. "We're most overweight in technology but I don't want to stay too long at the party," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. "What I'm watching for is an opportunity to lighten up on tech exposure and put it into some of the more cyclical areas," he said. "Financials are going to be catching a tailwind." AllianceBernstein's Tierney bets beyond tech on healthcare .SPXHC, the second-largest sector weight on the S&P 500. "Healthcare has really lagged the last 18 months or so. They could certainly pick up the mantle."

Heads of delegations at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. (Wikimedia Photo / Presidencia de la República Mexicana). Dozens of the country’s biggest corporations are mounting a last-ditch attempt to dissuade President Donald Trump from abandoning the Paris Agreement, a pledge to reduce carbon emissions and stem the tide of global warming. In full-page ads running in today’s New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and New York Post, 25 companies have signed an open letter detailing the economic benefits of adhering to the agreement. Those companies include Microsoft, Apple, Google, Adobe, Facebook, Intel, and Salesforce. In a related TV ad, “America’s biggest CEOs,” including the leaders of JPMorgan Chase, GE,  Johnson & Johnson, and Disney, make a similar case. Both ads claim the Paris Agreement will lead to job creation and will boost the U.S. economy. Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk is one of the CEOs named in the TV ad. An outspoken supporter of the Paris Agreement, Musk has pledged to abandon his post as an advisor to Trump if the president pulls out of the climate deal. Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2017 Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. committed to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. If Trump exits the Paris Agreement, the U.S. will join Syria and Nicaragua as the only non-participants. The entreaties from the business community appeal to Trump’s sense of nationalism, stressing the economic and financial benefits of remaining in the agreement while underplaying the environmental factors. “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the newspaper ad says. “U.S. companies are well-positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” Two of the world’s biggest oil producers, Exxon Mobile and ConocoPhillips, also oppose pulling out of the agreement, arguing it’s better to have a seat at the table to influence global climate policy, according to Bloomberg News. The Guardian reports EPA chief Scott Pruitt and Trump advisor Steve Bannon support an exit. Most reports say Trump is leaning toward leaving the Paris Agreement. He is expected to deliver his decision this afternoon.

President Trump announces his intention to pull the United States out of the Paris accord on climate change. (Facebook screen grab / The White House) President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord was rippling through the tech community on Thursday as Amazon, Microsoft, Elon Musk and others weighed in with reactions to the news. Despite pleas from those ranging from fellow heads of state to leaders of some of the world’s biggest tech companies, Trump acted to initiate the process of backing out of the landmark agreement aimed at reducing carbon emissions and stemming the tide of global warming. “In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or an entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States,” Trump said Thursday. “We are getting out. But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great.” Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, was perhaps the most high-profile tech leader to express his displeasure with Trump’s decision, and he did so by following through on his threat to abandon his positions on the president’s advisory councils. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today https://t.co/F8Ppr2o7Rl — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017 Musk, who has previously defended his access to the president as a way to work through disagreements from the inside, was serving on White House advisory councils that focus on manufacturing and infrastructure, as well as on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. He was also assisting a White House office aimed at boosting American innovation, led by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law. In a short tweet storm of its own, Amazon’s official news feed stressed its continued support for action on climate change. 1/4 Amazon continues to support the Paris climate agreement and action on climate change. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 2/4 We believe that robust clean energy and climate policies can support American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 3/4 We remain committed to putting our scale and inventive culture to work in ways that are good for the environment and our customers. — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 4/4 For more information on our commitment to sustainability, visit our website https://t.co/LrnVdML0el — Amazon News (@amazonnews) June 1, 2017 Microsoft President Brad Smith tweeted disappointment on behalf of the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant. Earlier, Smith posted a letter, signed by Microsoft and other companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and Intel, urging Trump to stick with the agreement signed by President Obama in 2015. We’re disappointed with the decision to exit the Paris Agreement. Microsoft remains committed to doing our part to achieve its goals. — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) June 1, 2017 Smith also shared a LinkedIn post in which he wrote, “We all live on a small planet and every nation needs to work with others to protect it.” He said that Microsoft is of the belief that continued U.S. participation in the agreement “benefits U.S. businesses and the economy in important and multiple ways” including creating “new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to cloud-enabled solutions.” Reiterating a commitment to embrace sustainability across every aspect of its business, cloud computing company Salesforce tweeted its displeasure with Trump — complete with an illustration of two bears standing in the woods. Salesforce Statement on U.S. Withdrawal from Paris Agreement: https://t.co/SeBTRteXDC pic.twitter.com/77reuijN2B — Salesforce (@salesforce) June 1, 2017 Washington Sen. Patty Murray released a statement calling the president’s “short-sighted” action “especially cruel” for her home state. “It is truly a sad commentary that when faced with two choices — to either uphold the Paris climate deal to combat perhaps the most significant challenge of our time, or, to abdicate all responsibility and walk away — President Trump chose the latter. This is especially cruel as Washington state is already grappling with the harsh effects of climate change, from ocean acidification and shrinking glaciers on Mt. Rainier, to more intense droughts and crop damage, and bigger, more devastating wildfires. Our children, and our children’s children, will remember the moment when the President of the United States of America chose the short-sighted political payoff despite scientific fact, overwhelming global support, long-term financial stability, and the will of millions of families he vowed to represent. To say I’m disappointed with President Trump’s decision is an understatement.” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued several tweets on the “shameful course of action” and announced the state’s intention, along with others, to be part of a United States Climate Alliance. Leaving the Paris agreement is a shameful course of action that will jeopardize the health and prosperity of our children and grandchildren. — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) June 1, 2017 Washington state has, is, and will continue leading the way on climate issues for our people while Trump and Washington, D.C. fails. — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) June 1, 2017 Along with @NYGovCuomo and Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown, we're forming the United States Climate Alliance. https://t.co/opGiz01Ntu — Governor Jay Inslee (@GovInslee) June 1, 2017 Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said that “going backward is not an option” and that cities like Seattle will keep their commitment to the Paris Agreement and even pass a resolution to that effect. As President Trump retreats on the #ParisAgreement and shirks responsibility, cities like ours will fill the void and #ActOnClimate. pic.twitter.com/C9B2rEvorl — Ed Murray (@MayorEdMurray) June 1, 2017 Meanwhile, the folks at weather.com — who perhaps know a thing or two about whether it’s getting hotter — dedicated a good chunk of their website, below news of Trump’s actions, to illustrating what it could all mean. Starting with “So, what happens to Earth now?” the site linked to proof of global warming’s effects such as Antarctica turning green and California’s coastline disappearing. (Weather.com screen grab) And in the end, Astronaut Scott Kelly, a man who has seen and reflected on Earth from a place most can only dream about, called the news “devastating” while sharing an image of the home planet from outer space. Withdrawing from the #ParisAgreement will be devastating to our planet. Paris and Pittsburgh share the same environment after all. pic.twitter.com/QNO5vHtmEF — Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) June 1, 2017 The White House streamed Trump’s statement on the Paris accord live on Facebook.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Computer Stocks to Buy in 2017 Investors looking for a play on computers -- as well as their software and hardware -- should consider these three companies this year. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Jun 2, 2017 at 3:09PM In the first quarter of 2017 the PC market reported its first growth in the past five quarters, but just barely. PC sales, which include desktops, notebooks, and workstations, hit 60.3 million units in the first quarter, up 0.6% year over year according to research from IDC.  Despite this snail-like growth, there are still several solid opportunities for investors looking to snatch up the best computer stocks this year. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) are all longtime players in the computer market, and each is poised to benefit in its respective segment this year.  Image source: Apple. Apple Apple reported Mac unit sales of 4.2 million in its fiscal second quarter 2017, an increase of 4% year over year, and said the net revenue from those sales hit $5.8 billion, up 14% year over year. Apple's PC sales pale in comparison to its iPhone business, but that doesn't mean Apple should be written off as a solid computer investment.  Image source: Apple. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call that its new Macbook Pro helped spur Mac revenues in the quarter, and that Mac business has generated over $25 billion of revenue over the past four quarters. "We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform," Cook added.  Apple will likely keep the good times rolling for its Macs this year when it releases updates to both the Pro and regular Macbook lineups next month. The company is expected to bring new, 7th-generation Intel Kaby Lake chips into both the Macbook and Macbook Pro lineups, which should boost processing speeds and increase battery life. Apple is the fourth-largest PC vendor in the world. It just raised it's dividend by 10.5% in the second quarter, and continues to prove that incremental upgrades to its Macs and other devices are more than enough to drive more growth from this longtime computer stock.  Abobe Pivoting to the software side of computer stocks, Adobe is a great example of a company transitioning from one-time software sales to recurring revenue through a subscription-based model -- and it's paying off enormously for the company.  Adobe just reported its strongest first quarter ever, with revenue up 21.6% year over year to $1.68 billion and GAAP net income jumping 56.7% to $254.3 million. The company's Digital-media segment, driven by subscriptions to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, deserve most of the credit for the stellar quarter, as it grew 22% year over year.  Image source: Adobe. Even with sales of PCs slowing down, Abobe is proving there is still substantial need for creative software that users are willing to pay for on an ongoing basis. Adobe CFO Mark Garrett indicated in a press release that there's likely more for investors to look forward to this year as well. Our solid execution and business momentum combined with strong market tailwinds give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong financial results. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of 2017 and beyond. NVIDIA NVIDIA may not be what you consider a traditional computer stock, but the company makes the vast majority of its revenue -- about 53% -- from sales of its graphics processing units (GPUs) that go into PCs, which, I think, is a solid computer stock bonafide. NVIDIA has caught the attention of investors for its growing opportunities in driverless cars and virtual reality, but the company's GPUs are also being used to power complex data centers for artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.  Image source: NVIDIA. Intel may dominate the server business right now, but NVIDIA's chips are already helping Facebook, Alphabet, and others take the next step into visual computing and neural network learning. NVIDIA's DGX-1 supercomputer is a prime example of this -- it can learn 12 times faster than the company's previous machine learning computers.  Aside from AI computing, NVIDIA's GPUs are the go-to choice for PC makers' graphics processing needs for gaming and virtual reality. That bodes very well for NVIDIA, as IDC has noted that PC gaming growth is helping to stabilize the broader PC market and VR is shaping up to be a nearly $34 billion business by 2022.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Scan & Sign CloudPrivate Back to Home The Great OpenStack Delusion – how open source cloud infrastructure can overcome a crisis Increase / Decrease text size James Nunns   - Deputy Editor 2nd June 2017 Add to favorites Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth delivers some tough love in his assessment of OpenStack and what needs to happen to get it out of a crisis. OpenStack is in a state of flux. The open source cloud infrastructure has always been dogged by issues regarding its value, complexity, cost, and a lack of skills. But now it faces a new challenge within its community that could herald a make or break period for the technology. The cloud infrastructure has to some extent overcome many of the challenges it has faced, and dispelled many a myth in the process, but moves from some of the largest vendors in the ecosystem have threatened to de-rail the project. HPE and Cisco are two of the most notable companies to have shifted their position with OpenStack, whilst Intel has also withdrawn funding in the past year. Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical and soon to return to the position of CEO, spoke to CBR recently about the health of OpenStack.  On HPE’s position Shuttleworth said: “Here’s the simple fact, HPE was never going to sell an HPE OpenStack because no one was ever going to buy an HPE OpenStack and HPE has zero f*****g clue how to operate software. But HPE will do a great job at selling servers under a Canonical OpenStack.” Shuttleworth said that OpenStack will thrive and because of that there will be a need for servers, which HPE, Dell EMC, Cisco and others will provide and build a great business off of it, but some of the big vendors have “taken a big punch to the face,” due to a delusion that they would own the entire stack. “The delusion that magically they would own the entire stack was what had to fail,  so the mixed messages is that they’ve taken a big punch to the face but at the end of the day they will end up selling a bunch of servers into OpenStack and I think that’s great, and they will be successful and we will help them with that,” said Shuttleworth. “This sounds like tough love but that’s exactly what this is. There is a bunch of delusion behind the vendor strategy.” Cisco is similar, while the Canonical founder says that his company deploys a lot of its OpenStack on Cisco UCS the vendor along with others have learned that they can’t own the whole stack. “There’s a difference between a vendor owning the whole thing, which is what they wanted, and participate with things that make sense, which is what will happen. “In all of that right now is the crisis, but what will emerge is that people will want to buy servers from HPE and they will buy from HPE and they’ll push a button and there Canonical OpenStack will get bigger with those servers  and that’s great for HPE.” In the past, Shuttleworth has, in his own words, “somewhat controversially” called out OpenStack for having lots of things in it that don’t really matter, that can essentially be ignored because they are going to die. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing for OpenStack because it will help to move it to a place where everyone agrees on what exactly OpenStack is. The OpenStack Foundation is also seemingly starting to recognise this and has started to move towards wrapping up projects that no one is interested in or using, but it’s been a long time coming and there’s a reason for that – money. Read more: OpenStack Summit: The second generation of private cloud At least that’s according to Shuttleworth who said it is: “because each one of those has a vendor that pays a sponsorship and a subscription.” But if these projects are closed then will it force companies out and damage the ecosystem? Shuttleworth said that words like ecosystem are associated with winning, hence why they are used so often and that “noise is not associated with winning but they can often be the same thing.” “So the foundation went through a phase where adding vendors added money and the perception of ecosystem, but it also added noise. So the painful thing that is going to have to happen is that some vendors will have to accept that they fit into a world where the only things that matter are Nova, Cinder, Swift, Neutron, KVM…” The soon to be CEO said that his point is that it’s none of the vendor specific “stuff.” “You’re already seeing Mirantis has multiple of those projects they just can’t sustain them, HPE has abandoned multiple of those projects and with that sponsorships will go. That’s ok, it’s the old how many people does it take to change a lightbulb, well if it should only take one then why would you want 20 in a room?” Shuttleworth doesn’t want to see a single vendor story and urges careful thinking from the Foundation as to how it moves forward without ending up in a single vendor situation, “because they’ve allowed throwing money at the problem to carry a very big stick and there are some people that have money.” Fundamentally he believes that getting virtual networks, virtual machines, and virtual discs right, doesn’t take 300 vendors.  “We can build ecosystems around OpenStack, very viable ecosystems around OpenStack without making the core contested, that will take real leadership,” said Shuttleworth. He does feel that the Foundation is getting ready to make the hard decisions but that in the end it will be forced upon them because vendors will leave as they haven’t made money. “That’s not a bad thing for OpenStack, if you look at what we said three years ago, a lot will go away so don’t fall in love with it. What you should fall in love with is the core that is what will survive and thrive,” he said. Although it may come across as Shuttleworth being quite doom and gloom about the state of ecosystem, he was actually very positive. His company is doing well, as highlighted by a recent OpenStack user survey that showed Ubuntu as being just behind Red Hat for commercial traction. He’s also seeing increasing traction when it comes to businesses being open to having multiple operating systems – with Ubuntu becoming the new Linux in the building. While there are positives for Canconical, Shuttleworth still wants to see open source cloud infrastructure’s operations become crisper and more automated in order to get in to line with the public cloud vendors like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure , and Google. Read more: Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical founder: Dot-com bubble collapse set to hit Openstack as the Big Tent comes falling down Shuttleworth said: “As long as the operations of OpenStack are crisp and automated the way we do them, that is a beautiful thing. There a lot of people in the OpenStack community who can’t do that, they can’t operate OpenStack, their OpenStack can’t be operated, so operating it is kind of crazy and therefore unpredictable in terms of cost. “So businesses look at that and see they have a predictable thing from Amazon and this crazy and unpredictable thing from Mirantis, well that’s a shit choice. Whereas if you can get it to the point where Amazon is predictable, Google is predictable and OpenStack is predictable the way it is from Canonical with a managed service like BootStack or with just doing it yourself with MAAS and Juju that is a great thing.” One thing that could help OpenStack is the upcoming Microsoft Azure Stack which is due to compete with OpenStack when it is fully released. “That’s an interesting one and I think it’s really good,” said Shuttleworth. “So yes, I think Azure Stack is a serious competitor to OpenStack and I suspect Azure Stack will be good. Historically, version three will be very good and I think that’s good for OpenStack.” The reason why he thinks it will be good is because it will help to force OpenStack to get rid of the things that don’t matter. There’s a lot of changes that are going to be on in OpenStack, some necessary, some that will be forced on them by external forces. Increased competition in the market should be a good thing, but it will be up to the Foundation and vendors to make sure they get it right. Shuttleworth isn’t critical of the Foundation, he said he admires them but that there are things that that they need to learn, not in a way of calling anyone an idiot, but there are a lot of decisions ahead that need to be made.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide Dozens of Cities and States Are Initiating Rogue One, Planning to Independently Rejoin the Paris Agreement  Sidney FussellFriday 3:05pm Filed to: political climate change Paris agreement climate change 204 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink AP Former New York City major, Michael Bloomberg, is coordinating an effort among 30 mayors, three governors, 80 university presidents and over 100 businesses to independently align with the Paris Agreement’s goal of curbing US carbon emissions, the New York Times reported Friday. Additionally, 83 mayors have signed the Climate Mayors Agreement, similarly with the goal of independently reducing carbon emissions. On Thursday, President Trump announced the US is joining Syria and Nicaragua in abdicating from the landmark agreement, ratified by former President Obama in 2016 and signed by 195 nations. Trump peddled dozens of wildly disproven falsehoods in justifying exiting the agreement, which prompted swift backlash from the international community, diplomats, Trump’s own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and major US companies like Apple, Microsoft and Intel. State and local leaders have also made it clear they’re fighting the decision and will continue to fight climate change, with or without federal support. The Climate Mayors Agreement is a commitment between now 8o+ cities including Austin, Palo Alto and San Francisco to ignore Trump’s March executive order that weakened the Clean Power Plan, which would have compelled states to set power plant emissions reductions goals. They want to keep those goals intact. Several of these same cities have jointly signed onto former Mayor Bloomberg’s new plan, which is a coalition of cities, states, and companies who plan on coordinating with the UN directly to come up with carbon emissions targets. Advertisement For now, it’s unclear how that coordination will actually work. The Paris Agreement was designed to accommodate entire nations, not individual cities. The point was for countries to have individual targets, then draw up their own policy measures in order to meet them. This new effort would seemingly involve a wide range of localities within a country all coordinating with an international body, which is brand new diplomatic territory. To remain aligned with the Paris Agreement, cities will be focusing on expanding renewable energy sources for utilities, launching infrastructure projects that are more energy efficient and offering subsidies for customers buying electric cars and solar panels. The US is roughly halfway to its initial Paris Agreement goal, of reducing carbon emissions by about 25% by 2025, and was set to meet its goal before Trump’s rapid-fire deregulations. While researchers projected the US will fail its climate goal, former Mayor Bloomberg said in a letter to the UN that he believes his coalition will help the US achieve its reduction target. Moreover, the new coalition signifies that while America’s leadership may have abdicated its responsibility to fight climate change, its people are not.

Reuters: Mueller Now Looking Into Flynn’s Turkey Lobbying, Too SHARE TWEET PIN-IT Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP By Allegra Kirkland Published June 2, 2017 12:29 pm Views Ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn’s well-compensated lobbying for a Turkish businessman during the 2016 campaign is now part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s election interference, Reuters reported Friday. Three sources told Reuters that Mueller was assuming control over an ongoing federal grand jury investigation into Flynn’s lobbying work, which forced him to retroactively register as a foreign agent after leaving the White House. Flynn’s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, was paid $530,000 by Inovo BV, a Dutch firm owned by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, to research and produce negative PR materials about exiled Turkish cleric Fetullah Gulen. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan believes Gulen orchestrated a failed coup against him last summer from his compound in Pennsylvania. Reuters reported that the grand jury investigation, run out of the Eastern District Court of Virginia, has issued subpoenas for Flynn and his business associates. The subpoenas requested bank records, documents and communications related to Flynn, Flynn Intel Group, Alptekin and Inovo, per the report. Mueller’s investigation, which includes determining whether there was any collusion between Trump campaign associates and Kremlin operatives, is also looking into Flynn’s conversations with Russian officials. Flynn had multiple conversations with the Kremlin’s ambassador to the U.S. about lifting the Obama administration’s economic sanctions against Russia. Former acting attorney general Sally Yates testified that the Justice Department believed Flynn was “compromised with respect to the Russians” because he knowingly misrepresented those conversations to other Trump administration officials.

Human drivers 1 / 3 Back to Gallery DETROIT - In just a few years, well-mannered self-driving robotaxis will share the roads with reckless, law-breaking human drivers. The prospect is causing migraines for the people developing the robotaxis. A self-driving car would be programmed to drive at the speed limit. Humans routinely exceed it by 10 to 15 mph (16 to 24 kph) - just try entering the New Jersey Turnpike at normal speed. Self-driving cars wouldn't dare cross a double yellow line; humans do it all the time. And then there are those odd local traffic customs to which humans quickly adapt. In Los Angeles and other places, for instance, there's the "California Stop," where drivers roll through stop signs if no traffic is crossing. In Southwestern Pennsylvania, courteous drivers practice the "Pittsburgh Left," where it's customary to let one oncoming car turn left in front of them when a traffic light turns green. The same thing happens in Boston. During rush hours near Ann Arbor, Mich., drivers regularly cross a double-yellow line to queue up for a left-turn onto a freeway. "There's an endless list of these cases where we as humans know the context, we know when to bend the rules and when to break the rules," says Raj Rajkumar, a computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University who leads its autonomous car research. Although autonomous cars are likely to carry passengers or cargo in limited areas during the next three to five years, experts say it will take many years before robotaxis can coexist with human-piloted vehicles on most side streets, boulevards and freeways. That's because programmers have to figure out human behavior and local traffic idiosyncrasies. And teaching a car to use that knowledge will require massive amounts of data and big computing power that is prohibitively expensive at the moment.

Driving customs and road conditions are dramatically different across the globe, with narrow, congested lanes in European cities, and anarchy in Beijing's giant traffic jams. In India's capital, New Delhi, luxury cars share poorly marked and congested lanes with bicycles, scooters, trucks, and even an occasional cow or elephant. Then there is the problem of aggressive humans who make dangerous moves such as cutting cars off on freeways or turning left in front of oncoming traffic. In India, for example, even when lanes are marked, drivers swing from lane to lane without hesitation. Already there have been isolated cases of human drivers pulling into the path of cars such as Teslas, knowing they will stop because they're equipped with automatic emergency braking. "It's hard to program in human stupidity or someone who really tries to game the technology," says John Hanson, spokesman for Toyota's autonomous car unit. Kathy Winter, vice president of automated driving solutions for Intel, is optimistic that the cars will be able to see and think like humans before 2030. Cars with sensors for driver-assist systems already are gathering data about road signs, lane lines and human driver behavior. Winter hopes auto and tech companies developing autonomous systems and cars will contribute this information to a giant database. Artificial intelligence developed by Intel and other companies eventually could access the data and make quick decisions similar to humans, Winter says. Intel's Winter expects fully autonomous cars to collect, process and analyze four terabytes of data in 1 ½ hours of driving, which is the average amount a person spends in a car each day. That's equal to storing over 1.2 million photos or 2,000 hours of movies. Such computing power now costs over $100,000 per vehicle. But that cost could fall as more cars are built. Someday autonomous cars will have common sense programmed in so they will cross a double-yellow line when warranted or to speed up and find a gap to enter a freeway. Carnegie Mellon has taught its cars to handle the "Pittsburgh Left" by waiting a full second or longer for an intersection to clear before proceeding at a green light. Sensors also track crossing traffic and can figure out if a driver is going to stop for a sign or red light. Eventually there will be vehicle-to-vehicle communication to avoid crashes. Still, some skeptics say computerized cars will never be able to think exactly like humans. "You'll never be able to make up a person's ability to perceive what's the right move at the time, I don't think," says New Jersey State Police Sgt. Ed Long.
