Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 1:04 PM Intel CEO pay rises to US$19.1mil as security costs climb Intel’s board awarded Krzanich, 56, stock worth US$11.7mil (RM51.91mil), a 20% increase from 2015, according to a proxy statement April 6. — Bloomberg Intel Corp boosted chief executive officer Brian Krzanich’s compensation package 30% to US$19.1mil (RM84.75mil) last year, fuelled by a bigger stock award and costs for his personal security arrangements.  Intel’s board awarded Krzanich, 56, stock worth US$11.7mil (RM51.91mil), a 20% increase from 2015, according to a proxy statement April 6. The CEO also received US$1.25mil (RM5.54mil) in salary, US$3.7mil (RM16.41mil) in bonuses, about US$2.13mil (RM9.45mil) in security services, plus other smaller items.  The decision to bolster the security programme came as Krzanich in April last year said some senior executives had faced backlash for the company’s stance and efforts on diversity, according to a TechCrunch report. In 2015, the CEO pledged Intel would spend US$300mil (RM1.33bil) to make the gender and ethnicity of the company’s workforce representative of the US population by 2020. He also vowed to tie executive pay to that goal.  The world’s largest chipmaker, like many other tech companies, has faced criticism for employing few women, blacks and Hispanics. In its diversity report for fiscal 2016, Intel said it achieved pay parity for women and underrepresented minorities and increased its share of female employees to 25.8%, a 2.3% gain since 2014.  The company spent US$1.86mil (RM8.25mil) on personal security for Krzanich and another US$275,200 (RM1.22mil) to protect his residence. Executive vice-president Venkata Renduchintala received security services worth US$944,800 (RM4.19mil) and Stacy Smith, who oversees manufacturing, operations and sales, got US$309,900 (RM1.37mil). The threats were targeted against the CEO and certain other executives, and in some cases their family members, according to the filing, which didn’t provide details on the specific arrangements.  By comparison, Intel spent US$39,600 (RM175,725) for Krzanich’s security in 2015. The company also enhanced the programme that year in response to “specific job-related situations,” a filing shows. His full 2015 compensation was US$14.6mil (RM64.78mil).  The CEO is trying to remake the company by converting its dominance in PC chips into a presence in markets ranging from cars to mobile phones to drones. That push has yet to provide Intel with enough revenue and profit to shake its dependence on its main source of income. Its finances are increasingly reliant on demand for processors running server computers in giant data centers that support computing over the internet.  Krzanich’s annual bonus, which paid out slightly above its US$3.5mil (RM15.53mil) target, is tied to absolute and relative financial performance, and operational goals. About 60% of his stock award is linked to total shareholder return and vests if Intel beats the median return among a group of tech companies over three years. The remaining shares vest in increments over three years as long as he remains on the job.  His bonus payout can be adjusted based on how Intel achieves goals related to hiring and retaining women and under-represented minorities.  Renduchintala, who joined the company in November 2015, received a US$20.4mil (RM90.52mil) pay package. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Analyst Reports , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested UTAR among top young varsities Speculation driving up tech stocks on Bursa, but many don't want to miss the party Joy over bumper harvest Don't tear down Ampang Park for MRT, say traders Where to find a cuddly quokka for your selfie Craft yourself a new career by embracing digital learning Others Also Read Turning the spotlight on online brands Copter ‘quietly’ attracts interest Tennis - Thompson stuns Sock to give Australia 1-0 Davis Cup lead advertisement Latest News Facebook starts to educate users on how to spot fake news Singapore central bank seen on hold as economy emerges from doldrums Sterling's fate hangs on tone of Brexit negotiations EPF provides free financial literacy guidance to members Key Asian markets mostly lower on geopolitical worries Most Viewed in Tech Trump sued by Twitter over bid to unmask @Alt-Agency handle Adidas to mass-produce 3D-printed shoe with Silicon Valley startup Alphabet moves two top Google Fiber executives off project Forget Apple; Xiaomi CEO now wants to be more like Costco Udacity self-driving taxi spin-off Voyage takes aim at Uber Samsung tips best quarterly profit in over three years as chips soar China's Ant seeks to allay MoneyGram security fears Emirates joins Etihad, Qatar in US cabin laptop ban workaround As millennials ‘Venmo’ each other money, banks fight back with their own mobile apps The long road to autonomous vehicles Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

They warned about valuation and also stiff competition from Intel and NVIDIA. But speaking of a rally, the bulls are starting to come back in defense of the chip maker. By Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (amd.com) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons AMD stock already reflects bullish scenario Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari initiated coverage of AMD stock with a Sell rating and $11 per share price target on Thursday. He believes that at 15 times his “very bullish” estimate for earnings per share in 2018, AMD stock is just too expensive. He adds that the stock’s current valuation sits 236% higher than the five-year median multiple, and he can’t justify this. He also feels that all the potential for further fundamental improvement is already priced in and even doubts that the chip maker will be able to meet his 2018 estimates because of competition from NVIDIA and Intel. He does give Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su credit for improving execution at the company and also fixing its balance sheet and cutting costs. The analyst predicts that AMD stock will start to underperform after the company’s analyst day in May. Goldman’s “a buzzkill” on AMD stock: Jim Cramer It didn’t take long for bulls to strike back at Hari’s ultra-bearish stance on AMD stock. “Goldman is being a buzzkill here,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said on Mad Dash earlier today. “They’re taking away the punchbowl.” He pointed out that the chip maker is still doing well in video games and in the fight against Intel, a much bigger and stronger rival. Barron’s also argued against Goldman, saying that the scenario the firm describes as “very bullish” doesn’t look unreasonable. The website noted that in February at around $12 per share, it had argued that AMD stock could double before the end of this year. Barron’s feels that the chip maker can achieve the strong market share Hari describes as “very bullish” and also that when it does, investors will probably send its shares even higher, making the current levels not seem overpriced at all. The website notes that Hari’s base case assumes “very little progress” with only an 11.6% share of the desktop market and 9.4% share of the notebook market. Goldman’s base case also assumes only a 1.1% share of the server market, although AMD is preparing to release its new Naples server chip very soon as it aims to hit Intel right where it hurts. AMD also released its Ryzen chips recently, and they have been met with glowing reviews so far. AMD stock closed down 6.35% at $13.27 on Thursday after dipping below its 50-day moving average. The shares are still well above their 52-week low of $2.60, however. AMD stock is up by more than 350% for the last 12 months.

By Chris Duckett | April 7, 2017 -- 00:38 GMT (17:38 PDT) | Topic: Innovation The reason why industry needs new architecture for neural networks becomes apparent when you work with GPUs at a low level, according to recently appointed chief technology officer of Intel Artificial Intelligence Product Group, Amir Khosrowshahi. Khosrowshahi was previously co-founder and CTO of Nervana System, which was purchased by the chip giant for an undisclosed amount in August last year, and whose technology quickly found itself at the centre of Intel's plans for AI. A problem-solving approach IT workers should learn from robotics engineers Sometimes the most profound solution is to change the entire problem. Read More The CTO detailed how his former company used GPUs because "that was the state of the art", but the company replaced the standard Nvidia assembler with one of its own because it was regarded by Nervana as generating "sub-optimal" instructions. "Early on in the history of Nervana we did this, partly for our own development efforts, but then realised it was about two or three times faster than Nvidia's own libraries, so we released it as open source," Khosrowshahi told ZDNet on Thursday. Nervana's efforts did not stop at software alone, with the company also creating its own silicon targeting neural network training. "Neural networks are a series of predetermined operations, it's not like a user interacting with a system, it's a set of instructions that can be described as a data flow graph," he said. According to Khosrowshahi, some of the features that help a graphics processing unit do its graphics rendering job -- such as a large amount of cache, and handling vertices, rendering, and textures -- is superfluous. "There is so much circuitry in a GPU that is not necessary for machine learning ... this is crud that has accumulated over time, and it's quite a lot of stuff," he said. "You don't need the circuitry which is quite a large proportion of the chip and also high cost in energy utilisation." "Neural networks are quite simple, they are little matrix multiplications and non-linearities, you can directly build silicon to do that. You can build silicon that is very faithful to the architecture of neural networks, which GPUs are not." The answer Khosrowshahi had a hand in developing is now called Lake Crest, a discrete accelerator which Intel is set to roll out to select customers this year, but over time, it will become more closely tied to Xeon processors. "It's a tensor processor, it deals with instructions that are matrix operations," Khosrowshahi explained. "So the instruction set is matrix 1 multiplied by matrix 2, go through a lookup table, and these big instructions that are high-level. "In a GPU it is a register and a register, move into [another] register, do an element-by-element multiplication, it's fairly low-level." Whereas the CTO said Nvidia have made an effort to make their GPUs more neural network friendly in recent years, their AI chips still carry a lot of graphics functionality with them. "Being part of a chip effort myself, I can see why that would be hard for Nvidia to do," he said. On the other hand, Intel shifted the way it approached AI through purchases. "It's a challenge in the chip industry to come up with an entirely new architecture; what Intel has done is they have purchased it," Khosrowshahi said. "They've bought FPGAs [field-programmable gate array], so they bought Altera, which is this really cool architecture that is very neural networky, so FPGA fabric is pretty interesting for neural networks... and of course the Nervana chip is very much a neural network focused engine, but slightly removed from neural networks." When thinking about neural networks, Khosrowshahi said it is wrong to think about etching neural networks in silicon, as much of that functionality remains in software. "Quite a lot of it is in software, so even in the case of Lake Crest, the instructions [for Lake Crest] are not 'neural network, do this', it's multiply this matrix by this matrix." "Outside the chip there is some software that knows it is a neural network, and it is training, and the user is asking for different things and searching for parameters -- all the sorts of things you have to do when you have a neural network system." With a background in neuroscience, Khosrowshahi believes the point of artificial intelligence is not to recreate the human brain, but to go beyond it. "The brain is an example of an AI, but it is a certain limited AI in the sense that my visual system sees the physical world, and it knows to understand the statistics of the world," he said. "If you look around you, you see a lot of edges, you see a lot of surfaces, you see shaded regions and so forth, and if you actually look in the brain ... [in] the primary visual cortex, there are neurons that are sensitive to these features, so your AI has learned the statistics of the world and is able to do inferences on them -- like I'm going to crash into this, or this is a cup, I want to hold the cup." But the data within enterprises is much different from that humans interact with, Khosrowshahi said. "It's rows of tables, of people clicking on stuff, potentially the statistics are very non-intuitive, so the idea of having intelligence working on this data is kind of a different form of intelligence." "I try to explain this to people because they think we are recreating a brain, we want to go beyond that, we want to create a new kind of AI that can understand the statistics of data used in business, in medicine, in all sorts of areas, and that data is very different in nature than the actual world." One of the AI architectures Intel will go up against is Google's custom-built Tensor Processing Unit, which the search giant said on Wednesday would be 15 times to 30 times faster than contemporary GPUs and CPUs at inference, as well as being 30 times to 80 times more power efficient. Also on Wednesday, IBM and Nvidia announced Big Blue would offer Tesla P100s within its IBM Cloud from May.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 6, 2017 at 6:30PM Michael Larabel, with website Phoronix, recently spotted something interesting with respect to microprocessor-giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) upcoming Cannonlake processors, the company's first products manufactured in its upcoming 10-nanometer technology. Larabel says that, in software patches published by Intel's graphics software development team, Intel refers to two families of Cannon Lake parts. Image source: Intel. The first is Cannonlake-Y, which is a family of processors targeted at fan-less notebooks, 2-in-1 convertibles, and tablets. The second, and perhaps the more surprising one, is a family of processors known as Cannonlake-U. These will presumably target mainstream thin-and-light notebook and "Ultrabook" computers, with the chips targeting a thermal design power of 15 watts. Let's take a closer look at what this means for Intel's product portfolio. Well, that's confusing To be blunt, I didn't think the odds were good that Intel would commercialize Cannonlake-U. To understand my rationale, a little bit of background is in order. Intel's current seventh-generation Core processors currently come in the following basic flavors (the first number represents processor core count and the second number represents the graphics performance of the chip -- higher is better and "e" denotes the presence of on-die memory): Kaby Lake-U 2+2 Kaby Lake-U 2+3e Kaby Lake-Y 2+2 Kaby Lake-H 4+2 Kaby Lake-S 2+2 Kaby Lake-S 4+2 The "S" chips are aimed at traditional desktop computers, the "H" chips are aimed at high-performance laptops like the 15-inch MacBook Pro, the "U" 2+3e configuration is aimed at mainstream notebook systems that need high-performance integrated graphics, the "U" 2+2 configurations are aimed at mainstream systems that don't need more graphical horsepower, and the "Y" series chips are targeted at fan-less notebooks and 2-in-1 convertible systems. The various leaks that have hit the web, as well as Intel's own official information, suggest that Intel's seventh-generation Core processors will be succeeded as follows: Kaby Lake-U 2+2 -> Kaby Lake-U Refresh 4+2 Kaby Lake-U 2+3e -> Coffee Lake-U 4+3e Kaby Lake-Y 2+2 -> Cannonlake-Y 2+2 Kaby Lake-H 4+2 -> Coffee Lake 6+2 Kaby Lake-S 2+2 -> Coffee Lake 4+2 Kaby Lake-S 4+2 -> Coffee Lake 6+2 Given that virtually every one of today's Kaby Lake processors is already accounted for with a successor, it's difficult to see where a Cannon Lake-U, in a 2+2 configuration, will slot in. How could Intel position this product? Here's a conceivable way that Intel can position the Cannonlake-U chips. The Cannonlake-U 2+2 is almost certainly going to be a lower-power product than the Kaby Lake-U Refresh 4+2 part using Intel's 10-nanometer manufacturing technology rather than the 14-nanometer++ technology. It could also have superior graphics performance to the Kaby Lake-U Refresh part, thanks to the use of a new graphics architecture, which Larabel confirms is referred to by Intel as Gen. 10 graphics (Kaby Lake-Refresh/Coffee Lake employ Gen. 9 graphics). Intel may simply give system vendors a choice. For systems where higher CPU performance/more cores is important, pick Kaby Lake-U Refresh. For systems where lower power and/or improved graphics performance is critical, then pick Cannonlake-U. In other words, in my list of parts above, Kaby Lake-U 2+2 could map not just to Kaby Lake-U Refresh 4+2, but also to Cannonlake-U 2+2, depending on the characteristics that the system vendor is aiming for.

Be aware that these firmware updates are only available to those devices running the new Windows 10 Creators Update. Microsoft won't begin rolling out the Creators Update to PCs until April 11, but you can manually upgrade now to that version of the OS using Microsoft's Update Assistant, or its Media Creation Tool.

A year ago, Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich told a Silicon Valley gathering that the company's efforts to diversify its workforce had resulted in a backlash from some employees concerned the campaign might impact them. "People worry that as a white man, you're kind of under siege to a certain extent," Krzanich said, according to the online journal TechCrunch. "There's been a bit of resistance. We've even had a few threats and things like that on some of our leadership team around our position on diversity and inclusion." In its annual proxy filing Thursday, Intel did not specify whether it's boosting security in response to those threats, specifically, or whether there have been other incidents. The company declined to elaborate on the proxy; Bloomberg first noted the security spending. Intel said it spent $1.9 million on security for Krzanich and nearly $1.3 million combined for two other top executives. In addition, it spent $275,200 on home security for the CEO and $77,000 for another executive. Intel's largest operations are in Washington County, but all three executives who received additional security work at corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California. "We do not consider these additional security measures to be a personal benefit for our listed officers, but rather appropriate expenses for the benefit of Intel that arise out of our executives' employment responsibilities and that are necessary to their job performance and personal safety," Intel said in its proxy filing. Intel valued Krzanich's compensation last year at $19.1 million, up from $14.6 million the prior year. The company said it boosted his pay and stock awards in recognition of additional experience after three years running the company. Krzanich wasn't Intel's highest-paid executive last year, though. Venkata "Murthy" Renduchintala, president of Intel's largest business group, received pay and stock awards worth $20.4 million, according to Intel, including incentives associated with his hiring in 2015. -- Mike Rogoway; twitter: @rogoway; 503-294-7699 Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

But most notably, they’re the first computers to ship with Intel’s “Light Peak” I/O technology, now rebranded as Thunderbolt. According to Intel, Thunderbolt combines data transfer and high definition display on a single cable, with transfer speeds of 10 Gbps – enough to transfer a full high definition movie in less than 30 seconds. In comparison, USB 3.0 transfers data up to 5Gbps – half the speed. Thunderbolt uses a standard DisplayPort connector for transfers, and is compatible with existing DisplayPort devices. Combining display and data transfer on a single connector has obvious benefits for mobile PC users, and allows manufacturers to maintain a small form factor. “Working with HD media is one of the most demanding things people do with their PCs,” said Mooly Eden, general manager, PC Client Group, Intel. “With Thunderbolt technology, Intel has delivered innovative technology to help professionals and consumers work faster and more easily with their growing collection of media content, from music to HD movies. We’ve taken the vision of simple, fast transfer of content between PCs and devices, and made it a reality.” “We’re thrilled to collaborate with Intel to bring the groundbreaking Thunderbolt technology to Mac users,” said Bob Mansfield, Apple’s senior vice president of Mac Hardware Engineering. “With ultra-fast transfer speeds, support for high-resolution displays and compatibility with existing I/O technologies, Thunderbolt is a breakthrough for the entire industry and we think developers are going to have a blast with it.” Intel say a number of companies are working on Thunderbolt compatible devices, including Aja, Apogee, Avid, Blackmagic, LaCie, Promise, and Western Digital. displayport i/o intel light peak thunderbolt transfer Terry Walsh Terry Walsh is the founder of We Got Served.

Apple Inc. Won't Build Its Own Mac Processors A new report from a respected journalist says Apple isn't planning to move the Mac to its own processors anytime soon. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 6, 2017 at 3:30PM Respected journalist Ina Fried, writing for Axios, was one of a handful of journalists invited to a Mac briefing at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). You can read Fried's full article, but there is one thing in particular that stood out about this report (bolded portion mine): The company has no plans for touchscreen Macs, or for machines powered solely by the kind of ARM processors used in the iPhone and iPad. However, executives left open the possibility ARM chips could play a broader role as companion processors, something that showed up first with the T1 processor that powers the Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro. In other words, those expecting that Apple would give Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) the boot in favor of homegrown chips should probably rethink those expectations. Image source: Intel. Does this mean Intel is off the hook? However, even though Apple "has no plans" to convert the Mac to its homegrown ARM-based systems -- something it would need to actively work on and support years in advance of an actual software and hardware transition -- that doesn't mean Intel is necessarily off the hook. Over the past several years, Intel has struggled to deliver new products on time. System vendors, like Apple, depend heavily on Intel to deliver new chips and related platform technologies on time. It's likely that Intel's time-to-market struggles have been frustrating to personal-computer makers, including Apple. However, Intel has stated publicly that it's now committed to releasing new products that deliver solid performance improvements each year. If Intel can consistently deliver for Apple in the coming years in terms of building compelling products and getting them out in time, then Intel should be able to keep Apple, as well as its other major customers, happy.  Apple probably doesn't want to build its own Mac chips Although there's been a lot of talk that Apple might build its own Mac processors and all the (supposed) advantages that doing so would confer upon the Mac product line, I doubt Apple would really want to transition away from Intel and toward its own chips. For one thing, Apple is much better off focusing its talented chip teams on chips targeted at iPads and, much more importantly, iPhones. These devices arguably represent the future of computing, together make up the bulk of Apple's hardware revenue, and are both product categories that are much more receptive to the differentiation that Apple can bring at the chip level than the Mac would be. Indeed, given how fiercely competitive the smartphone and tablet markets are, Apple needs every competitive edge it can get. And given how important those product lines are to Apple's top and bottom lines, I can't imagine that duplicating the work Intel already does well would be a good use of talent or money. In addition, Intel has built quite a reputation for itself in the personal-computer market. Many, if not most, prospective personal-computer buyers know the name Intel, know about the company's Core processors, and are familiar with Intel's "good, better, best" product segmentation within its Core processor lineup (i.e., Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7). Apple can leverage Intel's brand work to try to upsell customers to higher-end Intel processors, which, in turn, boosts Apple's Mac average selling prices and gross profit per unit. Apple could conceivably invest in building out a brand for its chips and aggressively segmenting them as Intel does today, but it's just more work that Apple would need to do to replicate what's already out there.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Cannonlake is Intel's 10nm successor to Kabylake. Cannonlake is rumored to start appearing by the end of 2017 and will likely be limited to the lower-power parts while on the desktop side will be Coffee Lake. Today's patches bring-up initial graphics support for Cannonlake, which the patches now confirm is considered Intel "Gen 10" graphics. There are also patches for the Cannonpoint PCH. I haven't seen the Cannonpoint codename referenced publicly before, but appears to be their codename for the Intel 300 series chipsets. 67 patches have been published so far today for Cannonlake/Cannonpoint. All these patches so far are for the Intel i915 DRM driver while the Mesa i965/ANV patches will surely come with time. Due to the DRM deadline this weekend, the earliest we'll see the Cannonlake support in the mainline Linux kernel is with Linux 4.13. Some notes in digging through the public patches so far: - Indeed, Cannonlake is "Gen 10" graphics. - Cannonlake PCI IDs for -U models are 0x5A52, 0x5A5A, 0x5A42, and 0x5A4A. - Cannonlake PCI IDs for -Y models are 0x5A51, 0x5A58, 0x5A41, 0x5A49, 0x5A71, and 0x5A79. - Many similarities to Broxton (no surprise). - There appears to be a number of differences with regards to power management and its low-power mode. But overall no real surprises with these initial enablement kernel patches. Intel's open-source Linux driver bring-up usually leaves out any juicier patches until closer to the hardware launch along with filling in the final golden register settings, updates to various values, etc. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

She previously was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. She is a qualified chartered accountant. Follow @GillianTan Facebook Twitter Email Print Share April 6, 2017 1:46 PM EDT GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC +0.98 At Closing, April 6th 228.64 USD MOBILEYE NV +0.44 At Closing, April 6th 61.74 USD Investment bankers love league tables -- especially when they're on top. To be ranked among the biggest firms in advising on M&A, IPOs, bond sales, or other transactions is an achievement that serves as a cornerstone in pitches for roles on new deals and one that's often touted to investors and analysts who acknowledge it as one measure of performance. But exactly how reliable are they? If last month's $14 billion sale of Mobileye NV to Intel Corp. is anything to go by, they don't always reflect the true state of reality. The deal was a coup for Raymond James & Associates Inc., which was named the sole adviser in the March 13 deal announcement. But retroactively, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was added as an adviser, according to reports and Bloomberg data. Bragging Rights? Without the Mobileye league table credit, Goldman would have placed fourth, not second, among global M&A advisers during the first quarter Source: Bloomberg The addition is believable, if only because Goldman has been tight with Mobileye since it invested $130 million in the automotive-technology company a decade ago. The bank even has a dedicated case study about its relationship with the Israeli company on its website, which mentions that early stake, another round of financing in 2013 and its role in the company's 2014 IPO (it landed the coveted spot of "left lead" per the offering documents). But an SEC filing published on Wednesday suggests that Goldman had little hand, if any, in selling Mobileye to Santa Clara, California-based Intel. In fact, the New York firm isn't mentioned once. Rather, Raymond James is named 139 times, taking center stage in the role of the company's financial adviser. And yet Goldman now shares that status in the record books.  Here's where the league tables come in. Because it was credited with work on the Mobileye transaction, Goldman finished first in a ranking of first-quarter U.S. M&A advisers; it would have placed second to Morgan Stanley had the deal not been included. It would have placed fourth rather than second (behind Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp.) in the league tables for first-quarter global M&A. And on a sector-specific basis, it would have dropped all the way to eighth from first, according to the data, on global technology M&A during the quarter.  Reliability Factor Without credit for the Mobileye sale to Intel, Goldman Sachs wouldn't have claimed the top spot in global technology M&A advisory during the first quarter of 2017 Source: Bloomberg It's not the first time that a bank found its way onto a deal after the fact, to the benefit of its standing in league tables. Back in 2014, Goldman and Morgan Stanley both sought credit for the $25 billion sale of Forest Laboratories Inc. to Actavis Inc. in exchange for fees in a maneuver that was explained as follows: Instead, the two banks, using previous contracts with Forest, negotiated to get credit for the deal in exchange for millions of dollars in fees they were owed, the people said. The contracts had a clause, commonly known as a tail, that entitled them to fees even if the company was sold by another bank, they said. After the deal was announced they each agreed to cut the fees they were due in exchange for being able to claim the league-table credit. It's probable that Goldman landed its after-the-fact advisory credit on the Mobileye sale thanks to a similar clause or agreement. However it came about, the result paints an imperfect picture for investors and prospective clients when filtered through to the league tables, which ought to represent work done.   Boom Time League tables aside, Goldman's financial advisory business has been thriving, with fees approaching pre-crisis levels Source: Bloomberg So what's the solution? To ensure the validity of league tables, such arrangements may need to be eliminated -- or credit could be applied at a fraction of the transaction's size. Without some sort of clarity, companies across the globe hosting so-called bake-offs or beauty parades -- a platform for banks to flaunt their credentials -- must give league-table rankings less weight in any decision making. That in itself is likely to be good for competition and will only shake things up further. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Goldman also led a secondary offering of shares in 2015, in which it pared its stake in the company.

(CREDIT: Walden Kirsch/Intel Corporation) By Levi Sumagaysay | lsumagaysay@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 6, 2017 at 11:27 am | UPDATED: April 6, 2017 at 12:38 pm Intel has put its money where its mouth is on diversifying its workforce — and the company has paid for it in other ways. The Santa Clara chip maker’s board in 2016 “determined to enhance the personal security for [its] CEO and certain other listed officers in response to specific Intel-related incidents and threats against those officers and, in some cases, members of their families,” according to its proxy statement released Thursday. Last year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he and his leadership team had received threats “around our position on diversity and inclusion.” The position that prompted threats? In 2015, Intel committed $300 million to building a more diverse workforce within the next five years. At the time, Krzanich said the company would use the money not only to hire more women and minorities at Intel but to encourage more women and minorities to enter the tech industry. “People worry that as a white man, you’re kind of under siege to a certain extent,” Krzanich said last April on stage with the Rev. Jesse Jackson at the PUSHTech 2020 conference in San Francisco. “There’s been a bit of resistance … We stand up there and just remind everybody it’s not an exclusive process. We’re not bringing in women or African-Americans or Hispanics in exclusion to other people. We’re actually just trying to bring them in and be a part of the whole environment.” Because of the threats, Intel spent more than $2 million on Krzanich’s security in 2016, according to the proxy. That’s up from less than $40,000 the company spent on his security the previous year, Bloomberg points out. The 2016 costs included $1.86 million for personal security for the chief executive plus $275,200 for security for his residence. “Intel believes these are appropriate expenses for the benefit of the company that arise out of our executives’ employment responsibilities and that are necessary to their job performance,” an Intel spokeswoman told SiliconBeat in response to an emailed request for comment Thursday. “We’re not commenting or elaborating beyond what is in the Proxy.” Other executives for whom the company listed security costs were Venkata Renduchintala, who is president of Intel’s Internet of Things business. His security services cost $944,800. Security costs for Stacy Smith, the executive vice president who oversees manufacturing, operations and sales, totaled $309,900. After all the costs, how did Intel do in its goal to diversify its workforce? According to its 2016 diversity report, it has achieved pay parity for women and minorities. Last year, its share of female employees climbed to 25.8 percent, up 2.3 percentage points from 2014. It also said its “diverse hiring” reached 45.1 percent.

The problem is, they don’t do a good job retaining them, especially in the most esteemed divisions. The reason is obvious: work/life balance is atrocious at Intel. Especially after last year’s layoffs, they are so short staffed and people are working so much that a lot of the engineers are actually getting physically sick from the stress of it. It’s bad enough for single white guys, but employees with families, especially mothers, really don’t stand much chance in that kind of environment. Bopper This is simply reality in the fast-paced world of technology. Is Intel guilty of over-working their employees? In some cases, sure. Same as other chip vendors, software co.’s, any organization in a clock-driven environment where a product release on time means success and a slip could cost millions of dollars. If that’s too harsh you can always consider working for the government. Lil25 Maybe men should step up and take care of the kids they helped create? Maybe they should have to work AND take care of the kids and do all the housework too! discountbrains . Maybe that’s because Intel has slipped behind in some areas. I have some stock in a chip co that might be taking over in the next big thing with something Intel never thought of. The co has been working on it several years before the tech people heard of it. BC But, But, but women..are supposed to be able to handle those pressures–it’s why they are demanding equal pay. This new society we live in has been teaching this for years in the education system that ‘men and women’ are the same and ‘gender is merely a social construct’ Field Dog So White males that devoted their career to Intel are not getting promotions or even lost their jobs. Pity the White male that is looking for employment with Intel. He will be passed over, even if he has the qualifications that exceed all others. This is Fact. Ask Human Resource for Intel’s’ recent hired list in the last 2 years. Transsubstantial Intel cut its workforce 11% in 2016. It absolutely is a racist and sexist policy of exclusion. Bopper Oh, really? And you base this on exactly what? rightislight how is a workforce reduction racist and/or sexist? Lil25 No. But, it is ageist. rightislight More from the tolerant left… who’s surprised? discountbrains . Yet more warfare against the white male. In the only account given about Bill O’Reilly’s activities I heard sounded like he did Nothing wrong.

Citing a “pretty accurate” source, the blog claims next-gen iMacs will feature Intel’s more powerful Xeon E3 chips with up to sixty-four gigabytes of Error-Correcting Code (ECC) RAM, faster flash storage with capacities up to two terabytes, Thunderbolt 3, USB-C and more. These upcoming high-end iMacs should use Intel’s unreleased Xeon E3-1285 v6 chip that will likely include updated Intel HD Graphics. Although the machines are said to ship with 16GB of RAM, users will be able to upgrade the memory to 32GB or 64GB. By comparison, existing iMacs ship with 8GB of standard (non-ECC) RAM that can be expanded to 16GB or 32GB. The inclusion of EEC RAM that detects and repairs data errors is another sign that these all-in-ones will be pitched heavily to creative pros. Like the current models, the new iMacs will use NVMe PCIe-based SSDs or Fusion Drives up to 2TB. Other rumors features include beefier AMD graphics to support virtual reality and pro apps (versus AMD Radeon R9 GPUs in the current 27-inch iMac model), Thunderbolt 3 ports and USB-C Gen 2. “Apple is also working on a 8K display for the next generation of Mac Pro’s, which will be much more like a PC with the next generation EFI BIOS,” reads the report. The machines should be unveiled in late October alongside a brand new keyboard. Prior rumors have indicated that a next-generation Apple keyboard may incorporate a Touch Bar and Touch ID, like the new MacBook Pro. Apple might even use a dynamic keyboard technology from Australian startup Sonder to create an iMac keyboard with a small e-ink display on each key. This would let users quickly change their keyboard layout on the fly, use per-app shortcuts akin to Touch Bar and so forth. The most popular Apple desktop with pros is an iMac—hardly a surprise knowing many pro customers have been moving to iMacs due to the lack of Mac Pro updates. Subscribe to iDownloadBlog on YouTube Apple’s software engineering chief Craig Federighi says the flagship 5K iMac is being used for anything from audio and video editing to graphics to arts and more. All those things that would’ve previously absolutely required the Mac Pros of old, are being “well-addressed” by iMacs, he said, adding that there’s still even further Apple can take iMac as a high performance, pro system. “We think that form factor can address even more of the pro market,” he said. Earlier this week, the company refreshed Mac Pros. In an unprecedented move, the Cupertino company also pre-announced a next-generation Mac Pro with a highly modular design and Apple-branded external displays, both of which should release some time next year.

AMD is trying to take the game to Intel in this lucrative market. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Apr 6, 2017 at 12:36PM Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is trying to take the game to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in server chips with its Naples platform. However, this is easier said than done as Intel owns the server-chip market hands down with a market share of over 90%. In fact, its dominance in this market is so absolute that the chip giant's products accounted for 99.3% of server chip shipments in the third quarter of 2016. AMD, therefore, needed to come up with a game-changing product before even thinking of shaking Intel's vice-like grip over this market. But it believes that its Naples high-performance server processor is capable enough to unsettle the market leader. AMD takes Intel head-on AMD previewed its Naples server processor in the first week of March. It showed a product packed with high-end specs to gain a performance advantage over Intel. The company claims that the Naples architecture has 45% more cores and 122% more bandwidth memory than its competitor. Image source: AMD.  This competitor is none other than Intel, and AMD made that clear by demonstrating the capabilities of its platform against Intel's fastest server offering, a 2-socket Xeon chip, in a number of scenarios involving seismic analysis that's used to locate natural-resource deposits. Not surprisingly, AMD Naples was the faster chip in all the scenarios. As it turns out, AMD Naples can process a workload two times faster than the Intel Xeon when both are running the same number of cores and identical memory bandwidth. The performance gain jumps to 2.5 times when Naples runs more cores and a higher memory bandwidth. AMD's strategy of bringing a more powerful chip indicates that it could do better on the performance front, though we would have to wait for the actual results as Naples will be launched in the second quarter. This is why investors should take the faster benchmark performance with a grain of salt until and unless independent tests establish Naples' supremacy over Intel's product. Why is AMD going against Intel in servers? AMD has a pretty solid reason for going against Intel to tap the server-chip market with a solution that has superior specs. The global market for data-center servers could grow at an annual pace of 4.89% until 2021, according to Technavio's Data Center Server Market report. This should create a stronger demand for server chips as they play a mission-critical role of enabling fast data transfer over the network in data centers. Now, an explosion of data will drive data-center workloads higher. The Cisco Global Cloud Index projects that traffic related to cloud data centers will jump a whopping 262% in 2020 from 2015 levels, with 92% of the workload being processed in the cloud. This is where AMD's Naples will come into play, as it seems capable of handling more workload due to higher specifications if the benchmarks are taken at face value. What's more, modular data centers can also use AMD's server chips to tackle the growing workload as they provide incremental capacity to the existing infrastructure, apart from being used in remote areas. This could be a big deal for AMD as Markets and Markets expects the modular data-center infrastructure market to grow threefold by the end of the decade. AMD, however, is not going to have a free run given Intel's near-monopoly in this space, as the latter won't wait for its rivals to eat into its market share. Additionally, Intel's response to AMD's potential threat is yet to come, which could make the game interesting if the company comes out with a more powerful offering. But Intel needs to be on its toes because the high-performance Naples platform could help AMD carve out a small piece of the server-chip market for itself as it solves the problem of greater workloads in data centers.

Apple did not share any specific details about what the upgrades will entail, but if the blog Pike's Universum is to be believed, the next-generation iMac lineup could feature several improvements that make Apple's desktop computer a more powerful workstation for professionals and average consumers alike. The blog, citing a "little bird" that is "usually pretty accurate," claims the incoming iMac lineup will be available with up to the following tech specs: • Intel Xeon E3 processors: The new iMac will supposedly have up to a pro-grade Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor. Intel has not released that particular chip yet, but based on previous generations of the E3-1285, the processor could essentially be the E3-1280 v6 coupled with integrated Intel HD Graphics P630. • 16GB to 64GB of ECC RAM: 16GB of ECC RAM, configurable to 32GB or 64GB, in line with the current Mac Pro. iMacs currently have 8GB of non-ECC RAM, configurable to 16GB or 32GB. ECC RAM can detect and repair errors that cause data corruption and system crashes. No word if it will be DDR3L or DDR4. • Faster NVMe SSDs: The rumor claims the next iMacs will have faster NVM Express PCIe-based flash storage with capacities up to 2TB. The current 4K and 5K iMac models are also configurable with NVMe PCIe-based SSDs or Fusion Drives up to 2TB. • AMD graphics: The new iMacs will supposedly have AMD graphics options to support virtual reality and professional apps. The inclusion of AMD graphics in the next iMac has been rumored previously by Bloomberg. The current 27-inch iMac uses AMD Radeon R9 GPUs. • Thunderbolt 3: Thunderbolt 3 ports would be an unsurprising inclusion in the next iMacs given they already exist on the latest MacBook Pro. Thunderbolt 3 carries power, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA over a single cable, creating one standard for connecting most accessories and peripherals.The report claims the next iMac models will be unveiled in late October and be accompanied by a brand new keyboard. A previous report said Apple was exploring a standalone keyboard with a Touch Bar and Touch ID, but its release allegedly depends upon how well those features have been received on the latest MacBook Pro. The blog also claims Apple is working on an 8K external display for Apple's "completely rethought" Mac Pro. This isn't a rumor we've heard before, but Apple did confirm it is working on a new Apple-branded pro display of an unspecified resolution. Dell recently launched a 32-inch 8K display for $5,000. Another tidbit mentioned in the report is that macOS 10.13 supposedly will not use a mountain or park name anymore, with two alternative names in the running, including one that starts with the letter M. One of Apple's trademarked names that could fit that description is Monterey. Last, the report said the next high-end Mac mini "won't be so mini anymore," suggesting that the most expensive model might have a larger or taller design. Apple recently said the Mac mini is "important" within its product lineup, but it remained tight-lipped about the prospects of future updates. Pike's Universum is best known for spotting references to unreleased Macs or upcoming software versions hidden within Apple's operating systems. The blog does not have an established track record of reporting on Apple's plans based on its own inside sources, so this rumor should be treated with caution for now. Apple last updated the iMac in October 2015, a span of 541 days, per the MacRumors Buyer's Guide.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Corp. fell as much as 9% Thursday after Goldman Sachs cited Intel and Nvidia as threats and initiated coverage on the stock with a sell rating. Analyst Toshiya Hari slapped an $11 price target on the stock, which implies 22% downside from Wednesday’s closing price of $14.17. AMD’s AMD, -6.35% shares traded just below $14 in late-morning trade. The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to hold, while the average 12-month price target is $11.97, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 30 analysts. The bearish note follows huge gains for AMD’s stock over the past year. Its shares have increased 14% in the past three months and roughly 361% in the past year. It has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 SPX, +0.19% which is up 3.4% in the past three months and 14% in the past year. Hari said he expects the stock to start underperforming the market after AMD’s analyst day in May. While he acknowledges the strides AMD has made under Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su since she was appointed in 2012, he believes the stock has already priced in a sharp improvement in its competitive and financial position and finds current valuation metrics difficult to justify. Among the problems facing AMD is competition from Intel Corp. INTC, -0.52%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.73% which Hari said will likely offset any meaningful traction AMD gets with new products. In March, AMD announced a new processor called Ryzen, a high-performance chip aimed at gamers, and Naples, a server chip aimed at Intel’s Xeon. It also released Vega, a graphics processing unit that competes with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics card. See Also: AMD investors get spooked by Ryzen’s mixed reviews “We see two potential pitfalls to the company’s long-term financial targets,” said Hari. “If AMD were to gain meaningful traction with its new products in 2017, we believe Intel and Nvidia would be likely to fight back in late-2017 and/or 2018 in the form of pricing concessions.” Even if AMD’s competition doesn’t try to undercut it by cost, Hari said there is still upside risk to AMD’s profit margins in the form of increased operating expenses, as the chipmaker expands its distribution channel to facilitate new product launches. AMD’s cost of sales soared 12.5% year-over-year in 2016. Nvidia, by comparison, has been a rising star in the chip world, having benefited from ambitious investments in autonomous cars, gaming and artificial intelligence. Nvidia and Audi predict self-driving car by 2020 (1:48) Nvidia, a leader in self-driving technology, announced partnerships with Bosch and Audi at CES 2017. Rob Csongor, Nvidia's automotive general manager, talked to MarketWatch about the company's promise to have a self-driving car on the road by 2020. Nvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016. Its shares have gained nearly 177% in the past 12 months, though they’ve underperformed the market recently as analysts raise questions about its ability to sustain that growth. On Wednesday, Canaccord Genuity cut its price target on Nvidia by $5 to $125. The day prior, Pacific Crest downgraded Nvidia stock to underweight from sector weight, citing market saturation for desktop graphics chips that could hinder its growth. Intel, on the other hand, has stumbled under the weight of its own fumbled mobile strategy and competition in other areas, notably from Qualcomm Corp.

Added by Agency Staff on 6 April 2017. Saved under World Tags: Brian Krzanich, Intel Tweet Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Intel boosted CEO Brian Krzanich’s compensation package 30% to US$19,1m last year, fuelled by a bigger stock award and costs for his personal security arrangements. Intel’s board awarded Krzanich, 56, stock worth $11,7m, a 20% increase from 2015, according to a proxy statement on Thursday. The CEO also received $1,2m in salary, $3,7m in bonuses and about $2,1m in security services, plus other smaller items. The decision to bolster the security programme came as Krzanich in April last year said that some senior executives had faced backlash for the company’s stance and efforts on diversity, according to a TechCrunch report. In 2015, the CEO pledged Intel would spend $300m to make the gender and ethnicity of the company’s workforce representative of the US population by 2020. He also vowed to tie executive pay to that goal. The world’s largest chip maker, like many other tech companies, has faced criticism for employing few women, blacks and Hispanics. In its diversity report for fiscal 2016, Intel said it achieved pay parity for women and underrepresented minorities and increased its share of female employees to 25,8%, a 2,3% gain since 2014. The company spent $1,9m on personal security for Krzanich and another $275 200 to protect his residence. Executive vice president Venkata Renduchintala received security services worth $944 800 and Stacy Smith, who oversees manufacturing, operations and sales, got $309 900. The threats were targeted against the CEO and certain other executives, and in some cases their family members, according to the filing, which didn’t provide details on the specific arrangements. By comparison, Intel spent $39 600 for Krzanich’s security in 2015. His full compensation that year was $14,6m. The CEO is trying to remake the company by converting its dominance in PC chips into a presence in markets ranging from cars to mobile phones to drones. That push has yet to provide Intel with enough revenue and profit to shake its dependence on its main source of income. Its finances are increasingly reliant on demand for processors running server computers in giant data centres that support computing over the Internet. Krzanich’s annual bonus, which paid out slightly above its $3,5m target, is tied to absolute and relative financial performance, and operational goals. About 60% of his stock award is linked to total shareholder return and vests if Intel beats the median return among a group of tech companies over three years. The remaining shares vest in increments over three years as long as he remains on the job. Neither his stock awards nor his bonus listed any targets for diversity. Renduchintala, who joined the company in November 2015, received a $20,4m pay package.  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 13SA is now junk – thanks to Jacob Zuma 9Expert warns SA on too much renewable energy 7Telkom to hike line rental fees 5Zuma has ‘done SA great harm’ 5The war on Kodi Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media

Doesn't Answer an Important Question At the chipmaker's recent Technology and Manufacturing Day, one analyst asked an excellent question about chip innovation. The answer, though, was less than satisfactory in this Fool's eyes. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 6, 2017 at 9:30AM One thing that has been frustrating about chip giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) current seventh-generation Core processors for personal computers -- and what will be frustrating about its upcoming eighth-generation Core processors -- is their apparent lack of architectural innovation.  A brief review may be in order. Back in the second half of 2015, Intel introduced a processor architecture that it called Skylake, which brought a lot of new technologies to Intel's chips: redesigned processor and graphics cores, improved multimedia cores, new (to PC chips, anyway) technologies like integrated sensor hubs and image signal processors, a new display engine, and other goodies.  Image source: Intel. In late 2016, Intel rolled out a successor to Skylake known as Kaby Lake. which largely reused the same cores and technologies as its predecessor -- though it did come with an improved media engine. However, thanks to  an upgraded manufacturing technology, Kaby Lake chips were more efficient and more powerful than their Skylake counterparts.  Later this year and in the first half of 2018, Intel will reuse that same basic Skylake architecture in its eighth-generation Core processors (to be called Kaby Lake Refresh and Coffee Lake, depending on the product segment). Once again, Intel plans to bring enhanced manufacturing technology to bear, and this time around, it will boost the number of processor cores included in its chips. The good news is that Intel should be able to deliver on its promise of newer, better products each year. The bad news is that, for a third product generation in a row, Intel isn't making fundamental improvements to its key processor and graphics technologies.  At Intel's Technology and Manufacturing (TMG) Day, one analyst asked the following question about this very topic: Why not introduce a new architecture design sooner than Ice Lake, which is 2019? You guys used to do architecture redesign every two years and now it's, between Skylake and Ice Lake, it's going to be like four years unless I'm mistaken. Architectural design used to be independent of nodes. So why not introduce one sooner than later? Let's look at what Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala had to say.  Deconstructing the answer Renduchintala began by arguing that in this discussion "we need to be really precise about the expansiveness of terms like architecture." He then went on to clarify that "we can talk about new ways of interconnecting the various [intellectual property] blocks within a [system-on-a-chip] to get better performance, but let's also be clear that what we're also doing is upgrading key pieces of [intellectual property] such as CPU or GPU, looking at different configurations of clocks and memory bus access speeds." This is where Renduchintala lost me. The problem isn't that Intel isn't changing up how it hooks up its CPU cores, graphics cores, and other pieces of technologies; it's precisely that Intel hasn't really changed those intellectual properties over the course of several generations that's the problem.  Renduchintala then went on to say that "there isn't really a panacea where you basically move toward a complete new architecture that in and of itself is necessarily going to give you all of those gains." I agree with him when he says that to get the kinds of product-level performance increases that the company aims to deliver on an annual basis, Intel's teams need to deliver on a "mixture of modification at the chip level construct, the improvement of [intellectual property], looking at the transistor process evolution, and creating a compound chemistry of that actually give[s] that performance improvement." Where Renduchintala and I disagree is on whether Intel has really been fully exploiting the product-enhancement opportunities available to it. What I would like to see Intel do Intel has done a good job of reshaping its chip development methodology to allow it to deliver new products at an annual cadence, even if it can't move to tinier manufacturing technologies every two years like it had hoped to do. However, if Intel could deliver annual improvements in the underlying chip architectures themselves -- that is, if it could improve how each individual intellectual property block (like CPU and graphics) processes data -- I think that could help it deliver even larger generation-over-generation product improvements. What I'd like to know is why Intel left its key intellectual properties largely unchanged between its sixth-generation and eighth-generation cores. Was it simply due to time-to-market concerns, potentially owing to the seventh- and eighth-generation Core products being added to the company's product roadmap relatively late in the game? Or would Intel have stuck with those same intellectual properties even if it had known many years in advance that it would need to stay on derivatives of its 14-nanometer technology for a while? Perhaps Intel will shed some light on these topics at some point in the future.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Shares of Advanced Micro Devices Corp. fell as much as 9% Thursday after Goldman Sachs cited Intel and Nvidia as threats and initiated coverage on the stock with a sell rating. Analyst Toshiya Hari slapped an $11 price target on the stock, which implies 22% downside from Wednesday’s closing price of $14.17. AMD’s AMD, -6.35% shares traded just below $14 in late-morning trade. The average rating on the stock is the equivalent to hold, while the average 12-month price target is $11.97, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 30 analysts. The bearish note follows huge gains for AMD’s stock over the past year. Its shares have increased 14% in the past three months and roughly 361% in the past year. It has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 SPX, +0.19% which is up 3.4% in the past three months and 14% in the past year. Hari said he expects the stock to start underperforming the market after AMD’s analyst day in May. While he acknowledges the strides AMD has made under Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su since she was appointed in 2012, he believes the stock has already priced in a sharp improvement in its competitive and financial position and finds current valuation metrics difficult to justify. Among the problems facing AMD is competition from Intel Corp. INTC, -0.52%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.73% which Hari said will likely offset any meaningful traction AMD gets with new products. In March, AMD announced a new processor called Ryzen, a high-performance chip aimed at gamers, and Naples, a server chip aimed at Intel’s Xeon. It also released Vega, a graphics processing unit that competes with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics card. See Also: AMD investors get spooked by Ryzen’s mixed reviews “We see two potential pitfalls to the company’s long-term financial targets,” said Hari. “If AMD were to gain meaningful traction with its new products in 2017, we believe Intel and Nvidia would be likely to fight back in late-2017 and/or 2018 in the form of pricing concessions.” Even if AMD’s competition doesn’t try to undercut it by cost, Hari said there is still upside risk to AMD’s profit margins in the form of increased operating expenses, as the chipmaker expands its distribution channel to facilitate new product launches. AMD’s cost of sales soared 12.5% year-over-year in 2016. Nvidia, by comparison, has been a rising star in the chip world, having benefited from ambitious investments in autonomous cars, gaming and artificial intelligence. Nvidia and Audi predict self-driving car by 2020 (1:48) Nvidia, a leader in self-driving technology, announced partnerships with Bosch and Audi at CES 2017. Rob Csongor, Nvidia's automotive general manager, talked to MarketWatch about the company's promise to have a self-driving car on the road by 2020. Nvidia was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2016. Its shares have gained nearly 177% in the past 12 months, though they’ve underperformed the market recently as analysts raise questions about its ability to sustain that growth. On Wednesday, Canaccord Genuity cut its price target on Nvidia by $5 to $125. The day prior, Pacific Crest downgraded Nvidia stock to underweight from sector weight, citing market saturation for desktop graphics chips that could hinder its growth. Intel, on the other hand, has stumbled under the weight of its own fumbled mobile strategy and competition in other areas, notably from Qualcomm Corp. QCOM, +0.11% Its shares have declined 1% in the past three months and are up just 13% in the past year.

Colin Johnson 4/6/2017 10:31 AM EDT Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet PORTLAND Ore. — The paradigm of real-time machine learning is eliminating many of the human-driven elements in the physical design of microchips, according to speakers at the Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM's) International Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD). IEEE- and Intel-Fellow Pradeep Dubey of Intel's Parallel Computing Lab outlined how cognitive computers will take over many human elements in his keynote presentation the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine. IEEE- and Intel-Fellow Pradeep Dubey of Intel's Parallel Computing Lab in ISPD's "Machine Learning in EDA" session featured presented the "Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine". (Source: EE Times) "Traditionally, machines crunched numbers and humans made the decisions in the physical design of chips," said Dubey. "But now machines can do both, taking computing into a whole new realm." Previous attempts to hand over the decision making job to computers, namely rule-based artificial intelligence (AI), failed because the experts each had their own style and could not agree on an optimal set of rules. However, today cognitive computers can perform each of the four steps involved in human decision making, namely sensing, reasoning, acting, adapting and repeat, until an optimal design is achieved. In his keynote talk Xilinx 's Ivo Bolsens explains how FPGAs make the ideal platform for EDA machine learning by providing the best performance/watt. (Source: Xilinx) Today neural-network-based deep-learning cognitive-computers, however, can perform each of those four steps, albeit with a time-lag introduced during each step. According to Dubey, our task today is to increase the speed of each of those steps until they achieve realtime operation, at which point cognitive computers can take over many of the human-based elements of the physical design of microchips. The biggest stumbling block, according to Dubey, is the deep-learning during the sensing and reasoning steps. To overcome that Intel described its new "Lake Crest" addition to its Xeon processor family, which makes use of the hardware neural networks it acquired from Nervana Systems last year. Lake Crest, according to Dubey, will enable deep-learning to take on the Big Data sets used in producing billion-gate chips in realtime. Keynote speaker Ivo Bolsens, a senior vice president and chief technology officer at Xilinx, on the other hand, claimed that field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) alone can do the same job. (Of course, Intel also has FPGA technology by virtue of its acquisition of Altera in 2015.) Nevertheless, Bolsens claimed that FPGA's can accelerate the deep learning step and eventually will result in "all programmable platforms" where every part of a system-on-chip (SoC) will be hardware configurable. "The biggest advantage of FPGAs is their very rich interconnect," said Bolsens. "There are plenty of global memory and data flow architectures that works well for machine learning on FPGAs." This year's ISPD contest, sponsored by Xilinx for its FPGA pictured, concentrated on a key constraint in placement, namely clock legalization for reduced runtimes and increased routability as measured by wire length as the primary metric. (Source: Xilinx) Bolsens also claimed that, to date, FPGAs have leveraged Moore’s Law more than any other type of chip, today achieving as many as 13 layers of programmable interconnect, thus allowing any gate to talk to any other. In addition, 28-nanometer is the sweet-spot for FPGAs, since the cost-per-gate is at a minimum at that node -- increasing when you take FPGAs to smaller geometries. Using multiple-die in the same package, as is the trend at Xilinx today, enables its short-reach 150 giga-bit per second interconnects to create one-tera-bit per second systems-in-package (SiP). Contest One fun highlight of each year's ISPD is its contest sponsored this year by Xilinx and called "Clock-Aware FPGA Placement." The contest motivated research groups worldwide to take on one of the most challenging problems in modern FPGA physical design--how to achieve the fastest clock speeds by reducing the length of its interconnects. The winning team came from the University of Texas at Austin, which also won the ISPD contest in 2016 too! The University of Austin was followed by National Taiwan University (NTU), Chinese University of Hong Kong, the National Chiao Tung University (Taiwan) and the University of Guelph (Canada). — R.

Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Apr 6, 2017 at 9:00AM Earlier this week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) graphics technology supplier Imagination Technologies disclosed that it had been notified that Apple is planning on dropping the company within the next two years. Shares of Imagination lost two-thirds of their value that day, which isn't all that surprising given Apple accounts for fully half of all revenue. While there are some legal uncertainties surrounding whether or not Apple can actually craft its own GPU architecture without infringing on any of Imagination's intellectual property, if the Mac maker pulls it off, its A series of chips would become even more vertically integrated than ever before. That should scare Apple's current discrete GPU suppliers for the Mac, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). The bad news There's been no shortage of debate over the years about the possibility of Apple ditching Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as the main CPU supplier for Macs. Apple switched to Intel a dozen years ago, and Apple introduced its first proprietary chip, the A4, seven years ago. As Apple continues to make progress with making its A series of chips increasingly more powerful, it approaches a day when it could conceivable transition to its own designs. The most recent A10 Fusion is already comparable to low-end Intel chips in terms of performance. Image source: Apple. The same threat exists for NVIDIA and AMD. Apple cyclically switches between the two GPU specialists, with AMD currently enjoying Mac design wins wherever discrete GPUs are necessary (15-inch MacBook Pro, 27-inch iMac 5K, and Mac Pro). But NVIDIA scored the last cycle, and could very well win the next one. Given Apple's clearly expanding graphics ambitions, it will naturally target integrated graphics architecture first, like what A chips currently use. The possible progression is this: Apple eventually supplants Intel for CPUs with integrated graphics by using its A chips, and then way farther down the line considers making discrete GPUs for high-end applications. To be clear, these possibilities are far in the future. It's going to be a long time until A chips can compete with high-end Intel chips on performance, and an even longer time until Apple could even conceivably compete with high-end discrete GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD. But the point is that this is all potentially in Apple's long-term road map, in which case it's a risk that NVIDIA and AMD (and their respective shareholders) must acknowledge. The good news Fortunately, both companies continue to diversify away from the discrete GPU market. Much of NVIDIA's share gains over the past year are primarily attributable to progress in autonomous driving technology, artificial intelligence, and data centers. Gaming still represents nearly 60% of revenue, but the other segments are all putting up strong double-digit growth (or triple-digit growth, in the case of data centers). AMD has been focusing on the game console market, and its processors power both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. These semi-custom processors, along with the enterprise and embedded business, now represent the majority of sales (54%), and it's even profitable too, unlike the computing and graphics segment that includes Apple's business. NVIDIA and AMD have plenty of time to continue diversifying their businesses, but eventually (i.e., potentially 10 years or more) Apple might ditch them, too. Evan Niu, CFA owns shares of Apple.

Expect more 360-degree replays while watching NFL games. Intel will install its high-tech cameras in more stadiums across the NFL as part of an expanded partnership with the league that extends through the 2018 season. The tech giant announced today that its “freeD technology” will capture live action in select NFL stadiums, adding to existing installations in San Francisco, Baltimore, and Houston. Intel did not provide specifics on which additional stadiums will be equipped with the cameras. The company said the replays will serve “fans on NFL’s digital and mobile platforms.” In a statement, NFL SVP of Digital Media Vishal Shal added that “fans will be able to experience compelling new vantage points of game action, both at home and in the stadium.” Intel’s 360-degree replay technology, a result of Intel’s acquisition last year of Israel-based Replay Technologies, is used by leagues like the NBA, MLB, and NFL during live broadcasts — including the Super Bowl in February. It utilizes dozens of 5K ultra-high definition cameras to create 360-degree replays. The technology was featured in a recent Intel ad with LeBron James. As Intel Sports leader James Carwana explained to GeekWire earlier this year, the 360-degree replay technology is all about “volumetric video.” From Carwana: “With Intel’s 360-degree replay technology, what we are doing is digitizing the volume of an arena. Picture a stadium filled with all these tiny little cubes of voxels — that’s essentially what we are creating. Once you digitize the volume of an arena, you can do amazing things. You have an opportunity to fly a virtual camera and you can see things where there isn’t a physical camera. We can show you exactly what a player is seeing at a moment of time. What is the quarterback seeing when he looked to pass? Our belief is that it will allow fans to experience the game in ways they haven’t been able to before.” The technology also enables a “Be the Player” view that gives fans the POV from a specific player; Intel is slowly rolling this feature out. James Carwana. Photo via Intel. Intel continues to ink partnerships and roll out new technology in the sports world. Last month it inked a deal with the NCAA and Turner to broadcast March Madness games in virtual reality. That was made possible by Intel’s acquisition of virtual reality startup Voke last year. Intel dabbled in sports several years ago, and made a statement at its CES keynote in 2016, spending nearly half of the presentation on its partnerships with ESPN’s X Games, New Balance, and others. Then the company established its Intel Sports Group this past fall, right around the Voke acquisition, and has continued building products and services with wearable computing, virtual reality, connected devices, and more that have application in the sports world. “Our job is to help fans or athletes,” Carwana told GeekWire in January. “By doing so, our belief is that we can create new value for folks like leagues or rights holders. Or, from an athlete perspective, how can we help athletes and teams perform at their peak level?” Love tech and sports? Sign up for our GeekWire Sports email newsletter for ongoing coverage of the innovations transforming the world of sports.  Sports Tech Headlines Around the Web SBNation: NFL will use laser scans to design safer cleats Fast Company: How Neuroscience Might Help The San Francisco Giants Win The World Series CBS Sports: CBS Sports creates an exciting future for sports broadcasting USA Today: Spain benefits from video technology in 2-0 win over France Forbes : How Opendorse Is Offering More Efficient Athlete Endorsements Taylor Soper is a GeekWire staff reporter who covers a wide variety of tech assignments, including emerging startups in Seattle and Portland, the sharing economy and the intersection of technology and sports.

Years after Intel released the low-power, Linux-compatible Quark X1000 processor, which runs on the Intel Galileo and numerous IoT gateways, the chipmaker last year launched three microcontroller-like Quarks that do not run Linux. Like the original Quarks, the Quark D1000 is limited to Pentium ISA compatibility and supports only bare metal implementations. The Quark D2000 and similar Quark SE C1000, which drives the Intel Curie module, also supply full Intel x86 ISA. They lack an x86 FPU but can still run RTOSes like Zephyr. At ELC 2017, Intel’s Daniele Alessandrelli describes the Quark Format Upgrade (QFU) image format he created for the QM-Bootloader (click image to enlarge) Considering the minimal MCU footprint and lack of Linux-associated technologies like U-Boot, Intel had to develop a Quark D2000/SE bootloader from scratch. At the Embedded Linux Conference in February, Intel software engineer Daniele Alessandrelli detailed the inner workings of the Intel Quark Microcontroller Bootloader (QM-Bootloader). In his presentation, Alessandrelli also described security extensions added to version 1.4 of the BSD-licensed QM-Bootloader. Designed for the D2000 and SE C1000, the QM-Bootloader offers typical bootstrap features such as system initialization, trim code computation, and restore context from sleep. It also provides Firmware Management (FM) functionality based on the DFU (Device Firmware Update) protocol and its most popular host tool, dfu-util. Alessandrelli and his team needed to adapt dfu-util to work over UART as well as USB. This would provide a uniform firmware-upgrade experience whether developers were working with the USB 1.1-enabled SE or the standard D2000, which lacks USB support. Quark SE block diagram (click image to enlarge) The D2000 and SE Quarks both feature 32MHz, x86-based Lakemont cores, but only the SE offers a 32MHz ARC sensor subsystem core. Further complicating the QM-Bootloader development process was the fact that the SE provides more memory: 80kB SRAM and 384kB flash. Both models, however, conveniently share an 8kB allotment of OTP (one-time programmable) SRAM. “From the bootloader point of view the two Quarks are quite similar because we put our bootloader in OTP,” said Alessandrelli, who, together with Jesus Sanchez-Palencia, maintains the project. “The 8kB limitation was a restraint, but we were still able to implement a modular approach so we could add new transports and potentially OTA updates in future.” The foundation of the QM-Bootloader is the DFU protocol, which provides a way to transfer data to the device with DFU_DNLOAD for FM, as well as extract data with DFU_UPLOAD. Both are block-based mechanisms: All blocks except the last must have the same size. “We decided to use DFU because it is open source, well documented, and designed for resource constrained devices,” said Alessandrelli. “Also, DFU doesn’t define any specific image format, and we wanted to do our own image format with its own metadata and authentication mechanism. We don’t have enough RAM or flash to store a full image, so we needed to develop our own block-wise transfer/flashing protocol to allow us to write an image a block at a time.” To adapt DFU for UART, the Intel team created a Quark DFU Adaptation (QDA) protocol. “QDA makes DFU available over any message transport,” said Alessandrelli. “Because UART is stream oriented, we added the old XMODEM-CRC protocol layer to transport QDA packets. QDA provides all DFU request/response messages, such as DFU_UPLOAD, and also mimics some generic USB functionality, including active alternate settings. We needed a different host code for QDA/UART, so we modified dfu-util to replace the USB layer with QDA/UART.” The resulting qm-dfu-util code is available on GitHub, licensed under GPLv2. On top of the QDA layer, the Intel team defined a Quark Format Upgrade (QFU) image format that works with generic DFU tools and supports firmware authentication (see photo with diagram farther above). This “very simple block-wise format” adds a header to the first block of the binary, “so it’s processed before the image,” said Alessandrelli. The header is subdivided into a base header, which contains information like the target device and the vendor and product ID, as well as an extended header used for authentication. “We do not add any specific memory address to the header, but instead assume the flash is divided into partitions, and that every image is targeting a partition,” said Alessandrelli. This setup enables the bootloader to support a single partition on the D2000, and two partitions on the ARC-enabled SE model. This also enables future schemes such as multiple partitions per core, which might come in handy for OTA. Finally, the Quark Firmware Management (QFM) protocol runs on top of the DFU layers, thereby enabling functionality beyond firmware upgrade, such as key provisioning, application erase, and system/firmware information retrieval. QFM is basically a request (DFU_DNLOAD ) or response (upload) protocol.   QM-Bootloader 1.4 adds security features Alessandrelli went on to describe new Secure Firmware Upgrade extensions that have been added to QM-Bootloader 1.4’s QFM layer to enable authenticated firmware upgrades. Due to the Quark’s limitations, he could not use a public key scheme. Instead, he chose a simple symmetric key scheme called HMAC256. “With HMAC, the image is verified using the same key that is used to sign it, and the key must be located within the device,” said Alessandrelli. “We decided not to hard-code the key, but instead provided users with the key management functionality so at runtime they can provide the key.” Alessandrelli explains latest secure firmware upgrade additions to QM-Bootloader (click image to enlarge) The QFU header is extended with an HMAC extended header. “We don’t compute the HMAC for the entire image, but we authenticate the header, adding an array of hashes, one for each block that composes the image,” said Alessandrelli. “We authenticate the header using HMAC, then start receiving blocks of images.We compute the SHA of every block and compare it with the SHA in the header.” The security enhancements address the challenge of ensuring partition consistency — how to handle failures that can leave partitions in an inconsistent state, for example, due to a reset during a firmware update. The new code associates a consistency flag to every partition and stores this metadata in a bootloader file called BL-Data. The updated bootloader also adds key management. “We basically define and authenticate a key update request, an extension of QFM,” said Alessandrelli. “We use double-signing, providing both the firmware key, which is used to authenticate an image, as well as a revocation key.” Although this scheme will need to be modified if they add OTA support in the future, “since right now we’re only supporting wired and point to point USB or UART transfer, a man in the middle attack is defeatable,” he noted. Alessandrelli also described security enhancements used to protect BL-DATA using CRC and further explained how partitions are related to targets. The enhancements are designed to support future upgrades to OTA and other additions, such as BLE modules with their own firmware. Alessandrelli concluded with some lessons learned, such as the importance of reusing existing open source code and using a modular approach. “By not pre-optimizing for footprint, we can adapt to changing requirements,” he said. “By using link-time optimization, we could offset most of the overhead from the modular approach, giving us 15 to 20 percent savings in flash footprint saving.” Watch the complete presentation below.

Moving libdrm_intel into the Intel Mesa driver itself could allow for simplifying some areas of the code like relocation handling while not having to worry about breaking the ABI with libdrm enforcing ABI compatibility. Kenneth Graunke who has been leading this charge titled this set of 53 patches, "Eat libdrm_intel for breakfast." The libdrm_intel code is about 13,000 lines of code made up of 15 source files while this new version is three files and just over two thousand lines of code. Ken wrote more about their motives, "The rest of the [libdrm_intel] library is basically useless to us. It contains a lot of legacy cruft from the pre-GEM, DRI1, or 8xx/9xx era. But even the parts we do use are in bad shape. BO offset tracking is non-threadsafe. Relocation handling is way too complicated. These things waste memory, burn CPU time, and make it difficult for us to take advantage of new kernel features like I915_EXEC_NO_RELOC which would reduce overhead further. The unsynchronized mapping API performs a synchronized mapping on non-LLC platforms, which can massively hurt performance on Atoms. Mesa is also using uncached GTT mappings for almost everything on Atoms, rather than fast CPU or WC maps where possible." With the simplified code in Mesa, they are free to break their own ABI and can better future-proof the code as well as letting it evolve when warranted. Those wanting to learn more can see this mailing list patch series. There is some concern though about importing much of the Intel libdrm functionality into Mesa could cause problems for Intel-using non-Mesa components like Beignet, xf86-video-intel, and the VA-API Intel driver which all rely upon libdrm. From other comments on this patch series, it sounds like the plan is for the driver interfaces to still evolve a lot more. There's also some comments that the Intel VA-API driver should even be moved inside Mesa as it could share more code with the i965 driver. Interesting times ahead. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

What makes India the third largest global site for Artificial Intelligence companies? April 06, 2017 12:19 IST Experts believe adoption of AI in developing countries will be much faster than in developed nations, as the magnitude of change it will bring will be far larger. Alnoor Peermohamed reports. IMAGE: Intel will host 60 courses under its 'AI Developer Education Program'.

Intel is betting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive demand for its electronic chips, for which it is aiming to train 15,000 scientists, developers, engineers and students on AI in India over the next one year. The company will host 60 courses under its 'AI Developer Education Program'. These will train people on ways they can adopt AI for better research, testing or even building of products. Intel is looking at India due to the country's large base of technical talent. The country is the third largest global site for AI companies. "As India undergoes rapid digital transformation, data centres and the intelligence behind the data collected will enable the government and industry to make effective decisions based on algorithms. This means increasing opportunities for using AI in the country," said Prakash Mallya, managing director at Intel for South Asia. He says adoption of AI in developing countries would be much faster than in developed nations, as the magnitude of change it will bring will be far larger. Intel wishes to involve the government, academia and hospitals, too. Research on AI and Machine Learning is already on at all Indian Institutes of Technologies (IITs), the Indian Institute of Science and some private universities. The company is keen to partner with these institutions, to drive adoption of its services and to get the next generation of scientists and technologists trained for using its products and services. "Our research groups are currently working on implementation of evolutionary algorithms in parallel environments, and using Intel based platforms and software tools to deploy, parallelise and optimise systems," said Pushpak Bhattacharya, director at IIT, Patna. Intel says by 2020, AI would contribute to the biggest workload in data centres, as analysis of data becomes ever more important for businesses, governments and academia. Its products reflect this change, becoming more capable in handling tasks on machine learning, computer vision and the like. The company says use of AI in sectors such as autonomous driving and the internet of things will create massive amounts of data, which in turn will have to be analysed. Mallya says a million autonomous cars have the capacity to create half as much data as humanity creates as a whole today. AI may take your job, if you don't learn: IT leaders Flipkart looks at AI to predict sales As India's largest e-commerce marketplace Flipkart closes in on completing a decade in the business, it is looking to put in use its mammoth pile of data to predict sales of products months in advance. The company is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) solution that will give it an edge over rivals by helping it make smarter decisions in ordering, distribution and pricing products on its platform. Ultimately, the AI system will allow Flipkart to boost efficiency and reduce the cost of products for customers. "We (Flipkart) are trying to predict how many units of what we will sell. This is a very complex thing that is dependent on a variety of inputs such as price, discount or if an event, such as Diwali or Christmas is coming up," said Krishnendu Chaudhury, principal scientist and head of image sciences at Flipkart. While rival Amazon, which has around a 10-year headstart over Flipkart, is known to have some of the most advanced sales prediction engines, the Indian company has the advantage of having a bigger data set of the country's online consumer market. For AI engines to be trained, the more data available, the more accurate researchers can make them, so Amazon's advances globally might not count for much in India as consumer behaviour varies depending on the region as well as the shopping season. Flipkart, among the early entrants into India's e-commerce space, also has an advantage of its 100 million user base, the majority of them using its smartphone app. This gives it better insights to understand consumer behaviour, including their socio-economic background based on the smartphone they use, the signals they can capture from the places they travel and can target with the right products. It also helps that for majority of Indians, a smartphone is their first computing device, through which they listen to music, stream videos, share photos and transact online. Flipkart has not yet applied for a patent on its AI sales prediction engine and, hence, isn't keen on sharing too many details to safeguard its technology. The company says it has been successfully using AI in the fields of computer vision and language processing to build tools that help customers better search for products on its platform. "It (Flipkart's AI engine) will also look at something like how much hype is being created in the media about a certain product. For example, iPhone sales depend hugely on the media hype. So, we have to capture all these various things and it will make a very complex decision," added Chaudhury.

The Linux Foundation Years after Intel released the low-power, Linux-compatible Quark X1000 processor, which runs on the Intel Galileo and numerous IoT gateways, the chipmaker last year launched three microcontroller-like Quarks that do not run Linux. Like the original Quarks, the Quark D1000 is limited to Pentium ISA compatibility and supports only bare metal implementations. The Quark D2000 and similar Quark SE C1000, which drives the Intel Curie module, also supply full Intel x86 ISA. They lack an x86 FPU but can still run RTOSes like Zephyr. Considering the minimal MCU footprint, and lack of Linux-associated technologies like U-Boot, Intel had to develop a Quark D2000/SE bootloader from scratch. At the Embedded Linux Conference in February, Intel software engineer Daniele Alessandrelli detailed the inner workings of the Intel Quark Microcontroller Bootloader (QM-Bootloader). In his presentation, Alessandrelli also described security extensions added to version 1.4 of the BSD-licensed QM-Bootloader. Designed for the D2000 and SE C1000, the QM-Bootloader offers typical bootstrap features such as system initialization, trim code computation, and restore context from sleep. It also provides Firmware Management (FM) functionality based on the DFU (Device Firmware Update) protocol and its most popular host tool, dfu-util. Alessandrelli and his team needed to adapt dfu-util to work over UART as well as USB. This would provide a uniform firmware-upgrade experience whether developers were working with the USB 1.1-enabled SE or the standard D2000, which lacks USB support. The D2000 and SE Quarks both feature 32MHz, x86-based Lakemont cores, but only the SE offers a 32MHz ARC sensor subsystem core. Further complicating the QM-Bootloader development process was the fact that the SE provides more memory: 80kB SRAM and 384kB flash. Both models, however, conveniently share an 8kB allotment of OTP (one-time programmable) SRAM. “From the bootloader point of view the two Quarks are quite similar because we put our bootloader in OTP,” said Alessandrelli, who, together with Jesus Sanchez-Palencia, is the maintainer of the project. “The 8kB limitation was a restraint, but we were still able to implement a modular approach so we could add new transports and potentially OTA updates in future.” The foundation of the QM-Bootloader is the DFU protocol, which provides a way to transfer data to the device with DFU_DNLOAD for FM, as well as extract data with DFU_UPLOAD. Both are block-based mechanisms: All blocks except the last must have the same size. “We decided to use DFU because it is open source, well documented, and designed for resource constrained devices,” said Alessandrelli. “Also, DFU doesn’t define any specific image format, and we wanted to do our own image format with its own metadata and authentication mechanism. We don’t have enough RAM or flash to store a full image, so we needed to develop our own block-wise transfer/flashing protocol to allow us to write an image a block at a time.” To adapt DFU for UART, the Intel team created a Quark DFU Adaptation (QDA) protocol. “QDA makes DFU available over any message transport,” said Alessandrelli. “Because UART is stream oriented, we added the old XMODEM-CRC protocol layer to transport QDA packets. QDA provides all DFU request/response messages, such as DFU_UPLOAD, and also mimics some generic USB functionality, including active alternate settings. We needed a different host code for QDA/UART, so we modified dfu-util to replace the USB layer with QDA/UART.” The resulting qm-dfu-util code is available on GitHub, licensed under GPLv2. On top of the QDA layer, the Intel team defined a Quark Format Upgrade (QFU) image format that works with generic DFU tools and supports firmware authentication. This “very simple block-wise format” adds a header to the first block of the binary, “so it’s processed before the image,” said Alessandrelli. The header is subdivided into a base header, which contains information like the target device and the vendor and product ID, as well as an extended header used for authentication. “We do not add any specific memory address to the header, but instead assume the flash is divided into partitions, and that every image is targeting a partition,” said Alessandrelli. This setup enables the bootloader to support a single partition on the D2000, and two partitions on the ARC-enabled SE model. This also enables future schemes such as multiple partitions per core, which might come in handy for OTA. Finally, the Quark Firmware Management (QFM) protocol runs on top of the DFU layers, thereby enabling functionality beyond firmware upgrade, such as key provisioning, application erase, and system/firmware information retrieval. QFM is basically a request (DFU_DNLOAD ) or response (upload) protocol. QM-Bootloader 1.4 adds security features Alessandrelli went on to describe new Secure Firmware Upgrade extensions that have been added to QM-Bootloader 1.4’s QFM layer to enable authenticated firmware upgrades. Due to the Quark’s limitations, he could not use a public key scheme. Instead, he chose a simple symmetric key scheme called HMAC256. “With HMAC, the image is verified using the same key that is used to sign it, and the key must be located within the device,” said Alessandrelli. “We decided not to hard-code the key, but instead provided users with the key management functionality so at runtime they can provide the key.” The QFU header is extended with an HMAC extended header. “We don’t compute the HMAC for the entire image, but we authenticate the header, adding an array of hashes, one for each block that composes the image,” said Alessandrelli. “We authenticate the header using HMAC, then start receiving blocks of images.We compute the SHA of every block and compare it with the SHA in the header.” The security enhancements address the challenge of ensuring partition consistency -- how to handle failures that can leave partitions in an inconsistent state, for example, due to a reset during a firmware update. The new code associates a consistency flag to every partition and stores this metadata in a bootloader file called BL-Data. The updated bootloader also adds key management. “We basically define and authenticate a key update request, an extension of QFM,” said Alessandrelli. “We use double-signing, providing both the firmware key, which is used to authenticate an image, as well as a revocation key.” Although this scheme will need to be modified if they add OTA support in the future, “since right now we’re only supporting wired and point to point USB or UART transfer, a man in the middle attack is defeatable,” he noted. Alessandrelli also described security enhancements used to protect BL-DATA using CRC and further explained how partitions are related to targets. The enhancements are designed to support future upgrades to OTA and other additions, such as BLE modules with their own firmware. Alessandrelli concluded with some lessons learned, such as the importance of reusing existing open source code and using a modular approach. “By not pre-optimizing for footprint, we can adapt to changing requirements,” he said. “By using link-time optimization, we could offset most of the overhead from the modular approach, giving us 15 to 20 percent savings in flash footprint saving.” Watch the complete presentation below.

A security researcher has discovered around 40 zero- in Samsung's Tizen operating system. Samsung adopted Tizen – a Linux-based OS developed in partnership with Intel and based on Nokia and Intel's failed MeeGo – to reduce its dependency on Google's Android operating system and is deploying it in TVs, smartphones, watches and other devices. According to Israeli security researcher Amihai Neiderman, head of research at Equus Software in Israel, almost every system app is vulnerable to attack, but in a presentation at Kaspersky's Security Analyst Summit in St. Martin, he said that some of the bugs found in the OS “felt like 2005”. He claimed that Tizen was "maybe the worst code I've ever seen". He tested his findings on a Samsung smart TV as well as two Tizen smartphones, the Samsung Z1 and Z3, which he purchased on eBay. He claimed that all the security holes found were critical and would enable a hacker to control a Samsung device remotely.  He noted the TV implementation of the software was particularly bad. Its TizenStore app (Samsung's version of the App Store), could be hijacked and inject malicious code into a Tizen device, changing parts of the system to gain control of devices. Another issue was the reuse of code from Bada, Tizen's predecessor operating system. But new code also had problems. One function, called “strcpy()”, has a buffer overflow exploit, while another fails to use SSL encryption when transmitting certain data. "They made a lot of wrong assumptions about where they needed encryption," he said. "It's extra work to move between secure connections and unsecure connections."  Tizen is Samsung's attempt to move beyond using Android in its devices, particularly its smartphones, in a bid to have more control over both the hardware and software its sells. Neiderman said that the company should reconsider widespread deployment of the OS until there has been a major overhaul of the code. Samsung has told the press that it is “fully committed” to working with Neiderman to mitigate flaws.

Forums › IT Pro and developers › Storage Pools, ReFS and Bitlocker on Windows Server 2016....(and FreeNAS) solutionz 167 posts Master Geek +1 received by user: 28 Subscriber Topic # 212699 7-Apr-2017 17:44 I decided to upgrade my Intel P4308CP4MHGC server which I use as my main workstation and VM host (mostly through VMWare Workstation for development).   Old config:   OS: Windows 8.1 Pro!!! Board: Intel S2600CP4 w/ 32GB RAM System: 2x 120GB SSD in LSI SW RAID 1 (BitLocker encrypted) Storage: 4x 4TB WD Red HDD in LSI SW RAID 10 (BitLocker encrypted) Graphics: ATI FirePro 2460 w/ Quad Displays As my requirements at the time shifted towards more a resilient & secure file storage and VM host I decided to give FreeNAS a go; which coincidentally had just released a major upgrade with FreeNAS Corral featuring native VM host support through Bhyve and of course their highly resilient ZFS filesystem supporting AES-NI accelerated full disk encryption.   System: 2x 16GB USB (Software Mirrored) Storage: 1x zpool of 2x vdevs of 2x 4TB HDD (mirrored)* *As "You should use mirror vdevs, not RAIDZ"   Install and setup was pretty painless (provided you RTFM) and had a pfSense VM up and running with a click of a button. Downside was that I lost my workstation which meant I'd have to invest in some more hardware to recover my desktop functionality and make use of my quad displays (new PC, thin client or laptop dock). After evaluating for over a week I also found a bit of functionality lacking in the GUI requiring a bit of messing around to do some basic things, which I'm sure will get added as time goes by.   I decided to re-purpose back to a Windows-based workstation and try out Windows Server 2016 Standard with ReFS based storage which features similar benefits to ZFS.   Ironically however my ATI FirePro 2460 seemed to die after a couple of reboots (the software utility would also just freeze when opened which looks suspiciously like a software induced hardware meltdown) so I'm waiting on an AMD FirePro W4100 to arrive while getting by on a single monitor!!   Setup is similar to before:   System: 2x 120GB SSD in RSTe SW RAID 1 (BitLocker encrypted) Storage: 4x 4TB WD Red HDD with RSTe pass through. The S2600CP4 BIOS gives the option of using Intel RSTe or LSI based SW RAID. I decided to go with RSTe this time for the system drive mirror as I wasn't too impressed with the Windows pseudo wed-based LSI MegaRAID management utility however RSTe utility isn't much better, occasionally crashes and appears to have less features so not sure if that was a good decision yet?   The 4x storage drives pass through to be managed by the OS.   "Storage Pools" ("Storage Spaces" on Windows 10) are quite cool in theory as they let you setup various "RAID-equivalent" storage schemes in the form of virtual disks across a series of physical disks.   e.g. Across my 4x drives I can setup multiple virtual disks that either:   reside on 1x physical drive for economy. mirror or stripe across 2+ physical drives for redundancy. span across 2+ physical drives for extra capacity. You also have options for thin/thick provisioning, hot spares and SSD cache.   Some things I learned I didn't come across in the documentation:   ReFS wont format onto default thin-provisioned Basic virtual disks (they need to be converted to Dynamic). (BitLocker will not encrypt Dynamic volumes, only Basic). Thick-provisioned Basic virtual disks can be ReFS formatted and thus encrypted. NTFS can be formatted to thin-or-think-provisioned Basic virtual disks OK and encrypted. I setup a 1TB mirrored BitLocker encrypted ReFS virtual disk and copied about 0.9TB of data across to it from a non-encrypted SATA drive; I noticed there appeared to be significant overheads when writing files probably due to ReFS calculating hash values as write speed for large files (200MB+) climbs to ~100-130MB/s, medium size (5-10MB) drops to ~10-30MB/s while small files (<100KB) can be well under 1MB/s.   I think a lot of the advise around using mirrored vdevs on FreeNAS as opposed to RAID-Zx applies just as well here. As "cool" as Storage Pools/Spaces are there are advantages to simple mirrored volumes; the foremost being ease of dealing with simple volumes for data recovery without having to rebuild an entire array.   Multi-disk redundancy and RAID5-type storage efficiency sounds goods in theory until you calculate how long it'll take to actually rebuild that array, and the risk of subsequent disk failure during that time. Hot spares or even 3-way mirrors can provide additional safety for critical data - as well as of course regular backups - as storage is now relatively cheap vs rebuild time.   As I don't really have a requirement for large non-contiguous volumes (greater than the size of my drives) I think I'll go back to basics and use my on-board SW RAID to manage my storage drives as multiple mirrored pairs; along with a couple of misc disks as temp / non-redundant storage, still taking advantage of ReFS for my archive storage.   Question is whether it's worth investing in a proper RAID card for it (especially VMs)...

The last time the company made changes to the all-in-one computer was back in 2016 when it released the Retina display iMac. Now, consumers are expecting the iMac 2017 to come later this year as Apple already made the announcement for it. In line with this, some new information about the iMac 2017 surfaced online ahead of the supposed release this year. According to the blog Pike’s Universum, the iMac 2017 will have a brand new set of specs on its release, on top of which is the Intel Xeon E3-1285 v6 CPU paired with 16GB of ECC memory. It is interesting to note that this type of processor is not out yet. It is not even listed in the Intel Ark website. Furthermore, this will be the first time that the iMac will support ECC memory. There are no details that the iMac 2017 will still have non-ECC RAM support. The blog also mentioned that the iMac 2017 will have a maximum memory capacity of 64GB. Another thing mentioned in the blog is the upcoming iMac’s support for NVMe storage that can go as much as 2TB. Also, there will be support for Thunderbolt 3 as well as second generation USB 3.1. 2015 iMac (via apple.com) On the graphics side of things, the blog said that the iMac 2017 will also be able to support virtual reality or VR. If this is the case, the AMD graphics card would be something like the AMD Radeon R9 290X or quite possibly the AMD Radeon R9 390X. It will be quite a push for Apple to use the latest AMD Radeon RX480 due to power constraints. Lastly, it seems that the iMac 2017 will also sport a new keyboard, according to the blog. While it did not clearly specify what the keyboard would be, one can speculate that it might have support for Touch Bar and Touch ID features. This is due to the fact that Apple was just granted a patent for the technology. Readers are urged to take these bits and pieces about the iMac 2017 with a grain of salt. These, as they say, are nothing but rumors. Nevertheless, since Apple has already confirmed the arrival of the new iMac, consumers can expect them to arrive later this year.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 7 April 2017 | MYT 11:30 AM The long road to autonomous vehicles by mike freeman The reason roads aren't filled with autonomous cars yet is because self-driving technology remains closer to the research lab stage and is not ready for prime time yet, say experts. — Uber/TNS SAN DIEGO: Back in 1995, the NavLab 5 team at Carnegie Mellon University launched an autonomous vehicle on a trip from Pittsburgh to San Diego.  The vehicle navigated itself, without intervention from a human driver, for 98% of the 2,800 mile journey. It averaged speeds above 60 mph.  So if self-driving technology worked on a cross-country trip 22 years ago, why aren't roads filled with autonomous cars today?  The reason is the technology remains closer to the research lab stage and is not ready for prime time, say experts. It's not good enough or affordable enough yet for widespread use.  Sensors must shrink, improve their range, particularly in bad weather, and become less expensive. Mobile networks must eliminate transmission delays so vehicles can communicate instantly – not only with nearby cars but also with the internet cloud to process data.  Costs for very precise, real-time, three-dimensional map technology to guide self-driving cars must come down. Artificial intelligence software must be nimble to handle the unexpected – ranging from predicting behaviour of nearby drivers to figuring out when an object in the road is a harmless plastic bag or an undercarriage-crushing rock.  And perhaps most importantly, the driving public needs to come to grips with what it wants from autonomous vehicles, which hold the promise of reducing accidents and fatalities but may not be perfect.  In May 2016, a man died when his Telsa crashed into a big rig while operating in the car maker's self-driving software mode known as Autopilot. US regulators determined that Telsa's software functioned properly in the Florida accident but Autopilot requires full-driver attention at all times.  In March, Uber briefly suspended autonomous car testing after a crash in Arizona, which officials said wasn't the fault of the self-driving vehicle. It occurred when a nearby motorist failed to yield.  "We really expect our autonomous cars to do much better than us, otherwise we are not going to use them," said Gabriel Rebeiz, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of California at San Diego. "That is a very high bar."  These hurdles don't mean that the march toward self-driving cars has stalled. If anything, it's gaining momentum.  Nearly all automakers are working on autonomous vehicles programs. Google and Uber are testing robotic car technologies on the road. Big technology companies including Qualcomm and Intel have targeted automotive technology as a major growth market. It is part of the rationale behind Qualcomm's pending US$38bil (RM168.41bil) acquisition of automotive chip outfit NXP Semiconductors and Intel's recent US$15bil (RM66.54bil) buyout of automotive sensor and software outfit Mobileye.  Work on autonomous vehicles has been going on since the early 1980s, said Takeo Kanade, a computer vision professor and winner of the 2016 Kyoto Prize for Advanced Technology, during a recent event in San Diego. The cross-country trip between Pittsburgh and San Diego was a milestone achievement for Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon and the advancement of self-driving vehicles.  One advantage to automation is the potential to reduce accidents and save lives. Vehicle crashes kill more than one million people globally each year and injure millions more. Cutting the number of wrecks would bring down medical and insurance costs.  "What happens when a child chases a ball onto the road? As a human you can slam on the brakes and stop car. But machines will react much faster than humans," said Chris Mi, chair of electrical and computer engineering department at San Diego State University.  Coupled with connected smart infrastructure, autonomous vehicles also could traverse highways and streets more efficiently, limiting traffic jams and reducing carbon emissions.  And self-driving cars free up time for motorists to do other things on their way to the office, boosting productivity.  To get there, data from on-board cameras, radar and lidar sensors is being fused together to create a picture of what's around the car. Lidar, which can cost US$60,000 (RM266,190) or more, works like radar but uses light instead of radio waves.  At International CES in January, Ford demonstrated a pickle-jar sized laser lidar, mounted near the side-view mirror on a prototype self-driving sedan. (Not long ago, lidar systems were the size of a suitcase.) It pinpointed people and objects around the car – creating a very detailed dynamic view of its surroundings.  But it also required a trunk full of powerful computer servers to process the data – which probably isn't practical for real life self-driving vehicles.  High-speed 5G mobile networks could be critical for autonomous vehicles – providing a way to off-load the hefty computer processing demands to the internet cloud.  5G also is expected to reduce transmission delays – known as latency – in wireless networks, paving the way for connected cars to make split second decisions required on the road. 5G networks could roll out as early as 2019.  There are other roadblocks facing autonomous vehicles, such as legal questions of who is responsible if a self-driving car causes an accident. Cybersecurity experts worry about connected cars being hacked and wrecking havoc.  But advocates of autonomous technology believe these barriers eventually will be pushed aside. With today's self-driving prototypes, a driver is obligated to be ready to take control at any moment. But in about a decade, autonomous cars where a human driver's attention is not required could begin showing up on the road.  The arrival of these autonomous cars might be different than we expect, said consultant Sven Beiker, a former BMW technologist and ex-director of the Centre for Automotive Research at Stanford.  "There is lot of work on these automated robo-taxis, where it operates within 20 city blocks – maybe to the airport – but you can't take it to the next city," said Beiker. "So it might not be the Toyota or Chevrolet or Volkswagen that I buy, push a button and it drives me home automatically. Maybe it's I wait for my Uber, and when it arrives there is no driver."  In the meantime, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems will incrementally boost automation and safety in cars. Already, lane monitoring technology in some vehicles will automatically correct drifting. Several automakers offer automatic braking in new models. Adaptive Cruise Control will automatically adjust speed to maintain a safe distance between vehicles.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Guest Everything your startup needs to know about marketing communications Steve Blank@sgblank April 6, 2017 4:32 PM Tags: Steve Blank Image Credit: Steve Blank I was having coffee with the CEO of a new startup, listening to her puzzle through how to communicate to potential customers. She was an academic on leave from Stanford now selling SaaS software to large companies but was being inundated with marketing communications advice. “My engineers say our website is old school and we need to be on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, my VP of Sales says we’re wasting our marketing dollars not targeting the right people, and my board keeps giving me their opinions of how we should describe our product and company. How do I sort out what to do?” She winced as I reminded her that she had gone through the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps. “Painful and invaluable” was her reply. I reminded her that all the Lean tools she learned in class – customer discovery, business model, and value proposition canvases – contained her answer. Here’s how. Define the mission of marketing communications Companies often confuse communications tactics (“What should my webpage look like” or “Should I be using Facebook/Instagram/Twitter?”) with a strategy. A communications strategy answers the question “Why are we doing these activities?” For example, our goal could be: Create demand for our products and drive it into our sales channel Create awareness of our company and brand for potential customers Create awareness for fundraising (VC, angels, corporate partners) Create awareness for potential acquirers of our company (Marketing communications is a subset of the marketing department’s mission. Read my post about mission and intent here.) Audience, message, media, messenger Once you figure out why you’re creating a communications strategy, you can figure out how to use it. The “how” requires just four steps: Understand your audience(s) Craft the message for that specific audience Select the media you want the message to be read/seen/heard on Select the messenger you want to carry your message Step 1: Who’s the audience? The audience is who specifically you want your messages to reach. Is it all the people on earth? Everyone in San Francisco? Potential customers, such as gamers who like to play specific types of games? Or people inside companies with a specific title, like product or program managers, CIOs, etc? Venture capitalists who may want to invest? Other companies that may want to acquire you? What’s confusing is that often there are multiple audiences you want to communicate with. So refer to your strategy: Are you trying to reach potential customers or potential investors and acquirers? These are very different audiences, and each requires its own messages, media, and messengers. If you’re selling a product to a company, for example, is the audience the user of the product? Her boss? The person who has the budget? The CEO? How do you figure out who the audience is? It turns out that if you’ve been doing customer discovery and using the value proposition canvas, you know a lot about each customer/ beneficiary. The first step is to put all those value proposition canvases on the wall to remind you that these are the people you need to reach. How do you figure out which of these customers/beneficiaries is most important? Who’s the least important? If you’ve been out talking to customers, you will have an idea of who’s involved in the buying process. Who’s the user of the product? The recommender? The decision maker? The saboteur? As you map out what you learned about the role each of these customers plays in the buying process, marketing communications and sales can decide which one of the customers/beneficiaries is the primary audience of your messages. (And they can decide if there are any secondary audiences you should reach.) Often there are multiple people in a sales process worth influencing. If you’re trying to reach potential acquirers or investors, the customer discovery process is the same. Spend time building value proposition canvases for these audiences. Step 2: What’s the message? Messages are what you deliver to the audience(s) you’ve selected. Messages answer three questions: Why should the audience care? What are you offering? What’s the call to action? Your customers have already told you how to craft the first part of your message. The answer to “Why should your audience care?” comes directly from the pains and gains on the right side of the value proposition canvas. And the answer to the second question “What are you offering?” comes from the left side of the value proposition canvas. It’s not just the product feature list, but the pain relievers and gain creators. Once you get your audience to read your message, then what? What’s the call to action? Do you want them to download a demo, schedule a sales call, visit a physical store location or a website, download an app, click for more information, give you their email address, or something else? Your message needs to include a specific call to action. Other things to keep in mind about messages: Message context. A message that is brilliant today and gets the press writing about you and customers begging to buy your product could have been met with blank stares two years ago and may be obsolete next year. In crafting your messages, remember that all messages operate in a context that may have an expiration date. Netbooks, 3DTVs, online classes disrupting higher ed, all had their moment in time. Make sure your context is current, and revisit your messages periodically to see if they still work. Sticky messages. Messages also need to be memorable – “sticky.” Why? Because the more memorable the message, the greater its ability to create change. Not only do we want people to change their buying behavior, we also want them to change how they think. (This is often a tough concept for engineering founders. We tend to believe that if we just tell customers about the features that make their business faster, cheaper, etc., they’ll buy in.) If you were told you were going to pay for cold, dead fish wrapped in seaweed, you might not be too hungry. But when we call it sushi, people line up. And if McDonald’s message was “dead cow, slaughtered by the millions, butchered by minimum wage earners, then ground into patties, frozen into solid blocks, and reheated when you order them,” instead of “You deserve a break today,” sales might be a tad lower. Product versus company messages. There is a difference between detailed product messages and messages about your company. At times, you may have to communicate what the company stands for before a customer is ready to listen to you talk about product messages. For example, to outflank a competitor who had faster products, Intel moved the conversation about microprocessors away from speed and technology to create a valued brand. They created the “Intel Inside” campaign. Apple was trying to resurrect a then-dying company by reminding people what Apple stood for with its “Think Different” ad campaign. Both Apple and Intel were selling complicated technology but did so by simplifying the message so it had broad emotional appeal. Both Intel Inside and Think Different became sticky corporate messages. Step 3: Media Media refers to the type of communications media each audience member reads/listens to/watches. It could be print (newspapers/magazines), Internet (website, podcasts, etc.), broadcast (TV, radio, etc.), or social media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.). In customer discovery, you asked prospects how they get information about new companies and new products (if not, get back out and do so!). The media your prospective customers told you they use ought to be on top of your target media. The online media your company controls (your corporate website, company Facebook page, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) should be the first place you experiment finding your audience(s) and message. Typically, you pick several media to reach each audience. It’s likely that each audience reads different media (potential customers read something very different than potential investors.) You’ll need a media strategy – a plan that describes the mix of media and how you will use it. This plan should start with the right category of media (print, Internet, broadcast) and then identify specific sites, blogs, magazine, etc. Step 4: Messengers Messengers are the well-placed and highly leveraged individuals who have influence over your audience(s). Messengers convey and amplify your message to your audience through the media you’ve chosen. There are four types of messengers: reporters, experts, evangelists, and connectors. (Each audience will have its own unique set of messengers.) Reporters are paid by specific media to write about news. Which reporters you should talk to comes from discovering which media your audience has said it reads. Your goal is to identify who the reporters are in the media your audience reads and what they write about, and to figure out why they should write about you. (Wrong answer: because we have a new product. Very wrong answer: because my CEO wants to be on the cover of publication X or Y.) Experts know your industry or product in detail, and others rely on them for their opinions. Experts may be industry analysts in private research firms (Gartner, NPD, AMR), Wall Street research analysts (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs), consultants who provide advice for your industry, or bloggers with wide followings. Experts may even be potential customers who run user groups that other potential customers turn to for advice. (Today some reporters are experts – product reviewers in the Tech Section of the Wall Street Journal, or the Technology section of the New York Times or its product review site, Wirecutter). Evangelists are unabashed cheerleaders and salespeople for your product and, if you are creating a new market, for your company vision. They tell everyone how great the product is and about the unlimited potential of your product and market. While nominally carrying less credibility than experts, evangelists have two advantages: Typically, they are paying customers, and they are incredibly enthusiastic about what they say. (Evangelists are not customers who will give a reference. A customer reference is something you have to twist arms to get; an evangelist is someone you can’t get off the phone.) Connectors are individuals who seem to know everyone. Each industry has a few. They may be bloggers who expound on the general state of your industry and write magazine or newspaper columns. They may be individuals who organize and hold conferences where the key industry thought leaders gather. Often, they themselves are the thought leaders. Founders ask me all the time whether they should hire a PR agency. I tell them, “The question isn’t if.  The question is when.” Influencing the messengers is what great public relations firms know how to do. They may have their own language describing who the messengers are (e.g., “influencers”) and how they manage them (e.g. “information chain”), but once you’ve done a first pass of the audience > message > media > messenger, a competent PR firm can add tremendous value. Customer discovery never stops Understanding your audience is important not just for startups but for companies already selling products. It helps you stay current with customers, get ideas for other needs to fill, and create new products. In addition, the audience > message > media > messenger cycle seamlessly moves this learning into getting, keeping, and growing customers. Today, marketing automation tools (customer analytics, SEO, and customer relationship management platforms) generate customer behavior history about what messages worked on which media. These tools generate data that companies use to feed AdTech tools (demand-side platforms, ad exchanges, and networks) to automate selling and buying of online ads. Communications as a force multiplier Smart CEOs treat communications as a force multiplier for sales, a tool to dramatically increase valuation, and the vehicle to get acquirers lined up at the door. Not-so-successful CEOs treat it as a tactic that can be handed to others. Hiring a PR agency too early is a sign that the CEO is treating this as someone else’s problem. In a startup, the first pass of understanding audience, message, media, and messenger can only be done with the founders/CEO engaged. Getting publicity for a product that does not yet exist is how startups get noticed. But don’t fall victim to your own reality distortion field and hype a product that can never be made (think of Tesla versus Theranos.) Figuring out who the possible audiences are, what messages to send, and what media to use feels overwhelming at first. The temptation is to try to reach all audiences with a single message and a single medium. That’s a going-out-of-business strategy. Use customer discovery, and your customers will teach you who they are, what to say to them, and how to reach them. Lessons learned Marketing communications = Audience, Message, Media, Messenger Use the Value Proposition Canvas to understand who your audiences are Craft messages to match what your audience has already told you Pick the media they said they read Find the right messengers to amplify your message [This story was originally published on Steve Blank’s own blog.] Steve Blank is a retired serial entrepreneur-turned-educator who created the Customer Development methodology that launched the lean startup movement, which he wrote about in his book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany.

The SEC on Thursday said it won a court order freezing assets of Lawrence Cluff and Roger Shaoul, both of Richmond, after they generated more than $925,000 of gains on Mobileye shares and call options purchased in the month-and-a-half before the March 13 merger was announced. News of the transaction caused shares of Mobileye to rise 28.2 percent in one day. The SEC filed civil charges against Cluff and Shaoul nearly two weeks after charging two Israeli residents, Ariel Darvasi and Amir Waldman, with insider trading in Mobileye, and generating more than $4.9 million of gains. It was unclear whether Cluff and Shaoul have hired lawyers. Cluff did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shaoul could not immediately be reached for comment. Reuters obtained a filed copy of the complaint, which was not immediately available in online court records. According to the SEC, Cluff's and Shaoul's "highly suspicious" trading occurred after the adult children of two Mobileye founders told Shaoul's adult children, with whom they were friends, about Intel's interest in Mobileye. The SEC also said both defendants, like Darvasi and Waldman, were connected to Mobileye through the academic community at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which developed Mobileye technology and where Shaoul, an Israeli citizen, had studied. According to the complaint, the suspicious trading occurred in two accounts held in Cluff's name, including one that had been dormant for six years and one opened on Jan. 29, 2017, around the time formal merger talks began. The second account generated a return in six weeks of about 492 percent on the $188,000 that had been wired in during February, the SEC said. Neither Jerusalem-based Mobileye nor Santa Clara, California-based Intel was accused of wrongdoing. Mobileye and Intel did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is SEC v Cluff et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-02460.

Described as a BYODKM desktop computer (Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard and Mouse), it’s just an inch and a half tall and weighs 2.6 pounds. They’re calling it Mac mini and it comes with four USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, HDMI video output, Gigabit Ethernet, an SD card slot and more. The next Mac mini “won’t be so mini anymore.” That’s according to a source, cited by the Pike’s Universe blog, that’s usually “pretty accurate”. The comment suggests that Apple’s next flagship Mac mini model could feature a taller chassis in order to accommodate for more powerful hardware. Intel in January 2017 unveiled faster Kaby Lake processors  suitable for Mac mini. If you ask us, a next-gen Mac mini should adopt Kaby Lake, the faster Thunderbolt 3 standard, USB-C, more powerful graphics, speedier RAM, power-sipping Bluetooth 4.2 wireless technology (existing models have Bluetooth 4.0) and other perks. The current-generation Mac mini is available in three models: $499 Mac mini—Intel’s fourth-generation 1.4GHz dual-core Core i5 CPU with four gigabytes of RAM, 500GB hard drive and integrated Intel HD Graphics 500. $699 Mac mini—Intel’s fourth-generation 2.6GHz dual-core Core i5 processor with eight gigabytes of RAM, 1TB hard drive and integrated Intel Iris graphics. $999 Mac mini—Intel’s fourth-generation 2.8GHz dual-core Core i5 processor with eight gigabytes of RAM, 1TB Fusion Drive and integrated Intel Iris graphics. The $499 and $699 models can be configured with Fusion Drive, which integrates a traditional one-terabyte hard drive with 128 gigabytes of fast PCIe-based flash storage for both speed and capacity. The $699 model is upgradeable to a 3.0 GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5 GHz for an extra $300. The top-of-the-line $999 model can be outfitted with a 3.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz and a 2TB Fusion Drive, with 256GB/512GB/1TB flash storage upgrades available as well. All models can be upgraded to sixteen gigabytes of 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM. Make no mistake, these machines are way overdue for a refresh. Mac mini was last updated in October 2014—that’s a whopping 903 days since the computer’s last release, which in this industry feels like an eternity. Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, told BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski that Mac mini is still important to them: I’ll say the Mac mini is an important product in our lineup and we weren’t bringing it up because it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use. Mac mini remains a product in our lineup, but nothing more to say about it today. Pike’s Universum also said that the next macOS version won’t have a mountain or park name and claimed that Apple’s upcoming external display for a “completely rethought” Mac Pro will have an impressive 8K resolution. Lastly, the blog shared claimed tech specs for the new iMacs that are coming down the pike later this year. The upcoming all-in-one desktops should ship with Intel’s faster Xeon E3 chips, ECC RAM up to 64 gigabytes, Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and more.

By Gordon Mah Ung Executive Editor, PCWorld | Apr 6, 2017 2:00 PM PT Credit: Thomas Ryan More like this Ryzen CPUs explained: Everything you need to know about AMD's disruptive... 7 AMD Ryzen tips and tricks to maximize your PC's performance Ryzen review: AMD is back Video Hardcore Hardware: Asus' new Four Dot One PC gives you 4K gaming in your pocket AMD's new Ryzen Balanced power plan is offering an answer for early performance woes with its new CPU. The power profile tweaks how Windows 10 handles power states of the individual CPU cores and can bump performance from 3 percent all the way to 21 percent in many popular games, AMD said in a blog post on Thursday. To obtain and install the updated power plan, you can visit AMD's blog or download the zip file directly from AMD here. AMD said the power plan, which will soon be rolled into a chipset driver package, tweaks Windows 10's treatment of virtual cores and physical cores. When Ryzen first arrived, many theorized that the Windows 10 scheduler—how an OS doles out work to individual cores—was to blame for the gaming performance gap because Windows 7 was often faster.  In the end, AMD absolved Windows 10 scheduler of any blame, but that doesn't mean Microsoft's top OS is also free and clear. Why this matters: AMD's new Ryzen CPUs have proven to be highly competitive with Intel's offerings in applications, but gaming performance often trails Core i7. With the updated power plan, AMD hopes to close the gap. Windows 7 vs. Windows 10 Windows 7 keeps all physical cores awake and parks the virtual cores in CPUs. Windows 10, however, keeps one physical core and one virtual core awake and puts the rest asleep until they're needed. The updated power plan from AMD helps reduce performance hits by keeping the physical cores awake. Intel, AMD said, takes a similar path with its own power plans. AMD, in fact, had already been recommending that consumers run the High Performance profile instead, which keeps all of the cores awake. AMD AMD said Windows 10 power plan tweaks helps Ryzen's performance How much faster? In testing, AMD said it found the largest performance increase came in Crysis 3, which saw a 21.6-percent bump compared to running the default Balanced power plan in Windows 10. Other games also saw decent increases: Gears of War 4 saw a 16.5 percent bump. Battlefield 4 enjoyed a bump of 8.8 percent to 10 percent. Shadows of Mordor saw a 6-percent boost, and Grand Theft Auto V accelerated by 4.4 percent. Here's the quick installation guide for installing the new profile: Decompress the file and launch it under Windows 10. Windows 10 will ask for your permission to install the power profile, which should become the new default and look like this: IDG AMD has released a power plan for Windows 10 that it claims can bump gaming performance from 2 percent to 21 percent.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria - RTSFHL1    Report: Intel Community Stonewalling Investigation Into Illegal Leaks Peter Hasson Associate Editor 2:44 PM 04/06/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5578203 The intelligence community is stonewalling the investigation into who illegally leaked classified information about Trump associates to the press, lawmakers told Fox News. “Our requests are simply not being answered,” one House Intelligence committee source told Fox News. “The agencies are not really helping at all and there is truly a massive web for us to try and wade through.” A source in the Senate Intelligence Committee had a similar story. “Any information that will help find the wide extent on the unmasking and surveillance is purposely not being provided,” the source said. The NSA pushed back, issuing a statement that said, “Allegations that the National Security Agency is ‘withholding information’ from congressional intelligence committees investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election are categorically untrue.” “NSA fully supports the committees’ work. We have already made available significant information in response to their requests, and we look forward to continuing to work with them in the execution of their important responsibilities.” Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice reportedly requested the unmasking  of Trump associates in raw intelligence reports. The associates’ names were then illegally leaked to the press. President Trump has consistently argued that the “real story” is the investigation into the leaks — not the investigation into Russian election meddling.   Follow Hasson on Twitter @PeterJHasson Tags: Donald Trump, Michael Flynn, NSA, Susan Rice Hide Comments   Show comments Free News Alerts Privacy: We never share your email Sections Politics US Opinion Entertainment World Business Sports Tech Featured Partners Columns Ann Coulter Ask Matt Labash Matt Lewis The Mirror DC Trawler Ginni Thomas Corporate About Us Advertise With Us Employment Terms Of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ © Copyright 2010 - 2017 | The Daily Caller

Meanwhile, vendors and tools that have been added to the project include Bitdefender's Bart decryptor, Check Point's Merry X-Mas decryptor and BarRax decryptor, Emsisof's Crypton decryptor and Damage decryptor, and updates on Rakhni and Rannoh decryptors from Kaspersky, the security vendor announced this week. Comcast's WiFi Cable provider Comcast has launched a new wireless service with unlimited data plan, Reuters reports. The move make the comms giant the first major U.S. cable provider to take steps into the wireless space, joining the likes of Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint, who all offer unlimited data plans, the report noted. Comcast is not planning to offer phone subsidies and will launch the service on Verizon's airwaves, Reuters said, adding that the vendor will use Comcast's 16 million WiFi hotspots in order to enable customer moves from 4G LTE onto WiFi automatically. The service will be available on iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones, Reuters added. AppDynamics' toolkit AppDynamics this week announced its spring '17 release, which includes the AppDynamics Developer Toolkit and what the Cisco-owned vendor says is "major updates" to Enterprise iQ and Business iQ. The new toolkit spans tools for build, test, analysis and continuous improvement, AppDynamics said in its announcement. Of note, new features include new extensions to BTs that are aimed at enabling app teams to "focus on the user journeys and code that move the needle the most". Also included in the release is comprehensive support for Xamarin, which allows mobile app developers to embed AppDynamics in native iOS and Android mobile applications and monitor and drive application performance from a single code base, according to the announcement. Bhaskar Sunkara, CTO and head of product at AppDynamics, claimed in the announcement that with the vendor's developer toolkit, companies can give their application teams "the context of how their code impacts the business". "Today, the application is the business, creating immense pressure on organizations to deliver new experiences that 'wow' customers," Sunkara said. "And digital leaders continually raise the bar for what consumers expect from application experiences." Devices' spend Mobile phones, ultramobiles and PCs will see a two percent increase in spend to $600bn in 2017, according to Gartner. Computing reports that the analyst believes prices for units will rise owing to higher component prices and user perception of quality over low pricing. Of the $600bn predicted, 67 percent will be on smartphones, the report notes. Meanwhile, premium ultramobile devices, such as Intel x86 products running Windows 10 and the Apple MacBook Air, will ship 60 million devices in 2017, versus 50 million in 2016, Computing notes. However, according to the report, other devices in the ultramobile category, including the iPad, Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and Lenovo Yoga Tab 3, are set to drop from 169 million in 2016 to 161 million in 2017.

Continuing with tradition, the AMD Chromebook is using Coreboot. Thus we have the first signs of it via Coreboot code review with this new Google board being codenamed "Kahlee." The Coreboot code began appearing for review just minutes ago after other Kahlee references in the Chrome OS world have been found in recent weeks. This AMD Chromebook features two M.2 slots and is based on an AMD Stoney Ridge APU.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Goldman Sachs has issued a “sell” rating on Advanced Micro Devices stock because it see the chipmaker being bruised by tough competition from Nvidia and Intel. AMD shares are up 25 percent this year and 406 percent in the past 12 months through Wednesday on anticipation of its new gaming graphics and processor chips, CNBC.com explained. While the company's "execution (i.e. new product launches, cost management and BS [balance sheet] deleveraging) has improved under CEO Lisa Su, we believe current risk-return is unfavorable," analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a note to clients Thursday entitled "Priced for perfection." "If AMD were to gain meaningful traction with its new products in 2017, we believe Intel and Nvidia would be likely to fight back in late-2017 and/or 2018 in the form of pricing concessions," he added. To be sure, Newsmax Finance Insider Ed Yardeni cautioned savvy investors to not underestimate Silicon Valley itself, as it may have more sway on your everyday life than politicians. "While we and everyone else have been focusing on Washington, life goes on elsewhere. Without a doubt, the regime change in DC is dramatic. It is bound to significantly affect and alter the future course of our political, economic, and financial systems—well, at least for the next four years. However, the near and distant future may very well be even more significantly affected by what is happening in Silicon Valley," he wrote for Newsmax Finance. "Certainly, recent developments in autonomous cars, robotics, and artificial intelligence have captured the imagination of tech investors. One way they’ve played the future is by investing in the manufacturers producing the semiconductor chips that will run all of these new technologies," he wrote.

That sure was a long time ago. Over the past few years, the Cupertino-based tech giant seemed intent on forgetting its portable, entry-level desktop unit. Even its current iteration, released October 2014, was panned by critics and users alike for the inability of its internals to be manually upgraded. Fortunately, Apple has recently broken its silence about the ubiquitous Mac mini, with Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller stating that the firm considers the little machine as an important product. “On that I’ll say the Mac mini is an important product in our lineup and we weren’t bringing it up because it’s more of a mix of consumer with some pro use. The Mac mini remains a product in our lineup, but nothing more to say about it today.” While Schiller’s statement has assured Apple’s avid fans that the desktop is not going away anytime soon, it remains to be seen how the Cupertino-based tech giant would implement the upcoming updates to the Mac mini, according to an Apple Insider report. Speculations are high, however, that the improvements to the device would be comprised of an overall spec bump. Apple Stays Quiet on the Future of Mac mini but Claims It’s Still an ‘Important Product’ https://t.co/xxSPk9E5KW #Macmini pic.twitter.com/rmv7XWPGUv — iPhone Hacks (@iPhoneHackx) April 5, 2017 One thing that the Mac mini 2017 is expected to get is a new, improved processor. The current iteration of the Mac mini, after all, still uses an extremely outdated Intel Haswell chip. While the chances of Apple equipping the next-generation Mac mini with an Intel Kaby Lake processor are extremely slim, there is a pretty good chance that the upcoming 2017 machine would come fitted with a Skylake processor instead, similar to those found in the 2016 MacBook Pro, according to a MacWorld report. Skylake chips are not the best processors available today, as its successors, the Kaby Lake chips, have already been released to the market. Nevertheless, the processors present a decent and notable upgrade from the mini’s current specs, which is something that users of the portable desktop unit would most likely appreciate. A Core i5 Skylake chip, for example, could still provide users with a decent computing experience, which would be just right considering the Mac mini’s target demographic. Apart from an improved processor, rumors are also high that the new 2017 Mac mini would be given a memory bump. Currently, the entry-level variant of the device is equipped with a measly 4GB of RAM, which is extremely lacking since the machine runs the full version of macOS. With Apple standardizing 8GB of memory in its laptops, it appears safe to assume that the Cupertino-based tech giant would implement the same strategy with its desktop computers as well. .@pschiller: #Apple's #Macmini an 'important product,' staying in lineup https://t.co/q4STrUAT79 pic.twitter.com/7HaELGBCOI — AppleInsider (@appleinsider) April 4, 2017 An entry-level Mac mini with 8GB of RAM would not be revolutionary, but it would be robust enough to provide users with a desktop experience far better than what its current iteration could offer. If any, it would enable everyday users to stream media and create basic content without any hiccups from the portable machine. The 2017 Mac mini is also rumored to embrace USB-C technology. Apple appears set on being one of the firms at the forefront of the USB-C revolution. Thus, it would make perfect sense for the Cupertino-based tech giant would release a revamped Mac mini 2017 with a number of USB-C ports. The release date for the Mac mini 2017 remains unknown, though speculations are high that the device would be released at some point in the year. Initial predictions pointed to a possible March 2017 release, but the month has come and gone. With this, updated speculations are predicting that the next-generation Mac mini would be unveiled sometime around October 2017, together with the 2017 MacBook Pro refresh and a newer, more powerful 12-inch MacBook.

Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg Intel Corp. boosted Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich’s compensation package 30 percent to $19.1 million last year, fueled by a bigger stock award and costs for his personal security arrangements. Intel’s board awarded Krzanich, 56, stock worth $11.7 million, a 20 percent increase from 2015, according to a proxy statement Thursday. The CEO also received $1.25 million in salary, $3.7 million in bonuses, about $2.13 million in security services, plus other smaller items. The decision to bolster the security program came as Krzanich in April last year said some senior executives had faced backlash for the company’s stance and efforts on diversity, according to a TechCrunch report. In 2015, the CEO pledged Intel would spend $300 million to make the gender and ethnicity of the company’s workforce representative of the U.S. population by 2020. He also vowed to tie executive pay to that goal. The world’s largest chipmaker, like many other tech companies, has faced criticism for employing few women, blacks and Hispanics. In its diversity report for fiscal 2016, Intel said it achieved pay parity for women and underrepresented minorities and increased its share of female employees to 25.8 percent, a 2.3 percent gain since 2014. The company spent $1.86 million on personal security for Krzanich and another $275,200 to protect his residence. Executive Vice President Venkata Renduchintala received security services worth $944,800 and Stacy Smith, who oversees manufacturing, operations and sales, got $309,900. The threats were targeted against the CEO and certain other executives, and in some cases their family members, according to the filing, which didn’t provide details on the specific arrangements. By comparison, Intel spent $39,600 for Krzanich’s security in 2015. The company also enhanced the program that year in response to “specific job-related situations,” a filing shows. His full 2015 compensation was $14.6 million. The CEO is trying to remake the company by converting its dominance in PC chips into a presence in markets ranging from cars to mobile phones to drones. That push has yet to provide Intel with enough revenue and profit to shake its dependence on its main source of income. Its finances are increasingly reliant on demand for processors running server computers in giant data centers that support computing over the internet. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Krzanich’s annual bonus, which paid out slightly above its $3.5 million target, is tied to absolute and relative financial performance, and operational goals. About 60 percent of his stock award is linked to total shareholder return and vests if Intel beats the median return among a group of tech companies over three years. The remaining shares vest in increments over three years as long as he remains on the job. His bonus payout can be adjusted based on how Intel achieves goals related to hiring and retaining women and under-represented minorities. Renduchintala, who joined the company in November 2015, received a $20.4 million pay package. (Updates security spending in sixth paragraph.) Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads By Joel Hruska on April 6, 2017 at 9:48 am Comment Several years ago, Google began working on its own custom software for machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads, dubbed TensorFlow. Last year, the company announced that it had designed its own tensor processing unit (TPU), an ASIC designed for high throughput of low-precision arithmetic. Now, Google has released some performance data for their TPU and how it compares to Intel’s Haswell CPUs and Nvidia’s K80 (Kepler-based) data center dual GPU. Before we dive into the data we need to talk about the workloads Google is discussing. All of Google’s benchmarks measure inference performance as opposed to initial neural network training. Nvidia has a graphic that summarizes the differences between the two: Click to enlarge. Teaching a neural network what to recognize and how to recognize it is referred to as training, and these workloads are still typically run on CPUs or GPUs. Inference refers to the neural network’s ability to apply what it learned from training. Google makes it clear that it’s only interested in low-latency operations and that it’s imposed strict criteria for responsiveness on the benchmarks we’ll discuss below. Google’s TPU design, benchmarks The first part of Google’s paper discusses the various types of deep neural networks it deploys, the specific benchmarks it uses, and offers a diagram of the TPU’s physical layout, pictured below. The TPU is specifically designed for 8-bit integer workloads and prioritizes consistently low latency over raw throughput (both CPUs and GPUs tend to prioritize throughput over latency, particularly GPUs). Click to enlarge Google writes (PDF): “Rather than be tightly integrated with a CPU, to reduce the chances of delaying deployment, the TPU was designed to be a coprocessor on the PCIe I/O bus, allowing it to plug into existing servers just as a GPU does. Moreover, to simplify hardware design and debugging, the host server sends TPU instructions for it to execute rather than fetching them itself. Hence, the TPU is closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU.” Click to enlarge Each TPU also has an off-chip 8GiB DRAM pool, which Google calls Weight Memory, while intermediate results are held in a 24MiB pool of on-chip memory (that’s the Unified Buffer in the diagram above). The TPU has a four-stage pipeline and executes CISC instructions, with some instructions taking thousands of clock cycles to execute as opposed to the typical RISC pipeline of one clock cycle per pipeline stage. The table below shows how the E5-2699v3 (Haswell), Nvidia K80, and TPU compare against each other in various metrics. Click to enlarge Before we hit the benchmark results, there are a few things we need to note. First, Turbo mode and GPU Boost were disabled for both the Haswell and Nvidia GPUs, not to artificially tilt the score in favor of the TPU, but because Google’s data centers prioritize dense hardware packing over raw performance. Higher turbo clock rates for the v3 Xeon are dependent on not using AVX, which Google’s neural networks all tend to use. As for Nvidia’s K80, the test server in question deployed four K80 cards with two GPUs per card, for a total of eight GPU cores. Packed that tightly, the only way to take advantage of the GPU’s boost clock without causing an overheat would have been to remove two of the K80 cards. Since the clock frequency increase isn’t nearly as potent as doubling the total number of GPUs in the server, Google leaves boost disabled on these server configurations. Google’s benchmark figures all use the roofline performance model. The advantage of this model is that it creates an intuitive image of overall performance. The flat roofline represents theoretical peak performance, while the various data points show real-world results. In this case, the Y-axis is integer operations per second, while the “Operational Intensity” X-axis corresponds to integer operations per byte of weights read (emphasis Google’s). The gap between an application’s observed performance and the curve directly above it shows how much additional performance might be gained if the benchmark was better optimized for the architecture in question, while data points on the slanted portion of the roofline indicate that the benchmark is running into memory bandwidth limitations. The slideshow below shows Google’s results in various benchmarks for its CPU, GPU, and TPU tests. As always, each slide can be clicked to open a larger image in a new window. Google’s TPU isn’t just a high performance engine; it offers substantially improved performance per watt as well, both in the original TPU and for improved variants Google has modeled (TPU’). Click to enlarge The chief limiting factor between Google’s TPU and higher performance is memory bandwidth. Google’s models show TPU performance improving 3x if memory bandwidth is increased 4x over current designs. No other set of enhancements, including clock rate improvements, larger accumulators, or a combination of multiple factors has much of an impact on performance. The last section of Google’s paper is dedicated to dispelling various fallacies and correcting misunderstandings, a number of which relate to the choice of the K80 GPU. One section is particularly worth quoting: Fallacy: CPU and GPU results would be comparable to the TPU if we used them more efficiently or compared to newer versions. We originally had 8-bit results for just one DNN on the CPU, due to the significant work to use AVX2 integer support efficiently. The benefit was ~3.5X. It was less confusing (and space) to present all CPU results in floating point, rather than having one exception, with its own roofline. If all DNNs had similar speedup, performance/Watt ratio would drop from 41-83X to 12-24X. The new 16-nm, 1.5GHz, 250W P40 datacenter GPU can perform 47 Tera 8-bit ops/sec, but was unavailable in early 2015, so isn’t contemporary with our three platforms. We also can’t know the fraction of P40 peak delivered within our rigid time bounds. If we compared newer chips, Section 7 shows that we could triple performance of the 28-nm, 0.7GHz, 40W TPU just by using the K80’s GDDR5 memory (at a cost of an additional 10W). This kind of announcement isn’t the sort of thing Nvidia is going to be happy to hear. To be clear, Google’s TPU results today are applicable to inference workloads, not the initial task of training the neural network — that’s still done on GPUs. But, with respect to Nvidia and AMD both, we’ve also seen this kind of cycle play out before. Once upon a time, CPUs were the unquestioned kings of cryptocurrency mining. Then, as difficulty rose, GPUs became dominant, thanks to vastly higher hash rates. In the long run, however, custom ASICs took over the market. Both AMD and Nvidia recently added (Nvidia) or announced (AMD) support for 8-bit operations to improve total GPU throughput in deep learning and AI workloads, but it will take significant improvements over and above these steps to address the advantage ASICs would possess if they start moving into these markets. That’s not to say we expect custom ASIC designs to own the market — Google and Microsoft may be able to afford to build their own custom hardware, but most customers won’t have the funds or expertise to take that on.

The only elements confirmed for Project Scorpio are the eight x86 cores, >6 TFLOPs, 320 GB/s, it's built by AMD, and it is coming in 2017. If anyone wants to officially correct any speculation, please get in touch.  One of the critical points of contention with consoles, especially when viewed through the lens of the PC enthusiast, is the hardware specifications. Consoles have long development cycles, and are thus already behind the curve at launch – and that gap only grows over time as the life-cycle of the console is anywhere from five to seven years. The trade-off is usually that the console is an optimized platform, particularly for software: performance is a known quantity and it is much easier to optimize for. For ten months or so now, Microsoft has been teasing its next generation console. Aside from launching the Xbox One S as a minor mid-season revision to the Xbox One, the next-generation ‘Project Scorpio’ aims to be the most powerful console available. While this is a commendable aspiration (one that would look odd if it wasn’t achieved), the meat and potatoes of the hardware discussion has still been relatively unknown. Well, some of the details have come to the surface through a PR reveal with Eurogamer’s Digital Foundry. We know the aim with Project Scorpio is to support 4K playback (4K UHD Blu-Ray), as well as a substantial part of 4K gaming. With recent introductions in the PC space of ‘VR’ capable hardware coming down in price, Microsoft is able to carefully navigate what hardware it can source. It is expected that this generation will still rely on AMD’s semi-custom foundry business, given that high-end consoles are now on x86 technologies and Intel’s custom foundry business is still in the process of being enabled (Intel’s custom foundry is also expected to be expensive). Of course, pairing an AMD CPU and AMD GPU would be the sensible choice here, with AMD launching a new GPU architecture last year in Polaris. Here’s a table of what the reveal is: Microsoft Console Specification Comparison   Xbox 360 Xbox One Project Scorpio CPU Cores/Threads 3/6 8/8 8 / ?

The GPU will be paired with 12GB of GDDR5, to give 326GB/s of bandwidth. Storage is via a 1TB HDD, and the optical drive supports 4K UHD Blu-Ray. Let’s break this down with some explanation and predictions. Eight Custom CPU Cores: But They're Still Jaguar (or almost) The Xbox One uses AMD’s Jaguar cores. These are low powered and simpler cores, aimed at a low-performance profile and optimized for cost and power. In non-custom designs, we saw these CPUs hit above 2 GHz, but these were limited to 1.75 GHz in the Xbox One. AMD technically has several cores potentiall available for Scorpio: Excavator (Bulldozer-based, as seen on 28nm), Jaguar-based (also from 28nm) or Zen based (seen on 14nm GF). While the latter is a design that has returned AMD to the high-end of x86 performance computing, offering high performance for reasonable power, a Zen design would be relatively quick turnaround from a consumer launch a month ago. Because of the time frame, even if Microsoft could go for Zen in the Scorpio, it this would increase the base cost of the console by redesigning the cores on 16nm TSMC. A full shot of the motherboard in Scorpio. Source: Digital Foundry In the Digital Foundary piece, Microsoft stated that the CPU portion of Scorpio has a 31% performance gain over the Xbox. This isn't IPC, this is just raw performance. Moving from Jaguar to Zen would be more than 60%, and actually the frequency difference between the 2.3 GHz in Scorpio and 1.75 GHz in Xbox One is exactly 31%. So we are dealing with a Jaguar-style style (although perhaps modified). That being said, this is a ‘custom’ x86 core. Microsoft could have requested specific IP blocks and features not present in the original Jaguar CPUs but present in things such as Zen, such as power management techniques. Typically a console shares DRAM between the CPU and GPU, so it might be something as simple as the CPU memory controller supporting GDDR5. So instead of seeing Zen coming to consoles, we’re seeing another crack at using Jaguar (or Jaguar+) but revised for a smaller process node to keep overall costs down – and given that the main focus on a console is the GPU, that’s entirely possible. 40 Customized Compute Units AMD launched Polaris 10 last year in the Radeon RX series. This is latest compute architecture, released on a 14nm Global Foundries process, and give substantial power efficiency gains over previous 28nm designs. The first consumer GPUs were aimed at the $200-$230 market and below, which is something that would be of interest to console manufacturers. Bypassing AMD’s Fiji GPUs using silicon interposers and high-bandwidth memory, AMD’s latest design is the RX480. The RX 480 is a 36 compute unit design, using 4GB or 8GB of 256-bit GDDR5 memory, giving 256GB/s of total memory bandwidth. According to the information given to Digital Foundry, Scorpio will have 40 compute units, 12 GB of GDDR5, and will be good for 320 GB/s of memory bandwidth. Technically the RX 480 is a fully enabled design, and only offers 36 compute units in total, suggesting that Scorpio is either using a new silicon spin version of this design (with a potentially lop-sided memory configuration), or is moving on to a Vega based design. The fact that the spec list has a 384-bit memory bus listed, and Polaris designs so far are limited to 256-bit, suggests that we might be dealing with Vega despite the Polaris-like configuration. That being said, it's also a cost issue again: Vega is expected to cost a pretty penny, whereas consoles are often low-cost designs. So while the memory bus is high, this is most likely a Polaris implementation, especially as we already know that Scorpio will be > 6 TFLOPs on 40 CUs, and the RX 480 is ~5 TFLOPs on 36 CUs. The Eurogamer article quotes Andrew Goossen, Technical Fellow for Graphics at Microsoft: Those are the big ticket items, but there's a lot of other configuration that we had to do as well," says Goossen, pointing to a layout of the Scorpio Engine processor. "As you can see, we doubled the amount of shader engines. That has the effect of improvement of boosting our triangle and vertex rate by 2.7x when you include the clock boost as well. We doubled the number of render back-ends, which has the effect of increasing our fill-rate by 2.7x. We quadrupled the GPU L2 cache size, again for targeting the 4K performance." The memory bus is listed as a 384-bit interface which means 12 32-bit channels. We are told that the GDDR5 modules are running at 6.8 GB/s. The 12GB of GDDR5 is split with 4GB available for the system and 8GB available for developers. There is no ESRAM, given the reason that the bandwidth of the GDDR5 is sufficient. The counter to this is a slightly higher latency, which Microsoft expects developers to hide when pushing higher resolutions. Ideally, I want to get Ryan’s thoughts on this and will do so when he signs in for the day, but his analysis on some of the specifications back in June 2016 still stands: The memory bandwidth of Project Scorpio, 320 GB/s, is also relatively interesting given the current rates of the RX 480 topping out at 256 GB/s. The 320 GB/s number seems round enough to be a GPU only figure, but [...] how much is impossible to say at this point. Additional: On 4K support, the latest AMD media block supports 4K60 with HEVC, as well as HDMI 2.0. When rendering 4K content to a 1080p screen, Microsoft has mandated that Ultra-HD rendering should super-sample down to 1080p to all developers. Microsoft also confirms full DX12 support, making use of new features to push draw calls and better multi-threaded capabilities. Designing for 16nm at TSMC If we move forward with a Jaguar plus Polaris prediction, it means that both designs will have to be reconfigured for TSMC's 16nm process. For the Jaguar-based CPU, it would result in much lower power than 28/32nm, and also a much lower die area. Compared to the GPU, an 8-core Jaguar design might be 10-15% of the entire silicon. The GPU will likely be on similar terms, although with a larger memory bus and more CUs (44 in the design, 40 in use). AMD recently afforded additional quarterly costs for using foundries other than Global Foundries (as per their renegotiated wafer agreement), which a number of analysts chalked up to future server designs being made elsewhere. A few of us postulated it's more to do with AMD's semi-custom business,  and either way it points to silicon Zen being redesigned for 16nm TSMC. Digital Foundry reported the total die size for the combination chip is listed 360mm2 at seven billion transistors (including CPU and GPU), with four shader engines each containing 11 compute units (one is disabled per block). This is all within 7 billion transistors. It was also mentioned that the floor plan of the silicon, aside from four groups of 11 CUs, also had two clusters of two CPU cores. For anyone familiar with Zen, this would initially suggest we might be dealing with CCX units, given each is four cores, but the performance metrics still point to Jaguar. This means that the CPUs are a tiny chunk of the die area on the silicon, probably under one fifth of the chip. We don't know the size of the GPU, but 36 CUs of Polaris 10 on GloFo 14nm is 232mm2 at 5.7 billion transistors. Scaled up to 40 CUs, this is around 257 mm2, leaving 100mm2 for cores, a memory controller, and other IO.  Microsoft also states that the power supply with the unit can be suited up to 245W. If we assume a low-frequency Jaguar CPU inside, that could be around 25W max, leaving 150-220W for the GPU. A full sized RX 480 comes in at 150W, and given this GPU is a little more than that, perhaps nearer 170W (or tuned to 100-150W, depending on low-frequency ranges). The power supply, in a Jaguar + Polaris configuration, seems to have a good 20-25% power budget in hand. Source: Digital Foundry Based on some of the discussion from the source, it would seem that AMD is implementing a good number of its power saving features from Excavator and Zen, particularly related to unique DVFS profiles per silicon die as it comes off the production line, rather than a one-size fits all approach. The silicon will also be paired with a vapor chamber cooler, using a custom centrifugal fan. What We Don’t Know Hardware aside, the launch titles will be an interesting story in itself, especially with recent closures of dedicated MS studios such as Lionhead. Project Scorpio is due out in Fall / Q3 2017. This article originally predicted a Zen + Polaris configuration, but due to a secondary analysis, is now a Jaguar + Polaris prediction.   Source: Digital Foundry Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 66 Comments View All Comments takeshi7 - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link "Consoles have long development processes, and are thus already behind the curve at launch" That's only true for the most recent generation of consoles. most other generation of consoles usually launched with more advanced hardware than PCs, but PCs quickly catch up. First GPU with hardware T&L was the N64 in 1996. PCs didn't get that until the Geforce 256 in 1999. First unified shader GPU was the Xbox 360 in 2005. PCs didn't get unified shaders until a year later. etc. Reply fred666 - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link you can pick individual specs but the fact remain that high end PCs are globally faster than console at launch, and the gap only widen with time. Console are cheaper than high end PCs, however. Reply CharonPDX - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link As takeshi7 said, this is a new thing. Even the Xbox 360 / Playstation 3 were better at launch than even an ultra-high-end gaming PC was. It has only been with the Xbone/PS4 that they were slower than PC at launch. Also, not sure what you mean by "globally faster". Reply Frenetic Pony - Friday, April 07, 2017 - link The PS3 wasn't, but only because it was about as fast as a 360 a year later, still very good for the time though. But today, 12 years after the 360 launch GPUs have gotten much bigger in terms of mm^2 and now you can have multiple of them cause why not? So today we've pegged Vega's launch at > double the relative straight compute power of the (to be released later) Xbox Scorpio. People have proven they'll pay for giant GPUs with giant cooling blocks, so Nvidia and AMD are more than happy to sell it to them. Reply zavrtak - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link Meanwhile the more powerful Playstation 3 came with a 7800GTX variant, while basically the 8800 was released in literally the same month (and several months before the console came out in the european PAL variant). And literally twice as fast as the 7800 from last year that was one of the worst timing for console gaming ever, and ironically it lasted for ever before the PS4 in 2013 came out. You are listing basically the expectations and ironically those were not performing even better. The N64 was up against much faster 3DFX cards, sure without texture and lighting units, but butting out much higher resolutions and much faster graphics. Feel free to compare quake 2 on glide with 3dfx voodoo 1 cards vs the n64 version. Reply takeshi7 - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link The cost for a PC in 1996 that meets the minimum system requirements for quake 2 would have been ~10x the cost of the N64. And that's just the minimum requirements. Sources: http://www.computerhope.com/q2.htm https://books.google.com/books?id=NGNpFuAXu70C&... Reply Flunk - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link That's not true, the N64 doesn't have "Hardware T&L" as in fixed-purpose hardware for processing transform and lighting (neither do current GPUs as they use shaders for that). in fact it doesn't even have a traditional rendering pipeline like a modern GPU. The reality co-processor was essentially a software-re-programmable vector processor attached to a hardware rasterizer. It's both more simple and more flexible than the concurrently available PC 3D cards, but it's essentially a technical dead-end because the technology wasn't developed any further, primarily because of claims that it was really difficult to program for (I have no experience programming for it so I don't have first-hand knowledge). It also processed audio. In short, very interesting architecture, but not ahead of the PCs at the time. Compare the PC and N64 versions of Turok Dinosaur Hunter, Doom or any of the other very few cross-platform games for examples. Reply blppt - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link Pretty sure that N64 did not have GPU hardware T&L, at least not the kind we would associate with the Geforce 256. Even a Voodoo 1 had overall superior 3d capabilities to N64, as we saw with the near perfect N64 emulation running UltraHLE on those cards. What the consoles did have in that era were main cpus and internal buses that were much more capable than the equivalent PC x86 architectures at generating triangles to feed their 3d rasterizers . But PC hardware development over the past couple of decades has been far more geared to multimedia/gaming than the business machines it originated as, and thus, today's x86/64 cpus + a GPU are really tough to beat for price/performance even in games. Or the gaming consoles wouldn't be using them. Reply takeshi7 - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link N64 had hardware transform and lighting in the sense that the CPU did not have to do the T&L calculations. They were offloaded. Reply blppt - Thursday, April 06, 2017 - link No they werent. The T&L calc was done by the R4200, the main cpu. Its just that the main cpus of consoles were much better at doing this than the x86 cpus we had at the time feeding our 3d rasterizer cards.

The likes of the Corsair One, Asus ROG GR8 II and HP Pavilion Wave have already shown us what modern hardware can do when shoehorned into compact chassis, and MSI is redoubling its efforts with the new Trident 3 Arctic. Priced at £1,800 and introduced as a more powerful revision of the original Trident, the third-generation Arctic ups the ante by pairing an Intel Core i7-7700 processor with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 graphics. A potent mix for any PC, so it's all the more impressive to see that MSI has squeezed said hardware into a games-console-like chassis measuring 346mm x 72mm x 233mm. Why limit a PC to such tight confines? Well, while the Trident 3 Arctic can't compete with an Xbox One or PlayStation 4 in terms of price, it offers the full functionality of Windows 10 and the might of desktop-grade components in a form factor that can be placed neatly alongside the living-room TV. Whether or not you'd choose to have it in full view is a question of taste, as MSI's Asian design influence is clear to see. For a premium bit of kit, the Trident 3 Arctic comes across as plasticky, with an angular gamer aesthetic adorned with the obligatory RGB illumination on one corner. The aesthetics are very much an acquired taste, and that's a shame as the dimensions and layout offer broad appeal. The front of the system provides quick access to a pair of audio jacks, USB 3.1 Type-C, dual USB 3.1 Type-A and HDMI for a hassle-free VR connection. The power button is hidden away neatly on the side, near the RGB light, and the rest of the ports are tucked around back. Here's where you'll find more audio jacks, Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.1 Type-A, a quartet of USB 2.0, a connector for the external power supply and all the display outputs made available via the graphics card. Note that in order for the front VR port to function, one of the HDMI outputs on the graphics card needs to be connected to the 'VR Link' passthrough and MSI handily includes a small HDMI cable for this purpose. Elsewhere, good-sized vents are scattered around the machine, and a large mesh section directly above the graphics card should help aid airflow. Curious to see how the hardware is arranged on the inside? Feel free to look, but think twice before opening your own Trident 3 PC as undoing the few screws required to gain access to the innards will void the two-year warranty. That means upgrades aren't catered for and, like so many small-form-factor machines, what you see is what you get. Fortunately, you do get a fair amount of capable gear. The Core i7-7700 processor is from Intel's latest-generation Kaby Lake stable and is joined by 16GB (2x8GB) of DDR4-2400 memory. Storage, located on the rear side of the motherboard, is provided by a 256GB Intel 600p Series M.2 SSD as well as a 1TB Hitachi 2.5in hard disk, while Wireless AC connectivity is made available via an Intel adapter. It's in the graphics department that the most meaningful upgrade takes place, with MSI inserting a compact GTX 1070 Aero 8GB card with a boost clock of 1,721MHz. MSI's internal arrangement has merit - both the CPU and GPU fans do a grand job of expelling heat without causing a riot - but there isn't space for everything. There's no optical drive, which may or may not be something you'd want in the living room, and tight interior confines combined with powerful components results in an unsightly exterior 330W power supply. A Trident 4 with an internal PSU and a sleeker, less-angular chassis would be a significant step forward, but even so, the Trident 3 Arctic has plenty of promise for PC gamers wanting to move out of the den and in with the family. With that in mind, MSI caters for horizontal or vertical orientation using a supplied stand and an Xbox One controller is included as part of the bundle. There's an inevitable premium associated with the form factor, but MSI's flexible design makes it ideally suited as a powerful alternative to a games console. Let's see how it fares in the benchmarks, shall we?

Home About Testimonials News Widget Guidelines Syndicate faq Blog Contact     Intuitive Systems and Software Are Key to Technology Adoption - And so are People In today's business world, the adoption of technology is a key issue. Online PR News – 06-April-2017 – London – In today’s business world, the adoption of technology is a key issue. The divide that once existed between the digital tools we use for entertainment and the ones we use at work is gradually disappearing. While there’s still some work to be done to make work applications more agile, the demand from users and employees is driving businesses to take a more user-friendly approach to technology adoption in the workplace. Therefore it is essential for businesses to look at barriers to technology adoption and eliminate them so that they don’t lose squander investments in new technology. Companies that take a people-based philosophy toward user adoption will draw the talent they need to make their business thrive, and employees will feel compelled to utilise the tools they are given to their fullest extent. Computacenter’s Chief Technologist Paul Bray states, “The bottom line is: if users don’t adopt the technology, you’re not only wasting money but also losing out on the opportunity for people to do their best work.” The question is, What are the barriers to adoption of new technology? How do you break them down? Computacenter and Intel are collaborating to answer these questions for businesses and organisations. Intel’s Director of Business Solutions Jim Henrys states, “As soon as you need to think about how to use technology it becomes a barrier.” When workplace applications are implemented without proper introduction, or are simply not intuitive systems, people feel like the tech is against them. One thing for companies to do is integrate more intuitive software - that surely helps. But most important of all is focusing on how to bring the people along with the new systems. Mr. Henrys details the three ways people tend to work. It is crucial to understand is how people work so the technology can support that. “We want to know how technology can enrich [people’s] lives rather than limit them,” he says. First, they want to work on the go. They must have digital work tools that enable them to connect wherever they are in a versatile and secure way. Second, people want to collaborate. Workplace collaboration is essential to an organisation’s creativity and productivity, and the tech should facilitate it with high quality visuals and audio, for example. And last, people want to work alone. They need a quiet personal workspace with technology that must simply get out of their way so they can let their creativity flow. In all three situations, the digital tools are meant to facilitate rather than hinder work. Mr. Henrys argues, “The tech supports the workstyles I’ve described, it’s NOT the workstyle itself. The tech is the means by which people can work the way they want to, and need to. Do that and user adoption won’t be a problem. Your investment in technology will yield a return: financially and in a very human way.” Learn more!

The security firm’s research team found an astonishing 176 new threats per minute in the period, it claimed in its McAfee Labs Threats Report: April 2017. The number of new malware samples discovered grew by nearly a quarter (24%) in 2016 to reach a whopping 638 million, although growth slowed 17% in Q4, it revealed. The total number of ransomware samples grew by 88% in 2016 as a whole, but dropped 71% in Q4 as the once-prolific Locky and CryptoWall families declined. The security vendor, recently spun out of parent company Intel and renamed from Intel Security, suggested that threat intelligence sharing is key to defeating the bad guys, and that siloed systems too often create gaps for hackers to exploit. “The security industry faces critical challenges in our efforts to share threat intelligence between entities, among vendor solutions, and even within vendor portfolios,” said Vincent Weafer, vice president of McAfee Labs. “Working together is power. Addressing these challenges will determine the effectiveness of cybersecurity teams to automate detection and orchestrate responses, and ultimately tip the cybersecurity balance in favor of defenders.” The report highlighted the increasing threat posed by IoT malware Mirai. McAfee claimed the October public release of the Mirai source code had propelled related botnet activity, with an estimated 2.5 million devices infected by the malware by the end of Q4. McAfee said around five device IP addresses were added to Mirai botnets every minute by the end of the year. A new variant of the botnet-conscripting malware was discovered last week after a 54-hour DDoS attack on a US university which generated over 2.8 billion requests.

What the Mac needs in 2017 Apple finally refreshes the Mac Pro, but the model you want isn't coming this... Video MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac Now that we know that Apple really does care about the Mac and is working on a new Mac Pro, it’s no longer a useless exercise to dream a little bit and make a wish list of what we’d like to see in Apple’s top-of-the-line Mac. Apple says the new Mac Pro will hopefully ship next year. Once it does hit the market, here’s what I hope to find in the future Mac Pro. A practical tower case design There’s no denying that the current cylindrical Mac Pro is a design feat that’s nice to look at, but it’s impractical in so many ways. And the fashionable design is one of the last things pro users care about. It’s not like you’re going to sit there and admire the Mac Pro’s round edges and gunmetal glare while waiting for a 4K video to render. No, you’re moving on to other tasks. You’ve got to get stuff done. Apple Apple’s aluminum tower case made its debut with the Power Mac G5 in 2003. A tower case design that provides easy access to the inside of the computer is what pros want. I’m not an engineer or a designer, but I imagine a tower is easier to deal with (and it’s a design proven over and over again) when it comes to thermal considerations, which Apple admits is a problem with the cylindrical Mac Pro. Should Apple simply revive the “cheese grater” design of the original Mac Pro? Apple doesn’t believe in looking back. That tower design worked, but it was extremely heavy and bulky. Apple’s all about the sleekness and thinness of its Mac laptops, iPhones, and iPads, so expect the same for a Mac Pro tower. The main reason I want a tower design is because it accommodates the other things I’d like to see in a new Mac Pro. Like… Modern graphics processors and the ability to upgrade Brad Chacos Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti When Nvidia recently started shipping its GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, I had the same thought I always have when a new beastly desktop graphics card hits the PC market: It’s too f-ing bad that a Mac can’t use that new GPU. In its Mac Pro pow-wow with select members of the media, Apple admitted that it took the wrong approach to its graphic implementation in the cylindrical Mac Pro. Apple gave the impression that the new Mac Pro will accommodate the way GPUs are currently designed, resulting in better handling of 3D graphics, video, and virtual reality software. But it’s not enough to include current GPUs in the Mac Pro. I can easily see Apple including a non-upgradeable GPU in order to accommodate certain design philosophies, and that would be wrong. Mac Pro users demand speed, and the ability to upgrade the graphics card when a faster one becomes available is key to fulfilling that demand. Razer Razer Core external GPU for PCs. During the Mac Pro briefing, TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino asked Apple about external GPUs. Apple VP Craig Federighi responded with a terse, “I think they have a place.” So neither a denial or confirmation. An external GPU opens up some interesting possibilities. It would work over a Thunderbolt 3 connection, and since it's external, we could see an interesting and compact Mac Pro case design. It’s also feasible that an external GPU unit could also be used with a MacBook Pro or any other Mac equipped with the proper Thunderbolt 3 ports. However, an external GPU is the exact type of product Apple historically would not sell. (An external GPU also requires some macOS issues to be worked out.) But it looks like the thermal issues with the current Mac Pro calls for some out-of-the-box thinking with the future Mac Pro.  Up-to-date CPUs In order to make my point about the CPU in the future Mac Pro, I’d like to talk about Apple’s current MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro uses Skylake processors, which were released by Intel in 2015. Meanwhile, the PC market offers laptops with Kaby Lake Intel processors, the successor to Skylake that was released last year. Essentially, the MacBook Pro uses an older-generation processor, which might be fine for what people do on the laptop. Newegg But the Mac Pro needs to have the latest Intel processor available. The Mac Pro is Apple’s way to showcase its implementation of the best technology available. Older-generation processors defeat that purpose. And as I’ve said before, Mac Pro users demand speed. Imagine the letdown if Apple revealed a Mac Pro in 2018 based around a Skylake processor. As for the ability to upgrade the CPU, I don’t think Apple would or could do it. As PC users know, a CPU upgrade often requires a motherboard upgrade, and Apple has never gone that route. That's another reason why Apple needs to use the latest processors. Ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, USB 3.0 Apple Apple USB-C to USB Adapter This goes without saying, and it’s probably a done deal. Thunderbolt 3/USB-C is on the MacBook Pro, so there’s a precedence in the Mac lineup. I would like to see a couple of USB 3.0 ports, though, to support legacy hardware that people use. Sure, Apple offers a USB-C to USB Adapter ($19), but since the future Mac Pro is going to be Apple’s most expensive Mac, adding a couple of USB 3 ports will not only be convenient, but it’ll also save the user from buying more adapters. I’d like to see most of the ports on the current Mac Pro appear on the future Mac Pro: ethernet, the audio out ports, and HMDI. No need to include FireWire; I know some will disagree, but Apple moved on from FireWire a while ago. 512GB SSD to start Dan Frakes/IDG The SSD inside the current Mac Pro. A lot of Mac Pro users rely on external storage, but you also need enough internal storage. The current Mac Pro includes 256GB of flash storage, and for content developers, that’s too small. At least 1TB is ideal, but it’s expensive. 512GB, while probably on the small side, is a good cost/capacity compromise. You can upgrade the current cylindrical Mac Pro with a third-party SSD, like one offered by OWC. But the installation involves more than simply disconnecting and removing the old drive and connecting and placing the new one. A new tower case could make it really easy to perform a storage upgrade. A complementary 5K display Also revealed during Apple’s Mac Pro briefing: The company is working on a pro display. No details were offered on the display, but Apple worked with LG on the UltraFine 5K Display, which can lead you into the direction Apple will probably take with its pro display. LG LG UltraFine 5K display It sounds like the new Apple display is being designed with the future Mac Pro in mind, but I hope Apple remembers that an Apple pro display will be bought by non-Mac Pro users, as well. So hopefully any dependence of the pro display on the Mac Pro will be kept to a minimum. I mentioned above how I’d like to see USB 3 on the future Mac Pro. The LG UltraFine 5K display includes USB-C ports, so we’ll probably see USB-C ports on Apple’s pro display. If Apple included a USB 3 port on the display and left them off the future Mac Pro, I’d be OK with that.

However, recent years have seen the high-end components required to run CAD and other compute-intensive applications squeezed into small form-factor desktops and clamshell-format mobile workstations. Now HP Inc has delivered the Z2 Mini G3 Workstation, a Mac Mini-sized workstation that can fit into a variety of small spaces on or around a desk. And, given that you can run up to six displays from this tiny system, you're going to need all the desk space you can get. HP's workstation family now includes the mini-PC-format Z2 Mini G3 (bottom right). Image: HP Inc. So, how does HP's diminutive workstation work out in practice -- can such a small package really deliver the goods? Design The Z2 Mini G3, which is certified for over 20 workstation-class applications, can fit on or under desks, behind monitors or on a monitor display arm. Images: HP According to HP, the Z2 Mini G3 is "90 percent smaller than a traditional business-class tower". With a 216mm-square footprint (give or take the chopped-off corners that give it an octagonal look), 58mm height, and weight starting at 2.04kg, there's certainly no mistaking it for a traditional desktop PC. If your working environment is space-limited, you have plenty of placement options: flat or upright on the desk; under the desk; and VESA-mounted on the back of a monitor or as part of a display arm setup. HP has thought about the inconvenience of locating the power switch in some of these configurations, and allows the system to be powered up remotely via the keyboard or mouse. There's a lock slot at the back, allowing this eminently portable unit to be physically secured. Inside the Z2 Mini G3, showing the CPU (right) and GPU (left) fans. The CPU fan lifts up to give access to the two SODIMM RAM slots. Image: HP You get tool-free access to the innards via a latch at the back, revealing a tightly packed set of components, including a pair of fans -- one each for the CPU and GPU. Given the amount of computing horsepower on offer (see below), you might be forgiven for fearing that the Z2 Mini G3 puts out a lot of fan noise when running demanding workloads. However, we didn't find this to be the case when testing our Xeon/Nvidia-powered review unit. Features There are no fewer than 26 variants of the Z2 Mini G3 Workstation on HP's UK website, starting at £740 (ex. VAT, or £888 inc. VAT) for a system based on an Intel Core i7-6700 processor with integrated HD Graphics 530, running at 3.4GHz (up to 4GHz with Turbo Boost). This has 8GB of DDR4-2400 RAM and a 1TB SATA hard drive spinning at 7,200rpm. Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 At the top end of the Z2 Mini G3 range is a £1,325 (ex. VAT, or £1,590 inc. VAT) model running on an Intel Xeon E3-1245 v5 with integrated HD Graphics P530 running at 3.5GHz (up to 3.9GHz with Turbo Boost). RAM is maxed out at 32GB (2x16GB), and as well as the integrated graphics this model has a discrete Nvidia Quadro M620 GPU with 2GB of dedicated video RAM. Storage is provided by a 512GB HP Z Turbo PCIe SSD, and there's a slot to add a SATA drive if further capacity is required. Ports on the 'Performance' SKU, as reviewed here. 'Entry' SKUs have three DisplayPort connectors rather than four, and lack the pair of USB-C ports. The blanking plate covers the space for an optional legacy serial port. Image: HP For a small device, there are a lot of connections on the Z2 Mini G3. Most are at the back, where -- on the 'Performance' SKU we had for review -- you'll find four DisplayPort 1.2 connectors, two USB-C, two USB 3.0 ports, and an RJ-45 Ethernet port. There's also a connector for the external power brick (135W or 200W, depending on the model) and a disk activity LED. A legacy nine-pin serial port is available as an option. On the left-hand side there's a pair of USB 3.0 ports (one charging) and a 3.5mm audio jack. An accessory sleeve is available to physically block access to the USB ports if the IT department deems this necessary. To drive the maximum complement of six monitors, you'll not only need a 'Performance' model with both CPU-integrated and discrete Nvidia graphics, and four DisplayPort connectors, but you'll also need to daisy-chain two of them. Performance Our review unit was based on Intel's Xeon E3-1245 v5 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB PCIe SSD. In terms of CPU performance, it acquitted itself well compared to the AIO-format HP Z1 Workstation G3, which we reviewed in December last year. The diminutive Z2 Mini delivered a Geekbench 4 Multi Core score of 14525, versus the Z1's score of 15126 -- impressive considering the AIO system we tested was based on a Xeon E3-1270 v5 processor with 64GB of RAM. Under the Cinebench R15 CPU test, the Z2 Mini even outscored the Z1, with 805.6 compared to 801.4. On graphics performance, the Z2 Mini with its 2GB Nvidia Quadro M620 GPU couldn't quite match the Z1, which sported a 4GB Quadro M2000M: in the Cinebench R15 OpenGL test, the Z2 Mini managed a very respectable 92 frames per second (fps), but the Z1 turned in 106.4fps. Both workstations were equipped with 512GB PCIe SSDs, and both delivered similarly impressive disk performance under the ATTO Disk Benchmark: write speeds of 1,482MBps and 1,581MBps for the Z2 Mini and Z1 respectively, and read speeds of 2,228MBps and 2226MBps respectively. Conclusions HP has pulled off a feat of engineering with the Z2 Mini G3 Workstation. Packing a Xeon CPU and discrete Nvidia Quadro GPU into a mini-PC-format enclosure might be expected to bring all sorts of cooling issues, but we found that it delivered similar performance levels to its AIO-format Z1 stablemate without excessive fan noise. Of course there are tradeoffs: although the Z2 Mini G3 takes up little space and can be positioned in multiple ways, there's precious little on offer in the way of upgradability.

There are even new ARM processors that are somewhat comparable to the previous generation desktop processors. This jump in performance led many to speculate that Apple could be making a jump as well to ARM for its line of laptops like the MacBook Pro. While it could be quite possible, Apple made it clear that it does not have any intentions of changing systems for the MacBook Pro or any other Mac device. According to Axios, Apple has no intentions of using an ARM chip to a Mac or a MacBook Pro as a main system. However, the company is not closing its doors on the possibility for more ARM chips used for peripheral devices. At the moment, the latest MacBook Pro is already equipped with an ARM chip. This chip controls the Touch Bar and Touch ID features of the 1026 MacBook Pro. While the prospect of using an ARM chip to MacBook Pro is quite enticing, it will remain to be with the mobile devices that Apple sells in the market. MacBook Pro 2016 (via apple.com) Even if Apple chooses to switch to the ARM platform, it is not entirely new to the company. In fact, back in 2006, Apple made a huge decision to ditch the PowerPC line of processors in favor of the Intel line of chips. Another aspect of it not being a surprise at all is the fact that Intel has been lagging behind in terms of performance for a few years now. Its old strategy of small incremental upgrades for each product released has led to the boost in market for other products like the AMD Ryzen processor. Perhaps the most obvious change that could possibly come is the switch to AMD processors instead of ARM chips. Right now, Intel is caught between a rock and a hard place as AMD unleashed its newest line of cheap and high-performance processors. Maybe in the near future, consumers could be seeing a Mac product that uses an AMD processor. In hindsight, Apple has already made the switch to AMD graphics on the new MacBook Pros and Mac Pros. It is only a matter of time before it makes the same switch to AMD processors. For more updates on the MacBook Pro, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News Trump Removes Steve Bannon From National Security Council Restores Positions on Council to Intel Chief, Joint Chiefs Chairman by Jason Ditz, April 05, 2017 Print This | Share This Back in late January, President Trump surprised many with a reshuffle of the National Security Council, adding his chief strategist Steve Bannon to the council while removing the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman and the Director of National Intelligence. Today, he reversed course, booting Bannon off the council, restoring both of the previously removed posts to the principals committee, and also adding the Secretary of Energy, the CIA Director, and the US Ambassador to the United Nations to the committee. There were reports of Bannon clashing with National Security Adviser HR McMaster, and the move is seen as a boost for McMaster, as the revision also downgrades the authority of Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert, putting him under McMaster’s control. Interestingly, White House officials say that the only reason they put Bannon on the council in the first place was to “keep an eye” on former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who resigned  in February, and that Bannon’s appointment was always intended to be temporary. Officials added that Bannon never attended a single meeting of the council in his role.

Just baby sitting then….????? Hey screw them If they can’t take a joke….. But who is the joke on…??? Is it on Bannon, those who voted Trump, or is it on McMasrers…..?????? Still leaves one wonderin why to let the navigator go this early in the voyage… Must more to this than Thanks Alot! Good job baby sitting… See you soon… Or not… Stay tuned… Who knows what rocks they yill find in the sea of tears ahead without Bannon to steer away from peril.. What think you..?? Tonyandoc Even Trump cannot avoid getting stuck in the tar-pit that is Washington. Populism and nationalism are not permitted within the establishment. Trump probably got the same message recently as Elizabeth Warren got from from Larry Summers back in 2009. The Democrats took care of the Sanders threat in-house. The elites’ firewall is still working as designed. Ten Count Toronto Probably a McMaster demand. At this point I think Trump is already just a hostage in his own presidency as most of his inner circle from the campaign is separated from him and those still around are under enormous pressure & threat of investigations and trial in the media, right up to his son-in-law. JimBass56 Another scalp for the Establishment/Deep State. RickR35 The establishment always wins in the end. Don The best explanation of this is that Trump was compeltely ignorant and uninformed to begin with. Wasn’t it obvious? To somebody’s credit, a lot of his ignorant bullsh-t moves are being fixed. Trump’s supporters can put it down to the establishment winning against Trump but that’s just laughable at this point. Trump’s verbal flailing around on his new position on Syria last night was a real comedy routine but probably good enough to fly right over the heads of most of his supporters. Like as if Trump ever had a position on Syria, Russia/Putin, or anything related. However, Raimondo is going to be pretty well limited now on his support of Trump. It’s going to have to be refined to “the establishment has forced Trump to be prowar”, sort of useless babbling. As Raimondo’s country marches to war against Syria! Make it good Raimondo, it’s going to take at least a few thousand words! Eileen Kuch Do you have any idea what an all-out war with Syria would be like, Don? Do you really know what the situation in Europe was like back in March of 1914, 5 months before the outbreak of WW1? We’re in the same type of situation today as Europe was in 100 years ago .. only, this time, the major powers (USA, Russia and China) have large stockpiles of both nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. The so-called “Establishment” is totally psychotic and suicidal, and the rest of us don’t want to be victims of the USA’s suicidal actions. What actually changed Donald Trump’s stance on Syria (and Russia) was the death threats he’s been receiving from lunatic left-wing extremists, who hate Russia in the extreme. The Donald began his administration on the right track, with his anti-war, anti-interventionist Inaugural address, and that’s when the lunatic fringe on the left ratcheted up their rhetoric with actual death threats. Don Oh sure Eileen, it’s not Trump’s fault that your country could be on the verge of a war that involved Russia. And you can’t believe the truth because it’s still domestic politics for you. Eileen, if it turns out that you have contributed in your small way to war with Russia or with Russia involved, do you have childrent you should be buying lethal injections for so you can administer them when the radiation sickness gets too bad to endure?

In fact, the CreditEase Wealth Management-HUJ partnership has lasted for years and it has expanded channels and created opportunities for non-governmental investors and mutual exchanges. "Such a partnership is very important to both parties," said Zvi Wiener, the school's dean. "Today is neither the first nor the last step (of our cooperation), but definitely the most critical one." Also in attendance were 20 students who joined the fourth Israel trip of CreditEase Wealth Management Institute. During the eight-day program, the group listened to lectures on innovation, visited startups and experienced the local culture. Thanks to HUJ's efforts, the students also met with Robert Aumann - a 2005 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, a former intelligence officer from Mossad, a high-ranking female officer from Israeli Intelligence Corps (Unit 8200), and Saul Singer - author of the Start-Up Nation. They also had a closer look at Mobileye, a smart driver assistance system startup recently acquired by Intel for USD15.3bn. Although more and more Chinese institutions are running similar projects in Israel, the CreditEase Wealth Management's program still stands out with high market recognition, built on the company's deep understanding about the country as well as its strategic partnership with the Hebrew University, said Zhou Yuan, Managing Director of CreditEase Wealth Management who participated in CreditEase Wealth Management's initial investigation on the program.  "Every trip that I've made to Israel has been eye-opening," said Zhou at the ceremony. About CreditEase Wealth Management The wealth management arm of CreditEase focuses on comprehensive global asset allocation services for high-net-worth individuals and mass affluent investors, offering a wide range of services and products available in multiple currencies for onshore and offshore investments in the areas of fixed income, private equity, capital markets, hedge funds, real estate, insurance, as well as investment immigration and international education.

In fact, the CreditEase Wealth Management-HUJ partnership has lasted for years and it has expanded channels and created opportunities for non-governmental investors and mutual exchanges. "Such a partnership is very important to both parties," said Zvi Wiener, the school's dean. "Today is neither the first nor the last step (of our cooperation), but definitely the most critical one." Also in attendance were 20 students who joined the fourth Israel trip of CreditEase Wealth Management Institute. During the eight-day program, the group listened to lectures on innovation, visited startups and experienced the local culture. Thanks to HUJ's efforts, the students also met with Robert Aumann - a 2005 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, a former intelligence officer from Mossad, a high-ranking female officer from Israeli Intelligence Corps (Unit 8200), and Saul Singer - author of the Start-Up Nation. They also had a closer look at Mobileye, a smart driver assistance system startup recently acquired by Intel for USD15.3bn. Although more and more Chinese institutions are running similar projects in Israel, the CreditEase Wealth Management's program still stands out with high market recognition, built on the company's deep understanding about the country as well as its strategic partnership with the Hebrew University, said Zhou Yuan, Managing Director of CreditEase Wealth Management who participated in CreditEase Wealth Management's initial investigation on the program.  "Every trip that I've made to Israel has been eye-opening," said Zhou at the ceremony. About CreditEase Wealth Management The wealth management arm of CreditEase focuses on comprehensive global asset allocation services for high-net-worth individuals and mass affluent investors, offering a wide range of services and products available in multiple currencies for onshore and offshore investments in the areas of fixed income, private equity, capital markets, hedge funds, real estate, insurance, as well as investment immigration and international education.

They also reaffirmed their commitment to their pro users and revealed that they had a pro iMac in the works. Exactly what constitutes as pro iMac remains to be seen, but thanks to a report from Pike’s Universum (via MacRumors), the alleged specs of the iMac Pro (or whatever it will be called) have been revealed. If the specs are true, it seems that Apple will be going with Intel’s Xeon E3 processors for the iMac Pro. It will also come with 16GB of ECC RAM and can be configured to go up to 64GB. This is versus current consumer-grade iMacs which sport 8GB of non-ECC RAM by default, and can be configured to 32GB. It is also rumored to feature faster NVMe SSDs with storage up to 2TB, and it will feature the use of AMD graphics, so for those hoping that Apple would return to using NVIDIA’s GPU might be disappointed. Last but not least, the iMac Pros will use Thunderbolt 3 ports, which shouldn’t be surprising and should almost be a given. According to Pike’s Universum, these new iMacs will be revealed come late October alongside a brand new keyboard. Whether or not this new keyboard will sport a Touch Bar like the patents have hinted at remains to be seen, but until we get the official word, take it all with a grain of salt.

Roston - Apr 6, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit If you dream of owning a MacBook Air, now is as good a time as any to pick one up. While used and refurbished models are still the cheapest options, nothing beats buying new, and that makes Best Buy’s recent price cut a great incentive. The retailer recently slashed the 13-inch MacBook Air’s price down to $799 USD, and that’s for a new model with 8GB of memory and an Intel i5 processor. The ‘open box’ models are even cheaper. MacBook Air 13-inch Review (mid-2013) It wasn’t too long ago that Apple introduced its new MacBook Pro laptops, and there’s a lot to like about them: USB-C, the fancy new Touch Bar, and their powerful hardware options. Not everyone needs something as powerful as a MacBook Pro, though, and so there’s the alternative 12-inch MacBook, a likewise new (-ish) model with USB-C and a much thinner body. Not everyone likes the lack of ports, though, and the 12-inch MacBook is still pretty pricey, turning many people off. That’s where the MacBook Air comes in, offering the best of both worlds with its thin and light body, its increasingly classic design, and its larger array of ports, including an SD card slot and a couple of ordinary USB ports. Joining that is the crazy 12 or so hours of battery run time you’ll get on a charge, enough to get you an extra-long work day. There are some things to dislike about this 13-inch MacBook Air, of course. The lack of Retina is one of them, and the Intel i5 processor may not be appealing to certain users. For the ordinary person, though — for students, writers, photographers, academics, and more — this hardware is more than adequate enough for an everyday laptop. The notebook was priced at $999 USD, but as of now Best Buy has it listed for $799 USD, a $200 price drop.

The knockout punch may come if he follows through on threats of protectionism. From a possible border tax to higher tariffs, America’s push to reset trade relations is putting Vietnam’s small economy at risk. Phu Tai, based in a central province, relies on the U.S. for 40 percent of sales, and some business may evaporate if its dining-room sets and outdoor chairs become too expensive. “If protectionism rises in the U.S., it will hurt countries like Vietnam that rely on exports,” said Nguyen Sy Hoe, the company’s deputy general director. “The government needs to help companies.” Vietnam sells a fifth of its exports to the U.S., making it one of the few Asian nations counting America as a bigger market for their goods than China. Yet Vietnam’s $32 billion trade surplus with the U.S. puts it in the crosshairs of the White House after Trump ordered a study to identify any “trade abuse” fueling American deficits. Trump also professed support for a border adjustment tariff to encourage production of goods in the U.S. and reduce incentives for companies to move overseas. Higher taxes on U.S. importers would reduce Vietnam’s gross domestic product by almost 0.9 percent, the most negative effect on any Asian country, Credit Suisse Group AG economists Santitarn Sathirathai and Michael Wan said in a January report. “If the U.S. creates a new wave of protectionism, Vietnam will be very vulnerable,” said Alexander Vuving, a Vietnam political analyst at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Hawaii. The U.S. will investigate countries running the biggest bilateral trade deficits to assess the extent they’re caused by “cheating or inappropriate behavior,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said. That tone is triggering alarm in Hanoi. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc told his cabinet that U.S. protectionist policies could hurt the economy and lead to a slowdown in exports and foreign investment. Samsung, Intel The rhetoric comes at an inopportune time for a nation where foreign technology titans Samsung Electronics Co., Intel Corp. and LG Display Co. have set up shop. Companies relocated factories to Vietnam from China in recent years because of the latter’s rising costs and shrinking labor force. Since introducing market-oriented “doi moi” changes in the 1980s, Vietnam has increasingly tethered itself to global trade, helping transform an agrarian economy into a manufacturing hub of everything from shoes to smartphones. Exports surged to a record $177 billion last year, with U.S. customers accounting for about $42 billion of that -- more than double compared to five years ago. Mobile phones and parts make up the biggest segment at about 27 percent. The most-recent GDP figures show how trade-dependent Vietnam has become. Samsung’s decision to scrap production of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphone last year spurred an 11 percent decline in shipments of phones and parts during the first quarter, the national statistics office said. That played a role in curbing growth of gross domestic product to just 5.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with the 6.25 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Phuc called the slower rate “very worrisome” and asked ministries to find “suitable solutions,” according to an April 3 posting on the government’s website. The government is targeting 6.7 percent growth this year. Just the threat of American trade barriers is denting exports for some homegrown manufacturers. Thanh Hoa-based Delta Sport Joint-Stock Co. saw a 20 percent drop in U.S. orders for its sportswear during the first quarter, Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Trong Thau said. Wal-Mart, Mizuno Last year, shipments to the U.S. represented about 40 percent of its exports, or the equivalent of $30 million in revenue. Customers include Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Mizuno Corp., according to its website. “Some of our American retailer clients are concerned about some uncertainty in the policies of the new administration,” Thau said. “We’re a bit worried about the outlook of our exports to the U.S.” The Trans-Pacific Partnership would have benefited Vietnam by reducing or, in some cases, eliminating U.S. import tariffs. Without U.S. participation, Vietnam is pivoting toward Plan B. Government officials vowed to push through structural changes to the economy required under the deal, including reforming state-owned enterprises and strengthening enforcement of intellectual-property protections. They’re also pushing sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing to improve efficiency and product quality. The science and technology ministry recently organized a business trip to the U.S. for Vietnamese companies to meet prospective clients, and the government is helping market their goods. Bilateral Deals “In the current environment, it’s crucial for us to improve our competitiveness,” said Tran Viet Thanh, the deputy minister of science and technologies. Hanoi may explore ways to keep TPP alive even without U.S. participation, said Michael Michalak, regional managing director of the U.S.-Asean Business Council and former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. One alternative would be bilateral or small-group deals with neighbors or Latin American countries on the basis of the earlier negotiations, he said. “I don’t think they want to see those six years go to waste,” he said. “There are opportunities there to build on.” That’s what furniture supplier Phu Tai is trying to do. It’s spending about 140 billion dong ($6.2 million) to build a factory in coastal Binh Dinh province to boost capacity and cut out the middlemen it uses for Wal-Mart, Hoe said. “That will help us save a lot more in costs,” he said. “We must be more competitive to cope with what protectionism may bring about.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Hear what Malcolm Turnbull thinks about polls now. More videos Turnbull won't budge on housing affordability Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is taking a wait and see approach on housing affordability, despite a public warning from the Reserve Bank about rising household debt. To test the veracity of that statement I spoke to a friend who works for one of the major banks. I asked him to run the numbers to let me know how much his bank would lend to a couple earning $85,000 a year each, with an adequate deposit and no debts. I was astounded to learn they could qualify for a loan of $1 million. Let's do the calculations with the figures rounded for ease of reading. Income tax including Medicare Levy on an $85,000 a year salary would be $21,000. Therefore, our hypothetical couple should be receiving combined take-home pay of $128,000 a year.

Obviously, personal discretionary expenses can vary enormously between households, but a recent study on retirement showed that a retired couple could expect to spend about $54,000 a year. Those figures were certainly not based on an extravagant lifestyle, with clothing costs estimated at $58 a week, and leisure at $173 a week. However, for the sake of the exercise let's assume our working couple live fairly frugally, and spend $60,000 a year. That leaves just $7000 over for contingencies such as holidays, house maintenance and vehicle replacement. Advertisement You could take an optimistic view and argue that a couple could get by quite reasonably in this situation, but all borrowing examples need to be stress tested. The obvious first question is: what happens if interest rates rise to 6 per cent? If that happened, their repayments would jump to $6000 a month, taking $12,000 a year from their cash flow. Just that relatively small rate rise could put them under water. We must also think long-term, and accept the fact that many couples aim to have children. The repayments I have used are based on a 30-year term – this means the mortgage does not reduce much in the early years. In fact, at 4.5 per cent, after five years of payments totalling $306,000, the debt would still be $912,000. Even at today's low rates of interest, this couple could not cope if one of them had to give up their job – and they might have to do so for a range of reasons other than starting a family, such as ill-health or lay-offs. The lesson here is that anybody considering buying a property should base the amount they borrow on their personal circumstances, and not on some hypothetical figure the bank's computer spits out. You need to prepare a simple budget, leaving some room for the unexpected items that are bound to come up, and then calculate how much of your take-home pay would be available for loan repayments. You should also allow around $4000 a year for the ongoing non-mortgage costs of home ownership. Once you have determined a monthly mortgage payment that seems comfortable, you then figure out the amount you could borrow using a factor of $600 per $100,000 loan per month – this would repay a loan in 30 years at 6 per cent. For example, if you worked out you could afford to repay $3000 a month, the maximum you should borrow would be $500,000. If a loan of that size won't buy the house you want, you need to review your options. Save for longer, rent instead of buy, or choose a cheaper house. Any of these are better than suffering mortgage stress, or worse, the stress of a forced sale. Noel Whittaker is the author of Making Money Made Simple and numerous other books on personal finance.

We pushed some of the things we were working on today off the agenda and started testing the new Ryzen Power Plan to see what performance gains were to be had. So, with a clean install of Windows 10 you get three plans from Microsoft, but you have the ability to create and add a custom power plan if you want to. Balanced – The default Windows 10 power plan that offers full performance when you need it and saves power when you don’t. Power saver – Saves power by reducing PC performance by lower clock speeds, screen brightness and through additional tweaks. High performance – Doesn’t lower the CPU clock speed when it isn’t being used for maximum performance, keeps other components from entering power-saving mode without worrying about power consumption. Custom power plan – Microsoft allows PC manufacturers (OEM) or anyone that wants to create an additional power plan to create a custom power plan. AMD came up with their own power plan and packaged it as a standalone installer (ppkg) that you can download and use right now. To install it on our Windows 10 system we just needed to allow the package to run on our system due Windows UAC alert and that was it. Once we went back into the Power Options on our test system there was a new AMD Ryzen Balanced Power Plan to choose from and it was automatically selected by default. This is nice as once it is installed you can just clock the power plan you want and quickly test the differences between the AMD Ryzen Balanced power plan and the default Balanced and High Performance plans. AMD informed Legit Reviews that they will be placing this power plan into the AMD chipset driver package shortly. They said that it will replace the Balanced plan that comes with Windows, and be set as the new setting for users with AMD Ryzen CPUs. What makes this power plan so special? Here are the two big changes that AMD did, but you can get more details from their blog post. Maintain residency in CPU P0 or P1 to give Zen full control over clocks and volts. Disable core parking. Why does this matter? On Windows 7 the OS keeps all physical cores awake, and parks SMT cores. Those running Windows 10 will find that the OS keeps one physical and one logical core away (Core0+1), then parks the rest as often as possible. This difference alone is what’s responsible for the cases online where some sites and users have said Windows 7 was faster than Windows 10 with regards to gaming performance. It was not the scheduler as the community thought at first. It should also be noted that Intel fully disables core parking in their own custom Balanced power plan. So, the secret sauce with this new power plan is disabling core parking! AMD sent over the following benchmark results that they came up with internally and the results look pretty damn impressive as you can see in the table below.

It is up to developers to bring the optimization for newer games. Hopefully, they wouldn’t mind doing it to bring the balance of the force in PC gaming. Nandiman Also, has anyone checked the power consumption with the new power plan? Because if it barely adds performance but significantly decreases efficiency than it’s a double bust (though I doubt it would be significantly affected, but I am curious.

Apple has already announced the new desktop will feature configurations "with the pro customer in mind." Good news folks. I am told, by a little bird, that the next iMac (to be released in late October) will be available with (up to) Intel E3-1285 v6 processor with 16 GB (upgradable to 32 or 64 GB) ECC memory. Faster NVMe SSD’s possibly up to 2 TB and AMD graphics to support VR and Pro apps. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C gen 2 with… tada… a brand new keyboard. While these details are sourced from a 'little bird' that 'is usually pretty accurate', the site recommends staying skeptical. We've already heard rumors that Apple could bring its new MacBook Pro Touch Bar to its wireless keyboards and it's likely that more reports will surface ahead of launch.

Worries surrounding the upcoming meeting between President Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping were cited as the cause, though the market was not well-positioned for a big gain regardless of Thursday’s backdrop. The S&P 500 ended the day at 2,357.49, up 0.19%. That was especially true for SeaWorld Entertainment Inc (NYSE:SEAS), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG), which led the session’s losers. Here’s the deal. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) As was pointed out late last year, computer chip company Advanced Micro Devices has a lot going for it now … perhaps more than it has in years. But, AMD shares were overbought and overvalued, rallying at an unsustainable pace. Goldman Sachs agrees with that stance, initiating coverage of AMD at a “Sell,” saying the stock’s worth only $11 per share versus its current price of $13.18. Analyst Toshiya Hari believes the stock is ‘priced for perfection,’ while still acknowledging the company has taken tremendous steps forward. Hari also expects rivals Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to begin lowering prices on their CPUs, GPUs and related chips before AMD garners any more market share by leveraging its entry-level pricing. AMD ended the day down 6.3%. Plug Power Inc (PLUG) Plug Power shares may have been off to the tune of 4.9% on Thursday, but don’t read too much into the move. That pullback was only a fraction of yesterday’s 73% gain from PLUG shares in response to news that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had inked a huge deal with the fuel cell company. Long story made short, Amazon has secured the rights to acquire up to a 23% stake in Plug Power, contingent on purchasing at least $600 million worth of fuel cell batteries. Amazon’s interest and potential spend on the company’s wares is compelling enough, in that Plug Power only generated $86 million worth of revenue all of last year. The fact that Amazon is similarly interested in an equity stake in Plug Power speaks volumes about the potential upside Amazon sees in fuel cells. Today’s relatively minor pullback from PLUG shares was just some predictable profit-taking. SeaWorld Entertainment Inc (SEAS) Last but not least, AMD wasn’t the only stock Goldman Sachs took a swing at on Thursday. The investment bank opened up coverage of SeaWorld Entertainment at a “Sell” as well, suggesting SEAS was only worth $16 per share, sending the stock 5% lower. Analyst Christopher Prykull is particularly concerned about sub-par growth stemming from waning attendance as well as the likely ineffectiveness of cost-cutting efforts. SeaWorld’s parks were once a popular tourist destination, and still are to a large extent. But, the company continues to deal with the fallout of a documentary called Blackfish, which cast a shadow of doubt as to how well the park is capable of treating its captive animals. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

It is especially difficult for a network as massive as AT&T. AT&T said this week that on March 28, it completed a trial of a multi-supplier open source white box switch carrying live network traffic. This is a significant step. Vendors to the project were Barefoot Networks, Broadcom, Delta Electronics, Edgecore Networks, Intel and SnapRoute. Software-defined networks (SDNs) separate the data plane (in other words, the emails, videos and other content) from the control plane (the packets that shepherd the payloads through the network). This segregation creates a lot of possibilities, including network management centralization and operating system standardization. This opens the door to new players, competition and reduced equipment costs. At the end of the day, it means that networks will run far more efficiently. Imagine a highway teeming with cars. Each has proprietary GPS devices from a small number of vendors. The cars rely on expensive proprietary devices to individually communicate with the satellites that provide directions. In such a world, there is no coordination between cars (except, perhaps between those using the same brand GPS). A high percentage of those drivers may decide to take the same highway at the same time to go to the mall. They would be oblivious if an ambulance needed to use that road. Now imagine the next-generation network. In the analogy, GPS relies on a common OS. A central traffic controller manages the cars in relation to each other. This is more efficient because the controller would know each cars’ location. Traffic jams would be avoided, shortcuts found for those willing to pay a premium, and the highway cleared for that ambulance. And, since most of the heavy lifting is done by the controller, the GPS device in each car would be simpler and cost less. Finally, since all of these devices now rely on an open source OS available to all, startups would be more common. That would drive costs down further. Much of this has already been developed in the server world. CIO.com makes the point that the intense tasks switches must perform make the transition more challenging. These devices have to dig deep into packets to determine what priority they have (i.e., whether they are going to the emergency room or the food court), the level of security they need and other attributes. Needless to say, this is a very complex operation that must be done very quickly. The transition to SDNs poses a threat to the established networking suppliers, as it would to the GPS vendors in the analogy. Until now, a small group of vendors dominated because barriers to entry for new players were daunting. SDNs threaten this neat and tidy landscape, according to Light Reading: For the makers of proprietary equipment, the ramifications of such a development are scary. Unless they somehow adapt themselves to a white box world, many traditional vendors and service providers could ultimately disappear. It was reported late last month that Cisco plans to sell its OS on a standalone basis. The Lindt OS will join others that are selling OSes in this manner. This has not been announced. If they do so, however, there are likely two goals: the desire to keep current customers from leaving and to keep influence over the evolution of SDN OSes.

Home Archives Ed Morrissey Show Newsletters   Devin Nunes steps aside temporarily from Russia investigation as House launches ethics probe posted at 12:01 pm on April 6, 2017 by Allahpundit Share on Facebook 1 1 SHARES The right decision, however belatedly — and reluctantly. He’s not doing this voluntarily, he notes in his statement, but because the left is making life hard for him and the House Intelligence Committee. “Several left-wing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics,” Nunes said in a statement Thursday. “The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power.” Nunes added: “Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committee’s Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter. I will continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims.” There’s a bit of sleight of hand there. It’s true that left-wing activist groups have filed complaints about him with the Office of Congressional Ethics over his revelation of incidental surveillance of Trump personnel. MoveOn.org is one of them. But it’s not just the OCE that’s interested in him. The House Ethics Committee, a separate body, also announced this morning that it’s investigating Nunes for possible unauthorized disclosure of classified information: The Committee has determined to investigate these allegations in order to fulfill its institutional obligation, under House Rule X, clause 11(g)(4), to investigate certain allegations of unauthorized disclosures of classified information, and to determine if there has been any violation of the Code of Official Conduct under House Rule XXIII, clause 13. The Committee notes that the mere fact that it is investigating these allegations, and publicly disclosing its review, does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred, or reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee. And so, a day after Trump accused Susan Rice of possibly having committed a crime in “unmasking” and/or leaking Americans properly, it’s his own ally on the Intel Committee who’s under suspicion for improper leaks. The Daily Beast predicted that a few days ago, noting that one of the Intel Committee’s own rules practically mandates an investigation in this case, providing “The Committee on Ethics shall investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence or intelligence-related information.” But what intelligence did Nunes, who was vague in his public pronouncements about “unmasking,” disclose? He’s told reporters repeatedly that the info he saw wasn’t classified. The Beast had a theory, though: [W]hen asked if the information he obtained came from surveillance obtained under FISA, or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Nunes replied, “it appears so.” He added, “it has to do with FISA, and there are multiple FISA warrants that are out there.” Surveillance authorized by FISA is some of the government’s most highly-classified information. To some lawyers, that means there is credible evidence to suggest Nunes did reveal classified information by speaking about FISA surveillance—assuming he doesn’t walk the FISA claim back, of course. “The existence or non-existence of a FISA warrant is a classified fact,” one natsec lawyer told the website. Did Nunes disclose a “classified fact,” though, if he didn’t name who, specifically, was targeted by any particular FISA warrant? Is “Trump transition members” a narrow enough description to amount to an improper disclosure? Relatedly, is Peter King now in trouble for unauthorized disclosures for what he told Fox News yesterday about the information involved in the surveillance reports Nunes saw? It includes “information about their everyday lives. Sort of like in a divorce case where lawyers are hired, investigators are hired just to find out what the other person is doing from morning until night and then you try to piece it together later on,” said King. Again, he didn’t name the specific target or targets, but he’s giving you insight into material that may have been obtained via a FISA warrant. Is that unethical? One other wrinkle to all of this: Nunes says he’s stepping back from “Russia investigation” but will continue to serve as chairman of the Intel Committee in all other matters. One of the notable details in his disclosure about incidental surveillance of Trump staffers is that, he claims, the surveillance had nothing to do with Russia. Does that mean he’s going to continue to pursue the investigation into who “unmasked” Trump personnel, which is what’s really annoyed the left this week? How broad is this recusal?

Current valuation metrics make it "difficult" to justify, and he expects the stock to underperform the market following the company's analyst day next month. AMD is facing competition from Intel (INTC) and  Nvidia (NVDA)  which Hari noted will likely negate any significant traction AMD gets with new products. "What bothers me about this call is that I do think AMD and Nvidia have a great product lineup. But people think there's froth," TheStreet's Jim Cramer, manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, said on CNBC's "Mad Dash" segment. Froth, though, isn't a strong enough case. Look at Tesla (TSLA) -- that's got plenty of froth and investors continue to bid it up.  Goldman is being a buzzkill here, Cramer said. They're taking away the punchbowl. He acknowledged that AMD has been on a remarkable run, but the company's video game business remains strong and it's doing well against Intel. Updated from 9:35 ET to include Jim Cramer's comments.

Among other things, Schiff slammed Nunes for viewing the documents by himself and not sharing them with Democrats on the committee. So last week, White House counsel Don McGahn invited Schiff to come see the documents for himself. Schiff did so on Friday. Now, both the Republican chairman and the Democratic ranking member on the Intel Committee have seen the documents. And now, the public has a chance to hear another assessment to balance Nunes' claim that he saw “dozens” of intelligence reports involving the incidental collection of Trumpworld figures in Obama administration intercepts, with the names of some of them “unmasked,” and that none of it had to do with Russia. In other words, Nunes suggested the Obama administration misused its wiretapping powers to gather information on the Trump team. So with Schiff’s visit to the White House, a chance for balance. But after viewing the documents, Schiff has gone nearly completely silent about what he saw. He has kept up his criticism of how Nunes came to view the material, but on what’s actually in the documents, Schiff has said virtually nothing. On Friday, immediately after viewing the documents, Schiff released a statement in which he declined to say anything about substance and repeated earlier criticisms of Republicans' handling of the matter. “While I cannot discuss the content of the documents,” Schiff said, “if the White House had any concern over these materials, they should have been shared with the full committee in the first place.” Schiff made no public comments on Saturday, and then on Sunday morning appeared on CNN, where Jake Tapper asked Schiff if, having seen the documents, “can you understand why Chairman Nunes might have some issues with the surveillance that was going on?” “I can’t go into the contents of the documents, Jake,” Schiff said, before a quick pivot to Nunes' methods. “I can say I don’t agree with the chairman’s characterization, which is exactly why it’s so important you don’t share documents with just one person or even two people. They need to be shared with both full committees.” Continuing, Schiff said “the most important thing” about the documents is not what is in them but how they were handled: “But the most important thing people need to know about these documents is not classified, and it’s a couple of things. First, the deputy assistant to the White House informed me when I went to see them that these are exactly the same materials that were shown to the chairman. "Now, this is a very interesting point. How does the White House know that these are the same materials that were shown to the chairman, if the White House wasn’t aware what the chairman was being shown? "And the second point was also made to me. And this is — I think was also underscored by Sean Spicer — and that is, it was told to me by the deputy assistant that these materials were produced in the ordinary course of business. "Well, the question for the White House and for Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because, if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? There’s nothing ordinary about the process that was used here at all.” All the talk about intercepts, Schiff said, was just an attempt by Trump and Republicans to distract from questions about Trump and Russia. By that time, anyone interested in the substance of the issue — Do the documents show that Obama administration officials picked up Trumpworld figures in electronic intercepts and then identified them by name? — was entirely frustrated. Schiff appeared determined to say nothing about substance. “I guess the question that Nunes is asking or suggesting that we should be asking in the media,” Tapper said to Schiff, “(is) who unmasked these Trump advisers, and is it possible that any of this unmasking was being done for political reasons, instead of for legitimate ones?” “Well, first of all, I can’t talk about, as I mentioned, the contents of any documents,” Schiff said. “So at this point, I can’t say whether anything was masked or unmasked improperly.” Schiff then pivoted again to criticize Republican procedures. Monday morning, Bloomberg’s Eli Lake reported that former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice “requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter.” If that is accurate, it seems unlikely that the “most important” thing about the documents is how they were handled. After seeing the documents with his own eyes, Schiff had a chance to shed some light on what has become a key question in the Trump-Russia matter. He didn’t take it.

ADVERTISEMENT “In a bipartisan way, the House Intelligence Committee should play the role that it needs to play in all of this. And I don’t have any reason to think that they wouldn’t,” Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol.  “I did have plenty reason to think that [Nunes] should not be in that role, both because of his role in the Trump transition and because of his erratic and bizarre behavior as chairman of the committee.” Nunes lit a storm of controversy last month when he briefed President Trump about details of the Russia investigation — a probe that partly examines Trump’s ties to Moscow — without first informing the other members of the full committee.  It was later reported that the new details were brought to Nunes’s attention by senior White House officials, leading to plenty of questions from Democrats about why he would need to brief the administration on things it already knew.  Several groups, including MoveOn.org, filed complaints with the Ethics Committee urging an examination into whether Nunes revealed sensitive material in taking his story to the press.  In a statement, Nunes portrayed the investigation as a witch hunt prompted by “false” accusations from “leftwing activist groups.” “The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power,” Nunes said.  Nonetheless, the 43-year-old chairman stepped away from the Russia probe in “the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress.”  In his stead, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) will lead the investigation, with help from Reps.

I think he understands his responsibility there,” she said. “And we’ll see how he goes forward.”  Tags Hillary Clinton Trey Gowdy   View the discussion thread.

While Apple didn’t share exactly what we might see in these new iMacs, one source believes it may have an idea about what to expect including other new hardware. Sony A6500 Pike’s Universum (via MacRumors) cites a “usually pretty accurate” source in sharing what the new iMacs could offer: Good news folks. I am told, by a little bird, that the next iMac (to be released in late October) will be available with (up to) Intel E3-1285 v6 processor with 16 GB (upgradable to 32 or 64 GB) ECC memory. Faster NVMe SSD’s possibly up to 2 TB and AMD graphics to support VR and Pro apps. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C gen 2 with… tada… a brand new keyboard. AMD graphics have previously been rumored along with the jump to Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C which would be expected. Could that new keyboard somehow offer Touch Bar features? The source also claims Apple’s promised Apple branded pro displays will feature 8K resolution compared to today’s LG 5K resolution display: Apple is also working on a 8K display for the next generation of Mac Pro’s, which by the way will be much more like a PC with the next generation EFI BIOS. And for the Mac mini, which Apple briefly acknowledged this week, there’s this teaser: The next Mac mini won’t be so mini anymore. Well. The top model that is. If you missed the news at the start of the week, Apple made the current Mac Pro hardware better spec’d for the price and promised a new modular design will be available in the future.

He wanted to create a premium brand for Irish butter to break into the growing British market. The new product, named Kerrygold and backed with a large marketing budget, was sold in half-pound packs in a parchment wrapping so shoppers could inspect the butter’s quality. Its success was an inspiration to other exporters and changed perceptions of Irish business. Half a century on, the Irish economy has been transformed into a global trading hub. Some 90% of its exports are shipped by multinational companies. Many of these are American giants such as Intel, a chipmaker, and Pfizer, a drugs firm. But some are home-grown food firms, such as Kerry Group. Observers speak of a dual economy: a “modern” capital-intensive part, powered by foreign direct investment (FDI), usually from America; and a “traditional” jobs-intensive food business, which still looks to the British market. The prospect of Brexit is pulling these two parts of the economy in opposing directions.

International16 hours ago See all updates For decades Ireland has appealed to foreign companies as a low-tax, English-speaking entry point to Europe’s single market. Brexit, in effect, removes a big rival for such mobile capital. Since Britain voted to leave the EU, there has been a “significant increase in inquiries” from firms considering a move to Ireland, says Martin Shanahan, boss of IDA Ireland, the state development agency. Much interest comes from banks and insurance companies, worried that London-based subsidiaries will lose the right to sell financial services in other EU countries. But the IDA’s phone lines were already busy. Many tech firms have chosen Ireland for their European headquarters. LinkedIn, a professional-network site, has built an office for 1,500 staff, having started with three people in 2010. Huawei, a Chinese telecoms firm, already has three centres in Ireland. Ireland’s indigenous industries have correspondingly shrunk in importance. When sales of Kerrygold took off in the 1960s, almost three-quarters of Irish goods exports went to Britain. Now just 13% do, a share that rises to 17% including services (see chart). Yet many analysts reckon that the damage from Brexit to Ireland’s food exporters will swamp any positive impact on high-tech FDI. Ireland is just one link in a global-tech supply chain: only a fraction of the value added to exports originates there. In contrast, the local content of Ireland’s food exports to Britain is high: weighted by Irish jobs, Britain’s export share would be around a quarter, according to John FitzGerald and Patrick Honohan of Trinity College, Dublin. Half of Ireland’s farm exports go to Britain and some would face tariffs of almost 60% in the event of a “cliff-edge” Brexit, in which trade reverts to WTO rules. Ireland’s exporters to Europe rely on Britain as a land-bridge, because shipping goods to the continent is more troublesome than carrying them by lorry. A quarter of Ireland’s imports come from Britain, partly because British chains own supermarkets in Ireland. Brexit could thus be devastating to rural Ireland while boosting the sort of FDI that benefits its bigger cities, notably Dublin. Ireland is already so geared to the global business cycle that a country which a few years ago was suffering a brutal housing bust now faces housing shortages, as FDI and migrants flood back. Yet a soft Brexit would be welcome in both parts of Ireland’s dual economy. Dublin has always been more of a complement than a rival to the City of London, so it benefits from the latter’s global status. A gentler Brexit that allows for a continuation of tariff-free flows for a time after Britain leaves the EU will give time for Irish food producers to reorient to other European markets. That won’t be easy. Ireland would need to create a more distinctive brand for its beef, notes Dan O’Brien, of the Institute of International and European Affairs, and “try flogging Irish Cheddar cheese to the French”. The reassuring lesson of Kerrygold butter is that Ireland has adapted well in the past.

Think again. A recent report from security software company McAfee showed malware targeting MacOS grew by 744 percent over the course of 2016. According to the McAfee Labs Intel Threat Report for April 2017, there were 460,000 instances of MacOS malware detected in the wild, a figure that includes a massive 245 percent spike in Mac malware spotted in the fourth quarter of 2016 alone. Read: WikiLeaks Vault 7 Dark Matter: CIA Hacking Tools For Macs, iPhones Revealed While there have been several examples of truly troubling MacOS malware floating around in recent months, including cases of ransomware that will hold important files hostage until the victim pays a fee. However, much of the Mac-based threats that make up the rapid growth in the malware market come from adware, or software that collecting user information without the user’s knowledge for the purposes of advertising to them. Adware is annoying and can direct people to even more malicious malware by injecting junk advertisements or search results into a user’s web experience. But for the most part, adware tends to be less harmful to the machine itself than other attacks. It’s not surprisingly MacOS has been the subject of more attackers given how relatively untouched the operating system is compared to Windows. MacOS owns just over six percent of the computer market, according to NetMarketShare, but accounted for less than one percent of the attacks reported by McAfee. Windows still takes the bulk of the 638 million total instances of malware reported in 2016 by the cyber security firm, which included a 24 percent increase over the course of the year—though it did experience a slight drop in the third quarter. Read: Remove Mac Ransomware: How To Tell If You're Infected By KeRanger And Recovery Steps While desktop attacks continued to grow, mobile saw the biggest increase in malware last year, with a 99 percent spike in 2016. Similar to desktop, that growth is happening primarily on a platform that does not belong to Apple. There were more than 15 million mobile malware samples identified by McAfee in 2016, but they hit almost exclusively Android devices.

By Parija Kavilanz NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Suuchi Ramesh was born and educated in India. But her New Jersey-based clothing startup has one core goal: keep all of the manufacturing in-house and in the United States, by making it faster and smarter. Powered in part by tech tools, Suuchi Inc. runs as a one-stop shop out of North Bergen handling fabric sourcing, product design, manufacturing and sales. "We are a completely made-in-America operation and proud of it," Ramesh, 36, told CNNMoney. Suuchi Inc., which launched in early 2015, specializes in limited quantity production of women's clothing, bags and a few home goods like cushion covers. The company sells not to customers but businesses: young designers launching their fashion labels, retailers who want to make private-label clothing in America and large firms supplying uniforms to the casino and hospitality industries. Ramesh currently employs 55 workers (80% of whom are women) and expects that figure to be higher than 100 by the end of 2017. She credits heavy investment from the beginning in tech and automation for her company's rapid growth. "We have to use technology to make the process and people smarter. It's where manufacturing is headed," said Ramesh, who has a computer science degree as well as an M.B.A. She first came to the U.S. in 2006 to work as an analyst with Intel. As a technologist, Ramesh employed modern tools from the start. Suuchi Inc. currently uses 100 different machines that enable 30% to 40% of the clothing production to be automated. "Our effort is to reduce manual intervention and eventually introduce robotic technology and automation," Ramesh said. For example, using digital fabric cutters instead of electric cutters creates precisely cut pieces for sewing more quickly. And by automating the process to make buttonholes, Ramesh has reduced labor time on pieces that include buttonholes by 40%. "Eventually the goal is to move toward a world of reprogrammable robots for these processes," she said. "But it's important to note reprogrammable robots and machines will make our seamstresses smarter -- not replace them." She's also testing software she created to reduce the design time process and to create a garment sample from a 3D concept within 48 hours. "This is real speed to market," said Ramesh. "We're hoping to have our partners use the software in six weeks." Speed to market is attracting clients. Even though using Suuchi Inc. costs her customers about 20% more compared to manufacturers in China or India, the math works for small-batch production: "By sourcing domestically, they get their orders faster and they save on shipping costs." In the last nine months, the manufacturer has boosted production from 3,000 to 20,000 items a month for its nearly 100 clients. Ramesh estimates the company will hit sales of $2.7 million in 2017 and $7.5 million by the end of 2018. It's a far cry from Suuchi Inc.'s beginnings. Frustrated by the difficulty she experienced finding outfits that fit her petite stature, Ramesh conceived of the startup idea: create custom garments quickly, efficiently and in a cost-effective way. She self-funded the company with $375,000 and leased a 2,000-square-foot space. Since then, Suuchi Inc. has relocated to a 10,000-square-foot facility and recently received a bank loan to fund further growth. Suuchi Inc.'s workforce is growing, too. Ramesh personally recruited most of her workers through word-of-mouth inquiries, posting flyers and advertising in local newspapers. The majority of her workforce is women because they have the skills she needs. "The cut-and-sew talent is the lifeblood of our business and they are the toughest to find," she said, adding that her employees represent 19 nationalities. Ramesh's own background continues to serve as a driving force for Suuchi Inc. "Being an immigrant forces something out of you," she said. "I don't think I would have worked as hard in India, and I don't take my opportunities in America for granted." TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

And by automating the process to make buttonholes, Ramesh has reduced labor time on pieces that include buttonholes by 40%. “Eventually the goal is to move toward a world of reprogrammable robots for these processes,” she said. “But it’s important to note reprogrammable robots and machines will make our seamstresses smarter — not replace them.” She’s also testing software she created to reduce the design time process and to create a garment sample from a 3D concept within 48 hours. “This is real speed to market,” said Ramesh. “We’re hoping to have our partners use the software in six weeks.” Speed to market is attracting clients. Even though using Suuchi Inc. costs her customers about 20% more compared to manufacturers in China or India, the math works for small-batch production: “By sourcing domestically, they get their orders faster and they save on shipping costs.” In the last nine months, the manufacturer has boosted production from 3,000 to 20,000 items a month for its nearly 100 clients. Ramesh estimates the company will hit sales of $2.7 million in 2017 and $7.5 million by the end of 2018. It’s a far cry from Suuchi Inc.’s beginnings. Frustrated by the difficulty she experienced finding outfits that fit her petite stature, Ramesh conceived of the startup idea: create custom garments quickly, efficiently and in a cost-effective way. She self-funded the company with $375,000 and leased a 2,000-square-foot space. Since then, Suuchi Inc. has relocated to a 10,000-square-foot facility and recently received a bank loan to fund further growth. Suuchi Inc.’s workforce is growing, too. Ramesh personally recruited most of her workers through word-of-mouth inquiries, posting flyers and advertising in local newspapers. The majority of her workforce is women because they have the skills she needs. “The cut-and-sew talent is the lifeblood of our business and they are the toughest to find,” she said, adding that her employees represent 19 nationalities. Ramesh’s own background continues to serve as a driving force for Suuchi Inc. “Being an immigrant forces something out of you,” she said. “I don’t think I would have worked as hard in India, and I don’t take my opportunities in America for granted.” How to keep cool while working in 100-degree heat Should I use my savings to pay off my credit card debt?

Russ Banham April 6, 2017 | CFO Magazine share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Ten years ago, American manufacturing was an oxymoron, as so much of what was sold by domestic manufacturers was produced outside the nation’s borders. This paradigm may now be altering, promising a new age for U.S. businesses that make things. How could manufacturing, a sector that has lost more than 35% of its jobs since 1979, return to its former glory? A key factor in the change is President Donald Trump, who has pledged to return domestic factory jobs lost to foreign sources of cheap labor. The White House also seeks a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, wants to allow companies to be able to immediately deduct capital spending for tax purposes, and vows to peel back an assortment of regulations that Trump says put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage—all good news for American manufacturers. At the same time, the U.S. economy is relatively strong. The stock market has posted more than $3 trillion in paper gains since the Presidential election, jobless claims are at a four-decade low, and business and consumer optimism are sunnier than Yuma, Arizona. Moreover, the much-watched ISM Manufacturing Report’s Purchasing Managers’ Index, which tracks movements in production, new orders, inventories, and employment, hit 57.7 in February, its highest level since October 2014. Last, but far from least, are the extraordinary efficiency and productivity enhancements offered to manufacturers by such remarkable technologies as robotics, 3-D printing, and smart factory equipment embedded with semiconductors and sensors. Those various developments herald what analysts optimistically call the Fourth Industrial Revolution, following the three previous ones—the introductions of the power loom in 1784 and the automobile assembly line in 1913, and the move from analog electronic and mechanical devices to digital technology in the 1990s. “We’re much closer to the ability for manufacturers to create products nearer to the source and nearly on demand,” says Mark Patel, a partner in McKinsey & Co.’s advanced industries practice. GREASING THE ENGINE Political pressure from the Trump administration is forcing companies to contemplate whether to manufacture on the home front. Several companies are bringing at least part of their production back to American shores—some in expectation that President Trump’s proposed tax and regulatory policies get implemented. Intel, for instance, announced a $7 billion investment in a new factory in Arizona that will create 3,000 jobs. GM is ponying up $1 billion to increase vehicle production domestically, and also plans to shift production elements from Mexico to Michigan, generating about 2,000 jobs. Competitor Fiat will invest $1 billion in plants in Michigan and Ohio, producing 2,000 jobs. Foreign manufacturers are also planting stakes in the U.S. Foxconn, the large Taiwan-based contract manufacturing concern, plans to build a $7 billion plant making television displays on American shores. And German chemical company Bayer AG has promised the president that, if it gets the green light to merge with Monsanto, it will invest $8 billion in R&D domestically, maintain Monsanto’s 9,000-strong U.S. workforce, and create 3,000 new jobs. Not every manufacturer is eager to relinquish overseas production, however. Milwaukee-based Rexnord recently finalized plans to close a ball bearings factory in Indianapolis and move the operation to Mexico, at a loss of some 350 U.S. jobs. Rexnord reportedly will pay Mexican machinists $3 per hour compared to the $25-per-hour rate paid to U.S. machinists. But the resurgence of U.S. manufacturing is not just about the location of plants. For manufacturing CFOs entrusted with profitably allocating their organization’s capital, there may be better areas in which to spend money, such as mergers and acquisitions, new equipment, smart technologies, worker training, and research and development. Leveraging automated production processes like 3-D additive and subtractive manufacturing allows for rapid prototyping. And smart factory equipment embedded with sensors that report on how machines are performing—their stresses and failures—maximizes maintenance and minimizes downtime. Obviously, such capital allocation decisions are not for the faint of heart. Feasting on today’s state-of-the-art plants, equipment, and software may end up looking foolhardy if the global economy stagnates. “Many of the decisions to be made right now in manufacturing are financial in nature, making the role of the CFO more critical than ever,” says Bob McCutcheon, PwC’s industrial products leader. “This will require finance to have a deep understanding of all the moving parts.” To learn where some U.S. manufacturers are placing their bets, we interviewed the CFOs of Armstrong Flooring, Polaris Industries, and Marvin Windows and Doors. Each CFO laid out a different array of capital priorities, but they also spoke of a common goal: less focus on cost cutting, more attention to customers’ needs. And that manufacturing renaissance? It may look different than what the president and other politicians envision. MEASURE TWICE, CUT ONCE Jim Macaulay, CFO of Marvin Windows and Doors, agrees that domestic manufacturing is at the threshold of a revival. “Certainly U.S. manufacturing is making a recovery, thanks to leaner manufacturing techniques and the wide deployment of productivity-enhancing technologies,” he says. Among the investments that Marvin has made are Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines that are directed by computers to produce components on demand, reducing setup and inventory costs. For example, at a plant in Oregon that manufactures different-sized wood pieces, the company recently installed new laser visualization CNC machines that give operators a good look at a board before cutting it, to ensure “maximum yield”—the largest piece of wood possible from a single block of lumber. The new CNC machines leverage X-ray technology to “see” inside the wood before it is cut, to visualize the knot and grain structure and the presence of defects. Previously, Marvin relied on the eyes of shop foremen to identify anomalies. “The computer inside the machine instantly analyzes the visual image to decide the best places to cut, increasing yield while reducing human intervention,” Macaulay says. Marvin also has invested in embedding semiconductors and sensors inside factory equipment to calculate temperature, vibration, moisture, and other conditions. If a piece of equipment exceeds a particular temperature, the machine signals a possible problem for corrective actions. Information from the various sensing technologies flows to a central location where the measurements are displayed and monitored. “We’re better able to anticipate [equipment] failures and preventively assign repairs at off-times to maintain production efficiencies,” Macaulay says. Since the machines are connected to each other in the Internet of Things, a problem often can be self-corrected—one machine automatically speeding up to allow another to slow down and cool off, obviating the possibility of one machine’s failure bringing all production to a halt, he adds. How does the CFO approach the many internal requests for funding that clutter his desk? “The question I always ask is, Will this project enhance the customer’s experience?” says Macaulay. “Innovation is crucial, as long as it provides for a better customer experience. That’s equally as important as a project’s cost-reduction opportunities.” ENJOYING THE RIDE Like many cost-conscious domestic manufacturers, Polaris Industries, maker of snowmobiles, Indian Motorcycles, and all-terrain vehicles, has a significant volume of its off-road vehicle production in Mexico. Aside from the cheaper cost of labor, the company maintains that vehicles made south of the border also are closer to those states that make up a sizable portion of the market for the company’s products. But Polaris is also investing heavily in U.S. manufacturing. Last year the company christened a 600,000-square-foot, state-of-the art manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama, where it builds its Ranger utility vehicle and the Slingshot three-wheel motorcycle. Once the factory is operating at capacity, the company expects to have 2,000 workers humming away. The multifunctional plant comprises vehicle assembly, chassis and body painting, welding, fabrication, and injection molding. “Ten years ago, we tended to look for low-cost labor solutions, which the factory in Huntsville runs counter to,” says Mike Speetzen, Polaris’s executive vice president and CFO. “But we’ve more than made up the difference with lean manufacturing, highly skilled labor, and enhanced automation across the production lines.” The new plant features state-of-the-art robotics that use precise calibrations to improve engineering tolerances and manufacturing efficiency. “The mindset here has changed from cost reductions to investing money for a payoff down the road,” Speetzen says. In addition to spending $142 million on the Huntsville plant, Speetzen dug into the corporate wallet last year to acquire Transamerican Auto Parts, a manufacturer of Jeep and truck accessories with 170-plus retail stores, for $665 million. Speetzen also plans to increase the company’s R&D investments this year by 15%: “Innovation is critical to our business. Seventy to eighty percent of our revenue has come from products introduced in the last three years,” he says. Polaris’s capital allocation plans have also changed. “It used to be all about cost-cutting, but now we realize that you have to spend money to save money,” he says. “The easy way out is to cut jobs or take costs out. We now look down the road at whether or not a particular [expenditure] will further our market position or the experiences of the riders of our vehicles,” Speetzen says. DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH Fast-changing consumer preferences have compelled Armstrong Flooring, a maker of wood, vinyl, engineered stone, linoleum, and other flooring products, to continually invest in innovation. One example is the company’s decision to expand its production capacity for making newer types of flooring like its LVT (luxury vinyl tile) line, a durable floor material composed of polymers, plasticizer, limestone, and cultured diamonds. The one-of-a-kind flooring can realistically simulate hardwood, ceramic tile, slate, or natural stone. “The high-end segment of the flooring market is the highest growth market,” says Jay Thompson, Armstrong Flooring’s senior vice president and CFO. “It’s such a fast growing category that it’s cannibalizing a lot of traditional flooring products like carpets and wood.” To manufacture the new product, a second production line was built on an industrial brownfield site at Armstrong’s Lancaster, Pa.–based plant. “We’re very scrupulous [about] where we invest our capital,” says Thompson. “But the current climate for manufacturing, given the president’s assurances of tax and regulatory relief, is guiding us to lean forward to leverage more of our capital in profitable projects, of which the LVT plant is one.” Spun off as an independent public company last year from Armstrong World Industries, Armstrong Flooring is looking to turn around several years of sluggish growth. Capital spending of $37.6 million last year is pegged to increase to about $50 million this year, with roughly $20 million earmarked for productivity and innovation projects. “We’re investing in R&D, new product development, and marketing concepts to quickly move new products to market,” says Thompson. “We also have 17 plants worldwide, 14 of them in the U.S., needing a fair amount of repair and maintenance spending to remain viable. On top of that, we’re looking to drive greater efficiency, investing in automation to reduce waste and [increase] throughput.” Armstrong Flooring is another company that has returned to manufacturing in the U.S. from foreign locales. In 2015, the company closed its scraped engineered hardwood flooring facility in Kunshan, China, onshoring the manufacture in Somerset, Kentucky. The decision was driven by the increasing cost of freight and labor in China and the growing demand for the flooring type domestically. “It just makes sense to move production closer to where we actually sell a product,” Thompson says. Onshoring also eliminates several months in product lead time and improves Armstrong’s response to those fast-changing consumer preferences. “Manufacturing domestically made this a smart move for the business, helping us to restore our wood business to an acceptable return on capital,” Thompson says. Like other manufacturers, innovation is the fuel igniting Armstrong’s capital allocation decisions. “We broadly lay out what we think our capital needs are going to be across three areas—the need to maintain current equipment, to drive efficiency in the business, and to accelerate new product development to be first to market with a new flooring,” says Thompson. “That gives us a target level of spending in the strategic plan. We then build this out project by project.” THE OBSTACLE The three CFOs interviewed all expressed a degree of optimism that has been absent in manufacturing, recalling the excitement surrounding lean manufacturing, Six Sigma, and just-in-time production concepts that consumed manufacturing attention at the end of the last century. Shortly thereafter, though, the focus switched to conserving capital through labor cost arbitrage. Will this resurgence prove longer lasting? The confluence of time-saving, efficiency-gaining, and information-rich technologies has definitely put the manufacturing sector back on track, leading to greater productivity and higher profit margins. But the investment choices by manufacturing companies are not necessarily going to boost the total number of jobs for minimally skilled U.S. workers. Indeed, the skilled worker that can operate highly automated equipment on the shop floor is the one that will be in demand. And those workers have proven tough to find in the U.S. in the last few years. Manufacturers, perhaps helped by the government, will have to find a way to solve that problem. And policymakers will have to refrain from protectionist measures that could make U.S.–made products less appealing in international markets. If both of those conditions are satisfied, the future looks pretty darn good for Made in America. Russ Banham is the author of 24 books and a longtime contributor to CFO.

Ogg April 6, 2017 11:00 am EDT Print Email Tweet The bull market is now more than eight years old. Many companies did not participate in the bull market at all, and some companies only jumped in to run with the bulls in the past year or so. One such late-bloomer as a turnaround and full of promise was Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). Its stock has risen close to 1,000% from the trough to the most recent peak. Now one major firm on Wall Street is saying enough is enough. While gains of this magnitude should raise most investors’ eyes, the reality is that analysts have tried to keep AMD shares shackled down at much lower prices. It simply didn’t work. To prove the point, it should be noted that the Thomson Reuters consensus analyst price target is still well under the prevailing price of AMD shares. In Wednesday’s top analyst upgrades and downgrades, Goldman Sachs led the charge by initiating AMD with a Sell rating. It also issued an $11 price target. That was far under the $14.17 closing price of the shares on Wednesday. It was also well under the $12.25 consensus analyst price target. While this is in part a valuation call, there is also a threat from the likes of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC). Where this gets interesting is that when AMD sold 45 million shares for a top holder (Mubadala Development Company PJSC), it was via Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari made the call here. The view is that AMD’s stock gains already reflect the improvements that may happen in its business and the high expectations for 2018. Also cited was an execution risk in issuing products and managing their costs. Despite a sharp improvement in AMD’s competitive and financial position, Hari noted that AMD’s enterprise value to sales was more than 200% over a five-year median. On the Intel and NVIDIA front, Hari believes that the companies can both fight back if AMD gains ground via price concessions. Even if those price risks do not materialize, Hari feels that AMD’s costs will rise as it rejuvinates its distribution channel. Another warning from Goldman Sachs in this Sell rating is that AMD’s stock should underperform the market after its May analyst day presentation is behind it. While a Sell rating seems harsh, Goldman Sachs is actually above consensus estimates, with revenue projections of $4.87 billion (versus $4.73 billion). Its EBITDA forecast of $235 million is just $1 million short of consensus. The firm’s earnings per share (EPS) forecast of $0.03 is under the consensus estimate $0.08 per share. The firm’s 2018 estimates are under consensus: $5.1 billion in revenue, versus $5.2 billion $345.8 million in EBITDA, versus $423 million $0.17 EPS, versus $0.28 Since AMD shares began rising rapidly in 2016, this has been a battleground stock. It is usually among the 10 most heavily shorted stocks on Wall Street. And analysts continue to debate whether AMD has more upside or downside. The Goldman Sachs call to sell AMD shares took 8% out of the stock, down to a price of $13.00, on Thursday morning. That compares with a 52-week trading range of $2.60 to $15.55, and AMD’s market cap is still $12.2 billion. While the Goldman Sachs call might have pitted Intel and NVIDIA against AMD here, the calls did not exactly help either rival. Intel shares were last seen down 0.2% at $36.14, in a 52-week range of $29.50 to $38.45. Intel’s consensus analyst target price is $40.03, and its market cap is $170 billion. NVIDIA shares, which have seen multiple analyst downgrades of late after a massive run of its own in 2016, was down 0.6% at $99.40. Its 52-week range is $34.40 to $120.92, and the consensus target price is $113.72. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   To show an open book on how AMD has been covered, here are some other recent analyst calls: Macquarie started AMD as Neutral at on March 31, 2017. This was part of a broader semiconductor sector initiation, and most others were given the same Neutral ratings. Jefferies reiterated AMD as Buy with a $16 price target on March 24, 2016, (after being raised from $13 back on March 20, 2017). The firm noted that its checks gave it even higher conviction in its above-consensus estimates. AMD was reiterated as Buy at Canaccord Genuity on March 9, 2017, and its target was raised to $17 from $14. As of March 3, 2017, the Merrill Lynch price target for AMD was $16.50, and the Wall Street consensus target was $11.79. AMD was assumed with a Neutral rating and $13 fair value estimate by MKM Partners on February 21, 2017, in a transfer of analyst coverage. MKM’s take was that there was a lot to like with AMD’s story, but the current valuation placed the firm on the sidelines. By Jon C.

What is Known About World's Most Powerful Intel Alliance © AFP 2017/ Roland Weihrauch / dpa World 17:55 06.04.2017(updated 20:49 06.04.2017) Get short URL 41315121 Last week, American journalist and author Mike Cernovich revealed that former United States National Security Adviser Susan Rice was behind the unmasking of members of the Donald Trump campaign prior to the election. © AFP 2017/ Jim WATSON Trump Says He Thinks Susan Rice May Have Acted IllegallyThe revelation fuels the scandal regarding the alleged wiretapping of Trump’s team during the presidential campaign. On March 4, President Trump took to Twitter to accuse his predecessor Barack Obama of having his Trump Tower headquarters "wires tapped" prior to the 2016 presidential election. The president went on to compare the alleged surveillance to McCarthyism and the Watergate scandal. The claims have been rejected by Obama's representatives. Commenting on the allegations, Rice said that information obtained by intelligence was not used "for political purposes." "The allegation is that somehow, Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes. That’s absolutely false. Let me explain how this works. I was the national security adviser. My job is to protect the American people and the security of our country. That’s the same as the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the CIA director," she told MSNBC. Furthermore, in March, Andrew Napolitano, a former judge of the New Jersey Superior Court and legal analyst, claimed that British intelligence spied on Trump at the request of the Obama administration. © AP Photo/ J. Scott Applewhite US House Intel Committee Chair Got Data on Trump Wiretapping From Whistleblower - RyanInstead of using US intelligence services, Napolitano said, Obama used Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) to ensure there were "no American fingerprints on this." Later, the GCHQ, a British intelligence organization providing signal intelligence and information assurance to the British government, called the allegations absurd. Napolitano was pulled from the air on Fox News and the White House press office apologized to London. Nevertheless, in relation to the scandal, Western media outlets have avidly discussed activities under the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance. American and British intelligence communities agreed to cooperate in 1940. In 1946, their agreement was formalized as the UK-US Agreement (UKUSA). Later, the deal was joined by Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Some other countries, including Norway, Denmark and Western Germany, have also been involved in the alliance’s activities, but with a third party status. © AP Photo/ Charles Dharapak Top NSA Official: US Surveillance Program Should Have Been Disclosed to PublicAfter the end of World War II, the alliance focused on spying on the Soviet Union, China and the members of the Warsaw Pact. The organization was directly related to the creation of the ECHELON surveillance network. Under the Five Eyes framework intelligence data was shared during the war in Vietnam, the Falklands War, the Gulf War and the military operation in Libya. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the organization focused on global surveillance and countering global terrorism. In 2013, documents leaked by former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden revealed the existence of numerous surveillance programs operated by the Five Eyes, including PRISM, XKeyscore, Tempora, MUSCULAR and STATEROOM. As the war on global terrorism gained momentum, the members of the alliance intensified cooperation, including spying on one another’s ordinary citizens. Since 2007, the NSA has been authorized to gather and store surveillance information about British nationals. In 2005, the NSA considered the possibility of collecting information on citizens of all the five members of the alliance, without notifying their allies. In 2013, Snowden leaked a series of documents shedding light on payments received by the GCHQ from the NSA. The former NSA contractor also described the Five Eyes as a "supra-national intelligence organization that doesn’t answer to the laws of its own countries." In 2013, The Guardian published an article entitled "GCHQ: inside the top secret world of Britain's biggest spy agency" which provided details about the hierarchy in the relations between the American and the British agencies. The article also gave insights into the challenges and concerns faced by the GCHQ, including silent warfare, smartphones and sharing intelligence. © AP Photo/ Patrick Semansky Tracking Everyone: Does US Vast Surveillance State Even Extend to President Trump?As a result of Snowden’s revelation, the alliance has become the subject to wide criticism by activists and human rights organizations around the world. Five Eyes members have been repeatedly accused of "[subcontracting] their dirty work" to each other and spying on ordinary citizens. In 2014, the European Parliament issued a report saying that the intelligence services of New Zealand and Australia cooperated with the NSA within the Five Eyes framework and shared the personal data of EU citizens. Despite the fact that British intelligence has denied its involvement in the wiretapping of Trump and his team, the situation provides food for thought.   Never miss a story again — sign up to our Telegram channel and we'll keep you up to speed! ...

By Nick Heath | April 6, 2017, 6:51 AM PST Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus This new look Start menu allows users to group tiles into folders, providing a new way to organize and personalize the menu. Image: Nick Heath / TechRepublic In a few days, the second major upgrade to Windows 10 will start rolling out to PCs worldwide. The Creators Update tinkers with the look, feel and performance of the OS, introduces new features that improve security, privacy and how updates take place, tweaks the virtual assistant Cortana and the Edge browser, and adds a new Paint app for creating 3D content. That said, while there are plenty of changes, many feel more evolutionary than revolutionary. Here's what's changed in the newest version of Windows, beginning with the Start menu. This single-page article is also available as a gallery. Start menu - Folders The Start menu allows users to group tiles into folders, providing a new way to organize apps. Want more about Windows? Sign up for TechRepublic's Microsoft Weekly newsletter and get Windows and Office tutorials, plus our experts' analyses of Microsofts enterprise products. Read more Clicking on these new Start menu folders reveals a drop-down panel that shows the tiles inside. To create a tile folder, users drag and drop tiles on top of each other. Hide the Apps list If you're not a fan of the Apps List, it can now be hidden behind an icon in the side rail. To do so, toggle a switch in the Personalization->Start section of the Settings app. Edge browser - Tab preview The Edge browser can now display a thumbnail image of the website below each tab. The preview bar drops down when the user clicks the chevron icon next to the tabs. Set tabs aside As well as bookmarking individual tabs in the Edge browser, users can also set aside all the tabs they have open with a click of a button, so they can be restored from a side menu at a later time. These tabs can also be shared with other apps via the 'Share tabs' option in the side menu. Flash blocking By default, Microsoft Edge will block Flash content running on untrusted websites, with users now having to click to run Flash from these sources. Users will also be able to choose to have Flash always play on specific sites. The move is aimed at improving security, stability and performance and echoes moves made by other major browser makers. Import from other browsers Not many people may be moving to Microsoft's Edge browser, but those who do will be able to choose "Import from another browser" button in Edge's Settings menu. The feature will bring across favorites, browsing history, saved passwords, and other data, although there are reports that password imports don't always seem to work. Edge can also now play Netflix videos at 4K, provided you've got a processor based on Intel's latest Kaby Lake architecture. The browser will also work as an e-reader, able to read books from the Windows Store's new Books section. Microsoft Wallet To simplify online shopping, Microsoft Edge includes support for the new Payment Request API, which will allow shopping sites to retrieve a user's payment and shipping information from Microsoft Wallet, providing a user has entered these details into their Microsoft account. Better Web Notes Microsoft Edge now has more options for users who want to draw on or to annotate webpages, with the browser's Web Notes feature now including the full set of Windows Ink colors, as well as the new slider. Privacy overhaul The Creators Update introduces a new privacy settings menu, designed to make it easier for users to choose which information they are comfortable being sent back to Microsoft. Upon upgrading to the Creators Update, this menu is presented to users. The menu makes it easier to toggle off data collection in a range of areas, for example, location data when using maps, voice recordings when using the Cortana virtual assistant or diagnostic information related to what users type and write, and the apps they use. The new privacy controls will be introduced alongside an option for Windows 10 Home and Pro users to dial back data collection further than is possible today, with Microsoft pledging that Windows 10's 'Basic' telemetry setting will ensure the OS "only collects data vital to the operation of Windows". Alongside these changes, Microsoft also detailed what data it collects and launched a web-based privacy dashboard, which lets Microsoft account holders check the data Microsoft has collected about their use of its various services, covering information related to location, search, browsing and its virtual assistant Cortana. Cortana - Setup assistant In an effort to simplify the process of getting a Windows 10 PC up and running, users can now mostly set up their machine by verbally answering yes or no questions, which are asked by the virtual assistant Cortana. Swapping between Windows 10 machines and picking up where you left off is also easier. For example, when swapping between a laptop and a desktop, Cortana will display quick links in the Action Center to Microsoft Edge websites and SharePoint, or other cloud-based, documents that you used most recently. More options for reminders Cortana can now be used to set recurring reminders for appointments that take place every month or year. The virtual assistant can also automatically set reminders for engagements mentioned in your email, if you opt in to allow it to scan your Office 365 or Outlook email. Providing you've got a subscription to Groove Music, Cortana will also play tracks from the service on request. Clearer notifications The look of the Action Center has been tweaked to make notifications easier to read. Notifications from apps and services can now be subdivided into groups under separate headers, to help users distinguish between messages related to different topics, for instance between Cortana notifications related to emails and those mentioning upcoming flight times. Apps can now also display a progress bar in the notifications panel, showing information such as download completion. Smaller updates The average download size of upgrades has been reduced, typically by about one third, due to the OS only downloading the new files each install needs. Active Hours, the period during which Windows won't automatically restart to install updates, has also been expanded to an 18-hour interval. For Windows 10 Education, Enterprise and Pro users, monthly quality updates, for example cumulative security fixes, can now be delayed for up to 30 days after their release to a servicing branch, while feature updates, such as the Anniversary or Creators Update, can be put off by up to 365 days. Home users have fewer options for deferring updates, but are able to hit Snooze to delay the installation. They will also be able to pick a time when an update should be installed. Windows Defender Security Center The new Windows Defender Security Center provides an overview of the "health" of your PC, with more notifications about its state, which may or may not be welcome. The console can be used to set restrictions on how the computer is used, as well as providing a "fresh start" button that performs a clean installation of Windows. There are various security and management features aimed at business, including tweaks to Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), a better Windows Analytics Dashboard for monitoring and managing Windows PCs, and easier Window 7 to Windows 10 upgrades. Metered Ethernet Those worried that Windows 10's frequent updates are consuming too much data can now restrict downloads over a wired connection. To do so, select the metered connection option for PCs connected via Ethernet, via the Network & Internet page in the Settings app. Paint 3D As reflected by its name, a key part of the Creator's Update is focused on making it easier to produce art. To that end, the update adds Paint 3D, another version of Microsoft Paint, with a strong emphasis on creating 3D scenes and objects. Users are able to rotate and zoom in and out of these objects, place them at different depths within a scene and alter their color, transparency and size. 3D/2D mash-ups Paint 3D can stick 2D images onto 3D models and 3D models can also be combined to make a larger 3D scene. Many different pre-built 3D shapes and models are available. Community content Paint 3D also offers access to Remix 3D, an online store of user-created 3D models, which can be downloaded, edited and 3D printed. The store hosts 3D models created in Paint 3D and SketchUp, and will also include creations from Minecraft, with users able to upload directly from Paint 3D. Simpler device management The new Device Settings page groups together Bluetooth and connected devices page to provide a single menu for managing devices and peripherals. Lock a PC to the Windows Store Admins can now also lock down a Windows PC, so users can only install apps from the Windows Store. Dynamic Lock Another new security feature is Dynamic Lock. This addition automatically locks a Windows 10 PC when the user leaves the machine for more than 30 seconds, which the OS determines by detecting the presence of a Bluetooth-paired phone. However, this feature is already attracting criticism for locking machines when the phone drops its Bluetooth connection. Night Light Using a computer late at night can supposedly interfere with the body's sleep cycle, due to the blue light emitted by the display. To counter this, Windows now allows users to lower the amount of blue light emitted from the PC using the Night Light feature. Built into the Settings app, the feature lets users adjust blue light intensity and schedule when the level should be reduced, although there are complaints that the transition happens too rapidly. Powershell The PowerShell command-line interface, a tool for interacting with and automating Windows, is now accessible from File Explorer. Microsoft has also broadened the range of commands and tools supported by its Windows Subsystem for Linux, as well as increasing interoperability between the Bash and Windows environments. Windows themes There are now more options for users who want to add a theme to their Windows 10 desktop. A large number of themes will be available to download from the Windows Store, and themes will be able to be managed via the Personalization section of the Settings menu. Beam streaming For Home users there are various gaming-targeted features, including Beam game streaming and Game Mode, which optimizes the OS to improve Game performance, although the benefits at present seem marginal at best.

Investors should avoid Advanced Micro Devices shares because the company will suffer from competition from Nvidia and Intel this year, according to Goldman Sachs, which initiated coverage on the chipmaker with a sell rating. AMD shares are up 25 percent this year and 406 percent in the past 12 months through Wednesday on anticipation of its new gaming graphics and processor chips. While the company's "execution (i.e. new product launches, cost management and BS [balance sheet] deleveraging) has improved under CEO Lisa Su, we believe current risk-return is unfavorable," analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a note to clients Thursday entitled "Priced for perfection." "If AMD were to gain meaningful traction with its new products (e.g. Ryzen CPU, Naples CPU, Vega GPU) in 2017, we believe Intel and Nvidia would be likely to fight back in late-2017 and/or 2018 in the form of pricing concessions," he added.

This stock's a buy Rex Moore, for The Motley Fool 9:00 a.m. ET April 6, 2017 Why not invest in a company that could have a drastically larger role in this new tech, and yet is only 1/12th the size of Apple? (Photo: The Motley Fool) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE There’s something crucial you need to know about Apple’s stock, especially if you already own it, know someone who does, or have even thought about buying it: 1. Apple is secretly working on its next big product… something so extraordinary — so CRAZY -- that the speculation surrounding it has investors drooling with anticipation. 2. One stock that our analysts believe is poised to benefit the most from Apple's next game-changer IS NOT Apple. This exciting new technology should make any investor’s ears perk up. Heck, Apple even filed a patent related to it. The profit potential is enormous: Tech giants like Google and Intel are scrambling to claim their piece of the action... the University of Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, and Stanford have dedicated millions to researching the technology… and Morgan Stanley says the market could be worth $2.6 trillion in the next 13 years. But I have never seen so many people get so excited about a single apple while completely missing the entire tree. That’s because Apple’s stake in this coming tech tidal wave is expected to be relatively small, no matter how successful they are. Instead… Why not invest in a company that could have a drastically larger role in this new tech, and yet is only 1/12th the size of Apple? Think about how much more room it has to grow! <!--iframe--> That’s because this modest company is sitting on a gold mine of patents and intellectual property that’s absolutely critical in this new field. Nearly every other company in this new industry will have to pay it to use its technology. You can almost hear the cash register ring each time a sale is made… no matter who makes it! So while Apple is exciting to us as consumers, it’s this other tech-savvy company that should be exciting to us as investors looking for our next big success. That's why I hope you take a few minutes to unlock the full research a team of highly trained stock analysts from The Motley Fool put together on this developing story and discover why we could be near a turning point.

Here, the Audi SQ5 with Delphi technology on the streets of Singapore. (Photo: Sid Quah for Delphi) 5 CONNECTTWEET 58 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Delphi said today it has invested two companies and struck a partnership with a third that will help it develop systems for new cars that can process and transmit data faster — capabilities that are becoming increasingly important as automakers develop self-driving cars. Delphi, a tier-one supplier to most of the world's largest automakers, has already emerged as a leader in the development of systems and technology some automakers need in the autonomous cars of the future. The Troy-based supplier said today it has purchased minority stakes in Valens, a provider of semiconductor products that can quickly transmit large volumes of data, and in Otonomo, a company that has developed a platform that tracks and aggregates the data generated from cars. Delphi declined to disclose the value of the investments or percentage of the stake it purchased in Valens or Otonomo. Valens said it secured an additional $60 million in capital from five investors. The funding was led by Israel Growth Partners but Delphi is the lead strategic investor. Valens other new investors include: Samsung Catalyst Fund, Goldman Sachs and MediaTek. “We have made some significant strides in the automotive market in the past year, and the support of IGP, who has a solid track record of investing in technology companies in growing markets, and of the unique investors’ syndicate participating in this round is a testament to this success and to our drive to continue doing so going forward,” ,” Dror Jerushalmi, Valens’ co-founder and CEO said in a statement.

The deals announced by Delphi further underscore how both traditional automotive suppliers and automakers are moving rapidly to reach partnerships with both large and small technology companies in the race to establish leadership positions in the rapidly developing autonomous car arena. Earlier this week, for example, German auto supplier Bosch and Mercedes-Benz said they would work together to introduce a driverless car by the start of the next decade.  Ford, which has also vowed to begin selling a fully autonomous car by 2021, said in February it would invest $1 billion in Argo AI, a small start-up company founded by former Google engineers that specializes in artificial intelligence. Related: Daimler's Mercedes, Bosch to deliver self-driving car by 2021 Ford bets $1 billion on self-driving car start-up Delphi Chief Technical Officer Glen De Vos  said Wednesday that one of the biggest emerging challenges for automakers developing connected cars is the ability to move and transmit the data required for autonomous cars to operate. "Delphi’s vision is to enable the brain and nerve center of the vehicle through our leadership in computing and complete electrical architecture solutions," De Vos said. "We have selected world leaders in three areas: high-speed data transmission, connectivity and data management." Mike Ramsey, a research director at Gartner Group, gives Delphi credit for investing in companies that will help automakers solve some of the toughest issues facing the self-driving vehicles. "All three of these companies have a role that helps to tame the tyranny of data," Ramsey said. "What I like about what Delphi is doing is, more than any other company I have seen, they are putting together the right pieces." Here is a closer look at  each company in which Delphi will invest: Valens Founded in 2006, Valens specializes in technology that helps companies move high volumes of data. Valens makes chip-to-chip technology that the company says allows for connectivity speeds six times faster than today’s industry standard. "And so for us, as we are moving the data around the vehicle … it allows us to do it not just at a higher rate, but at a lower cost," De Vos said. Otonomo Otonomo was founded in 2015 "with a goal to disrupt the connected and autonomous car industry," the company says on its website. Former GM vice chairman Steve Girsky is among four members of its advisory board. De Vos said Otonomo's technology aggregates data generated as cars are driven and sends it to automakers who can then use that data to sell services to the owner of the car. De Vos said the services could be from emergency assistance services to location-based advertising. Owners with privacy concerns or those who simply are not interested in those services should not worry, De Vos said, because they will be able to opt out, or turn off those services. "You own your data," he said. Rosenberger Founded in 1958, Rosenberger specializes in high-voltage fiber optic technology and radio frequency connection systems. Delphi and Rosenberger have agreed to form a partnership to develop high-performance, cost-effective hardware to transmit data. Contact Brent Snavely: 313-222-6512 or bsnavely@freepress.com.

We review and chart the best portable hard drives and SSDs in the UK in 2017. We review and chart the best portable hard drives and SSDs you can buy in the UK in 2017 By Andrew Harrison & Christopher Minasians | 06 Apr 17 Solid-state storage may be sexy, but if you’re looking for huge capacity and tiny prices, then the classic hard disk remains unbeaten. Available capacities of portable drives with laptop-style disks inside now extends up to a whopping 4000GB, more commonly referred to as 4 terabytes (TB). Most portable USB drives are powered by the connected computer, so you can use them on the move without the need to plug into the mains or use batteries. Also see: Best Tech Deals Click here to skip to our top portable drive recommendations. Best portable hard drives: Capacity Even in the smallest portable drives you’ll likely find are 128GB in size, which is enough to space thousands of CD albums in lossless FLAC format, or even more in lower quality MP3 or AAC formats. Off-loading your music collection alone from a computer to a portable drive can be a godsend in freeing valuable space if your laptop has limited storage. Another popular application of portable storage is for keeping critical backups of your data held on a PC or laptop. You may be able to keep a perfect clone of your entire computer’s internal drive, on standby and ready in the event that the computer is lost or its drive should malfunction. Alternatively, you may choose just to back up the most important files and documents from your user libraries, such as text documents, photos, films, music and stored email. Some portable drives include software that can help automate this process, keeping your selected directories in sync whenever you plug in the drive or by a daily schedule. Best portable hard drives: Performance Now that USB 2.0 has been banished from all self-respecting storage, we find USB 3 as the standard for connection, letting these portable drives perform as quickly as the little disks inside will allow. This means that when transferring your music or video collection to or from your PC, you can expect around 100MB/s read speed (and typically the same for writing, since unlike flash storage technology the read and write speeds tend to be more symmetrical). Compare this with the older drives using USB 2.0, which would limit speeds to around 35MB/s, or only one-third the speed. So in real terms, your 100GB of media files would take close to an hour to transfer with USB 2.0, or under 20 minutes using USB 3.0. If you’re likely to be storing or backing up many small files, be aware that overall performance will plummet since hard disks tend to choke on smaller files. So while large files may zip across at 100MB/s, the smallest will likely travel at less than 1MB/s, or one hundredth that speed. USB 3 is confusing, as USB 3.0 was retrospectively renamed to USB 3.1 Gen 1. There’s also a new version, USB 3.1 Gen 2. This doubles the potential throughput from Gen 1’s 5Gb/s to 10Gb/s. In megabytes per second, these equate to 625 and 1250 respectively. Pretty fast, then. In reality, the fastest SSDs top out at around 550MB/s and this speed is highly dependent on the device you’re connecting it to. Best portable hard drives: Protection A rugged exterior will be handy if you want the freedom of being able to throw around the unplugged drive with less worry that it will damage the unit; and more importantly lose your data. Look out for shock-resistance ratings such as the US military MIL-STD-810F 516.5 (Transit Drop Test). This means that it should withstand being dropped 26 times onto a hard floor, once on to each face, edge and corner, from a height of 1.22m. The drive does not need to be switched on to pass - we don’t believe any hard disk would survive that test – and nor does it require independent verification before a manufacturer can promote its product as ‘milspec shock-resistant’. But the rating is an indication that the manufacturer has probably taken more care in nurturing the delicate disk inside. Flash storage - more commonly known as SSDs - can survive more brutal treatment, and some portable drives are even water resistant. If you were to accidentally drop a portable SSD drive in water, then as long as the port covers are firmly closed, it will work fine to use it after it has been fully dried. Best portable hard drives: Reliability It’s tough to say definitively which manufacturer makes the most reliable hard drives. While there’s a big difference between the technology used in traditional hard drives and SSDs, both have a limited lifespan, and this is why warranties are relatively short – typically two or three years. What’s important is that you have a well-thought-out backup process and you don’t rely on any single drive to store precious files. Ideally you should have three copies: one on a PC or phone / tablet, one on a backup drive (such as one of these portable drives) and one in the cloud. This guards against drive failure, losing or breaking your phone, plus theft and fire. Best portable hard drives: Extras Besides the drive itself, you can expect to find more extras included with the product. A slip-on case or even just a simple cloth pouch can be valuable, letting you store the drive in the bottom of a laptop or handbag without it collecting scratches and dents - or in the case of metal-cased storage drives, of leaving scratches and dents on everything around it. At least one USB cable will be included, and you may find additional Y-cables that allow you to piggyback more power from a neighbouring USB port. This is mandatory for some portable hard drives, which demand more power than a single USB port can provide, for example. Software is often bundled, and this can add value: we’ll tell you if it’s any good in our reviews. Best portable hard drives: Value For many users, a portable storage drive may be an unavoidable commodity, and price will be the deciding factor. We give a value rating based on how much each gigabyte of storage is costing you for each drive. Particularly with a 3TB drive, you can expect to find storage for under 4p per gigabyte now. Best portable hard drives: Security The larger the drive, the more you can store - and the more you stand to lose in the event of losing the drive or having it stolen. This is where it pays to lock down that drive. There are two ways to ensure the data is unreadable by other users. You can scramble the contents through hardware encryption. Or you can use a software application to encrypt either parts or all of the drive. The hardware-encryption option is good for defeating keyloggers and other malware already installed on your PC, and this solution also tends to be platform agnostic, where it works with Windows, Linux or Mac computers. The disadvantage is that the security is hard-coded into the drive, so that in the event of a vulnerability being discovered there’s little chance of upgrading or fixing it. Software encryption can be more flexible, but ensure that it works on your chosen computer platform. Ideally the software should be open-source to reduce the chance of it being compromised by deliberate back doors introduced by the developer. Best portable storage drives: How we test Our benchmarks were run on our test rig which comprises: Operating system: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Processor: Intel Core i7 4770k @ 3.5Ghz RAM memory: 16GB 1600Mhz Motherboard: Intel Desktop Board DZ87KLT75K Haswell Z87 Graphics card: AMD Radeon R9 390 When conducting our tests, we plugged in our portable storage drives into one of our motherboard’s rear USB 3 ports. Like the vast majority of PCs and laptops, it does not support USB 3.1 Gen 2. However, Gen 1 ports should (theoretically) be able to handle up to 625MB/s and none of the drives on test is rated beyond 550MB/s. We used CrystalDiskMark 64-bit to test each drive’s speed. We selected 1GB test files and three test passes in order to determine both sequential and 4KB performance. Where a drive could be connected to a phone or tablet, we did so an installed any relevant Android or iOS apps. Best portable hard drives 2017 UK 1.

Seagate Backup Plus Ultra Slim 2TB Rating: Reviewed on: 21 September 16 RRP: £89.99, US$89.99 The Seagate Backup Plus Ultra Slim is not a top performer, but with its 2TB storage and super slim design, the Seagate portable drive is fantastic for backing up documents.

Seagate Backup Plus Slim 2TB Rating: Reviewed on: 19 August 15 RRP: £74 The Seagate Backup Plus Slim is a well-rounded portable hard drive which offers good value for money, design and speed. PC and Mac compatibility out-of-the-box is a decent feature and the Seagate Dashboard software is easy to use offering PC, mobile and social backup. There's very little to dislike here.

PNY Duo-Link 3.0 Rating: Reviewed on: 31 August 16 RRP: £70.79 Buy from Amazon The only reason to choose the Duo-Link is to add storage for music and movies to your iPhone or iPad. While, technically, it does the job, it does it in such a ham-fisted way. Add to this the relatively poor performance and it’s hard to recommend. Read our PNY Duo-Link 3.0 review. 12. Transcend StoreJet 25M3 Rating: Reviewed on: 30 January 15 RRP: £85 At less than £85 the Transcend StoreJet 25M3 is very good value for money, costing just 4.15p per gigabyte for a decently resilient portable drive.

Toshiba Canvio Basics 2TB Rating: Reviewed on: 6 February 15 RRP: £69.99 Like Tesco Basics, the Toshiba Canvio Basics lives up to its name, a basic portable drive with no frills in its packaging, style or feature set. However there’s also little sign of any compromise in its overall performance and usability, excepting a slower than usual small-file random write issue. Importantly for many potential buyers, it’s one of the cheapest drives available at fewer than 4 pennies per gigabyte, without compromising the build quality required of its role. Read our Toshiba Canvio Basics 2TB review. 15. Seagate Seven Rating: Reviewed on: 9 February 15 RRP: £89.99 At £123, or just under 25p per gigabyte, the Seagate Seven is currently priced rather expensively for its 500GB capacity. It does offer something quite different in industrial design though, and providing it’s not jostled too much while powered up should be a relatively robust portable drive too. Read our Seagate Seven review. 16. iStorage diskAshur Pro 1TB Rating: Reviewed on: 28 January 15 RRP: £382, US$268 The diskAshur Pro could be iStorage's most secure encrypted drive yet, and its FIPS rating means the US government is content to let its contractors store potentially sensitive data on it. As a storage drive alone it's rather expensive (26.9p/GB) but it performs well and should keep out just about any civilian hacker. Read our iStorage diskAshur Pro 1TB review. 17. LaCie Mirror 1TB Rating: Reviewed on: 5 February 15 RRP: £240, US$180 The LaCie Mirror is well suited for the modern computer narcisist, a portable storage drive that lets you check your makeup as easily as your Facebook status, or just to keep an eye on who is creeping up behind you. As a drive it performed perfectly well but be prepared to pay to peer through this looking glass – at £230 it is five times the price of more function-first 1 TB models.

Traditional companies are seemingly approaching the product category with more hesitation, while fashion companies like Tag Heuer, Guess, Montblanc, Casio and Fossil are jumping on board.  One newcomer in recent times is New Balance, which falls into the fitness-focus category, a company which outed its running-oriented RunIQ watch at the beginning of 2017. The idea: to offer a watch which can be worn all the time, but that is aimed at runners who want to track their runs without needing their phone.  New Balance RunIQ review: Design Waterproof to 5ATM Simple, black metal case Interchangeable 22mm strap lugs Without meaning to be overly cruel, the best way to describe the RunIQ's aesthetic is that it's plain. The round metal casing feels solid; it's thick and well made, but it doesn't feature any eye-catching or extravagant trim anywhere. It's not at all flashy. There is a bonus to this rather simple design: as it's not brightly coloured or ostentatious like some other fitness watches, ut means you can wear it with almost anything. It's not classic enough to wear with a dinner suit, but it's simple enough to wear with most other dress codes. What's more, you can swap the 22mm strap for other standard fit ones if you want. One element we really like about the RunIQ is its strap. Featuring dozens of heart- and diamond-shaped holes means it's always comfortable to wear. It doesn't get hot and sweaty, even during long runs, ensuring your arm stays cool underneath the strap. The diamond-shaped holes running down the middle are to fasten the clasp - and as there are so many of them, so close together, it's easy to find a comfy fit.  Unlike more Android Wear watches, the RunIQ has three buttons on the right edge. They're not especially clicky, but they work. It's here, perhaps, that New Balance could have done more, because with there being three buttons, you'd assume it would add a lot of extra functionality. Realistically, however, they're limited. The middle crown acts like the single button on an Android Wear watch normally would. Press it once to go home, press-and-hold it to launch the apps list. The top button is used only for launching an activity, whether that be running or bike riding, while the bottom one is used purely to launch Google Play Music, either on your connected phone or on the watch itself.  One area that could have done with a little more attention is the underside of the case. This is where you'll find the heart-rate monitor which - with most watches - is hidden behind dressed-up windows of some kind. Here, you get small windows, exposing the sensors in their entirety. It doesn't look very refined. But people aren't going to be staring right at that most of the time. Also on the back of the watch, nestled near the top edge, are four contact points for charging. It's similar in design to the Huawei Watch and Tag Heuer Connected in that regard, and clips onto its small, light charging base using strong magnets. Although even with that, we had to ensure the watch base was completely flat in order for the contacts to be secure and charge effectively. New Balance RunIQ review: Performance and battery Intel Atom processor 410mAh battery  5 hours GPS/HR use  Rather than go with the latest Snapdragon wearable chipset, New Balance partnered with Intel to power its first Android Wear watch. In our testing, however, we've found the RunIQ to be a little sluggish at times, showing noticeable lag when viewing or dismissing notifications, as well as loading functions and apps. This lethargy is most noticeable when attempting to track a run. When the top button is pressed it takes a second or two to load up the interface for tracking the activity. Then there's the waiting time for the watch to lock onto a GPS signal, before a green ring appears to tell you that you can start your run. Except, in all of our runs, it was premature. After starting a run, we noticed the little icon denoting the GPS signal had a cross through it still. So we had to wait 10-20 seconds more until the watch successfully logged our location. The first time we took it running, we hadn't realised this and run nearly 500 metres without it logging the route. When all you want to do is click a button, tap the screen and get going, having that delay is a little frustrating. Once you get used to the waiting at the beginning of a run - throw in a couple of stretches to keep warm - the watch does as good a job of tracking your location as a smartphone would. And it's this sense of freedom that's easy to get used to, and helps you forget that 20 second wait at the start of the run. Not having to carry your phone as well is this watch's biggest selling point, but it's one now shared with a number of other smartwatch makers. Brands like Apple, Samsung and Garmin all make GPS-equipped wrist gadgets, and are a tough crowd to compete with, especially with a first watch - and one which needs a little more improvement and refinement. Battery life is another area that could be improved. The built-in battery performs exactly as New Balance claims it will. That's to say, it's a one day battery. With relatively minimal use, we made it through into the morning of a second day before needing to plug the RunIQ in again. With GPS and heart rate switched on during a run, the watch can last for a claimed five hours (our testing suggested it might go a little longer than five hours). With Android Wear 2.0 coming to the watch soon, some of the performance issues could be solved. GPS logging, for instance, should be even more accurate and faster because of the new software, which New Balance tells us is arriving some time around 27 March. New Balance RunIQ review: Software Currently Android Wear 1.5 Dedicated running app Google Play offline The software experience on the RunIQ is virtually identical to every other Android Wear watch on the market. Like most other manufacturers, New Balance has added a couple of its own fitness-focused watch faces. There's also a dedicated running app which - as previously mentioned - you launch by pressing the top button.  This running app ties in with Strava to track your run, so you can link it to your account, and when you're finished, the route, pace, distance and heart-rate information is all displayed in your Strava feed. One of its best features is that it auto-pauses when you stop. That means you don't need to worry about waiting at crossing affecting your overall time or pace. If you don't use Strava, however, then the button function is useless because you can't map anything else to its use. It's Strava or nada. Same with music: it's Google Play Music or go home. You can still use the watch to control music on your smartphone, but you can't tell the watch to launch Spotify instead of Google Play Music when you press the bottom button. It does seem like a big oversight on New Balance's behalf, giving two fixed, physical buttons such specific functions. New Balance RunIQ review: Display 1.39-inch round screen 400 x 400 resolution  AMOLED panel There are positives and negatives to the round display on New Balance's first Android Wear watch. It's an AMOLED panel, so colours are saturated and high contrast is possible. What's more, because it's completely round and "flat-tyre" free (take note Fossil), there's no slice missing from the bottom portion of the display.  This means New Balance has been able to add icons near the bottom of the screen for starting and pausing exercise or music, without the fear that they'll be cut off.  Despite this, the screen isn't terribly bright. Comparing it to the original Fossil Q Founder, with both screens set to the same brightness, the RunIQ was noticeably dimmer. In most instances, indoors, this doesn't pose too much of a problem. Outside, in bright daylight, it's a different story. It can be hard to see what's on the screen, especially if it's reflecting the sun, or you're looking at it from an angle.  Verdict The long and short of the RunIQ is that it's not a bad bash at a fitness watch, but it's a bit too plain to be an everyday watch. There's nothing remarkable or anything that truly stands out about it. We wouldn't choose it as our go-to fitness watch or our go-to smartwatch, which leaves it in something of a grey area. Also, Android Wear 2.0 can't come soon enough. When it does we're hopeful that the RunIQ can fix its limited button issues, GPS tracking tardiness, and, to some degree, slow operation. Right now this watch feels like an Android Wear device that could have been released a year (or more) ago. With all of that said, however, the RunIQ delivers roughly the same experience as we've had with most other Android Wear watches on a daily basis. The capability is there, it just needs to be eked out of it with various tweaks. The alternatives to consider... Samsung Gear S3 Frontier If you're after a well-made, attractive sports watch that works well with Android, the Gear S3 is an ideal choice. It runs its own wearable operating system which is so much more intuitive and attractive than Android Wear, and its rotating bezel is a brilliant control option.  Read the full review: Samsung Gear S3 review: Android Wear, beware, this is the smartwatch to beat Pocket-lint Polar M600 Polar's square Android Wear watch is purpose designed for sport, and costs considerably less than the New Balance Run IQ.

Maybe you should have a look at how much Intel has given you that per core performance over the recent years. It's not much, not much at all. Two new cores would automatically give you 50%, even if not all old games could put them to perfect use. Without the new cores you are looking at 5%, maybe 10% if Intel was really generous with the clocks.

Quote: Originally Posted by SirDremor Can you please elaborate on WHY you need more cores? And what do 4 cores limit you with? Not this again... In 2007 I felt the need to upgrade my Pentium 4 3.0Ghz and in 2008 bought a E8400. Just 2 years later I felt the need for more cores again so in 2011 I bought the CPU I have today still. It's been 6 years, why didn't we move forward? Lack of competition, lack of software support (API level) and we hit a wall. We need more cores at the mainstream level so developers can take advantage of new existing today APIs and develop more complex and immersive games with thousands of units on display. I'm not a VR or streaming kind of guy but that needs allot of CPU kick. I do like to record wile gaming, edit and post on youtube. So, even if you wouldn't take advantage of more cores today, there's people who would. Quote: Originally Posted by Fox2232 Install Battlefield 1, play multiplayer on 64 man map.

Having CPU's clocking over a certain point is stupid and inefficient.     Silva View Public Profile Find all posts by Silva   (#16) H83 Maha Guru     Videocard: ATI Radeon HD 4850 Processor: Core I5 7600K Mainboard: Asus ROG Strix Z270F Memory: G.Skill DDR4 2800Mhz 16Gb Soundcard: ROG SupremeFX PSU: Corsair RM850i Yesterday, 14:44 | posts: 1,742 | Location: Mars Quote: Originally Posted by SirDremor Can you please elaborate on WHY you need more cores?

I don't mind Intel and AMD releasing 6-8-10-12 multicore chips, it is just that advantage of such chips for ordinary users is absent at best. Personally I would prefer 10nm, better efficiency and per-core performance, rather than more cores. I think the same way. The only reason to need more than 4 cores is if most games really start to require them otherwise they seem such a waste for those who don´t use their system for professional use.

Are you sure that you need a cpu with more cores for this type of cases??? I could be wrong but i think the problem with this kind of MP games is the network part that can´t handle so many players at the same time, not the cpu having insufficient cores... But i could be wrong, of course, so maybe you have some evidence to support this? Remember there´s a reason tech sites like Guru3d don´t use MP games as benchmarks.     H83 View Public Profile Find all posts by H83   (#17) Fox2232 Ancient Guru     Videocard: Fury X - XL2420T(Z)@144Hz Processor: i5-2500k@4.5GHz NH-D14 Mainboard: MSI Z68A-GD80[g3] Memory: 4x4GB 1600MHz 9,9,8,20 1T Soundcard: Essence ST / AKG K-701 PSU: FSP Gold series 750W Yesterday, 15:26 | posts: 5,080 | Location: EU, CZ, Brno Quote: Originally Posted by H83 Are you sure that you need a cpu with more cores for this type of cases???

I am as sure as is my CPU utilization in BF1 multiplayer... I am 4 times 100% sure. And actually I can tell that only reason why MP is not benchmarked is fact that you will have damn hard time getting consistent results. In BF1 CPU utilization is very different in SP and MP. When I 1st time kicked SP, I was running all usual stuff in background. (Around 1 core used by stuff.) Everything was fine. But once I went to MP, i was shocked. Had to alt+tab and kill all my stuff. I am constantly on 4x 100% utilization. And GPU sits at 25~35%, tends to even downclock. Nothing can be done about it. Yes, kaby i5 has quite higher performance per core, but it is still limiting factor. One needs at least i7.     Fox2232 View Public Profile Find all posts by Fox2232   (#18) H83 Maha Guru     Videocard: ATI Radeon HD 4850 Processor: Core I5 7600K Mainboard: Asus ROG Strix Z270F Memory: G.Skill DDR4 2800Mhz 16Gb Soundcard: ROG SupremeFX PSU: Corsair RM850i Yesterday, 16:43 | posts: 1,742 | Location: Mars Quote: Originally Posted by Fox2232 I am as sure as is my CPU utilization in BF1 multiplayer...

I never had my cpu reach 100% on all 4 core and it was a Q9550. But i rarely play MP games nowadays, most of them just bore me to death. But even if you have a better cpu with more cores, the network problem will still exist or no??? I could be wrong but i think that the network part of huge MP games is the biggest bottleneck they have right now. Having 64 players going at each other has to create some problems i think.     H83 View Public Profile Find all posts by H83 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Show Printable Version Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home General Chat     The Guru's Pub     Folding@Home - Join Team Guru3D !     Frontpage news     Digital Photography, Home and Portable Electronics     Tablets and Smart Phones     The HTPC, HDTV & Ultra High Definition section Videocards     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce     Videocards - NVIDIA GeForce Drivers Section     Videocards - AMD Radeon     Videocards - AMD Radeon Catalyst Drivers Section     Videocards - 3dfx     Videocards vs General Purpose - NVIDIA Ageia PhysX, GPGPU etc.     3D Stereo Gaming Section     Benchmark Mayhem Hardware     General Hardware     Die-hard Overclocking & Case Modifications      Computer Monitor Forum     Soundcards, Speakers HiFI & File formats     SSD and HDD storage     Processors and motherboards AMD     Processors and motherboards Intel     Network questions and troubleshooting     Laptops & Notebooks Affiliates     Rivatuner Generic Discussion forum         RivaTuner Advanced Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Overclock Application Discussion forum     MSI AfterBurner Private Beta access     Guru of 3D Clan General     Games, Gaming & Game-demos     Game Tweaks and Modifications     Consoles & console games     Operating Systems     General Software and Applications     Hardware Reviews and News     Programming/Html     Links Powered by vBulletin® Copyright ©2000 - 2017, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd. vBulletin Skin developed by: vBStyles.com Copyright (c) 1995-2014, All Rights Reserved.

The companies would combine expertise in car making, sensors and software so that people in a specific part of town could order a shared car through their smart phone. The driverless car would pick them up and take them where they want to go. The companies said Tuesday the system would let people make better use of their time in cars and help those who do not have driver’s licenses. The auto industry and tech firms have been investing heavily in autonomous driving technology. Many basic elements of autonomous driving are already in use, such as driver assistance systems that can keep cars in freeway lanes or detect pedestrians ahead. But legal issues surrounding driver responsibility remain to be solved. Other automakers are also working on the concept. BMW, a top competitor for Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, has teamed up with chip maker Intel and Mobileye, maker of driver-assistance systems. Together they plan to have 40 autonomous BMW vehicles on the road testing the technology this year, and BMW says it will introduce an autonomous vehicle called the iNEXT by 2021. Last month at the Geneva auto show, Volkswagen showed off an autonomous vehicle with no steering wheel and facing sofa-style seats. Alphabet’s Waymo, the former Google autonomous car project, is testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in the United States with test drivers aboard. The two companies provided little additional detail about the project in their statement but were clear that they intended to come up with an automated system that is “ready for production.” The news release said they were aiming for what is known as Level 5 automation – with sensors and software controlling the vehicle fulltime. Bosch, headquartered in the German town of Gerlingen, near Stuttgart, has some 390,000 employees in 120 countries. It is a leading auto industry supplier, making vehicle safety and driver assistance systems, sensor technology and software. “By introducing fully automated and driverless driving to the urban environment, Bosch and Daimler aim to improve the flow of traffic in cities, enhance safety on the road and provide an important building block for the way traffic will work in the future,” the companies said in a statement.

State presidents and directors of the party will attend the briefing as will members of the federal leadership group, including Julie Bishop, George Brandis and Mathias Cormann. Those present will be able to read the review but will have to return their copies, underlying the sensitivity of its findings.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Malcolm Turnbull supporters listen to Bill Shorten give his speech on the screen at the Liberal Party election night function in Sydney. Photo: Wolter Peeters MPs only expect to receive a highly redacted version of the report, if they are allowed access to it at a later date.  The presentation of the review comes just two days after the man who oversaw the campaign, party director Tony Nutt, announced his resignation. Advertisement Sources familiar with the review said it would be critical of the Coalition's flat-footed approach to rebutting Labor's "Mediscare" campaign and the "jobs and growth" mantra that failed to cut through with voters. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton on Thursday said the Liberal Party had failed to combat scare campaigns by Labor and activist group GetUp! in the lead-up to polling day.  SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Outgoing Liberal Party federal director Tony Nutt. Photo: Andrew Meares Liberal MPs said they were particularly interested in the review's findings on the quality of the party's internal polling. "There is broad agreement that the polling that was done was not very good," a Liberal MP said. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Former cabinet minister Andrew Robb. Photo: Louie Douvis Another Liberal source, pointing to swings against the party in Tasmania and western Sydney, said: "There was a lot of false confidence about seats we ended up losing." The review - which included interviews with Liberal MPs who lost their seats - is expected to canvass how research was shared between the federal party machine and state divisions. One marginal seat MP said it was hard to get Mr Nutt on the phone during the campaign and that campaign operations were highly centralised.  Former prime minister Tony Abbott on Thursday warned against Mr Nutt being blamed for the party's poor showing. "Obviously the government lost 14 seats and that was very unfortunate," he told the Nine Network. "We are now left with just a one seat majority, to try to sheet home the responsibility for that to one person, particularly to try to sheet home the responsibly to the federal director would be a big mistake."  Mr Abbott said the report should be "frank and fearless, not mealy mouthed". "There is no point in doing these reports unless they tell the truth, the plain, unvarnished truth and I hope that's what we get," he said. "It will be tough to win the next election, whenever that is, and it's important we learn the lessons of the last one going into the next one." Former Howard government minister Chris Ellison and former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell also contributed to the review.  One MP questioned why it had taken nine months after the election to complete the review, noting the federal election was followed by a drubbing for the Liberal Party in Western Australia.  Mr Dutton acknowledged the party needed to lift its performance in the polls given Malcolm Turnbull cited poor polling as a justification for rolling Mr Abbott in 2015.  "That's a fair point and Malcolm Turnbull wouldn't step back from that point," Mr Dutton told radio 2GB. "What we need to do is turn the polls around, if that's the measure." Mr Dutton said Mr Nutt was a "wonderful bloke" who had been a loyal servant of the Liberal Party for 35 years. Victorian Liberal Party president Michael Kroger told Sky News it would be "completely illegitimate" to make Mr Nutt "the fall guy" for the campaign's shortcomings, but said such internal reports "don't go nearly as far as they need to" in apportioning blame. "Obviously you can't lasso every person that you think failed because a lot of them are still in office," he said.

Sections Search Help/Info Subscribe: Digital | Home Delivery Subscribe Help/Info     Breaking News Bar   Columns posted: 4/6/2017 1:00 AM Schiff mum on what he saw at White House Facebook Twitter 200 Email Print Comments 0 hello Article to: (required) Article from: (required) Add a message (optional) Success - Article sent! close   Byron York     Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has been sharply critical of the panel's Republican chairman, Devin Nunes, for visiting the White House to view classified documents that Nunes says show the Obama administration intercepted the communications of Donald Trump associates before the president took office in January. Among other things, Schiff slammed Nunes for viewing the documents by himself and not sharing them with Democrats on the committee. So last week, White House counsel Don McGahn invited Schiff to come see the documents for himself. Schiff did so on Friday. Now, both the Republican chairman and the Democratic ranking member on the Intel Committee have seen the documents. And now, the public has a chance to hear another assessment to balance Nunes' claim that he saw "dozens" of intelligence reports involving the incidental collection of Trumpworld figures in Obama administration intercepts, with the names of some of them "unmasked," and that none of it had to do with Russia. In other words, Nunes suggested the Obama administration misused its wiretapping powers to gather information on the Trump team. So with Schiff's visit to the White House, a chance for balance. But after viewing the documents, Schiff has gone nearly completely silent about what he saw. He has kept up his criticism of how Nunes came to view the material, but on what's actually in the documents, Schiff has said virtually nothing. On Friday, immediately after viewing the documents, Schiff released a statement in which he declined to say anything about substance and repeated earlier criticisms of Republicans' handling of the matter. "While I cannot discuss the content of the documents," Schiff said, "if the White House had any concern over these materials, they should have been shared with the full committee in the first place." Schiff made no public comments on Saturday, and then on Sunday morning appeared on CNN, where Jake Tapper asked Schiff if, having seen the documents, "can you understand why Chairman Nunes might have some issues with the surveillance that was going on?" "I can't go into the contents of the documents, Jake," Schiff said, before a quick pivot to Nunes' methods. "I can say I don't agree with the chairman's characterization, which is exactly why it's so important you don't share documents with just one person or even two people. They need to be shared with both full committees." Continuing, Schiff said "the most important thing" about the documents is not what is in them but how they were handled: "But the most important thing people need to know about these documents is not classified, and it's a couple of things. First, the deputy assistant to the White House informed me when I went to see them that these are exactly the same materials that were shown to the chairman. "Now, this is a very interesting point. How does the White House know that these are the same materials that were shown to the chairman, if the White House wasn't aware what the chairman was being shown? "And the second point was also made to me. And this is -- I think was also underscored by Sean Spicer -- and that is, it was told to me by the deputy assistant that these materials were produced in the ordinary course of business. "Well, the question for the White House and for Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because, if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? There's nothing ordinary about the process that was used here at all." All the talk about intercepts, Schiff said, was just an attempt by Trump and Republicans to distract from questions about Trump and Russia. By that time, anyone interested in the substance of the issue -- Do the documents show that Obama administration officials picked up Trumpworld figures in electronic intercepts and then identified them by name? -- was entirely frustrated. Schiff appeared determined to say nothing about substance. "I guess the question that Nunes is asking or suggesting that we should be asking in the media," Tapper said to Schiff, "(is) who unmasked these Trump advisers, and is it possible that any of this unmasking was being done for political reasons, instead of for legitimate ones?" "Well, first of all, I can't talk about, as I mentioned, the contents of any documents," Schiff said. "So at this point, I can't say whether anything was masked or unmasked improperly." Schiff then pivoted again to criticize Republican procedures. Monday morning, Bloomberg's Eli Lake reported that former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice "requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter." If that is accurate, it seems unlikely that the "most important" thing about the documents is how they were handled. After seeing the documents with his own eyes, Schiff had a chance to shed some light on what has become a key question in the Trump-Russia matter. He didn't take it. © 2017, Universal Tweet This article filed under: Discuss Commentary York, Byron Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Also, Jeff Howe is tweeting about Richard Sherman to the Patriots. The guys take a look at Sherman's contract situation to see if it could work. Also, LeGarrette Blount and Patriots are supposedly still talking. Callers react to Marchand's spear. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. On him when he. Beats Fort Wayne and moaning and forty. And that's the way. Against Boston. Barges being escorted out that would signal that it's a major penalty water. Wonders if it is they've backed penalty had it been days with an automatic review by the national hockey league's player safety administration with the wind blew in. Christian I'm the last person I've about a big game for the student. And so our. I'm not want to get caught up regular season business you know them. And so I've been situated finals than. I'm the last person as a regular season game goof. Right now on Sports Radio WEEI. I'm not very many experienced suspensions of come out of the league so it'll be interesting how they played this one. I'm Marcia and most deserving and I think what the Bruins making the playoffs they might as well form a couple of games for us and send another message to on. Its. Keith Jones on last night's NBC sports broadcast its was wiped out here. Involvement play. That's what they were talking about national lane you know why he makes some sense. Bruins are in the postseason right now you wanna send a message to a guy that's got a rap sheet right he's been suspended before. He's been a bad boy won't that affect most recently January the 24 2007 team that trip on a Nicklaus crumble. So you may saying while they're in the playoffs. Two games left or should slap the tone but. If he just dropped their cash and it's no big deal. You don't mean like that Washington is clincher for college. The party classic colors then number one seed just suspended for the last two what does it matter if it's means or means a lot. To this Bruins team yet they clinch a playoff spot as of right now. Odds are they're facing Washington. If they don't lose Brad marsh area a better shot to win these last couple of games as a chance they could be the number three seeds they were they all. Do you think it might always huge demand means something Jeremy Jacobs in the organization that they're going to be able to sell popcorn and beer and pizza and a lot of the stuff for a few more games because let's face it. If you're any Atlantic Division. And you're facing Ottawa you facing Toronto. Not only is it more likely it's a long first round. But she got a chance to women at brown and get to the second round possibly I Montreal if not possibly face Montreal and cool and you do you do you have. Drama vet with clout but if you face Washington. If you think Washington how can anybody saved it you can when that I'm just amazed that this type of act. Is not frowned upon more I'm just amazed that this is just. And that's no big deal against those those note there's no real suspension history there's no light. Bylaw let's say if you take your steak and jammed it under somebody's undercarriage and and knock out his baby DNA under maggert and what that well he I think that this. It's this says had star written all over the fact that yet to gain that never suspect really I don't they don't any. I know I did it. That's just I guess that's just hockey and my friends who like whoever worked out with Trent wood down Foxboro all hockey players and all laughing about it like it's no big deal. Could you imagine somebody like. Brady fell down and just laying on his back in the JJ watt just came and took his foot just. Right did brilliantly jewels to knock them I'm not like no big deal on the consumer does that virtually every Sunday and that are here but we're talking yes he's one of the guy at a dirty ass player nations suspended every single time but he wasn't he wasn't. Purposely going for is not. March and was going or not. He did it was actually that this would strictly RS admits that but it was strictly be on reputation Crosby did it. You know a short period going in it but there's more attention to you see the replay of Crosby doing it's just there's no question what he was doing now there's a question will Marcia was doing either. Well it may look it's me those. But he might get suspend the ship if he does he probably deserves it because to be an idiot. After he sticks him in the groin when he turns around the talks are refereed like what. What Snyder is near where did me wrong he's got a stick any ice and it's like he hits the do at a at a bridge of his nose with this pick actually it's a guide to face. So to be taking a look at it and I wonder if they won't even bring that up when they announced garlic the penalty because the dude he's got nailed. In casinos get a stick in his nose on wryly yeah I'd be tested this nice gonna get reload Japanese and curtailing nothing's going on. I don't think he should be suspended. But he he should be a massive fine but if he does then. I agree with that but you know it it to himself is yeah but played a huge game. It's sound angry if you it was he was sold it was almost like he was fists. That he was addicted there's even an issue like people think I was faking it like god I barely giving I raised you. Amy I can bail you got to cop why did you know you're not really hurt like he was about you like he was flopping. We all guys like forever. Had hurt his stomach. Couldn't breathe if you really ever gotten it really does right on point Lou maybe baseball I've ever now men you know kind of got it catches you William when you least expect it doesn't happen in the NFL but it was a company NFL. Never happens that nobody ever since LS someone purposely does it. It's just they're all got me. You see how well Jimmie hey beat it because Brad my ship got 39 year concede a goal for forty. This sort of stuff you're hoping was in his past practice or something mr. Brad motion from 23 years ago. And you just take it beyond it now you can still be a little nastier out their player union VP discussion. And do something like this and arguably one of the biggest games at the garden in the last three years. A chance to make the postseason if not you start. Things start tighten it up if you lose that game. It may knows he's lucky they won that game yes yes they bail them out he owes an apology should go around that room today and he should apologize to every player and say thanks for bailing my ass out. And and killing that five minute nature 'cause he did it early now a minute left in the in the first period produce the best he does talk when the game is over. And he's kind of a bloodiest of the whole thing. He's suspended. Annoyed Hansen replace. You know that kicked over the game and frustrated also. So enjoy the one with the bush. Is that I is that OK with us either public or does anybody does anybody believe. Does anybody believe that he did not see the replay unless the way you phrased it low he knows exactly what he did he doesn't want to see the replay of. I'm only guessing that the Bruins. You know. I'm just going up my own experience you know it in the Red Sox for example you gate tossed to me you walk in their runway. Whether the video guys right there an accident dug out or is up there and in the locker room whatever it might be. When you get tossed he had two periods. You don't think you ran that play back he actually saw at least five times while he's up there hanging out prohibited beer line. Our shot of the game for boys come back in the locker room he addresses these nasty cracks open a beer or two who knows I don't know sits there watching the video showers maybe has another one who knows there are lapping water. Again here's the difference if he admits that he actually saw. Then there's a follow up question asking him specifically why he did it and what he did. By answering the question is I haven't seen the replay after that you can asked a question or he doesn't have an answer the follow up if you ask him exactly what he did I don't know I haven't seen. But come on it happened with a minute left in the first period. US all of that time you had nothing else to do there was no other obligation US you wore us out of the game that is sole. Some days you're differ look poised forty seconds before in the period I think was so called team comes out and the first period you're pissed million. David apple let my bad my bad my bad they go opposite compared what you don't. Hang out you don't BS write your guy don't you guys make them pay just got him hey you know you're you're regular Nabisco in you've seen. The Senate's idea acknowledged he was Smart there right appointed to bail us out. And they did dale assassinated they really did. And you know at the beginning of period you've got fresh ice out there you've got fresh legs. And they held up four and a half minutes to open up that second period and killing that Sakharov. And that was the difference and again you can see it. Tuukka Rask has a great second period they want them to win the thing they can bury that team and heels a mall an apology and heels a mall like that they'll MI. I mean you're Sammy he's not getting your game and you may be right. He should get too but he should there should be they should change his role. Overall that if you do anything like that regardless of culture what used to be and how was and how it should be good but if you take your stick. And blindly. Knock somebody in his knots on purpose. I mean not by accident another kid the putt hit somebody and it based are you your fight in the state actually hit somebody who's just skating by U. But here's the problem without logic if they have been have been hearings for guys that have done this already this year last year or the year before the year before that. And have not. And given a suspension for you that you can't suddenly today suddenly saying I want. Of the one there's exploration and Jerry I don't problem. You can't sit there and say las Sidney Crosby did it in now Brad marsh is getting out of control so let's suspend the got the last strategist David. You know and I understand that wouldn't be the reason the reason Libyan look at the history and and I get that but maybe this is something in the offseason the news when we go back to. You know of this type of thing you know there's an opportunity maybe to suspend these guys now as opposed to treating the way did with a haven't passed which just fine. Despite the guy but he inherited your game misconduct you missed the last two period dale. Directed bailed them out the amazing thing to me is this team what you've seen now eighteen and seven under Bruce Cassidy. It makes you feel better because that tip of gay game last time they played and we all sat there and everybody sat there the guys are nests and they're talking about it after the game Dallara all of of it is and we just thought this was it. This was it and it was just the timing of it it was so bad they lost three straight and it would all play the worst in the later Bruce Cassidy. And we just thought this was then now the reality six games later is. It was just a bad game. It was a bad game from Duca and now what got him going but in 1970 to save percentage is last four games. Dressed in four games three and ultimately it's only get away from ranked whatever it was motivating I don't really that's Reston. I think that's the problem jeans and he just he keeps on its own wants if it's why he's an arm of the can stand up to it now. Gust of night quiz was. Suspended for six games but he spirit of player in the face. So bleak you know is protective of offense protective thing that we've seen that any hits against the boards. With him with head related to neck related that is something that they they slap the suspension. But if you look at the history you have a guy with a stake in the not. It's OK what do I know little oil and let me go to this I get it right I guess my point is overall that ruled these changed my grip it just that I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm just amazed. That's at protections varies yes I mean there's two the two most important things are ahead. You had come back with him. All along some of them and make them by Annan who want it. Well as its current U protected wanna viewers the other woman mature I'm you don't admin. For some of the stuff you say in his per game and I have added yeah they got the years. You take your service others that JFK nets are critical that the we'll leave it there. So force assets Carlson you know he's sorry he signs that the three year entry level deals so he's gonna burn a year of eligibility but. It's going to be a game ranked yes. Whoever it is it is visa. That's a problem who's got the student DC now he's a work visa solicitor issues there with his visa thing. What did you get into. Troubled him out of the country the trust a veteran trial if you're in a battle embrace it could be a worry about it good to delegate is we need to. All. Is that your game right you think. Probably not tomorrow night against Ottawa by the way this game at least that's gonna drive me Sunday dads can drive secret you cannot call this guy JFK by now because we had a presidents here from the cells from Brooklyn. It is but I wanted to it was his first and Jacob or is it a Yucca as the verdict announced balls. The see you in the morning guys beat this Swedish yes. We're veteran or is it is Jacob here we are probably young couple out there ya ya got heated aggregated from your throat to the soft. Soft is that what is doctor and I heard it off why is I'm I'm listening to people thought about it for as Barca Carlson. I hate it when they do the hyphen stuff on Alex you two last names of the guys nice ringtone well it's it's now it's still it's lazy that's what is this what is slightly once we noticed. He said that. I don't know what a cable to pretend okay as we need a mechanic this up all the cell phone apple. Got on got you yeah routed the let me. Import arguing that fire wrecked cars and that that is on gold at port the budget at cadence player slashed and Netscape right at the line. It would not help because there's no way issue even think about and. I'll it and they didn't call one on I caused brief promo on the hit that he didn't call one did. We think all the penalty and only did they strike. Now they're gonna suspend and the causes you know is right protection. Right could you got a history. But that's another story fall and I think it's an interesting one. It's this guy wants to be a great player and I know he's probably sitting in making excuses that I coney city's best player in the league and he didn't. If he wants to be great player scout clean reputation. He's going to be a hard. Player but he's got to get away from being that that mosquito that that that just drives people crazy you know. That's what you want me he's got to play his game he's got a income went to get back in the Intel that mammoth starting this week. He can't change. He has yet. All he has this is. Already above all he had beat he is done now you know and ask him some he can't do we are shown he can do it. That's just not present a part of game. At least this year. The most who put up. And those. Are. But they say he got back to bestseller. Well there's a lot of chip on the shoulder while it's another thing about being a dirty as. You you don't think there's a difference. Unlike his champions. I mean this painting was the craziest thing I've ever seen he took what four punches at the guy and nobody said anything resembling what it isn't in on a Stanley Cup champions final. Unbelievable it was used to twitch yeah Oaxaca which of us I. Think that's the most amazing thing I don't like to accuse him. In a week it's there it's cutting out fighting he said they're stood up toe to toe. Just punched away with dreams of a punching bag. Pretty sketchy. And they took it and that's why they took it in the end game seven to right. Yeah but he's got to clean it up a little boy you don't think he's got to claim this act up. I think he's got a be a leader. And you can't take stupid penalties or dictate that a game that he got or at. And that was not and you agree that without being a leader last night that without was doing something because you were pissed off frustrated there like you ought. A great Gallagher right let's go to us Steve's and a truck. Hey guys I don't there. Christian I got a little bored to create Iraq and went a little girl on this on this subject. Is a listen and you shot. Let him call me this girl went upstairs. I'll tell ya on the Toyota knew why doesn't happen in the NFL because they brought steroids and it strikes on a minute about the. Her balance as stupid. As her other areas to order a wide open. OK let me ask you this this league again you has. It has nothing to do with mr. Rosenblum penis has nonetheless. The fact is it just seems like just I recall broke cold I don't know whatever you wanna call it. It's is like any time so don't think it's funny. To randomly. Knock somebody kick somebody and in the nuts it's just I don't see why that's not frowned upon like that. Okay. I actually light so late and if it is OK okay okay apply to me that's All Saints so it's been everybody I talk to says that's on the way to bet they don't mammals but I was I was sure you. Now I know I know I. I didn't my point is. The reason guys don't get personal global players are not gonna start randomly knock some guy. In the maps locate every now then under the pile there is one knuckle that that likes granddad Yankee Graham and even know I didn't do any really awareness cubs this. I think it has a down my leg right now on the come on stop me on whether whether this sometime this. Sort of intimate portrait what is. Wow. And struck out needs to write and remember. All I credited Byron friend guy. We. Larson's. Yeah it's what I thought he says in his right hey if you you noticed that if it doesn't have Chester says something. You know everybody jumped to a little commercial you know and yes Hutton yes but what went one added that does talk surveillance. So so he doesn't like an hour ago an hour and a half ago on on ESP and says. Is this something to this Richard Sherman about being traded. And then suddenly. You go online and and then suddenly everybody's popping up all he would he would grow go to the patriots are you would agree. It's suddenly becoming a Star Search all shift yourself. Was there is something to. The possibility that Richard Sherman could get traded in other words Seattle may be looking at that she got to figure out they holes. In their team so if you are going to try to fill some of those holes the best way of doing it if you've got cap issues. Is to take a way. Something where you really strong and right now they're strong in a back into their defense and and and through traffic seemed to Vilsack. And so you take it got its make an eleven million dollars a year fourteen I think as the average eleven million bucks and you take him out of the equation. As of now we've jumped the shark and we suddenly looking at the possibility. That he could becoming too knowing. Is is there any solid profitability do you sing anything that directly ties to knowingly or we just taking. We just jump off a rat poison in a while ago and what it yeah. Before they sent Gilmore that there was entry that there was interest that they talked to Sierra global trade for a for Richard chairman that was before soul. Now back editing here again there'll be so you see John Snyder apparently was on with our old friend Mike Salk you know. Wednesday morning GM first Seattle it's he says quote what you've seen lately in the news is real. Unquote that's on both sides. So there's this it's always ended messages. Now given how close did you ask him he also said that meg 90% of this type of stuff that they're discussing that doesn't happen it just doesn't it ever close about his discussions that they're both over to read Tom what is a go to sell insurance and to be at that I don't know if we got down the point that question. But you know that just affected them or Paul resulted they are urged him before Lisa Gillmor. Don't exist they got Gilmore you sit out at second after us now maybe people are opening up their doors are all gone now. Because Malcolm bulletin we still don't know what's so there should you not from what we're gonna you get something in return obviously foreign. With no warmth that you go out there and what are you gonna have to give. I'm probably everything you've already acquired in the box or do you gonna have to give up for Richard Sherman. They didn't have to pay Richard Sherman eleven million dollars he's only on under contract for 20172018. And granted. And some of that money because of the bogus stuff that structure will be paid by Seattle. But this is this just makes cents. Unless you love Richard Sherman is a boy you that is going to be the difference well he's a guy that seems to would we talk about. What was the knock on nudging it counts he likes to a freelance and do all zone. That kind of the Middle East on Richard Sherman is that. Clinton I don't know when they play only on once I'd left right guys AME had a player like inciting players always intently do you found he's got that. But the sideline as a as a friend so and I'm much see you can't really freelance that Martin Lister cheese in the back across the middle of the field and just being stupid. And and they're not gonna do that. I didn't look at finances with you said the EU can heaven for Tim Williams Zemaitis they do have an exec in you can keep him. Ominous thing in Seattle their interest in getting rid of whom they get room after one year but if you require I think he still control for two. Possibly look at his his let your two years you wanna give up all that for two years Richard Sherman does just what you're afraid to pay Malcolm Butler big time money. This guy's gonna get top the end money. Exactly and he's going to be thirty years of age 31 when he goes out the free agency so we some books for eleven point four this year. Eleven million next year a cat and remember the cap hit would go to Seattle's you know have to worry about that they would take it point. Did cap money nine point four. And then it becomes a free agent in 2000 in 1931 years of age. So it was two years is a two years these two years old of butler's Becker two years old down. There. Well that's a big capital he said to Medicare and and half million to look at I did like reports us Maria I'm 44 to get rid Richard chairman. Yeah I eight I don't know why you'd wipe these pressure when I got to take nine and a half men in a campaign to get rid of Richard Sherman it's horrible gorge and by the way the other one it's kind of interest because I think you would imagine this you're the low. Why would they worked out a deal with regard to what he wants to be here or finding out now that the money seems to be an issue and. It's always about money you know that when horses and some are eligible public. So when you wanna save it once you want to hold on just Carolina and yes I know your goal does not like it yes I'm familiar. But it didn't close calls that you are a you know Sissy boy was an area writes for the lemur Loney and 48. Christian college Sports Radio. It got released from the wasn't that wonderful to store here's Jim McCullough I joke. Pelé guys don't you know you don't expect expects a technical. Question what the audit of the white called orbit I grapefruit football. The or. If you are or call eight go to that. A whole lot Olympic and I never said it wasn't pop and actually the pass and said if we're gonna start raking as far as the toughest sport to place or is weird here on your body. One and baseball we know about her parents started as well it's the heartless or is a left. OK let's see a shift physical without it and that and that. You know you know ship that people are so I might. We don't have to contest right now I'm OK great you win a hockey is so much article on ethic I don't care. In August rarely eats that you feel worse the next morning after Hakim are football depending if your player for now. But how close Gaza third fourth I think guys know about it that's funny right that's what apple worked out after a game they don't get enough minutes that you're one of them that you only play sixty games because the body can't take more sixteen in the course of the season. Was too complacent it's more quickly when all you do is what's that there's more cheap shot mentality that's mine. If it did I don't get it it just doesn't make any sense played. That's OK everything else is everything else that is frowned upon like a vicious hits all can be careful tablet. You take a stake and it's nobody's looking at you when you give them the business. The monitor that's like at at two game suspension. Okay no I don't like I saw that I want to get what they pretty carefully collect I think it may be observed a double minor let's. I didn't see that in any more than that pretty much an up or I don't feel that anything that. Well hook Spinner Carl yeah yeah rumors using wish he had what he would use him right in the ball exactly. So I mean you go on a lark you know I'll call atmosphere the fact is he was trying to do damage to the guys products and you can't do that acts on that sorry he can't do that he is to go to player now. To lower himself to doing stuff like that or you better be. The way he used to be really sneaky about it that was not sneaking I was out in the open and that was would be essential literally over your shoulder. So he was not paying attention and you can't do it when your team is playing in the biggest game maybe in three freaking years. Stephen Marbury feisty. And guys in Auckland you just edit the biggest game in three years. And they were severely. Penalized in neck games to give someone a five minute major I'm pretty sure. That was the first penalty of the game I think dead matching penalties from the queen the other guys they're clueless first and got up five minute major and game like that's deciding to eighteen states. You know why don't we blame you don't live there. So I it was about play good call on I think you should have been on minor. I don't think it should be a five minute major. I don't know what and I don't you know why you know why well because Jane dodge of was down there. You know screaming at in soprano. That's what happened so he would all like. Yes so that's what happens and I agree with you should be based on the intent. And not what happens to the to the to the individual that that played into the five minute major. And a game misconduct. And the discount is an automatic. Right that was anonymous there and. They are it was almost as reject him for his own safety that Democrats have. We'll find out ammunition they're treated it and he gets suspended here because this game tomorrow and it now means an awful lot. Now in if you lose him for the last two games that would hurt this team you know and he was yelling I think it if at the wrath. Oslo would be yellen. I wouldn't be surprised if you jump ball the stick in the face afterwards as well. In early ages need mean it just you know we're stuck in and knocks. But did you see him stick in the face for a stick but he just casually just had to stick pretty nice it was like with what they end up music. Little. Later this statement Bridget is noses they call but you lick all. Any it's tough but I am a little bit surprised. Because. When it originally happened I I thought it was a real dirty yet. You can see people want to quarter were pretty much in the same thing now you caught in the heat of the game and where you war and you want the Bruins to win. The game is over not only do they kill off the five minute major but they win the game they win it in and a an easy fashion when it by fort Nelson school okay. An occasional four. At that human cry people screaming about martian but I would not. All you need to know to me is on the telecast with a brick weather's jackal the post in a medical was nobody was defending Brad nobody nobody sector no one really is there was a -- by bitter internal rarely dipped. Nobody not one of them defended them which was nice. And they all called to the carpet they also listening might face discipline for this thing you might actually missed a few games the wasn't anybody call looked like these guys. Innocent say I don't think he did it on purpose as a kid that Arctic and if they work in front of the net now. All the former players you heard from none of them let him off the OK so what should people be critical when not an awful lot to okay. Imagine what would have happened if Tampa Bay scored 23 goals splits into goals. In a five minute major period and suddenly they'd lose that game last that we get a total different but. What happens now. If he goes and he gets suspended it. They'd lose that game against Ottawa then they'd lose the game against Washington and you Washington in the first round of the blast. Maybe who knows maybe Washington wants to beat you Saturday. So the pic of you in the first round of the plant maybe they feel you're better matchup for that. But it dominated you he's been great against you maybe you look at it that way is that we got to win this game. We want Boston in the first round world kicked arrest. And you know suddenly. Are facing Washington as opposed to maybe getting back in the Atlantic Division getting Ottawa. Getting the Toronto getting a Montreal the second round and actually being able to make some noise in the post season now will people be pissed that the at marsh. On their deepest dive at it they lost last naked in Paris and we'll see you so wait. The backlash would be. Especially you know they were if they weren't able to. If that if they wanted to kill. You know that that was a five minute. Five when it would end up being honest like I hear of it for par four and a half minutes right. That ended any differently what a nightmare that would have been today. Major nightmare I mean blaming him personally for just being dumb but he embassy in all of the work of this there weren't last year. I Jackson McCartney Jack. Barry I I don't think they. Well. I'd get it was a really pulled it no doubt about it being very self which would just be sport spirit that. By a cross checked the back edge rock shall. Read it was dot. Sure thing I think in May let him skate on this or maybe aren't nada not a suspension by and check it won't mean. These are critical piece of that of that is enough. They cannot afford to be voted for a game or a couple games. But CR how many times the teams do that to him and nightly basis this year given the way he's playing this what you do when you play the Bruins rightly moshing is who he's doing out there. That's what you do you do things you know yeah and try to get a whiff of what you try what you try to do is get what the reaction that you got from him gave him off the ice took great. I yet but I significant across certain side of the face it's it's mostly just my heart and just a quick reaction. And I got it needs to be moronic. Just openly pledged it was a with a fine because she's playing great right now you know legitimate or hospital orderly to our souls and maybe just like it bought. Now that it that the key may be getting it back in the Atlantic Division again with a number two and a retreat you know in the Atlantic and suddenly you play teams that. I know they've had problems with with Ottawa Lebanon because of the way that they play. Now little trap but now those two teams that you'd rather get a much better shot against either one of those teams that you do against Washington. I six point 7779793. Several close about one more segment to go here each week. And then afterwards with the go who appreciate your guards are rare bloody glad you're afraid it is the way Maloney and Maury Montel you. It's video what Garrett wants during the second birthday we pair. We have via media critic. On the line I want to go home and out because he'd like to. It like to breakdown the commentary Lou's commentary and opening date is loop by the way will be doing tomorrow afternoon schedule at Fenway Park. If we have faced so this might be a little bit of a constructive British architect notes I had just. Yeah I. I really like Lou I think I'd like to move the ball players in. By my couldn't. He didn't shut out on. Commentary that color. Let analysis. You know he he was speaking right he was our speed dial in. And would let him talk and I don't know the feeling on too much too much life to let's say if the broadcast did you want to late clear more cricket. Between every pitch he he was like yeah. Pete talk in that particular did he overshadow the other two guys on the radio 2.2. Wouldn't shut I'll tell you what is that thing. Tomorrow do you gains and I will say and debris. But you want to say something you just don't want the cost as much right. Exactly it. Is an island like Hewitt it would like like it was nervous. Are you know it. You nervously now now a look at our donors was when Joseph does the play by play it's Joseph and me. And Tim does you know once and then when when Tim does a play by play it's Tim and mean Joseph. Did this is how the baseball the whole works these two late three and so when I'm in a Booth and allows them to sort of take a break. So they're talking for four and a half that you're talking for Obama. Yes let's talk. Zachary and Jeff want to shut up a well we'll sort lust of shorty wanna hear you get off the heat is also open up his car and to hear the sound of the back at at almost a half from now. So if he doesn't really wanna hear your toys to be just quieter as Jeb bowl Janice Jeff which one which one does which orders don't sell best with and which one disease sound worse with just told you. He does have to game would Joseph and have to game with him. Where would you see he say he sounds the best were the worst against with which guy. Oh easy but it's all this talk at all time you want it now he's put the ball that iTunes is talking and stuff. Some sauce or other words a jolt and I know I wrote Jim that tomorrow they're great in Fallujah Sox right Jeff I would think that's is that it just just I don't know I figured we heard this idea aux sable's goodness and CA united auto I don't know and I I will I will make a note. Diluted down so the and and. Slippery at that perfect gonna let nobody expects that it. But it was cute too much into reading. Wolf you know your stuff we did don't you think it's a Smart move to to pass that along to the list they also note quiet or should we hold all that stuff. Seventh. You don't get it to you want more we'll show him the ticket buyer from Irish bar had a shiner Baltimore there's advantages to get him on Knight. I'm and it's and I probably do one day be to a monkey should shoot for and that's about it so it's only what's I'll let you know what do the two yards on. Like the original mourns we should have moved critical decline. And local news on the field right now being chased down by superiors knew it was. Right. It is an example we'll enthused and it's just for fun to review with some dignity and go yeah individual homes and. I don't opening tomorrow. Reacted Kidman it's Brito left so tomorrow you'll be doing that John Ferrell song with deal holly this afternoon and obviously we'll talk a little bit about that the commit a while before we close out we bring in check out and those guys. The leader board that. Do you think the fact that Rex Berkett signed for three point one million dollars may have something to do with The Who would care what is he wanted to be here. Seems like it would be easier since it was going just fine. And then suddenly they go out and bring another running back yet who you would think would be lower on the depth chart. Then he would can be special teams guy to. And they given three point one million maybe I'd get hurt nobody else is where we are now he has no leverage Schwartzel who make money and more fall back down in a fourth down back you don't mirror ball or go back or out of whatever I don't I don't mean stripped of his yeah. Put doubts it. Select because he's on special teams like Brandon Bolden an upgrade on Brandon Bolden should be making more than leader or they must really like. Perk that they must really think this month cite your liberties for more than that maybe me maybe that's part of what they're looking at right now saying. Some of the stuff that Garrett pointed out we got a goal and that was gained seventeen last year with all the other running backs got hurt. And he had a big huge game because he played much this is one of those we've seen a little of and enough to think that he can be pretty good and maybe do some of the things that blocked. Yet if it the gear blondes wants to have a little I want to hold his breath and wait for them to. To give in its not gonna happen so what's thought Brooke gets three million what do they what is the what is blow one. 3.5. Or I'd rather not I'm gonna have I wanted to please his points well and there's nothing right there port unless that speaking of running backs out of even sort of set those salons have apparently interviews and yes a retirement system it was a major pieces came through me and talked all the coaches had some lunch and left. He actually worked out and we wish that he probably would work not I don't I said he did you know I know it never happened that way of an old veteran players never come in. And work out drew the creation and don't just happen you don't run forty you don't put it may be in September you do. But during your free agency during. You'll pick he she just shake hands. I'm just understand it went but I usually don't happen that deal's gonna try to get something out of this whether it's again Intel if you pop somewhere else he he might be doing the agent in favor. Who knows maybe he really thinks this guy. Comedic got a lead on the season maybe doesn't think anything's gonna take a chance on. If we get a guy at work they got a target at an age regularly and has an eight year in it to Ager Peterson is a 100% he's healthy they put him out there on the grass on the turf well and they start having go right go left and they watch him cut. Won't forget about it yeah start forget about all the issues you just want that guy to have ball. Oh sure the crusher average front you buy find mass money dot com no deal today he's worn out with a hockey game last night. Holly worked like eighteen hours yesterday so of course who was it as it is every day its chief. Gaelic you know I wanted to but I think you know like I got these guys sounds good but we know if you had the option not to do this you don't you're live in the Logan and the importance I was through eldest especially today outward out here but it's like to see your faces them now talk to you Linda. About four and better Adrian Peterson air want right now. Adrian Peterson yeah I I. Or just about everything. They didn't at all on a regular to the crowd could you talk Phil Graham make up our. So don't let 2000 and all with one partner so I had added I would like no not in my. And by the way we are altered your own company topic is glendening for the final five minutes of the job on wheels we've got a couple more we talk about that's OK you guys don't hold on a city and a good game now. Outlet about well I don't know what I gave acorn. The manager to sort of entity to make that case I think if you don't agree with Lou yeah you'll throw some tough questions that John Ferrell said. Falling today I was an article posted today a political talk about that performance. Out now. I feel pretty good. They asked if that I asked him joke at least on the wrong and he did and other Washington. They're all coming up next. We'll be back tomorrow I'm going to work Fenway Park tomorrow and am I. Yeah there was mad at him than originally. We're one of them don't. When Dave Dombrowski and Julia. Ultimately against an on going and going with them and doing browser and our.

By Tas Bindi | April 6, 2017 -- 01:33 GMT (18:33 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Ros Harvey, founder and CEO, The Yield (Image: Microsoft/The Yield) Australian agtech startup The Yield has announced that it has raised AU$6.5 million from lead investor Bosch, as well as from KPMG and AgFunder. The closure of the Series A funding round brings the total amount raised by the two-year-old Tasmanian startup to AU$11.5 million. The Yield's microclimate sensing system, Sensing+, uses sensors, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence -- combining its own technology with those from Microsoft, Bosch, and Intel -- to help growers make critical decisions faster. The system has been used in aquaculture to predict, for example, when oysters need to be pulled out of the water based on information such as salinity levels and temperature. If there was a storm and the oyster farmer knew contaminated water was going to flow towards the oyster farm in the coming days, then they could proactively harvest the oysters, for instance. The Yield will be using the funds to support the commercial deployment of Sensing+ in the second half of 2017. The funds will also be used for investment in sales and marketing capabilities, new product development, and entry into international markets -- particularly the US west coast. Founder and CEO of The Yield, Ros Harvey, said Australia is the "perfect breeding ground for agtech innovation" because the conditions there are "so tough". "Farmers and growers are incredible risk takers when you think about what they do. Growing something is an incredibly complex thing to do. It's not like a factory. You've got all these different variables to take into account. You're constantly making decisions about when to plant, when to irrigate, when to protect, when to feed, when to harvest," Harvey told ZDNet this year in an interview about using IoT to transform the agriculture industry in Australia. Harvey said creating reliable and accurate technology that growers can use every day is essential. "We also need to deliver these solutions at scale, which means bringing in the right strategic investors," she added. "We now have some of the world's best engineers from Bosch working on our microclimate system, we have KPMG's deep industry insights and commercial expertise, and AgFunder's global community helping us bring solutions to growers in Australia and beyond." Bosch and KMPG both admitted that the investment is strategic in that it will allow the companies to bring their solutions together and deploy them as a package. Meanwhile, The Yield is AgFunder's first global investment from its new agtech investment vehicle, which is currently being finalised. Michael Dean, AgFunder's Australian co-founder and CIO, said The Yield's strength lies in its ability to provide farmers with actionable, granular, real-time insights into the microclimates developing on their farms." "Developed and proven in harsh aquatic environments, the accuracy and reliability of The Yield's technology and simple delivery of useful data is the perfect platform for producers of all types of high-value crops such as nuts and berries," Dean said. "We are delighted to be an early stage investor in The Yield, and look forward to utilising our global network to assist with its development and expansion internationally." In March, Food Agility -- a consortium of commercial companies, universities, and farming industry bodies looking to facilitate the digital transformation of agriculture industry in Australia -- received AU$50 million as part of the Australian government's Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) program. The government funding adds to the AU$160 million in contributions -- both monetary and non-monetary -- previously raised by the organisation from partners such as KPMG, National Australia Bank, IAG, and Bosch. Moving forward, Food Agility's innovation programs will seek to deploy real-time big data market intelligence and predictive analytics to help farmers produce the right products at the right time, connect food producers with consumers in new ways, and develop a common knowledge base.

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues The good news and bad news of Apple’s Mac Pro announcement Jason Snell 6 April, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA Comments News Apple’s recent announcement that the current Mac Pro will be replaced by a new model – but not this year – is one of the most curious in recent memory. It was a defence of the Mac, a promise of things to come, an attempt to reassure professional Mac users, and an admission of failure all at once. Here’s what it is: A restatement of Apple’s support for the Mac. Three years ago, Phil Schiller sat across a table from me at Apple’s Infinite Loop campus and responded to my question about the future of the Mac by saying, “The Mac keeps going forever.” And in stories posted today based on a prior interview, Schiller said much the same thing. “The Mac has an important, long future at Apple… we have every intention to keep going and investing in the Mac,” he said. For those who doubt the esteem the Mac holds at Apple, it’s worth noting that Apple has been unwavering in its insistence that the Mac is an ongoing concern, not a product with a rapidly approaching expiration date. A remarkable admission of failure. The lack of updates on the Mac Pro made it obvious that this product was a flop, but it’s still to Apple’s credit that it came out and took its lumps. Going above and beyond the call of duty, the execs went into some detail about how the company made a bet on a unique design approach in the hopes that Pro users would come to rely on the two GPUs that the system provided. It was a mistake, perhaps predicated on a troubling lack of understanding about what Apple’s professional customers really desired in a Mac Pro. Apple executives wouldn’t specify exactly when they realised that the existing Mac Pro needed to be killed, but it must have been somewhat recently, or this entire process could have happened sooner. (And perhaps a new Mac Pro would arrive sooner than 2018.) Acceptance that the current Mac Pro isn’t going to sell. Apple very rarely announces any product (or even the existence of a product) months in advance. When it does so, it’s generally in a new category. This is because the moment a company announces that it’s replacing a product with a newer model, sales tend to fall off a cliff. (It’s called the Osborne effect.) But in the case of the Mac Pro, it’s already been so long since the machine was updated that it can’t be selling. A signal sent to professional Mac users. The Mac Pro has been sitting, unadjusted, on Apple’s price lists for years now. The company’s silence on the issue has been deafening. In the past year, speculation about the future of the model has risen to a fever pitch, with cranky Pro users beginning to brag about building custom Intel-based PCs as “hackintoshes” and running Sierra just to show how far Apple is behind the curve. It seems like Apple has twice tried to cool the ire of the market via statements by Tim Cook – one embedded in an internal memo, another expressed in public – about the company’s commitment to Pro users. But they never stuck. Cook’s statements were so vague that they could be read as negative by those who wanted to believe the worst. Tuesday’s announcement, on the other hand, couldn’t be more clear. A promise of a new Apple-branded monitor. Despite reports that an unnamed Apple executive had declared that Apple was “out of the display business” last year, Schiller confirmed on Tuesday that in addition to the new Mac Pro, Apple would release a display to go along with it. It’s possible that cosmetic and technical issues around the LG display that Apple promoted with the new MacBook Pros may have prompted this move. Perhaps there was enough negative feedback around the LG display for someone at Apple to convince the powers that be that it was in Apple’s best interest to control this product category rather than leaving it to a partner? And here’s what it isn’t: An update to the current Mac Pro. Reports from the writers who attended Apple’s private roundtable session used words like “bump” to support the changes Apple made on the current Mac Pro model today. But as Marco Arment pointed out on Twitter, this isn’t an update at all. Here’s what Schiller said: “In the meantime, we’re going to update the configs to make it faster and better for their dollar. This is not a new model, not a new design, we’re just going to update the configs. We’re doing that this week.” The two available Mac Pro configurations aren’t new, they’re just newly priced. So if you must buy a Mac Pro right now, at least it’s a better deal than it was. Not a good deal, mind you, but a better one. A solution for people who need a better professional Mac this year. As excited as we can be that the soap-opera story of the fate of the Mac Pro has been resolved, the fact is, its replacement won’t arrive until 2018 at the earliest, and we know nothing about it. If you’re a professional Mac user with a long-in-the-tooth Mac Pro or iMac and you need more power today, or next month, or this fall, Apple won’t have a new Mac Pro to sell you. Perhaps a new iMac will appeal to you – Apple suggested on Tuesday that iMac upgrades that may appeal to professional users are on the horizon – but if not, it’s going to be a long wait. A commitment to update the new Mac Pro in a timely fashion. Schiller suggested that the new Mac Pro will be more capable of receiving hardware updates, but on what schedule? It seems that Apple’s most high-end users want the company to track hardware updates as closely as possible with new chip releases from Intel. When this new Mac Pro debuts in 2018, will the company take that approach? Or will it do as it has done on most of its other computers lately, and lag behind Intel’s processor releases by months? In the end, Tuesday’s announcement allows Apple to stop the bleeding of a self-inflicted wound. It should probably have come to this conclusion a lot sooner, but whether it was an inability for those who green-lit the Mac Pro to see that they had made a mistake or a simple lack of focus on this particular market segment, the product languished far too long and became an embarrassment. At least now the deed is done. The “trash can” Mac is bound for the garbage dump itself. In the long run, it’s good news for Apple’s professional users. But in the short run, it doesn’t change Apple’s lack of competitiveness compared to other Intel PCs. At least now high-end pros can know that if they’re waiting for a solution from Apple in the next few months, they’re probably out of luck.

In fact earlier this year a report from Apple insider Mark Gurman at Bloomberg hinted that ARM-based MacBook Pros could be launched this year, although it seems that this chipset won’t be replacing Intel’s chipset, but rather exist alongside it. Whether or not that is true remains to be seen, but according to reports, Apple has no plans for pure ARM-based MacBooks. However the report goes to add that Apple did not rule out the possibility that ARM processors could be used as companion processors, which is more or less in line with what the report from Bloomberg had suggested, although Apple stopped short of confirming whether or not that is true. Apple also reiterated that there are no plans for touchscreen Mac computers. Following the launch of hybrid devices like the Surface Pro, many had wondered if Apple could follow suit. However the company has previously explained why this would never happen, with some Apple execs even calling the idea “absurd”, so definitely do not get your hopes up for a touchscreen Mac anytime soon. In the meantime Apple has also announced their plans to “rethink” the Mac Pro, but that we probably shouldn’t expect to see anything anytime soon. Filed in Apple >Computers.

By John Amato Share Share on facebook Share Share on twitter Share Share on reddit Share Share on sharethis 4/06/17 8:56am 15 hours ago by John Amato up Click here for reuse options! After the news broke that Chairman Devin Nunes has "removed himself" from the Russian investigations on the House Intelligence Committee, Fox News hosts and personalities went into overdrive defending the chairman from any criticism. Immediately co-host of America's Newsroom Shannon Bream had this excuse at her fingertips. "He references charges by quote 'left-wing groups' that he says has come after him. He talks about them being filed with the House Ethics office, and again we want to note that you and I can go down to the office today to file those." "It's not something that's been instigated by another member or any type of congressional investigation," Bream said. "It's gonna take time and it's a distraction so he's going to step aside." Shannon Bream never mentioned why any ethics charge had been filed against Rep. Nunes or any of his blatant pro-Trump actions which have paralyzed and destroyed the integrity of the House Intelligence Committee. Even Republicans called Nunes out for destroying the committee's integrity. Later in the broadcast, Matt Schlapp picked up the slack by attacking Nancy Pelosi for establishing an Office of Congressional Ethics. Republicans under Trump tried to get rid of it, but were heavily criticized and didn't follow through. 15 hours ago by John Amato up Schlapp claimed the office, "Has been used so many times for simply partisan political reasons," but offered no proof of this. "You can see, "anybody can bring any charge to the Office of Congressional Ethics and now it looks like the Ethics committee is going to pick up and look at this as well. "Matt said. Schlapp continued, "This is why ethics in congress gets so polluted...[Nunes should] step away, get this cleared up and don't do anything to derail the investigation." Chairman Nunes has already destroyed the Intel Committee with his actions and that's why he had to step aside, Matt. Judge Napolitano also came on air soon afterwards and also blasted the Office of Congressional Ethics. I expect the "anybody can file an ethics charge" to be the song-of-the-day on Fox, like their imaginary and consciously distracting "Susan Rice Probe" was yesterday. ↓ Story continues below ↓ So long as we aren't talking about Trump and the Russians, they're fulfilling their mission.

Even if it doesn’t quite rival the messy relationships in a daytime soap opera, autonomous vehicle partnerships are definitely part of a tangled web. The Daimler – Bosch deal announced earlier this week, however, has brought some clarity. Daimler and Bosch said Tuesday (April 4) that they’re partnering to accelerate the production of "robo-taxis.” The real significance of the news, however, is that all three -- Daimler, Mercedes Benz (owned by Daimler) and Tier One Robert Bosch -- have chosen Nvidia as their autonomous driving platform partner. Mobileye vs. Nvidia In fact, when it comes to the platform battle over Level 4 and Level 5 cars, the automotive industry today is split in two: you are either with Mobileye (soon to be part of Intel), or with Nvidia. And Nvidia has clearly shown it is gaining momentum. Asked about the Damiler-Bosch announcement, Phil Magney, founder & principal advisor at Vision Systems Intelligence, told us that Daimler must be “encouraged with Nvidia’s roadmap for both AI and solutions for highly automated driving.” Notably, Mercedes announced a plan to develop AI-based self-driving capabilities with Nvidia even before the Daimler-Bosch partnerhips happened, he explained. Relationship Map among chip vendors, tech companies, Tier Ones and car OEMs (Source: EE Times) Click here for larger image On the other hand, an opposing camp built around the BMW/Intel/Mobileye alliance was announced last summer. Last month Intel announced the acquisition of Mobileye. Separately, Intel and Mobileye last year picked up Tier One Delphi as their partner. Especially in recent months, among high-profile autonomous car development announcements with prestigious German car manufacturers, Nvidia is stealing Mobileye’s thunder. But look closely, said Egil Juliussen, director research, infotainment & ADAS at IHS Automotive. Mobileye might be “way ahead of Nvidia,” when considering the number of OEMs and Tier Ones already deeply aligned with NVidia.

Home AP Article Pres. Trump address nation following U.S. strikes against Syria Posted: Thu 9:48 PM, Apr 06, 2017  |  Updated: Thu 11:14 PM, Apr 06, 2017 WASHINGTON (AP/CBS NEWS) - President Donald Trump is calling on "all civilized nations" to join the U.S. in seeking an end to the carnage in Syria. Trump gave a brief statement Thursday shortly after the U.S. fired a barrage of cruise missiles into Syria in retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians, which left more than 80 civilians dead. Residents and doctors say many of those who fled have yet to return, fearful of lingering fumes or another attack. The dead are buried in trenches. The order to launch the cruise missiles into Syria was the President's first military action. The target: the Syrian government airbase where the warplanes that carried out the chemical attacks were based. Syrian state TV reported the U.S. missile attack on a Syrian air base "leads to losses." Trump said "peace and harmony will prevail" so long as the U.S. continues to stand for justice. He addressed the nation from his Mir-A-Lago resort estate, where he is hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping this weekend. On Thursday, Trump hosted a dinner for Xi and his wife before the strikes occurred. The President and his Chinese counterpart will spend Friday discussing security, trade and North Korea. Tensions in that region are heightened because North Korea has recently fired missiles into the Sea of Japan. Sen. Marco Rubio, (R) Florida reacted to the strike: "the targeting of a specific airfield from which these attacks were launched ... was the right move." Some 60 cruise missiles launched from two U.S. carriers in the eastern Mediterranean. Cruise missiles are unmanned aircraft. They carry a 1,000 pound warhead and fly close to the ground -- below enemy air defense -- guided to their targets by GPS Satellites. Earlier, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Bashar Al-Assad's future in Syria is uncertain. He also issued a warning to Russia: "It is very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime." Russia told the U.N. Security Council there could be negative consequences if Washington took military action. House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes also announced that he is stepping aside from the Russia Probe in a move that will have major implications on the investigation into potential Russia ties with the Trump campaign. Late Thursday night, Secretary of State Tillerson said, "Russia has `failed to deliver' on preventing chemical weapons attacks in Syria." Republican Sen. Rubio's released the following statement: " I salute the bravery and skill of the men and women of our Armed Forces who conducted this mission. [Thursday's] strike against the Assad regimes Shayrat Air Base will hopefully diminish his capacity to commit atrocities against innocent civilians. By acting decisively against the very facility from which Assad launched his murderous chemical weapons attack, President Trump has made it clear to Assad and those who empower him that the days of committing war crimes with impunity are over. What must follow is a real and comprehensive strategy to ensure that Assad is no longer a threat to his people and to U.S. security, and that Russia no longer has free reign to support his regime."

More Project Scorpio coverage Inside the next Xbox: Project Scorpio tech revealed Analysis: Scorpio is console hardware pushed to a new level Why Microsoft is making Project Scorpio: Mike Ybarra speaks Scorpio made simple: the next Xbox’s tech explained Everything should run just fine, but more than that, the full power of the Scorpio Engine will be brought to bear on enhancing your existing games. According to the Xbox hardware team, your existing library of games should run smoother, look better and load faster. It’s a considerable technical achievement because, while the new console is built from the ground up to run all content, certain design decisions were made during the machine’s gestation period that make this task a whole lot harder than it might have been. Put simply – there’s an easier way, exemplified by PlayStation 4 Pro’s technical make-up, and then there’s the more challenging approach – the Scorpio way. “In designing for compatibility, there are two choices that we can take from a performance perspective,” Microsoft’s Andrew Goossen, Technical Fellow, Graphics tells us. “One of which is to design hardware to emulate the performance capabilities of the original [console] as much as possible, or the other one is to say, we’re just going to turn on all the performance and we’re going to deal with all the issues.” What Goossen described as the ’emulation’ approach is seen in PS4 Pro’s design. Sony’s latest console uses a ‘butterfly’ approach to GPU design, effectively mirroring the base unit’s GPU with an extra rank of 18 compute units, doubling power (more so once extra frequency is added). With this approach, Sony can ensure complete compatibility simply by turning off the additional, new ‘half’ of the graphics core. It’s an elegant solution, but what’s clear is that the newly introduced boost mode doesn’t deliver the Pro’s full power to existing base PS4 titles. Microsoft has taken the harder route – and it has done so by necessity. It doesn’t have the option of doubling up on its existing design, as Scorpio is a radical architectural overhaul. Here, it’s down to the platform holder to take ownership of compatibility issues, but the advantage is this: unlike PS4’s boost mode, Scorpio theoretically allows for the full power of the new console to be deployed on older games. In fact, there are five different ways in which Scorpio aims to improve the experience for owners of existing Xbox One games – and these should also apply to Xbox 360 back-compat titles. 1. Smoother performance and no screen-tearing “We bring to bear all 40 compute units and the full 1172MHz clock-speed [of the Scorpio GPU], we’re bringing those to bear on all the games possible,” says Andrew Goossen. “Now, I have a caveat a bit later about all the compatibility testing we do for these and some of the implications, but we can bring all the 40CUs, all 1172MHz, of course the full 2.3GHz on the CPU.” What this means in practice is that games that cannot fully sustain their target frame-rate on Xbox One stand a really good chance of doing so on Scorpio. But to be clear: what we won’t see will be 30fps games suddenly running at 60fps. The game itself still sets its frame-rate target, and there are no functions for removing performance limits. However, the full six teraflops of graphics power will be deployed to run your existing library of Xbox content. In fact, there’s so much raw power here that Microsoft can go one step further. Says Goossen: “We’ve taken the approach that we do with 360 [games] on Xbox One, where you will never see a torn frame, because we have enough performance there to ensure that.” 2. Maximum possible resolution on dynamic titles A popular technique in games development is to adapt dynamic resolution scaling. The idea here is straightforward: when a game is in danger of losing its lock on its performance target, be it 30fps or 60fps, the title scales down the image, running it at a lower resolution in order to maintain a smoother frame-rate. There are many games out there that support dynamic scaling – Doom 2016, Halo 5, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and The Division, for example. “With the additional performance of the Scorpio Engine, we expect to see those titles hit the maximum render resolution that those titles support,” says Goossen. “As you know, we can’t boost it to 4K, but definitely the maximum resolution the game supports, we should be able to run it.” We’re looking forward to testing one particular title: CD Projekt RED’s The Witcher 3. The developer states it supports dynamic resolution scaling, but we’ve yet to see it break the 900p barrier. Given Scorpio’s 4.6x improvement in performance, surely if the tech is in there, we should hit native 1080p – and iron out the performance wobbles at the same time. 3. Improved texture filtering Resolution is an important, defining aspect of image quality but it is not the only one. Texture filtering is hugely important – and it’s actually an element where both PS4 and Xbox One have let us down a little compared to the same titles running on PC, where the full force of 16x anisotropic filtering can make a big difference. “We built into the hardware the capability of overwriting all bilinear and all trilinear fetches to be anisotropic,” Andrew Goossen reveals. “And then we’ve dialled up the anisotropic all the way up to max. All of our titles by default when you’re running on Scorpio, they’ll be full anisotropic.” Good quality texture filtering will make a big difference to a large number of Xbox One titles, where typically 4x anisotropic tends to be the balancing point chosen by developers. The leap to 16x, enforced at a system level by the back-compat engine, is a huge boon, especially in concert with the complete lack of screen-tear and smoother overall performance. More good news: this new feature extends to Xbox 360 games too. 4. Scorpio GameDVR support Microsoft’s plans for GameDVR on Scorpio are impressive – the hardware team is leveraging the new console’s next-gen media block to provide 4K60 video capture with no performance hit, utilising the highly efficient HEVC codec for pristine visual quality. GameDVR works for back-compat titles too, which has some key benefits. “Even though a lot of this content will be 1080p, we’ll have the benefit of HEVC, the ultra high bit-rate, so we’ll be able to do those retroactive screen captures at a really high quality.” Retroactive screen captures are a new featuring coming to the Scorpio GameDVR – users will have the ability to scan through their captures with ‘to-the-frame’ precision, allowing them to extract the precise screenshot they want. You won’t be able to capture at 4K – there’s no point for 1080p content – but our take on this is that Microsoft will be able to use the same level of video encoding bandwidth on 1080p video, meaning better quality. 5. Faster loading In a world where a Battlefield 1 campaign level can take anything up to two minutes to load, this one is especially welcome. “We’re able to say that game loads will be fundamentally faster,” Goossen reveals. “There are three ways we say that – one of which is the CPU boost. The 31 per cent CPU boost in terms of clock will help games that are CPU-bound in terms of their IO.” Assets streamed from a hard drive often arrive in a compressed state, requiring the CPU to decompress them. Extra frequency on the CPU cores can make a difference here – sometimes a dramatic one. Case in point: the Division on PC can actually max out all six cores and 12 threads on an overclocked Intel Core i7 3930K, just through loading content. “The second one is that we’ve that we’ve improved the hard disk speed,” Goossen adds. “We’re actually promising developers a 50 per cent improvement in overall bandwidth for the purposes of driving 4K textures, but this also helps us in this situation where you’re running existing Xbox One and Xbox 360 titles. They will also benefit from the faster hard disk.” This is an example of how another spec boost in the Scorpio arsenal means good things for other areas in the system – a factor that also comes into play on the third and final way in which Scorpio will improve back-compat loading times. The new console gives developers eight gigs of RAM to play with, but existing Xbox One titles were only built to utilise 5GB – something the hardware team use to their advantage. “If Xbox One games take five gigs, we have three gigs left over. We do a file system cache on that. Any repeated IOs… if you go into a race and come out or if you go into a fight and come out, we’ve got a nice boost right there for load times as well.” Is there a catch? If it all sounds too good to be true, there is one minor drawback. Some of the enhancements may cause compatibility issues on a very small percentage of titles, meaning that certain improvements listed above may not apply to all games. It’s similar to the way that boost mode on PS4 Pro has great compatibility overall but has issues on a small minority of the library. The difference is that in this case, Microsoft is ensuring that all titles work, and this means that some of the five benefits above may need to be dialled back. The onus is on the platform holder to ensure that everything ‘just works’. A brief history of Fallout War. War changes quite a lot. “We’re going to be the ones that ensure that your games run as fast as they can in terms of all those five different features, the best that they possibly can,” Andrew Goossen explains. “There will be some cases where we have to dial down some of those attributes… in some games we potentially have to dial down the number of CUs, for example, to maintain compatibility with that title. But again these are all things that Microsoft does, we’ve always done, that’s true of all 360 titles on Xbox One. We just make sure it runs the best it possibly can on Scorpio and we’re very excited that Scorpio really will be the best place to run all your Xbox content.” What’s clear from our Scorpio back-compat briefing is that Microsoft is taking this aspect of the system very seriously – and rightly so. The notion of PC-like portability for your entire games library is a highly compelling prospect – something we also hope Sony takes on board as it inevitably moves onto PlayStation 5 development. It’s perhaps another sign of further convergence between console and PC, in that you get an out-of-the-box improvement when upgrading to a new piece of kit – though frame-rate and resolution caps limit the scalability in comparison. Several times during our day at the Microsoft campus, the same point came up. The team is aiming to deliver, as Mike Ybarra phrases it, “the world’s most powerful console, delivering the best versions of the games”. It’s a statement presumably intended to cover the latest and the greatest multi-platform titles, but if that sentiment applies to the existing Xbox game library too, all the way back to Xbox 360, then that’s absolutely fine with us. We learned about Project Scorpio’s backwards compatibility features at an exclusive briefing at Xbox HQ. Microsoft paid for travel and accommodation.

Photo: CFP Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and supplier Robert Bosch are teaming up to develop self-driving cars in an alliance aimed at accelerating the production of "robo-taxis." The pact between the world's largest maker of premium cars and the world's largest automotive supplier forms a powerful counterweight to new auto industry players like ride-hailing firms Uber and Didi, which are also working on self-driving cars. Technology companies and carmakers are striving to adjust to a shifting landscape in the auto industry as consumers increasingly use smartphones to locate, hail and rent vehicles, rather than going out and buying cars. The alliance not only marks an end to Daimler's efforts to develop an autonomous car largely on its own, but moves the auto industry's ambitions beyond simply developing prototype vehicles toward industrial-scale production of self-driving cars. Financial terms were not disclosed about the deal between the two German companies, which was announced on Tuesday. Bosch - which was founded in 1886, the same year that Mercedes founder Carl Benz patented the motorcar - will develop software and algorithms needed for autonomous driving together with the carmaker. Bosch said Mercedes would be able to use the jointly developed system for two years before it could be offered to competitors. The deal will help the automotive supplier make up ground in a competitive autonomous driving system sector where rivals Continental, Delphi, ZF and others have also made heavy investments. For Daimler and its Mercedes division, teaming up with Bosch helps them throw more engineering resources at autonomous cars, allowing them to speed up the process of creating a production-ready system for autonomous cars by several years. The autonomous system will now be ready by the beginning of next decade, ­Daimler said, without disclosing when it had first envisaged the commercial launch of automated taxis, or robo-taxis. "The prime objective of the project is to achieve the production-ready development of a driving system which will allow cars to drive fully autonomously in the city," Daimler said in a statement on Tuesday. The company will continue to build and sell vehicles that can be manually operated by individual drivers. Car comes to driver The market for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles is expected to grow from about $3 billion in 2015 to $96 billion in 2025 and $290 billion in 2035, Goldman Sachs said in 2016. Daimler is focusing its efforts on the app-based car-sharing and ride-hailing sector dominated by China's Didi, and US-based Uber and Lyft. Like autonomous cars, this market is a big global growth area and is expected to expand by 28 percent a year to 2030, according to consultancy McKinsey. "Within a specified area of town, customers will be able to order an automated shared car via their smartphone. The vehicle will then make its way autonomously to the user," Daimler said. "The idea behind it is that the vehicle should come to the driver rather than the other way round." The cutthroat competition to launch self-driven cars has forced carmakers to shift strategy from an evolutionary toward a revolutionary approach. Instead of evolving driver assistance systems to achieve full autonomy, carmakers are now experimenting with radical car designs combined with software-driven development - which has led to alliances with technology companies. Mercedes-Benz's arch rival BMW teamed up with Israeli autonomous vehicle tech company Mobileye and chip maker Intel in 2016 to develop new technology that could put autonomous cars on the road by 2021. Intel has since agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.3 billion, a deal which followed Qualcomm's $47 billion move to acquire Dutch automotive chip supplier NXP. Before deciding to partner with Bosch, Mercedes-Benz had two engineering teams, totaling about 500 people, working on autonomous vehicles. One took an evolutionary approach, upgrading the capabilities of conventional vehicles, while the other team took a more radical approach to the car's design. Bosch and Mercedes did not disclose how many additional engineers they would assign to the teams in Stuttgart and Silicon Valley. | PRINT | RSS Add Comment SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

Peter Bright - Apr 6, 2017 10:20 pm UTC reader comments 57 Share this story Microsoft has finally revealed most of the hardware going into its Project Scorpio console. Digital Foundry was shown the hardware exclusively and has come away broadly impressed. While there are still some questions—what exactly are those processor cores?—we have a pretty solid idea of what will make the machine go and what it'll be capable of. But as of press time, it's missing one of the things we expected. When Scorpio was first announced at E3 last year, Microsoft didn't just rattle off a list of specs—the 8-core CPU, 6 TFLOPS of GPU compute power and 320GB of memory bandwidth that were confirmed today. Xbox division chief Phil Spencer also made a bold proclamation at the time: "The next-step change for gamers and developers must deliver true 4K gaming and high-fidelity VR." VR, you say? Microsoft was never entirely clear about what those VR capabilities would be. The company has, or at least had, some kind of working relationship with Oculus—and Facebook's VR headset shipped with Xbox controllers—but since Scorpio's initial reveal, Microsoft has launched its own VR initiative that'll use a new range of headsets made by companies including Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Acer. These headsets won't use the Oculus APIs, nor will they use Valve's SteamVR, as used on the HTC Vive. Instead, they'll use Microsoft's own developer framework. With today's hardware specs, the 4K issue has been examined in relative depth. A Forza Motorsport demo was privately shown running at a solid 60 frames per second at 4K, so yes, the Scorpio hardware can definitely do 4K gaming. But when it comes to VR, and its own set of high-octane hardware demands, nothing appears to have been said. Does Microsoft still intend to make Scorpio a VR machine? Take a look at the ports At first glance, Scorpio looks like a fine VR system, with plenty of CPU and GPU power, but it's also been designed with the exact same back-of-the-box series of ports and plugs as the Xbox One S. The Scorpio team says will make it easier for Xbox One S owners to swap the new system into entertainment centers, which sounds nice enough. But that means the new console will only ship with one HDMI output, one that will surely be connected to your TV on a near-permanent basis, creating an obvious problem: there's nowhere to plug in a VR headset. To be fair, the PlayStation 4 has the same issue—only a single HDMI output on the console—but Sony's PlayStation VR system has a separate breakout box, the PlayStation VR Processing Unit, that includes one HDMI output for the TV and another for the headset. The box also includes some audio and video processing; it includes hardware for positional audio, is responsible for driving the TV display when playing a VR game, and handles projecting regular TV games onto a virtual screen for PlayStation VR's "cinematic mode." But this solution has a number of downsides. An extra box, with an extra power supply and processor, causes extra expense and complexity during system setup. Sony's particular implementation is also problematic; although the PlayStation 4 itself can process and display high dynamic range (HDR) content, the Processing Unit cannot pass it through. If you want HDR passthrough to work, you'll have to connect the PlayStation 4 directly to your TV. Moreover, Project Scorpio looks like it will be powerful enough to handle the same workload as Sony's Processing Unit. No need for an extra processor. One could imagine an even simpler box that did little more than split Scorpio's output into a VR output and a TV output, but it's still an extra expense and complexity. Scorpio does retain the HDMI input that Xbox One S sports, for connections to cable boxes or other devices. In principle, this port could serve dual purpose and be used for an output as well as an input. This doesn't exactly solve the problem, since people using the input as an input will still suffer the same shortage of ports, but it would make it a lot less apparent to most Scorpio users. We also can't completely rule out that the final production hardware will include an extra, possibly front-mounted HDMI port for headsets that Digital Foundry either wasn't shown or wasn't allowed to talk about. Maybe Xbox just isn't that into VR? Whatever the situation, for a machine that was introduced as being built for, among other things, VR, the apparent lack of something so simple as a second HDMI output feels like a peculiar omission. Having a second port is arguably the most user-friendly approach to the need to connect both a headset and a TV, and putting that port in the console itself is the cheapest place to do it; no extra breakout boxes, no proprietary splitters, just using the support for multiple outputs that the GPU itself surely already has. It's a peculiar omission unless, of course, Microsoft just isn't that interested in VR. If the company believes that VR is never going to be widespread over Scorpio's lifetime, and that for the majority of users the second output would simply be a waste of money, perhaps it was felt better to not include one. That still seems odd on a machine that's aiming to be so high-end, but one could understand the logic. Problem is, Microsoft clearly is interested in VR. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which has its mainstream release next week, includes significant developer support for what Microsoft is now calling "Mixed Reality." It has APIs for developing 3D applications for use with both HoloLens and a new range of VR headsets that'll start at just $299. Enable Developer Mode in the new Windows 10 edition and there's even a 3D shell designed for use with headsets. Those headsets are, for now, going to be sold as developer kits. The next major Windows 10 update, due in about six months, will open the mixed reality interface and APIs up to consumers, with headsets being sold at retail. That update will also slash the hardware requirements; the Creators Update requires a discrete GPU comparable to the ones required by the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, but that GPU requirement will allegedly drop to include the integrated GPUs on recent Intel processors. A $300 headset and a $500 PC will be able to run VR software built for this platform. These headsets will use HDMI or DisplayPort and USB 3. Some will have pass-through cameras; others won't. All will support Microsoft's inside-out, six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) tracking, which allows software to know exactly how the headset is oriented and moving without requiring base stations mounted on walls or anything like that. There are some important gaps in the Microsoft mixed reality world—for example, right now there aren't frameworks for 3D 6DoF input devices—but these gaps will not be permanent. Mixed reality apps on Windows 10 will be built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform (UWP), and Scorpio will be able to run UWP apps. Extending that VR headset support to Scorpio is logical and obvious, and we can't believe that Microsoft will want to cede the VR space to Sony—which just makes the lack of mention of VR, and the lack of any obvious way of connecting a headset to the Scorpio, something of a surprise. Of course, plenty is still unknown (name, design, cost, release date), and Microsoft will be sure to drip-feed details before Scorpio eventually launches. But the hardware analysts at Digital Foundry who got their hands on today's reveal have spent a lot of time analyzing the wide world of VR performance. It's telling that they didn't get to answer those this week. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

EDT Q    Can you go over the schedule? MR. SPICER:  Yeah, let me walk you guys through it.  So, obviously, just to recap, I think we had a great visit yesterday with King Abdullah and the Queen.  Obviously, one quick note for this morning -- I think we put it out yesterday -- but the President ordered flags flown at half-mast today in recognition of Senator John Glenn of Ohio. This morning, as many of you saw, the President continued a bipartisan tradition that started out of President Bush welcoming the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride to the White House, and I think it was a really cool event.  Ironically, as much as the weather dampened our ability to have it outside, I think spirits were high inside.  We had 50 folks up there.  A great way to start the day.   Obviously, right now, we're in flight to Mar-a-Lago.  Quickly, to Steve's point, let me walk you through the schedule.  I don’t know how much you saw on TV, but the President of China, President Xi, arrived a few minutes ago.  He was greeted by Secretary Tillerson at the airport.  He will be, obviously, heading for the airport to where he'll be staying.  I've been asked a couple times, so I just want to get it out in front.  No one from the Chinese delegation is staying at Mar-a-Lago.  They were invited, but it was a room-size issue in terms of the size of their delegation, so they're staying just down the road.  But the invitation was extended to them.  The delegation will arrive at Mar-a-Lago at 5:00 p.m.  They will be greeted by the President and the First Lady.  Following the welcome, the group will share some private time ahead of their dinner at 6:30 p.m. in the formal dining room.  There will be a pool spray at the top of the dinner. Tomorrow will be mostly spent in meetings.  The First Lady and Madame Peng will also visit a local school.  There will be a working lunch.  And then the Chinese delegation -- (Interruption due to turbulence.) There will be a working lunch.  The President's weekly address will be released tomorrow, focusing on the President's pledge to reverse decades of dangerous open-border policies that have left the country open, unsafe.  As you may have noted this week, U.S. Customs and Border Protection released a report on the decline of individuals that have been apprehended at the southwest border.  I mentioned this the other day, but we had some really good numbers -- declining 35 percent in March, from February of 2017, and down 61 percent from January 2017, and a 64 percent decrease from March 2017.  All this will be mentioned in the brief tomorrow -- or in the weekly address. The Vice President's office announced that the Vice President will travel to the Republic of Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Australia and Hawaii from April 15th to the 25th.  This will serve as the Vice President's first official travel to the Asia Pacific region.  The Vice President will emphasize the President's continued commitment to U.S. alliance and partnerships in the Asia Pacific region, highlighting the administration's economic trade agenda, and underscoring America's unwavering support for our troops here and abroad. Next week, I mentioned previously the President will host the Secretary General of NATO on Wednesday.  We'll have a press event at that. With that, I'll take a few questions before we buckle back. Q    Sean, following up on Syria yesterday, there's a lot of people who see a contradiction between the sympathy expressed for the victims of the gas attack and the policy of basically not allowing, for humanitarian reasons, these sort of people to come into the United States now.   MR. SPICER:  I'm sorry, what are you -- Q    Syria.   MR. SPICER:  Right.  I think one of the things that you've seen the President talk to several of the folks in the region about is the setting up of safe zones and supporting them -- something that he's talked to several of the leaders in the region about.  And I think we got to make sure, number one, while obviously our hearts break for the people of Syria who were innocently attacked the other day, especially these young children who we watched, we've got to make sure that we're always doing what we can to protect our nation.  But that doesn’t mean that we can't support efforts like safe zones through Syria; that we'll make sure that we do what we can for their people. Q    But there’s no contradiction about not allowing people like this to come to the U.S. -- MR. SPICER:  Every country’s number-one priority is to its own people and the protection of them.  We've got to do what we can to make sure that as we seek to root out ISIS and terrorism throughout the country -- throughout the world, rather, that we don't, at the same time, do things that would bring those same threats to our country. So we can do what we can to provide humanitarian relief, to support the building and maintenance of safe zones throughout, and that's something that the President I think has found a lot of common ground with other heads of state, especially in the region.   Q    Sean, what will the President’s response be if President Xi urges more action on climate change and asking the U.S. to fulfill its commitments and go further on it? MR. SPICER:  I think it's a great question.  I think we'll have an opportunity to talk to you guys at some point tomorrow, and I think we can get through what was discussed on the agenda.  But I'm not going to get ahead of the leaders discussing issues, whether it's that or economic stuff or North Korea.  There’s going to be a very robust discussion on a lot of these issues, and to start to hypothetically guess what we're going to say if someone brings up something ahead of the talks is not a place that I want to -- Q    And on the second question.  You mentioned the border security issue.  Yesterday, Secretary Kelly said that it would not be a contiguous border, it would not be a physical border throughout, it would be a combination -- MR. SPICER:  I don't think he said it wasn’t going to be a physical border.  I think there’s a question of whether there will be some fencing and some other stuff. Q    He said in response to a question from Senator McCain, would you consider all these other things, including electronic surveillance on the border, and he said, yes, I would, and that's a good definition.  MR. SPICER:  I will let Secretary Kelly be the expert on that. Q    But is that a backing-down of the President's commitment on a physical wall? Q    No, I think -- no, because, again, I think it's a physical barrier.  I think he’s informed the President of what’s feasible throughout the extent of our southern border.  And the President’s number-one goal is to do what we can to deter illegal immigration and keep our country safe.  That's the primary focus. Jim. Q    Chairman Nunes decide to step aside, at least in the House Intel investigation on Russia.  Does the White House believe that it could have handled things better in terms of the invitation for him a couple weeks ago?  Now you have the second administration official, starting with Jeff Sessions recusing himself, Chairman Nunes recusing himself.  Does the White House believe that it could have handled this better?  And how did you find out about Chairman Nunes’s decision? MR. SPICER:  I found out about it by watching Fox News.  It was on the television.  So -- but I don't know -- Q    Did he notify the White House, though? Q    I'm told he alerted the White House.   MR. SPICER:  I saw it live.  But I don't know how -- in terms of us handling with respect to Chairman Nunes, as you know, Jeff, he was the one who requested to come see some things and then said he wanted an appointment with the President.  We were informed of his desire to talk to the President through media reports; he held a press conference and announced it.  So I'm not sure what -- our job is not to -- Q    But he was invited to the White House the day before that. MR. SPICER:  He was no invited to the White House the day -- Q    (Inaudible.) MR. SPICER:  I know, but with respect, you're making -- stating a fact that isn't true.  He wasn’t invited.  And not that he wouldn't be; he’s more than welcome to come, as is any member of Congress.  But by his own statement, he requested to come to look at something.  So we have continued to say that we want the House and the Senate to look into it, and we continue to support that effort in both chambers. Q    If I could follow, going forward, will this change how anyone in the administration from the National Security Council and anyone talks to or deals with matters involving the Russia investigation? MR. SPICER:  I don't know that there’s been any change in how we -- no.  I mean, I'm not aware of anything that we've done that would change how we handle requests for information.  But the answer to the question is, there’s been no change in our policy. Q    Sean, have you been asked about Steve Bannon yet? MR. SPICER:  Have I been asked about him? Q    Do you have full confidence in him?  Does he still have a seat at the table?  Do you want to talk about him a little bit? MR. SPICER:  I mean, tell me what the question is and I'll answer it. Q    Well, does his removal from the NSC show that you're getting more of the professional people, less of the political people involved in national security? MR. SPICER:  The President respects Chairman McMaster’s willingness to form the National Security Council in the way he did.  It's something that we said when we announced Chairman McMaster back at Mar-a-Lago, ironically.  We had talked about the fact that he would have full authority to oversee the National Security Council in terms of personnel and structure, and he has.  Q    Are you saying that it was his decision to ask Bannon to leave then? MR. SPICER:  Well, obviously, he’s the National Security Advisor, he runs all of these major decisions in restructuring by the President.  But at the end of the day, he is the National Security Advisor. Q    Just on logistics for the next two days, should we expect to hear from the President and President Xi at all? MR. SPICER:  Well, I know that there will be pool sprays.  I think, as you know, I wouldn't rule anything out.  We're not -- there’s nothing beyond that on the thing, and I think we may have some folks come by the filing center and such. Q    One last thing.  Does the President plan to raise human rights with the Chinese President? MR. SPICER:  Julie, I'd go back to what Noah said.  I don't -- we will have a readout of what they discussed after they discuss it.  But I don't want to get ahead of what they’re going to discuss or not discuss until they’ve had a chance to meet. Q    But does he feel like it's important, as the American President, to raise human rights? MR. SPICER:  (Inaudible) human rights, trade.  There’s a lot of areas of both economic and national security, human rights being one of them.  There’s things that we will discuss in private.  And we will have a readout of those discussions. Q    What about climate change?  Is that an issue?  Oh, asked already?  Sorry. MR. SPICER:  Again, I mentioned this to -- Noah brought that up.  Once we have an update on what they discussed we’ll make sure that we read it out, but I’m not going to -- part of this opportunity is for them to develop a relationship and start the discussion on some key issues. But there’s a lot of folks that are traveling down and having discussions as well.  Secretary Ross is on the plane, Secretary Mnuchin.  Secretary Tillerson, as I’ve mentioned, is already down there.  Secretary Mattis is coming down.  So there’s going to be a lot of opportunity for our folks to interact.  And again, I probably left some -- Gary Cohn is on the plane, General McMaster.  There’s going to be a lot of interaction that occurs during this bilateral with our senior officials and their counterparts. Q    Is Steve Bannon on the plane? MR. SPICER:  He is. Q    Can you give us a sense of -- we wanted to square in Judge Gorsuch. MR. SPICER:  We’ll have an update.  I would imagine there’s some -- I don’t want to get ahead of this but I know we are looking at dates for next week.   Q    But you wouldn’t fly back to Washington, or you wouldn’t have the judge down here for a swearing-in? MR. SPICER:  No.  The earliest that it would be would be Monday.  There are some -- we’re looking at some times.  There’s some other logistical things that we’re just trying to figure out, whether it would be Monday.  It could potentially be Tuesday.  I know Wednesday we’ve got the NATO Secretary General.  But once we lock in that, we’ll have something out.  But it would not be over the weekend, no. Q    The President said that he was flexible in his thinking maybe evolving on Syria.  Can you give us a lens into where that is and kind of what he’s doing behind the scenes? MR. SPICER:  The President has held several discussions with his national security team regarding the situation in Syria.  Obviously he is being presented with a lot of options.  But I would go back and echo the comments the President made yesterday in the Rose Garden where he is not one to telegraph those decisions or options until he’s ready to make them, and that’s where I think he continues to bring that sense of being a shrewd negotiator to the table and not revealing his hand until it’s time. Q    And what’s the timeline on the healthcare bill, renewing that or deciding whether to abandon a second attempt? MR. SPICER:  Well, first of all, I would just -- with respect to -- it’s not a second attempt.  It’s been an ongoing discussion.  You saw Chief of Staff Priebus and the Vice President were up on the Hill last night.  We’ve had a continuation of discussions over the last several days, and I think they’ve been very productive. You saw I think Freedom Caucus Chair Meadows made some comments earlier today that they’ve seen some very constructive proposals and ideas put forward.  I think the amendment that Speaker Ryan was talking about putting forward to the rules committee is something that shows tremendous progress by the team.  And look, honestly, as soon as we get to 216, we’ll let you know. Q    Sean, did the White House ask for the House to go forward with the vote that they’re planning this week?  Was that driven by the White House?   MR. SPICER:  (Inaudible) that, as I mentioned, Chief of Staff Priebus and the Vice President and some others were up on the Hill last night working with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy, Greg Walden, Kevin Brady, and others.  I think the idea is that we feel very good about where the discussions are going and some of the language that is being updated, moving this in a very positive direction towards getting that 216.  Q    Does the President maintain full confidence in Speaker Ryan and his abilities to get this done? MR. SPICER:  Yes.  Thank you, guys.   END   2:47 P.M.

James Mattis, to continue fostering relationships with tech innovators as part of his drive to create a “force of the future.” Looking back at his nearly two-year tenure as defense secretary and a 35-year career in national security, Carter urged the new administration to continue making inroads with the Silicon Valley and other tech hubs across the country. “We set out to build and to rebuild bridges between the Pentagon and America’s technology community,” Carter said Tuesday during his keynote address before the Atlantic Council. “The bridges between tech-driven change and public purpose need to be repaired and restored in fields well beyond defense. These bridges don’t maintain themselves.” Before assuming his new role as the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government, Carter touted the success of programs he’d like to see further developed by the new administration, such as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx), which connects DoD with startups and commercial tech firms in Silicon Valley and regional hubs like Austin, Texas and Boston, Massachusetts. Online Chat: DJ Kachman, the Veterans Affairs Department’s director of mobile and security technology transformation lead, on April 10, at 1 p.m. Advertisement “Just last week, I visited with DIUX leadership and saw firsthand the success they’ve had not only in facilitating dozens of deals with tech companies that were not previous postured or had any experience working with DoD, but also how the military services have begun to exploit the benefits of building bridges — thinking differently about procurement and using tech to improve their own systems and processes,” Carter said. While Carter acknowledged the present-day threats posed by the Islamic State, Russia, Iran and North Korea, he also warned Mattis of “unforeseen challenges and opportunities that an unpredictable future might hold.” Part of that future, according to Carter, involves doubling down on DoD’s role as the preeminent investor in research and development. In the Pentagon’s fiscal 2017 request, it asked for $72 billion for its R&D budget — more than double what Apple, Intel and Google spent combined in 2015, Carter said. “We pushed the envelope with research and development, despite the unconscionable budget environment in Washington, to stay ahead of our competitors,” he said. On the personnel side, Carter highlighted some of the “force of the future” initiatives he pioneered at the Pentagon. “At DoD, the source of American power, as well as my greatest joy in the job, came from the young people who make up the spine and the future of the force … the other source of strength is the tendency of the organization as a whole to be able to change and innovate,” he said. “We ensured that DoD was a place where thinking boldly and differently was fostered.” 19 agencies on chopping block only account for a small fraction of overall budget One program, the Defense Digital Service, sought to recruit tech talent from outside the uniformed service to work on DoD projects for a limited period of time. Carter said those who participated were eager to take on challenges unique to the Defense Department. “Many of them — a growing number of them— are extremely and increasingly receptive to the commitment and the responsibility to serve the public good. After all, these are people driven by a desire to do things of consequence,” he said. Another one of Carter’s projects, the Defense Innovation Board, has invited some of the top names in tech, like Eric Schmidt, board chair and executive chairman of Alphabet to tackle some of DoD’s longstanding problems, like harnessing its massive stores of data, from an outside perspective. “As Secretary of Defense, I challenged the Pentagon, as I used to say, to think outside of its five-sided box. We needed to be willing to change how we invested and how we innovated, how we planned and how we fought, and how we recruited and retained personnel,” Carter said.

PLAY:1, PLAY:3, PLAY:5, SUB, SOUNDBAR? I love them all. Hooked up to my music library, with Google Play Music in support, it’s the complete, whole home package. Sonos owners will be all too familiar with the Sonos Controller apps, available for OS X, Windows, iOS and Android. They do a great job of helping users navigate through large music libraries and push selected tunes to selected speakers. I use the Sonos Controller on various platforms, and works really well. But sometimes, when I’m browsing through my music library on a PC, I may stray across a track I haven’t heard in a while, and want to play it immediately. Forget opening up the Sonos Controller, searching for the track, choosing a speaker and streaming it – I want to play it now! This tip may well be known to everyone apart from me, but I’m going to share it anyway! This evening, I was editing some file names in my music library. The files themselves are stored on a QNAP NAS, but I was editing the file names over the network on an Intel NUC PC running Windows 10. I right clicked on a file and noticed the Cast to Device option. To be honest, I’ve never paid much attention to Windows’ media casting feature. It’s used to push media to DLNA devices – handy for connected TV playback, for example but I have my media streaming covered using other methods (like the Sonos Controller app!) I’m not sure why I decided to rollover the option this time, but on doing so I noticed that my Sonos speakers were listed. Now, I’ve assumed for some time that Sonos had locked down their speakers really tightly – to the point where the Sonos Controller app was the only way to stream music to them. But what the heck! I thought I’d see if Windows 10 could push music out to the Sonos speakers natively. Expecting to hear the familiar tone of a Windows error, rather than the new Suede album I’d selected for streaming, I was shocked to hear the popular beat combo rocking the Living Room! Of course, from a features perspective, casting from Windows to Sonos simply can’t match the Sonos Controller app, which remains my “go to” source for music library access. But if you’re working in Windows File Explorer and you need to spin some tunes on Sonos sharpish, Windows 10’s Cast to Device is a really handy option. cast to device sonos sonos controller Terry Walsh Terry Walsh is the founder of We Got Served.

Reply Anonymous says: Mar 18, 2017 at 4:07 pm You can queue up a playlist in a particular speaker and then go to the Sonos App and group that speaker with others. Reply Kel says: Mar 18, 2017 at 4:25 pm Same poster here (not sure why it posted anonymously). I’m curious to learn if anyone has figured out how to change the name so you can tell which PLAY:1 is which (I have several). Reply Rohit says: May 30, 2016 at 4:45 pm Hi! You can also cast 24 bit music through Sonos. Sonos won’t let you do it but you can cast it! Reply Midix says: Aug 3, 2016 at 5:18 pm I’m afraid that it will get converted on the way. DLNA protocol used by Cast To function is limited to specific formats only and if both endpoints do not agree upon the format, then the audio gets converted on the server end (Windows PC in this case) to the format acceptable to audio renderer device (Sonos PLAY in this case). Reply Maarten says: Sep 28, 2016 at 3:45 pm DLNA 24 bit is no issue. It will play. Reply Midix says: Aug 3, 2016 at 5:19 pm The Cast functionality is available also from Windows Media Player, so you can control your media library from there.

After eating a little humble pie, Cupertino’s top brass has promised a ‘complete rethink’ of its Mac Pro and has boosted the current model's specs in the meantime. However, the company has also promised new iMac configurations with those users with a need for power and speed in mind. Now we’ve got the first idea as to what these 'iMac Pro' specs might be and when the new desktops will be available to buy. Related: MacBook Pro 2016 review Pike’s Universum (via MacRumors) says they’ll be here in late October, which matches up to when Apple usually boosts its Mac line. The report, quoting a “usually pretty accurate source” says: “Good news folks. I am told, by a little bird, that the next iMac (to be released in late October) will be available with (up to) Intel E3-1285 v6 processor with 16 GB (upgradable to 32 or 64 GB) ECC memory. Faster NVMe SSD’s possibly up to 2 TB and AMD graphics to support VR and Pro apps. Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C gen 2 with… tada… a brand new keyboard.” A brand new keyboard you say? Well, earlier this week, word got out about an Apple patent application that featured the MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar functionality. There were more purported scoops from the source. He reckons there’ll be an 8K display with the new Mac Pro, while also teasing: “The next Mac mini won’t be so mini anymore. Well. The top model that is.” An iMac Pro or a full on Mac Pro? Where would your considerable investment be going if Apple delivers on this week's promises.

Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated April 6, 2017 10:43AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Machine Learning Chip Processor TPU GPU CPU Data Centers Intel Nvidia Top Tech News Without its custom-designed chip for machine learning, Google might have had to build many more data centers to support the intensive computing demands of services such as Image Search, Google Photos and more. Yesterday Google revealed new performance details about its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) during a National Academy of Engineering presentation at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. It said the TPU has shown in tests that it can outperform CPUs and GPUs in data centers, enabling faster and more energy-efficient computing for complex demands. As it applied machine learning capabilities to more of its products and applications over the past several years, Google said it realized it needed to supercharge its hardware as well as its software. It launched a "stealthy" project to develop a custom accelerator, and last May revealed that it had been successfully running Tensor Processing Units in its data centers for more than a year. Faster Chip or Twice as Many Data Centers "The need for TPUs really emerged about six years ago, when we started using computationally expensive deep learning models in more and more places throughout our products," Norm Jouppi, a distinguished hardware engineer at Google, wrote yesterday on Google's Cloud Platform Blog. "The computational expense of using these models had us worried." According to Jouppi, the company calculated that Google users employing voice search for just three minutes a day would have overwhelmed existing data center processors running deep neural nets for speech recognition. Keeping up would have required Google to double its current number of data centers, he said. Google currently operates 15 major data centers around the globe, with eight located in the U.S. and the rest scattered across Europe, Asia and South America. The company launched its high-priority TPU development project with the goal of boosting computation performance in its data centers to 10 times that of existing GPUs (graphics processing units), according to a research study released by Google yesterday. Tests show the TPU is an average of 15 to 30 times faster than a contemporary, server-class Intel Haswell CPU (central processing unit) and an Nvidia K80 GPU, according to the study. Enabling Responses 'in Fractions of a Second' Google's TPU is an application-specific integrated circuit that was tailored for TensorFlow, the company's machine learning-focused, open source software library. When it announced an updated version of TensorFlow in mid-February, Google said the library is now being used in projects ranging from language translation to cancer detection. In his blog post yesterday, Jouppi said Google's first-generation TPUs "allow us to make predictions very quickly, and enable products that respond in fractions of a second." More than 70 authors contributed to the research report detailing the TPU's performance in Google's data centers. The report is scheduled to be presented this June at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture in Toronto. Jouppi noted that Google plans to provide more updates about its TPU in the coming weeks and months. "TPUs are behind every search query; they power accurate vision models that underlie products like Google Image Search, Google Photos and the Google Cloud Vision API; they underpin the groundbreaking quality improvements that Google Translate rolled out last year; and they were instrumental in Google DeepMind's victory over Lee Sedol, the first instance of a computer defeating a world champion in the ancient game of Go," he said.

Not This Year Oracle Converges Cloud Storage Robots Coming for 38% of U.S. Jobs Intel Unveils Solid-State Drive Tech Snapdragon Chip Is Now a 'Platform' Next Article > Apple Promises Mac Pro Redesign Is Coming, Just Not This Year By Jef Cozza / Top Tech News. Updated April 04, 2017. First, the good news: Apple announced plans to release a completely redesigned version of the Mac Pro. Now the bad news: you won’t see it until at least 2018. But professional Mac users can sleep soundly in the knowledge that Apple understands their frustrations. Why else would the company invite a group of reporters to its headquarters yesterday to update the world on a product it doesn’t plan to release for at least another year? Apple seems to understand that it has a major perception problem when it comes to professional users, and can't afford to ignore the issue until an official product announcement sometime in 2018. Not Built for Modern Workloads The current version of the Mac Pro was released in 2013. At the time, the company thought it was making a bold statement with the unusual form factor that looked more like a cylindrical Bluetooth speaker than a professional desktop machine. But instead of representing a great leap forward for the company’s pro users, the current incarnation of the Mac Pro is now closer to a dead end. A large part of that is likely the fault of the internal architecture, the company admitted to reporters yesterday. Apple designers had gambled on an architectural plan designed to accommodate two smaller GPUs (graphics processing units), rather than a single larger one. Not necessarily a bad idea in principal, but that wasn’t how the industry evolved. Instead, designs and workloads have moved toward relying on one larger GPU. Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi acknowledged to reporters that the current design was inadequate for professional users whose workloads depended on running on a single GPU or single-threaded CPU (central processing unit) performance. Certain scientific workloads require a single GPU, and heavy 3D graphics or VR applications can also be taxing for two smaller GPUs, Federighi said. A Move to Modular However, the Mac Pro’s architecture made it difficult for the company to reconfigure the machine along the lines that their customers required. In particular, while the desktop’s triple chassis design was well-equipped to disperse the heat generated by two lower-power graphics chips, it couldn’t handle the thermal output generated by a single, massive GPU. That left Apple with a device that didn't serve the needs of many of its professional customers. Apple was also unable to upgrade future versions while remaining true to the original design. As a result, the Mac Pro has received little in the way of significant upgrades to its specifications. After four years on the market, the Pro has now fallen dramatically behind its competitors in the professional space. But Apple said that it's already hard at work on redesigning the Mac Pro. Although the company did not reveal any major details, executives did say the next model will be much more modular than the current version to better facilitate future upgrades. The new modular architecture will also include a new Pro display, something Apple has shied away from in the past.

What You Need to Know After Goldman initiates at sell, AMD takes it on the chin. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 6, 2017 at 2:04PM Every day, Wall Street analysts upgrade some stocks, downgrade others, and "initiate coverage" on a few more. But do these analysts even know what they're talking about? Today, we're taking one high-profile Wall Street pick and putting it under the microscope... Shares of semiconductor giant Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) are in free fall this morning, knocked for a loop by a giant sell rating from Wall Street's Goldman Sachs. After closing at $14.17 on Wednesday, the stock fell as far as $12.83 in early Thursday trading -- so the "good" news here is that it's now down only 7%. Here are three things you need to know about why. Goldman Sachs' sell rating shocked AMD investors this morning. Image source: Getty Images. 1. What Goldman Sachs said Completely out of the blue, Goldman Sachs initiated AMD stock with a sell rating and an $11-per-share price target this morning. If the analyst is right about that, it means AMD investors stand to lose 22% in market capitalization on their AMD shares over the course of the next year. Already, the stock is down 7% in response to Goldman's rating, suggesting worried investors are taking the analyst's warning to heart -- and don't want to stick around for more losses. But are those fears justified? Isn't Goldman's sell rating just one opinion in a sea of opinions about AMD? 2. Why Goldman Sachs said it At its heart, Goldman Sachs' sell rating is a valuation argument. Investors are betting on a big improvement in AMD's business as consumers warm to its line of Ryzen microprocessors, and they like its growing prospects in PC gaming, artificial intelligence, and computer deep learning. Many analysts who follow the stock believe that AMD will enjoy rapidly rising revenue (and profits) over the coming years. On average, analysts quoted on S&P Global Market Intelligence are calling for AMD's revenue to grow nearly 50% over the next four years -- and for operating profits to grow 16-fold. But as explained in a write-up on TheFly.com this morning, Goldman believes the potential improvement in fundamentals has already been priced into the shares. As a result, while some appreciation in stock price may have been justified, now that the stock is up nearly five times in two years, the current risk-return profile is unfavorable. 3. Anatomy of a sell rating Priced today at nearly 44 times next year's profits (i.e., profits AMD is not even guaranteed to earn), Goldman sees AMD's current stock price as "difficult to justify." Most analysts on Wall Street expect to see AMD turn profitable as soon as next year (earning a GAAP $0.11 per share, and $0.25 pro forma). Goldman, however, warns that that's a "very bullish" view -- and likely not to be correct given pricing pressure from even larger semiconductor powerhouses Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). Goldman's best guess? NVIDIA will earn only $0.14 per share pro forma next year, which implies an actual, GAAP profit of zero dollars, zero cents. What it means to investors And Goldman Sachs' argument makes sense. As the analyst explains it, there's certainly a possibility that AMD will succeed in winning market share this year with its powerful Ryzen chips. But even if it does succeed, then Intel and NVIDIA would probably try to lead customers back to the fold by offering price concessions on their own chips. The result would be short-term revenue gains for AMD, followed by margin compression on that revenue later in 2017 and heading into 2018 as the company is forced to cut its own prices to fend off competition from Intel and NVIDIA. So what would that portend for AMD investors? According to S&P Global data, AMD hasn't succeeded in posting a full-year profit since 2011, a year in which its operating profit margin surpassed 7%. Currently, that margin is coming in just shy of negative 9%. So while it's possible it will improve for a quarter or two, the end result of the moves AMD's rivals would make to counteract its gains in market share would likely plunge AMD's profit margin right back into a bath of red ink -- and deny the company the ability to report a profit in 2018. Investors betting on a return to GAAP profitability at AMD may have to wait a bit longer to see it. Rich Smith has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Apple did not share any specific details about the external display, but if the blog Pike's Universum is to be believed, it could feature an impressive 8K resolution. The report did not offer any additional details about the display, including a potential release date, but Apple said it won't be ready this year. 8K displays are just starting to reach the market now, led by Dell's new 32-inch UltraSharp 8K display, which retails for $5,000 in the United States. Apple has yet to launch a display with greater than 5K resolution, as found on the iMac with Retina 5K Display and the UltraFine 5K Display it partnered with LG on. Apple confirmed that it had exited the standalone display market after discontinuing the Thunderbolt Display in June 2016, but it has evidently reversed course. It's a smart move, given concerns that Apple was no longer focused on pros, and considering that LG's UltraFine 5K Display had a hardware flaw. On the Mac mini front, the blog said that the next high-end model "won't be so mini anymore," suggesting the most expensive configuration might have a larger or taller design to accommodate for upgraded tech specs. Apple last updated the Mac mini in October 2014, a span of 903 days, per the MacRumors Buyer's Guide. Apple recently said the Mac mini is "important" within its product lineup, but it remained tight-lipped about the prospects of future updates. The current Mac mini models, which are designed to be connected to a display, keyboard, and mouse purchased separately, range in price from $499 to $999. The base model is equipped with a 1.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with 4GB of RAM, a 500GB hard drive, and integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. Intel has released faster Kaby Lake processors appropriate for the Mac mini, but no other rumors have surfaced about the entry-level computer as of yet. At least one other plausible addition is Thunderbolt 3, which is already included on the MacBook Pro and rumored to be added to the next iMac models as well. Pike's Universum is best known for spotting references to unreleased Macs or upcoming software versions hidden within Apple's operating systems. The blog does not have an established track record of reporting on Apple's plans based on its own inside sources, so this rumor should be treated with caution for now.

It's like Apple reads the forums and counters the disappointment with future plans and rumors. So far so good IMO. Rating: 9 Votes truthertech 13 hours ago at 11:28 am Once again you are mistaking the facts when you say "Apple confirmed they were getting out of display business." Your only supporting document is a link back to your own article when you quote a tweet from Nilay Patel stating he spoke with some unnamed source, and Patel has had his own problems including warring with Apple over issues. LOL. Now he has egg all over his face. Apple never said this and it never made sense so please stop repeating what can be called "fake news," especially since Apple's recent press confab revealed that they simply have been working on the next gen of displays. Ditto that Apple was getting out of Mac Pro business, many claimed this but also have egg on their face. Notice that the Verge and Patel weren't invited-revealing. Correct way to report on the facts is "it was rumored by one blogger, but never confirmed by Apple" that Apple was getting out of display business." Same type of false info has been reported by many that Apple is getting out of router business. Another LOL. They are going all in on wireless in your home and elsewhere.

It was always supposed to the the cheapest way into the Mac ecosystem (remember Steve Jobs saying "BYOKMAM", Bring Your Own Keyboard Mouse And Monitor)?For me the point of the Mini would be that I'd like a capable stationary MacOS machine, but don't want a display permanently attached to it that I neither want or need nor have the room for (I already have 2 big monitors sitting on my desk).

It would be awesome if they finally woke up, smelled the coffee (and blood) and decided to get Windows down to BlackBerry OS status where it belongs. This is almost certainly what happened. Apple is pivoting here. Nilay just confirmed to me that it was an Apple executive that confirmed their previous intentions to exit the standalone display business. That's obviously not the case anymore. The pro community has been very vocal about their concerns, and I'm sure the shielding issues with the LG UltraFine 5K display don't help either. Apple can do better here. (cc [USER=1034762]@truthertech[/USER]) Rating: 4 Votes gugy 13 hours ago at 11:11 am Man, a 8K display will be awesome.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The Democrats and old-guard news media who spy a KGB agent behind every filing cabinet in President Trump’s White House are aggressively apathetic about Hillary and Bill Clinton’s decisions that gave aid and comfort to Russia. During a visit to Moscow on March 24, 2010, Mrs. Clinton explained the purpose of America’s "reset" with the Kremlin, "Our goal is to help strengthen Russia." The Clinton’s shadiest Russian deal is called Uranium One. This outrage should mushroom into Hillary and Bill’s glow-in-the-dark Whitewater. Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining mogul and major Clinton Foundation donor, led a group of investors in an enterprise called Uranium One. On June 8, 2010, Rosatom — Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation — announced plans to purchase a 51.4 percent stake in the Canadian company, whose international assets included some 20 percent of America’s Uranium capacity. Because Uranium is a strategic commodity, this $1.3 billion deal required the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Hillary was one of nine top federal officials on that secretive panel. On June 29, 2010 Bill Clinton keynoted a seminar staged by Renaissance Capital in Moscow, a reputedly Kremlin-controlled investment bank that promoted this transaction. It paid him $500,000 for a one-hour speech. While CFIUS evaluated Rosatom’s offer, Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer observed, "a spontaneous outbreak of philanthropy among eight shareholders in Uranium One” erupted. These included Uranium One’s then-chairman, Ian Telfer, who donated $3.1 million to the Clinton Foundation and related charities. Giustra himself gave the Clinton Foundation $131.3 million. Before, during, and after CFIUS’ review, Schweizer calculates, "shareholders involved in this transaction had transferred approximately $145 million to the Clinton Foundation or its initiatives." Hillary could have stopped Vladimir Putin from controlling one-fifth of U.S. uranium supplies. But no. On October 23, 2010, CFIUS approved Rosatom’s purchase of a majority stake in Uranium One. Thanks to subsequent investments, Rosatom controlled 100 percent of Uranium One by January 22, 2013. That’s when Pravda boasted, "Russian nuclear energy conquers the world." Hillary helped Boeing seal a major sale to the Kremlin. "We’re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rosavia, is actively considering the acquisition of Boeing aircraft. And this is a shameless pitch for Rosavia," Clinton said in Moscow on October 13, 2009. On June 1, 2010, the Kremlin decided to buy as many as 50 Boeing 737 jets for Russia’s national airline, Aeroflot. The price? A reported $3.7 billion. That Aug. 17, just 10 weeks later, Boeing announced a $900,000 gift to the Clinton Foundation to, "help support the reconstruction of Haiti’s public education system" after a massive earthquake pulverized the impoverished nation the previous January. The Clinton Foundation counts between $1 million and $5 million in contributions from Boeing. Hillary also favored Skolkovo, a Kremlin-sponsored "innovation city" near Moscow. The State Department arranged for 22 leading U.S. venture capitalists to tour Skolkovo in May of 2010. Cisco, Google, and Intel are among the companies that got involved. Among Skolkovo’s 28 "key partners" in 2012, 60 percent had given to the Clinton Foundation or paid speaking fees to Bill Clinton. According to The Government Accountability Institute (GAI), these 17 "key partners" gave the Clinton Foundation between $6.5 million and $23.5 million. Far more troubling, in 2014, the FBI wrote companies that operated in Skolkovo or backed the Skolkovo Foundation. "The foundation may be a means for the Russian government to access our nation’s sensitive or classified research development facilities and dual-use technologies with military and commercial application," warned Boston-based FBI agent Lucia Ziobro. The U.S. Army Foreign Military Studies Program at Fort Leavenworth concluded, "Skolkovo is arguably an overt alternative to clandestine industrial espionage." The Clintons actually did these things. When it comes to Team Trump, Democrats and their journalist pals are as relentless as bloodhounds chasing escaped jailbirds. And yet, regarding the Clintons, the Democrats and old-guard news people are as ferocious as puppies enjoying a roaring fireplace.

X Science breakthrough yields milk with human kindness Printed transistors could allow milk to text message alerts when it is about to go off about 13 hours ago Charlie Taylor Prof Jonathan Coleman, principal investigator at Amber with one of his printed transistors Prof Jonathan Coleman, principal investigator at Amber and a professor in the School of Physics at TCD, is working on turning common products into intelligent devices that can communicate information to consumers Previous Image Next Image         Ever wished your milk could warn you by text message that it was about to go off? It may soon be possible thanks to Dublin researchers who have found a way to turn everyday products into smart devices that can communicate with you. Researchers at the Science Foundation Ireland-funded Amber Centre, based in Trinity College, have fabricated printed transistors, a breakthrough which is expected to unlock the possibility of turning common products into intelligent devices. Among the possibilities are wine labels that alert you when a bottle is at its optimum temperature, food packaging that warns of sell-by-dates, and window panes that provide the day’s weather forecast. Prof Jonathan Coleman, principal investigator at Amber, led the team of researchers whose findings have been published in the latest issue of the leading international journal Science. The aim of Prof Coleman’s research is to take liquid dispersions of nanosheets and, by carefully tuning the liquid properties, optimise them for use as inks. Everyday surfaces These nano-structured inks can then be printed on to everyday surfaces using standard printers to form patterned networks of nanosheets “Electronics has been around for donkey’s years and Intel out in Leixlip are among those making high-end, high performing transistors. However, unlike them we are trying to make transistors so cheaply that they could be used in pretty much anything,” Prof Coleman told The Irish Times. He said that as a result of his team’s latest research, printed devices could soon be incorporated into even the most mundane objects allowing products to gather, process, display and transmit information that could be of benefit to consumers. “All of this is a long way off in the future, but it is imaginable that at some point milk cartons could send messages to your phone warning that the milk is about to reach its sell-by-date,” said Prof Coleman. A number of Prof Coleman’s patents have already been licensed to well-known companies, including Samsung. “We were able to print the initial transistors from a standard inkjet printer . . . we now intend to try to make more sophisticated printed transistors,” he added.       Topics: Jonathan Coleman Amber Eu European Research Council School Of Physics At Tcd Science Foundation Science Foundation Ireland Trinity College Dublin Intel Samsung Read More Cork-based firm set to shake up global iron supplements market Read my lips: Irish start-up gets teeth into verification tools If a new ID solution from SaaS start-up iDly Systems succeeds, plastic ID cards will be history Axial3D secures £230,000 of new investment in seed funding Music industry starts to dance to streaming giant Spotify’s tune Pie in the sky or Ireland’s big chance?

The Mac Pro will not, in fact, stay frozen in its late-2013 incarnation. Sometime after this year, Apple will finally ship a completely rebuilt version of the desktop. What’s more, the company’s iMac, which has gone 539 days without a refresh, will also see an update later this year. Apple even said it was sorry for leaving its customers wondering if the Mac Pro had a future. But this gesture at transparency doesn’t mean Apple will now be as public with its product road maps as, say, its environmental efforts. This company — like many others in the tech business — remains deeply devoted to parceling out information about its hardware on its own terms, as frustrating as that can be for its customers. Hard-where? As Daring Fireball blogger John Gruber, TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino, Mashable’s Lance Ulanoff, Axios’s Ina Fried, and BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski separately wrote after attending a Monday briefing near Apple’s headquarters, a reborn Mac Pro will sacrifice the current model’s titanium-trash-can style in favor of a design that eases storage and processing upgrades. As an interim step, Apple has bumped up the specifications on the existing model and offered an uncharacteristic apology to customers. “If we’ve had a pause in upgrades and updates on that, we’re sorry for that,” Panzarino quoted Apple marketing vice president Phil Schiller. The iMac, meanwhile, will get a less comprehensive update than the Mac Pro later this year. The five writers had fewer details to share about that desktop, aside from the hint that Apple will offer models geared toward professional users. View photos Apple iMac.More Apple’s all-in-one iMac is also getting a refresh. Schiller also revealed that desktops still make up 20% of Apple’s computer sales — a data point Apple last seems to have shared in 2012, when desktops held a 25% share. There’s still no word on Apple’s two other neglected computer lines — the MacBook Air, which has now gone 758 days without an update, and Mac mini, now neglected for 902 days. Opacity and openness It’s crazy for Apple to offer even a vague outline of a future product given its history of secrecy regarding devices. When I asked Apple PR if the company had anything to say about the MacBook Air and Mac mini, a representative declined to comment on unannounced products. But while this tight control of information helps Apple crank up excitement before each product launch and hasn’t hurt its stock price (from the Dec. 19, 2013 release of the Mac Pro to today, it’s nearly doubled in value), this opacity can hurt customers’ confidence in the company. Apple can’t blame that on Mac users getting too clingy. Yes, the slowing pace of evolution in “real” computers has shrunk the performance gap between new and older hardware. And yes, Apple likes to hold product revisions until it can deliver major changes — as Creative Strategies president Tim Bajarin explained in an email, the company focuses on “having the right chips and design,” not just popping in the latest processor from Intel (INTC). Competing computer vendors, however, update their PCs much more consistently, and Apple ships new iPhones and iPads with an almost-monotonous regularity. It’s easy to feel that Apple has decided its future is iOS, not macOS — as Adam Engst, editor of the long-running Mac-news site TidBits, fretted in November. Tuesday’s unprecedented pre-announcement “shows how much pressure they must feel they are under to fix the professional problem,” NPD Group analyst Stephen Baker said in an e-mail. Read More He added that while the cost for a pro user to move from Mac to Windows is high, “people have been absorbing it because of their lack of confidence in Apple’s future for the Mac.” This isn’t just an Apple problem Apple is known for keeping its customers and developers in the dark (see also, its inscrutable oversight of its App Store), but so do a lot of other tech companies. Google (GOOG, GOOGL), for instance, has a long and dubious history of shutting down projects and services without warning — which doesn’t stop it from introducing new apps that we’re supposed to expect won’t meet the same fate. View photos Google is known for launching and killing products with little to no warning to consumers.More Remember when it launched the Google Keep note-taking app a week after revealing that it would shut down Google Reader, the company’s free and simple tool that updated you about new posts on websites you followed? That’s one of the reasons why I still take my notes in Evernote but pay to use that app’s premium version. Except Evernote has its own, more recent history of axing products without warning. Facebook (FB) has run the same never-mind playbook when it shut down its Messages e-mail replacement and its Credits currency scheme, both unceremoniously dumped after the social network’s users and developers largely ignored those features.

That means after a year of trying to conceive there is still no viable pregnancy. What those couples are likely to find is if they chose to seek medical intervention, it will come at their own expense. A hefty expense. While Arkansas is one of 15 states to legislate mandated coverage for infertility in 2013, health professionals said the law has a $15,000 lifetime cap for in vitro fertilization which likely only covers one treatment. There are also a number of loopholes in the law that exempts self-insured companies from providing the in vitro benefit. Many of the state’s largest employers – including Wal-Mart Stores, Tyson Foods, J.B. Hunt Transport, Murphy Oil –  are self-insured. Dr. Michael Clouatre of Creekside Center for Women in Northwest Arkansas said it’s rare to see his patient’s insurance cover even the basic treatments. Coverage also rarely covers tests which can be used to determine if there is a medical condition requiring laparoscopic surgery such as blocked fallopian tubes or some other obstruction. In his 20 years of practice he has seen around five to six cases a year. He said given the high number of women professionals in Northwest Arkansas who postpone child birth, many seek a diagnosis in their mid to late 30s. Clouatre is not a fertility specialist, but as an obstetrics and gynecological physician he does work with patients seeking basic services when they can’t successfully get pregnant after a year. He said when there isn’t a medical problem 60% of couples will conceive within six months without medical assistance. “Most of the time patients are paying for the services completely out of pocket and there are times when couples simply cannot afford tests and treatments offered locally, (or) much less more expensive treatments at fertility clinics in Tulsa or Little Rock,” he said. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT Clouatre said the first step with a possible problem is to do a complete family history. He said 40% of the time the problem involves the male. Many times he said women are not regularly ovulating and that is something consumers can check themselves with over-the-counter tests similar to pregnancy tests. Clouatre said the cost for the ovulation strip tests could run a patient $20 to $40 a month. He said the next step is to prescribe Clomid which will induce ovulation, starting on a small dose to try and regulate the cycles. “A few years ago Walmart put the generic for Clomid on its $9 prescription list which was a huge help to couples without script cards. The drug was expensive for women not that long ago,” he said. “Over a three-month period of using Clomid and timing intercourse some couples will conceive.” If more intervention is needed Clouatre said there are diagnostic tests to examine the fallopian tubes for obstruction, but those tests are not covered by most insurance plans. The primary test known as HSG can range in cost between $800 and $3,000 depending on markets. The national average for that test is $1,259. Clouatre said the test doesn’t always reveal a problem that is believed to be present because of its limitations. In those cases he said exploratory outpatient surgery which is done and laparoscopically is the best way to check the quality of the tubes and check for endometriosis. He said because it’s related to infertility, insurance most times will not cover that expense. Outpatient surgery can range from $5,000 to $15,000 on average. Clouatre said seeking treatment locally is cheaper than in larger markets, but the cost is still out of reach for too many couples. He said patients can go as far as intrauterine insemination which can be done in the doctor’s office using the husband’s sperm or donor sperm if necessary. He said this procedure allows him to place sterile sperm through the cervix to the top of uterus near the fallopian tubes. “The harsh environment of the vagina can kill off a large number of sperm and bypassing the vagina and cervix gives the male sperm the best chance to reach an egg,” he said. Beyond that, Clouatre said he refers his patients to the Tulsa Fertility Center. In vitro fertilization there is about $12,000 for one round. He said if the patient doesn’t get pregnant after one cycle they must pay for round two which is somewhat less but still pricey. In a year’s time he said a patient could feasibly do four cycles of in vitro and the cost would be as much as $40,000, none of which is covered by insurance in most cases. PLUGGING GAPS When asked what he would like to be done to fill the gaps in coverage, Clouatre said it would likely have to legislated and the loopholes plugged because it’s doubtful a company will offer it otherwise – at least they haven’t thus far. American Express made news in December when it began offering insured employees up to $35,000 for infertility treatments including advanced reproductive technology procedures through its health plan. The company also tossed in $35,000 of coverage for adoption and surrogacy events. American Express Human Resource Officer Kevin Cox said employees wanted and asked for the expanded coverage and in trying to retain and attract the talent it needs this was the right move to make because the market is moving in this direction. Last year professional services firm EY (Ernst & Young) added a $25,000 benefit for infertility, surrogacy, adoption and egg-freezing. Intel also quadrupled its fertility benefit for its U.S. employees last year raising it to $40,000 on treatments and services and $20,000 on fertility drugs. Clouatre said the corporate moves are commendable, but the trend has not reached Arkansas market sand likely won’t as long as state law exempts the largest employers. GEOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES While Northwest Arkansas offers a wide range of healthcare services it’s also important to note patients seeking in vitro fertilization must still travel to Tulsa, Little Rock or some other larger market for those services because there is not a fertility specialist in any of the three local health care systems. Clouatre said traveling outside the local market for care is not only expensive but also a time commitment. A recent study by scientists at University of Pittsburgh and University of Michigan looked at the number of fertility clinics in the nation compared to population. They found that almost 25 million women of reproductive age in the U.S. don’t live near fertility clinics. They also noted that 18.2 million women between the ages of 20 and 49 live in metropolitan areas that have no fertility clinics, and an additional 6.8 million women live in areas that only have one clinic and therefore don’t have a choice of provider. However, the remaining 38.1 million — or 60% of the population — live in regions with multiple fertility clinics, which gives them a choice of providers. “Infertility is by itself a difficult issue for couples to face emotionally and financially,” study co-author Dr. John Harris, of Pitt’s School of Medicine, said in a statement. “Based on geography, many couples who are trying to start families may have only one clinic nearby where they seek these services, and many women with infertility do not have any nearby access to these services at all, adding additional anxiety during an already stressful time of life.” Comments comments Previous post Use of heating equipment and fuel varies based on climate Next post Crowdfunding cap boosted by SEC, adjusted for inflation Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Martha Londagin ‘The food’s the thing,’ but not everything Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, germ wagons, and getting state-ified Scott Cashion What we’ve done in the name of national security Gov.

We like this definition. SoC interconnect IP enables highly scalable neural network systems with integrated hardware functional safety features for ISO 26262 ASIL D compliance Linley Autonomous Hardware Conference 2017, SANTA CLARA, Calif (PRWEB) April 06, 2017 ArterisIP, the innovative supplier of silicon-proven commercial system-on-chip (SoC) interconnect IP, today announced the Ncore 2.0 Cache Coherent Interconnect IP and the optional Ncore Resilience Package to accelerate and enhance the creation of next-generation designs for autonomous driving systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Ncore is a distributed heterogeneous cache coherent interconnect that enables SoC design teams to easily integrate custom processing elements using embedded low latency proxy caches (also called “I/O caches”). In neural network machine learning SoCs where workloads are typically partitioned onto different processing elements, low latency proxy caches offer a more hardware- and software-efficient way of communicating between all the different elements than fixed internal SRAMs or scratchpad memories. These types of architectures are at the core of autonomous driving systems. Ncore 2.0 offers new capabilities: Ncore Resilience Package (optional) – Adds hardware data protection and intelligent unit duplication to detect and correct system faults required to achieve automotive ISO 26262 ASIL D compliance Includes a functional safety controller with advanced Built-In Self-Test (BIST) as well as Failure Modes, Effects and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA) and documentation. Coherent Memory Cache – The configurable coherent memory cache achieves the benefits of a traditional Last Level Cache (LLC) while consuming less die area and offering more flexibility. It integrates with other system caches, serving at as a lower-level cache in the memory hierarchy relative to those caches. Scalability, with up to 16 coherent agents – Ncore 2.0 IP enables larger systems with up to 16 coherent clusters. “We engineered the Ncore 2.0 cache coherent interconnect and the accompanying Ncore Resilience Package based on feedback from our customers, who are creating the world’s most efficient machine learning systems that will power the future of autonomous driving,” said K. Charles Janac, President and CEO of ArterisIP. “Our IP was specifically created for autonomous hardware SoC designers, enabling them to simultaneously meet the competing needs of design complexity and functional safety.” Supporting Quotations Sanechips (Subsidiary of ZTE): “We are very impressed with the new ArterisIP Ncore interconnect IP technology,” said Mr. Yu Li, VP at Sanechips (Subsidiary of ZTE). “ArterisIP Ncore 2.0 interconnect IP offers even higher scalability along with the Coherent Memory Cache, which reduces DRAM accesses while maintaining area efficiency.” The Linley Group: “Designers of machine-learning SoCs must integrate heterogeneous processor cores and accelerators into a complex system that can handle the high data bandwidth and low latency required for such applications,” said Mike Demler, senior analyst for the Linley Group. “ArterisIP’s new Ncore 2.0 interconnect IP with resiliency features addresses these issues by enabling designers to implement heterogeneous cache-coherent machine-learning architectures for applications such as the rapidly developing autonomous-vehicle market.” Resiltech: “Implementing functional safety mechanisms in SoC interconnect hardware is imperative for highly complex machine learning SoCs,” said Andrea Bondavalli, Professor of Computer Science and head of the Resilient Computing Lab at the University of Florence, and scientific advisor to ResilTech, a leading functional safety consultancy, “Doing so simplifies software development and maintenance while freeing scarce processing resources to perform functional work rather than safety checking.” About ArterisIP ArterisIP provides system-on-chip (SoC) interconnect IP to accelerate SoC semiconductor assembly for a wide range of applications from IoT to mobile phones, cameras, automobiles, SSD controllers and servers for customers such as Samsung, Huawei / HiSilicon, Mobileye, Altera (Intel), and Texas Instruments. ArterisIP products include the Ncore cache coherent and FlexNoC non-coherent interconnect IP, as well as optional Resilience Package (functional safety) and PIANO automated timing closure capabilities. Customer results obtained by using the ArterisIP product line include lower power, higher performance, more efficient design reuse and faster SoC development, leading to lower development and production costs.

Seeing as Ryzen 7 proved to be a very capable performer when running heavily-threaded applications, it's perhaps unsurprising that AMD would take the multi-core design philosophy further still. AMD has confirmed the existence of many-cored Zen CPUs with its Naples platform, but the company hasn't made any announcements regarding similar consumer hardware. A new update to popular monitoring utility AIDA64 suggests we might be in for a surprise. Those many-core chips are mentioned by name, along with AMD's upcoming 500-series graphics cards. The release notes for the upcoming version of AIDA64 Extreme don't offer many details, but what's there is intriguing. The notes declare that AIDA64 will have "preliminary support for AMD Zen 12-core and 16-core HEDT CPUs." It's fun to think about how such chips might pose a challenge to Intel's Core i7-6950X and Core i7-5960X in the high-end desktop and workstation spaces. The notes also mention both the Radeon RX 570 and Radeon RX 580 cards, and indicate that they're both powered by the Polaris 10 GPU. This information matches up with other rumors we've heard concerning these pixel-pushers. For whatever it's worth, AIDA64's notes don't mention either the RX Vega or the RX 550, a rumored product based on an unreleased Polaris 12 GPU. As much as we'd like to offer more details on these parts, there just isn't much in the way of specific information available yet. As AMD lets the cats out of the bag, we'll keep you posted.

The Californian Republican congressman said he is stepping down due to “entirely false” accusations filed against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The decision will also affect the committee’s probe into alleged possible interactions between Moscow and Trump campaign staffers.

That Ryan allowed Nunes to step aside is not a good reflection on his leadership. https://t.co/a34lOEkOQB— Mollie (@MZHemingway) April 6, 2017 Top House Democrats called for Nunes to recuse himself from the panel’s investigation into Russia, following the revelations that he had met on White House grounds with a source who showed him secret US intelligence reports.

The Senate Intelligence Committee is running its own inquiry, while the FBI has carried out a broad counterintelligence investigation since July 2016.

NBC News’ Blayne Alexander reports. (Published Thursday, April 6, 2017) A new Republican congressman will take charge of the embattled House investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. election as Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is temporarily stepping aside. Nunes, R-Calif., said in a statement Thursday that he believes it's in the best interests of the committee and Congress for him to do so. The move comes weeks after he generated accusations that the investigation was biased when he took information — later revealed to be acquired on White House grounds — directly to President Donald Trump without sharing it with colleagues on the committee. US Launches Missiles at Syria After Chemical Attack Nunes called charges filed against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics "false and politically motivated." The office confirmed Thursday that it is aware of accusations "Rep. Devin Nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information." "Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway ... temporarily take charge of the Committee's Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter," he said in the statement. House Intel Chairman Criticized for Meeting Source at WH House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes faced criticism from Democratic lawmakers after he was found to have met an unnamed source a day before he told President Trump and the press that Trump Tower may have gotten caught up in United States surveillance efforts during the transition period. (Published Monday, March 27, 2017) House Speaker Paul Ryan said that he supports the decision and that Nunes, who served on Trump's presidential transition team, continues to have his trust. "I know he is eager to demonstrate to the Ethics Committee that he has followed all proper guidelines and laws. In the meantime, it is clear that this process would be a distraction for the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian interference in our election," Ryan said. UpdatedFilibuster Busted: Senate OKs 'Nuclear Option' for Gorsuch The ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, D-Calif., called Nunes' sharing of information with the White House "gravely concerning." He argued that Nunes' actions show the need for an independent investigation into the alleged meddling, which is also the subject of a Senate investigation and an FBI counterintelligence investigation. "The important work of investigating the Russian involvement in our election never subsided, but we have a fresh opportunity to move forward in the unified and nonpartisan way that an investigation of this seriousness demands," Schiff said Thursday in a statement. 🚨🚨🚨 House Intel Cmte Chair @DevinNunes will temporarily step aside for the Russia Investigation --> pic.twitter.com/f7LSo0vmL0 — Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) April 6, 2017 Nunes steps down with most Democrats and Republicans focused on different facets of the investigation. Schiff has said he's seen "more than circumstantial evidence of collusion" that associates of Donald Trump colluded with Russia during the election. He has not named individuals who may have colluded with Russians, but some members of the Trump campaign who have been implicated in news reports have denied the allegation. Fact Check: Trump’s Line on Syria Trump has claimed, without evidence, that he believes Trump Tower was placed under surveillance by the Obama administration, and Nunes has said that while there is no evidence of an order to collect surveillance, communications with the Trump team were caught "incidentally." Trump's supporters have argued that the identities of Trump associates were improperly "unmasked" by members of the Obama administration. On Wednesday, Trump claimed, again without evidence, that Obama aide Susan Rice illegally ordered the names unmasked.  Dems Call for Nunes to Step Down From Russia Probe Calls are growing for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes to recuse himself from the committee's investigation into Russia after he met with an anonymous source at the White House to review intelligence documents. Nunes is facing criticism for revealing the results of another investigation to President Donald Trump and the press before discussing it with the committee. (Published Tuesday, March 28, 2017) Rice, who had the power as national security adviser to request that names be unmasked for national security purposes, has denied that she or other Obama officials spied on Trump associates for political purposes.  "I'm not going to dignify the president's ludicrous charge with a comment," Rice's spokeswoman said of Trump's latest accusation. Clinton 'Deeply Concerned' About Russian Election Role The president spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to his Florida resort on Thursday afternoon. Trump said he only recently heard that Nunes stepped aside from the committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible ties to the Trump campaign. Nunes is a "good person" and "a very honorable guy," Trump said. WH Staffers Fed Info to House Intel Chairman: Report The New York Times reported on Thursday that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes was briefed by two White House officials shortly before he announced that the Trump transition team may have been swept up in "incidental" surveillance. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced an invitation to top Senate and House investigators to review classified documents related to Russian hacking and U.S. surveillance, calling it "the responsible thing" to do. (Published Thursday, March 30, 2017) Nunes remains the chairman of the intelligence committee after stepping down from the Russia investigation, which Republican congressman Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney will help Conaway lead. ______ The Unlikely Organizers of the 'Chicken Trump' Tax March The Associated Press contributed to this report.

(AMD), Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) and Yum China Holdings Inc (YUMC) Goldman snubs AMD, while BBBY and YUMC get a lift from earnings Apr 6, 2017, 7:54 am EDT  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     View All   Wednesday’s trading was a seesaw affair that ended in an ugly fashion. While the major indices were ahead solidly for most of the day, comments from the Federal Reserve sent the markets into a reversal. The S&P 500 index lost 0.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite took a 0.6% dip. Heading into Thursday’s trade, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is taking a punch on the analyst front, but Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) and Yum China Holdings Inc (NYSE:YUMC) are on the rise thanks to some encouraging quarterly results. Here’s a look at what to watch for heading into Thursday’s action: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Just a couple days after fellow chipmaker Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) took a precipitous fall, AMD stock is off to its own rocky start this morning. Goldman Sachs ticked off the bulls by kicking off coverage of AMD shares at a “Sell” rating at a price target of $11, or 22% lower from current levels. Analyst Toshiya Hari also set earnings-per-share estimates for the next three years — 2 cents of EPS in 2017, 14 cents in 2018 and 48 cents in 2019. The 2017 and 2018 estimates are well below analyst consensus expectations of 8 cents and 30 cents, respectively. Hari admits that the company is executing better under CEO Lisa Su, but believes that all progress has been baked into the share price. Thus, the risk/reward situation is unfavorable at this juncture. Hari not only considers Nvidia to be a strong competitive threat, but Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) as well. UPDATE: AMD shares were tracking 3% losses premarket that accelerating to a 7% decline at the open as traders woke up to the news. Advanced Micro Devices was still up 25% year-to-date heading into Thursday’s trade, but has mostly plateaued since late February. Recently, shares have been battling to stay above the short-term 20-day moving average, and will start today’s action below that level. Thanks to this morning’s drop, the stock has slipped below next support at its 50-day MA, which sits around $13.40 per share. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) BBBY shares had some pep in their step early Thursday after the company released its fourth-quarter earnings data and hiked its dividend. The homewares retailer earned $268.7 million ($1.84 per share) in its most recent quarter. That was 11% lower year-over-year, but an easy beat of expectations for $1.77 per share. Meanwhile, revenues of $3.5 billion were actually a bit higher year-over-year, as were comparable-store sales, which inched higher by 0.4%. Bed Bath’s top line was a match of analyst estimates. On the upside, those comps included digital improvement of 20%. But there were a couple of low points.

Gigabyte will begin selling its new 15.6-inch Sabre 15 gaming notebook in Taiwan at the show featuring Nvidia's latest GeForce GTX 1050 Ti graphics card and Intel's new processor, the paper noted. Because gaming products typically offer gross margins over 30%, the business has become the focus for several PC vendors in 2017. In 2016, MSI's share in the worldwide PC market was nearly 20%, and the company is looking to increase the percentage to above 30%. For 2017, MSI is planning to flood the gaming market with multiple different specification products and so far has already released 25 new gaming and mid-range to high-end VR-ready motherboards as well as several gaming notebooks, the paper added.

(Photo: Delphi) 15 CONNECTTWEET 8 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Delphi Automotive PLC has entered into a trio of partnerships aimed at making the company a leader in the collection — and sale — of information culled from self-driving and connected cars. Delphi, a maker of autonomous driving systems, and its rivals have identified data collection as the next major frontier in mobility. It’s considered lucrative: Last October, research firm McKinsey & Co. estimated “the global revenue pool from car data monetization could be as high as $750 billion by 2030.” Vehicles that will one day be connected with other vehicles, people, infrastructure and the surrounding environment are expected to produce all kinds of useful information. A key hurdle has been how best to collect that information from on-board the vehicle, how to process and share that information with cloud-based storage, and how to sort that data into a product. This week Delphi has announced agreements with three companies offering key technologies for that process: ■Valens, based in Israel, specializes in high-speed semi-conductors, or “chip-to-chip” technology producing connectivity speeds six times faster than the current industry standard. ■Rosenberger Hochfrequenztechnik GmbH & Co., based in Germany, specializes in data transmission and ethernet connectors. ■Otonomo, based in Israel, develops marketplaces for the automakers collecting data. Delphi has purchased minority stakes in both Valens and Otonomo, and has struck a strategic partnership with Rosenberger. “Increasing vehicle complexity is driving demand for more data connectivity, active safety and greater vehicle automation,” Delphi said in a press release. “This in turn, is driving a requirement for best-in-class signal and power distribution capabilities, along with a robust data management strategy.” The short version of Delphi’s strategy with its new partners is to harness the information vehicles can collect, move it as quickly as possible and put it into a format that can be sold. For vehicle owners, Delphi officials said this kind of data sharing can open up a whole new world of personalized services for them. Mary Gustanski, Delphi’s vice president of engineering, offered the example of a car broken down on the side of the road where the driver has called a tow truck. Data from the car would allow a company to identify the problem of a dead battery and send a van along with a new one. Delphi, a global company with its Michigan base in Troy, has redefined itself in recent years. The former parts unit of General Motors Co. has worked to position itself as a technology company under a strategy it calls “safe, green and connected.” Last year, Delphi entered into a partnership with Israel-based Mobileye NV and Intel Corp. aimed at creating a self-driving car platform by 2019. In January, at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, Delphi and Mobileye showed off Audi SQ5s equipped with their system. In a study released this week by Colorado-based Navigant Research, Delphi ranked ninth — the highest supplier — among 19 companies for leadership on automated driving. “Delphi has narrowed its focus significantly in the past several years, spinning off many of its own units and leaving fuel systems, electronics, electrical architectures and automated driving as the core businesses,” Navigant said. This week’s acquisitions move Delphi further into the data collection arena. And as the high-tech capabilities of vehicles increase, the company’s focus is shifting from the vehicles to the information they can provide. Glen De Vos, Delphi’s chief technology officer, said: “With connectivity, you have more value being created around the car, not in it.” JLynch@detroitnews.com (313) 222-2034 15 CONNECTTWEET 8 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2oEwGE4 TOP VIDEOS GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Surface Phone Gets An Official Domain, Hardware Rumors Hint At Quad HD Resolution Posted: Apr 6 2017, 5:21am CDT | by Shane McGlaun, Updated: Apr 6 2017, 8:31am CDT, in Rumors | Technology News     Rumored hardware for Surface Phone doesn't seem all that compelling The rumors that fly about new smartphones certainly lean heavily towards Apple and Android devices, but there is a third option that many fans are clamoring for. Microsoft has been doing well with its Surface line of premium tablets and laptops. This has led many fans to have strong want for a Surface phone. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com Rumors swirled heavily late in 2016 that the Surface phone was on its way, but that never happened. Microsoft has snagged an official domain name for the Surface Phone and it's as you might expect surfacephone.com according to DroidReport. The web address redirects to the home page at Microsoft right now and is also registered by Microsoft according to the domain records. I think if all Microsoft was trying to do with that domain name was to keep a competitor from grabbing it, it would have simply bought the domain and left if fallow. Once the web address is up and running all Microsoft needs to do is redirect it to the right page for the phone and it is off to the races. Rumors suggest that the Surface Phone will use a 5.5-inch AMOLED display with resolution of 1440 x 2560. The rumored chipset for the device is a Snapdragon 835 or perhaps an Intel part. I think Microsoft needs to use the Snapdragon part, Intel doesn't have the best rep for performance and power conservation in the mobile market. Storage is rumored to be 128GB with 4GB of RAM and a microSD card slot for expansion. That all sounds pretty good, but the real question remains is if Microsoft will build it. The Windows platform is a distant third place in the smartphone realm behind iOS and Android. It will take some very compelling hardware to lure large numbers of people to the platform and these rumored specs seem quite mainstream right now. This story may contain affiliate links.
