Baba, may i not be knowledgeable to the extent of doubting your existence. May i not be rich to the extent of doubting your existence. Baba, i an not a saint, i have my faults as a human being but i believe there is an awesome creator that is beyond the comprehension of intelligent Men on Earth. Baba, when Men who think they are intelligent fail to comprehend why you remain dumb to insane things happening within your creations, some conclude you(God) must be a wicked creator, others conclude you (God) never existed. Baba, there is this quest in man to reference the supreme being. He does not see this supreme being but he feels his Awesomeness through his works. This quest led the early man to raise and carve stones, wood, ornaments into a form or shape, as a representative of this supreme being. It’s this same quest to reference the supreme being that made man have different names with same meaning for this supreme being according to the different tribes and languages that exist on planet Earth. Baba, what is it that will make me doubt your existence? I may not understand why you permit some evils to happen to mankind but that should not make me doubt you. I may not understand why you make me go through my current experience but that should not make me doubt you. All I ask is knowledge, wisdom and humility to reference you. Nairaland What do you think?

You’ve got to be kidding’,” he said, “reminding me I’d never worked in hardware, that I didn’t know anything about manufacturing.” But how Wang has proved his detractors wrong. Established in 2014 in Beijing, Zero Zero Robotics has just officially launched its Hover Camera Passport, a US$599 portable artificially intelligent drone that shoots 4K video and serves as your own personal aerial photographer. Unlike most aerial photography drones on the market, which can fly far and wide to capture a landscape view, Wang said the Passport was designed to photograph people. “It will capture your life moments when you travel with your friends and loved ones. Passport allows you to capture yourself and the view behind you [hands-free],” he said. But he says what sets the Passport apart from other drones on the market is its lightness, its foldable body, its enclosed propeller blades, and its artificial intelligence. The propellers are fully enclosed in carbon fibre, allowing users to grab the device in mid-air and fly it in enclosed spaces without fear of hurting anyone close by. It will capture your life moments when you travel with your friends and loved ones. Passport allows you to capture yourself and the view behind you [hands-free] Wang Mengqiu, founder of Zero Zero Robotics And unlike drones that track users using stereo vision – defined as the perception of depth obtained by comparing visual information from two vantage points – the 242-gram flying device employs computer vision for facial recognition, thereby allowing it to lock on to a specific user and follow them around. “It can track you from the front, the side or from behind,” Wang said. “[With the artificial intelligence software], it actually recognises objects in its view. It’ll draw boxes around every face it sees and you can double-click on which person it should follow. No other drones can do that.” The Passport can also orbit around the user and spin 360 degrees to capture a panoramic photograph. Users who prefer to control its flight path can do so with an accompanying mobile app. But the Passport is not without competition. The device is being pitched against DJI’s Mavic Pro, a US$749 foldable camera-drone the Shenzhen-based company launched last month. The 734-gram Mavic Pro is almost three times the weight of the Passport, but has obstacle avoidance, a feature the Passport does not yet have. It also boasts almost three times the Passport’s 10-minute battery life. “I do wish we could have improved the battery life more,” Wang said. “We promised eight minutes when we showcased our prototype in April, and now we can go 10. That’s 25 per cent better, but we’re not going to pat ourselves on the back.” But while Zero Zero Robotics currently only has one device in its portfolio, Wang has ambitious plans. “We want to do so much more in the personal robotics space,” he said, adding that the Passport was a first step towards more robots the company planned to build. His vision of a personal robotics system at home starts with an aerial command centre – an eye in the sky, which issues commands to other devices around the home. “Once a device is airborne above 1.5 metres, there are very few indoor obstacles – perhaps several humans and some pillars. Mobility becomes a lot easier when you can manipulate yourself in a 3-D [setting] ... there is a better view, better path-planning. Obstacle avoidance becomes easier,” he said. A smart drone could easily give commands to robots on the ground that “don’t have to get very smart”, Wang said. “It just has to do what it does on the ground very, very well. The [airborne device] can be the one to plan out the path for the ground robot and tell it what obstacles it has to avoid.” He added that the next-generation Hover Camera Passport, which he expects to release in about a year, would be a lot smarter. “[The device] is going to be completely autonomous. It will be able to land and charge itself, and then automatically take flight and avoid obstacles while circling around a room,” he said.

(Photo: Moyan Brenn/flickr/cc) Does the concept of a living planet uplift and inspire you, or is it a disturbing example of woo-woo nonsense that distracts us from practical, science-based policies? The scientifically-oriented nuts-and-bolts environmental or social activist will roll her eyes upon hearing phrases like “The planet is a living being.” From there it is a short step to sentiments like, “Love will heal the world,” “What we need most is a shift in consciousness,” and “Let’s get in touch with our indigenous soul.” What’s wrong with such ideas? The skeptics make a potent argument. Not only are these ideas delusional, they say, but to voice them is a strategic error that opens environmentalism to accusations of flakiness. By invoking unscientific concepts, by prattling on about the ‘heart’ or spirit or the sacred, we will be dismissed as naive, fuzzy-headed, irrational, hysterical, over-emotional hippies. What we need, they say, is more data, more logic, more numbers, better arguments, and more practical solutions framed in language acceptable to policy-makers and the public. I think that argument is mistaken. By shying away from the idea of a living planet, we rob environmentalism of its authentic motive force, engender paralysis rather than action, and implicitly endorse the worldview that enables our destruction of the planet. The psychology of contempt. To see that, let’s start by observing that the objection to “Earth is alive” isn’t primarily a scientific objection. After all, science can easily affirm or deny Earth’s aliveness depending on what definition of life is being used. No, we are dealing with an emotional perception here, one that goes beyond ‘alive’ to affirm that Earth is sentient, conscious, even sacred. That is what upsets the critics. Furthermore, the derisiveness of the criticism, encoded in words like ‘hippie’ or ‘flake,’ also shows that more than an intellectual difference of opinion is at stake. Usually, derision comes from insecurity or fear. “Judgment,” says Marshall Rosenberg, “is the tragic expression of an unmet need.” "Part of our resistance to the notion of Earth as a living being could be the patriarchal mind feeling threatened by feminine ways of knowing and choosing." What are they afraid of? (And I—the voice of the derisive critic lives in me as well.) Could it be that the contempt comes in part from a fear that one is, oneself, ‘naive, irrational and over-emotional?’ Could the target of the derision be the projection of an insecurity lurking within? Is there a part of ourselves that we disown and project, in distorted form, onto others—an innocent, trusting, childlike part? A feminine part? A vulnerable part? If so, then critics of the infiltration of New Age ideas into the environmental movement may not be serving the movement at all. They may be enacting their own psychological dramas instead. If you are one of those critics, I am not asking you to join hands with me and sing Kumbaya. I ask only that you soberly and honestly consider where your discomfort comes from. Certainly, much of the discomfort is a healthy revulsion toward the escapism, spiritual bypass, and cultural appropriation that plague so much of the New Age. Certainly, there is a danger that, intoxicated by the idea of cosmic purpose or some-such, we ignore the pain and grief that we must integrate if we are to act effectively and courageously. Certainly, dogma like “It’s all good” or “We’re all one” can blind us to the exigency of the planetary crisis and discourage us from making changes in our lives. Certainly, borrowed rituals and concepts of sacredness can be an insidious form of colonialism, a strip-mining of cultural treasure to compensate for and enable the continuation of our own cultural vacuity. However, such criticisms address a mere caricature of the thoughtful work of generations of philosophers, scientists and spiritual teachers, who have framed sophisticated alternatives to conventional phenomenological, ontological and causal narratives. Phew, that was a mouthful. What I’m saying is not to hide behind facile criticisms. The fear of being emotional, irrational, hysterical, etc. is very close to a fear of the inner feminine, and the exclusion of the fuzzy, the ill-defined, and the emotionally-perceived dimensions of our activism in favor of the linear, rational, and evidence-based, mirrors the domination over and marginalization of the feminine from our social choice-making. Part of our resistance to the notion of Earth as a living being could be the patriarchal mind feeling threatened by feminine ways of knowing and choosing. But that’s still pretty theoretical, so let me share a little of my own introspection. When I apprehend concepts such as “Earth is alive,” or “All things are sacred,” or “The universe and everything in it bears sentience, purpose and life,” there is always an emotion involved; in no case is my rejection or acceptance the result of pure ratiocination. Either I embrace them with a feeling of eager, tender hope, or I reject them with a feeling of wariness, along the lines of “It is too good to be true,” or “I’m nobody’s fool.” Sometimes, beyond wariness, I feel a hot flash of anger, as if I had been violated or betrayed. Why? "I became an environmentalist out of love and pain: love for the world and its beauty and the grief of seeing it destroyed." That wariness is deeply connected to the contempt I’ve described. The derision of the cynic comes from a wound of crushed idealism and betrayed hopes. We received it on a cultural level when the Age of Aquarius morphed into the Age of Ronald Reagan, and on an individual level as well when our childish perception of a living, personal universe in which we are destined to grow into magnificent creators gave way to an adulthood of deferred dreams and lowered expectations. Anything that exposes this wound will trigger our protective instincts. One such protection is cynicism, which rejects and derides as foolish, naive or irrational anything that affirms the magic and idealism of youth. Our perceived worldview has cut us off, often quite brutally, from intimate connection with the rest of life and with the rest of matter. The child hugs a tree and thinks it feels the hug and imagines the tree is his friend, only to learn that no, I’m sorry, the tree is just a bunch of woody cells with no central nervous system and therefore cannot possibly have the qualities of beingness that humans have. The child imagines that just as she looks out on the world, the world looks back at her, only to learn that no, I’m sorry, the world consists of a jumble of insensate stuff, a random melee of subatomic particles, and that intelligence and purpose reside in human beings alone. Science (as we have known it) renders us alone in an alien universe. At the same time, it crowns us as its lords and masters, for if sentience and purpose inhere in us alone, there is nothing stopping us from engineering the world as we see fit. There is no desire to listen for, no larger process to participate in, no consciousness to respect. “The Earth isn’t really alive” is part of that ideological cutoff. Isn’t that the same cutoff that enables us to despoil the planet? The wounded child interjects, “But what if it is true? What if the universe really is just as science describes?” What if, as the biologist Jacques Monod put it, we are alone in “an alien world. A world that is deaf to man’s music, just as indifferent to his hopes as to his suffering or his crimes.” Such is the wail of the separate self. It is loneliness and separation disguised as an empirical question. While no amount of evidence can prove it false, we must acknowledge that the science that militates against an intelligent, purposeful, living universe is ideologically freighted and culturally bound. Witness the hostility of institutional science to any anomalous data or unorthodox theory that suggest purposiveness or intelligence as a property of inanimate matter. "What hides behind the contempt? The reactivity?" Water memory, adaptive mutation, crop circles, morphic fields, psi phenomena, UFOs, plant communication, precognitive dreams…and a living Earth, a living sun, a living universe, all incite scorn. Anyone who believes in these, or even takes them as a valid topic of investigation, risks the usual epithets of ‘pseudo-scientist,’ ‘flake,’ or ‘woo-woo,’ regardless of the merits of the theory or the strength of the evidence. Of course, simply by making this assertion I open myself to the very same calumny. You can conveniently dismiss me as irrational, scientifically semi-literate, gullible at best and delusional at worst, perhaps knowingly dishonest, bamboozling my audience with learned allusions to impart an illusion of scientific probity to my ravings. But if you really care about this Earth, you’ll want to be curious about the emotional content of this judgment. What hides behind the contempt? The reactivity? What moves the environmentalist? Our discomfort with New Age-sounding concepts like “The planet is alive” is not entirely rational, but comes in large part from a wound of betrayal, cloaked in the pervasive ideology of our culture. Is it true though? We might play with various definitions of life and come up with logical, evidence-based arguments pro and con, just as we could debate the veracity of anomalous data and unconventional theories, and never come to an agreement. So let us look at the matter through a strategic lens instead. What belief motivates effective action and real change? And what kind of action results from each belief? Most people reading this probably consider themselves to be environmentalists; certainly most people think it is important to create a society that leaves a livable planet to future generations. What is it, exactly, that makes us into environmentalists? If we answer that, we might know how to turn others into environmentalists as well, and to deepen the commitment of those who already identify as such. I don’t know about you, but I didn’t become an environmentalist because someone made a rational argument that convinced me that the planet was in danger. I became an environmentalist out of love and pain: love for the world and its beauty and the grief of seeing it destroyed. It was only because I was in touch with these feelings that I had the ears to listen to evidence and reason and the eyes to see what is happening to our world. I believe that this love and this grief are latent in every human being. When they awaken, that person becomes an environmentalist. Now, I am not saying that a rational, evidence-based analysis of the situation and possible solutions is unimportant. It’s just that it will be compelling only with the animating spirit of reverence for our planet, born of the felt connection to the beauty and pain around us. Our present economic and industrial systems can only function to the extent that we insulate ourselves from our love and our pain. We insulate ourselves geographically by pushing the worst degradation onto far-away places. We insulate ourselves economically by using money to avoid the immediate consequences of that degradation, pushing it onto the world’s poor. We insulate ourselves perceptually by learning not to see or recognize the stress of the land and water around us and by forgetting what healthy forests, healthy streams and healthy skies look like. And we insulate ourselves ideologically by our trust in technological fixes and justifications like, “Well, we need fracking for energy independence, and besides it’s not that bad,” or “After all, this forest isn’t in an ecologically critical area.” The most potent form of ideological insulation though is the belief that the world isn’t really in pain, that nothing worse is happening than the manipulation of matter by machines, and that therefore as long as we can engineer some substitute for ‘ecosystem services,’ there need be no limit to what we do to nature. Absent any inherent purpose or intelligence, the planet is here for us to use. "When environmentalists cite the potential economic losses from climate change, they implicitly endorse economic gain and loss as a basis for environmental decision-making." Just today, the borough was removing trees on our street, and I felt grief and rage as I listened to the chainsaws, even as my mind said, “But after all, those are old trees and the branches could fall onto a person or damage a house. They are unsafe. And what does it matter? They are only trees.” So here, inhabiting my own mind, was the fundamental ideology of domination (the trees must be removed because they stand in the way of human interests) and separation (they are ‘only trees;’ they are not-self; they do not have the basic qualities of beingness that I do). Look around this planet. See the results of that ideology writ large. The love of life. The idea that our planet is alive, and further, that every mountain, river, lake and forest is a living being, even a sentient, purposive, sacred being, is therefore not a soppy emotional distraction from the environmental problems at hand; to the contrary, it disposes us to feel more, to care more, and to do more. No longer can we hide from our grief and love behind the ideology that the world is just a pile of stuff to be used instrumentally for our own ends. True, that ideology is perfectly consistent with cutting carbon emissions, and consistent as well with any environmental argument that invokes our survival as the primary basis for policymaking. A lot of environmental activism depends on appeals to survival anxiety. “We have to change our ways, or else!” Appealing to fear and selfish interest, in general, is a natural tactic for anyone coming from a belief that the planet has no intrinsic value, no value beyond its utility. What other reason to preserve it is there, when it has no intrinsic value? It should be no surprise that this tactic has failed. When environmentalists cite the potential economic losses from climate change, they implicitly endorse economic gain and loss as a basis for environmental decision-making. Doubtless they are imagining that they must ‘speak the language’ of the power elite, who supposedly don’t understand anything but money, but this strategy backfires when, as is the norm, financial self-interest and ecological sustainability are opposed. Similarly, calls to preserve the rainforests because of the value of the medicines that may one day be derived from its species imply that, if only we can invent synthetic alternatives to whatever the forest might bear, we needn’t preserve the rainforest after all. Even appealing to the well-being of one’s grandchildren harbors a similar trap: if that is your first concern, then what about environmental issues that only affect people in far-away lands, or that don’t tangibly harm any human being at all? The clubbing of baby seals, the extinction of the river dolphin, the deafening of whales with sonar… it is hard to construct a compelling argument that any of these threaten the measurable well-being of future generations. Are we then to sacrifice these beings of little utility? Besides, did anyone ever become a committed environmentalist because of all the money we’ll save? Because of all the benefits we’ll receive? I am willing to bet that even the survival of the species or the well-being of your grandchildren isn’t the real motive for your environmentalism. You are not an environmentalist because you are afraid of what will happen if you don’t act. You are an environmentalist because you love our planet. To call others into environmentalism, we should therefore appeal to the same love in them. It is not only ineffectual but also insulting to offer someone a venal reason to act ecologically when we ourselves are doing it for love. Nonetheless, environmental campaigning relies heavily on scare tactics. Fear might stimulate a few gestures of activism, but it does not sustain long-term commitment. It strengthens the habits of self-protection, but what we need is to strengthen the habits of service. Why then do so many of us name “fear that we won’t have a livable planet” as the motive for their activism? I think it is to make that activism acceptable within the ideological framework I have described that takes an instrumentalist view of the planet. When we embrace what I believe is the true motive—love for this Earth—we veer close to the territory that the cynic derides. What is it to make ‘rational’ choices, after all? Is it ever really rational to choose from love? In particular, is it rational to love something that isn’t even alive? But the truth is, we love the Earth for what it is, not merely for what it provides. "Each of us (in an industrial society) wades against the tide of an old ideology as we dare to act from the felt understanding of our intimate connection to life, our interdependency, our interbeing." I suspect that even the most hardheaded environmentalist, who derides the Earth-is-alive crowd most vociferously, harbors a secret longing for the very object of his contempt. Deep down, he too believes the planet and everything on it is alive and sacred. He is afraid to touch that knowledge, even as he longs for it. Often, his intellectual reasons are but rationalizations by which he gives himself permission to act on his felt understanding of what is sacred. This person is all of us. I am no exception: the idea of a living, sentient Earth attracts me and repels me both, mirroring the polarity of opinion I observe at conferences between the nuts-and-bolts and spiritual factions. Accusations of ‘naive!,’ ‘softheaded!’ and ‘gullible’ rattle around in my own brain, expressing a hurting thing within. Maybe if I join the ranks of the critics and turn the criticism outward, accuse others of ignoring science and indulging in fuzzy thinking, I can find some temporary relief. But there is no real healing in that. I want to be whole. I want to feel more and not less. I want to heal these alienated parts of myself, so that I don’t act from them unconsciously and sabotage the beautiful vision that asks my contribution. Each of us (in an industrial society) wades against the tide of an old ideology as we dare to act from the felt understanding of our intimate connection to life, our interdependency, our interbeing. Critiques of the idea of a living planet make that struggle all the harder. In the interests of honesty as well as effective strategy, we need to look at the fear and pain that that critique comes from. Then we can get people in touch with their perception of a living sacred planet, so they can feel the grief and love that perception opens, and act upon it.

Montini: Dolphin prison draws out a bit of our ... humanity EJ Montini EJ Montini , The Republic | azcentral.com 11:23 a.m. MST October 16, 2016 792 Shares This is where they should live. Not in the desert.  (Photo: Public domain) Not too long ago eight heavily guarded, carefully restrained prisoners were flown to Arizona and locked up in Stalag 101, the dolphin internment camp located just off the freeway on the Salt River Reservation near Scottsdale. The owners call the facility Dolphinaris Arizona, but make no mistake, it’s a prison. A very unique one. And it’s open for business, making it the only correctional facility I’m aware of where the public is invited to cavort with the inmates – for a price. The gulag is on reservation land because there’s little chance it would get the permits to operate outside of it. The Mexico-based company behind the enterprise stated on its website that “the mission of Dolphinaris Arizona is to amaze, inspire, and empower guests, encouraging them to become stewards of the oceans and its inhabitants. We hope to deepen respect for dolphins and our natural world, and encourage visitors to take actions, large and small, that can make a difference.” Our “natural world?” Dolphins are smart, perhaps second only to us in intelligence (and moving up fast during this election season). What could Dolphinaris teach us about them? Well, how much would you expect to learn about humans if you took eight babies away from their parents and raised them in a sterile room with no access to the outside world or to other men, women and children? That’s the way it is for the prisoners at Dolphinaris, swimming round and round in concrete ponds. Scientists have learned a lot about dolphins over the years. They’re intelligent. Highly social. Advanced. That’s why the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Md., is relocating its captive dolphins to an ocean sanctuary, saying, “We now know more about dolphins and their care, and we believe that the National Aquarium is uniquely positioned to use that knowledge to implement positive change. This is the right time to move forward with the dolphin sanctuary." Arizona’s dolphin Guantanamo is adjacent to the OdySea Aquarium and Butterfly Wonderland at Via de Ventura and the Loop 101. Technically, Dolphinaris is a separate entity from OdySea, but both are under the development of a company called Northern Gateway. Arizona State University marine-biology expert Leah Gerber told The Arizona Republic that incarcerating dolphins in concrete cells in the middle of the desert is “totally insane." That has been echoed by any number of other experts. But, hey, willing patrons can cavort with the inmates for as little at $59 for a "land-based" dolphin experience to $149 for a 45-minute dolphin swim program. It’s grotesque. There is a local group of activists, operating under the banner of Dolphin Free AZ, who have been protesting at the facility. Lisa Arnseth, vice chairman of the group, sent me a note late last week that reads in part, “While we know that we cannot stop Dolphinaris at this point and we have been making our opposition known loud and clear for months, we remain fully committed to educating the public about the downside of dolphin captivity. We are encouraged by recent market trends and news stories, such as TripAdvisor announcing this week to no longer promote attractions using certain wild and captive animals, including swim-with-the-dolphins programs. It's never been more clear that these attractions are an endangered species themselves.” We humans don’t think highly of one another these days. We don’t seem to believe, or at least practice, much good will, compassion or forbearance. It’s as if our coarseness and hostility has sent our better angels flying off for safe haven in the firmament. But the fact is, a few remain. You may see them now and again holding signs of protest in Scottsdale near Via de Ventura and the Loop 101, not far from the complex housing Dolphinaris. We may not demonstrate much grace or tolerance toward one another these days. But it’s in us. By rallying against the ugly imprisonment of innocent dolphins, protesters prove that we still possess a little … humanity.

This is why we work hard ­—so we can create an environment and give them the tools we think they need to achieve just that.  We want to know what exactly what predicts success. Is it talent? IQ? Being born in a certain socio-economic class? Attending a good (expensive) school? Having a conventional, relatively peaceful, family life?   All these do bear on how children eventually turn out, but recent research shows there is something else that is a far better predictor of whether children will actually find meaning and happiness in what they do. It is called grit. Grit is defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals. It is carrying on despite distraction, temptation and failure.  “Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over the years despite failures, adversity and plateaus in progress. The gritty individual approaches achievement as a marathon; his or her advatage is stamina. Whereas disappointment or boredom signals to others that it is time to change trajectory and cut losses, the gritty individual stays the course,” so say Angela Duckworth, Christopher Peterson, Michael Matthews and Dennis Kelly in their paper “Grit: Perseverance and Passion for Long-term Goals” published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 2007. One of the authors, Duckworth, has gone on to become a more vocal advocate, publishing her own book, Grit, and becoming a famous TED Talk speaker. *** So why do different people, of generally equal intelligence or talent, achieve different levels of success? The answer lies on good old grit, which characteristics are summarized by Forbes Magazine’s Margaret Perlis as courage, conscientiousness, follow through, resilience and excellence.  Courage. Courage, we say, is not the absence of fear. It is pushing ahead despite it. Fear of failure, for instance, is debilitating—many would rather not try than risk trying and thereafter failing.  But gritty people know that we are all bound to fail at one point, or several. They acknowledge that failure is part of the learning process and that the important thing is, as the song goes, is to “pick [themselves] up, dust [themselves] off and start all over again.”  As parents, we often try to shield our kids from the consequences of their actions or omissions. We don’t want them to feel pain or frustration. What this tells us is that we just might want to adopt the “let them fail” approach, not so that we can punish them and say “I told you so!” but so that they can learn to deal with failure which is, they will eventually find, inevitable.  Conscientiousness. To be conscientious means to be careful, painstaking and meticulous, and being accountable for one’s actions no matter what. Travis Bradberry writes for The Huffington Post: “By holding yourself accountable, even when making excuses is an option, you show that you care about results more than your image or ego.”  Follow through. Overnight success is not success at all. A 1985 study of 120 world-class pianists, neurologists, swimmers, chess players, mathematicians and sculptors showed that just a few of them were regarded as prodigies by teachers, parents or experts in their younger years. “Rather, accomplished individuals worked day after day, for at least 10 or 15 years, to reach the top of their fields.” This is akin to the minimum-requirement rule described by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers. To be really good at something, he posited, you have to work on what you do for no less than 10,000 hours.  Resilience. Author Andrew Zolli defines resilience as “the ability of people, communities and systems to maintain their core purpose and integrity among unforeseen shocks and surprises.” Grit, or hardiness, he says, has three marks: the belief that one can find meaningful purpose in life, the belief that one can influence one’s surroundings and the outcome of events, and the belief that both positive and negative experiences will lead to learning and growth. It’s all a mix of optimism, confidence and creativity.  Excellence. Gritty people are not perfectionists. They recognize that there is so much imperfection in the world, and pursuing perfection can just lead to negative, counterproductive results like low self-esteem, obsessive-compulsive tendencies, depression and sometimes substance abuse.  What the gritty aim for is excellence—which they see as an attitude, a disposition, and not an end in itself. Excellence is a way of life, done every day in the big things and the small.  *** But how do parents instill grit in their children, especially given the penchant of today’s generation to work “smart” instead of working hard, their apparently limited attention span, the abundance of distraction, and the general tendency to tread the easy path?  Duckworth shares that she and her husband enforce The Hard Thing Rule in their home for their teenage daughters—and themselves as well. All members of the family have to be doing a difficult thing. They should be interested in that endeavor, sure, but it requires sustained daily effort and they are not allowed to quit for a given period just because they are bored or frustrated or feel they are no good at it.  Some parents bombard their children with “reminders” that they should be doing this or that, but experience tells us this hardly works especially since it is so easy for children to just tune out, however valid and priceless the message is.  Some try to simply set a good example by exhibiting the traits associated with grit, in the hopes that the kids will pick up the clues and live them, themselves. But this could be all too subtle.  The challenge to instill grit in our children—and the consequent feeling of confidence that because they have it, they will be fine when we are gone and wherever they eventually choose to go—is in itself a goal that requires perseverance and passion on the part of parents. And so we try, shunning the fearing of failure, carrying on despite stumbling blocks, and tirelessly beginning anew each morning.  *** The Homeschool Association of the Philippine Islands, HAPI for short, is holding its annual Philippine Homeschool Conference this Saturday, October 22 from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the SMX Convention Center, SMX Aura Premier in Taguig.  This year’s theme is  “From Roots to Wings: Homeschooling through the Stages.”   Visit www.educatingforlife.co for details.  adellechua@gmail.com Topics: Hail the gritty , Parents , Children Related stories: No related stories matched this topic.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries E-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site 1985-Present 1831-1950 Letter: What strong leadership really looks like Saturday Oct 15, 2016 at 6:28 PM If we can see past the presidential campaigns' diversionary mud-slinging and charisma (or lack thereof) we realize we all just want to be safe, and that starts with strength in our leadership.  When feeling unsafe, it's so easy to react with one-sided anger and therefore respond to issues simplistically and quickly. But is strength really in bulldozing others when resultant extremist groups, who meet fire with fire, then emerge in ever greater numbers? Is reactive, divisive assault truly strength that yields safety?  Do we want a president who is lightningly fast to take offense and who therefore reacts to the world as something for him to win/conquer? What happened the last time someone in power with tremendous charisma felt that way? What could happen today, given all the nuclear weapons in play?  Or do we want a president who is emotionally balanced, even when tested to the limit time and again, and who is able to rationally think through complex, interrelated issues and who also has the experience of a lifetime of successfully finding common ground on the national and world stage?  It takes self-awareness, compassion, temperamental restraint, knowledge, experience and intelligence to understand that everyone wants to feel safe. This yields the ability to thoughtfully, instead of reactively, balance the many moving parts of this complex world, a world that often hangs in a precariously delicate balance, to arrive at safe solutions. Real solutions often take time, patience and compromise, include a show of force only when necessary, and are comprised of so much more than we're privy to for national security reasons.  Michelle Sullivan Springfield About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Contact Us Subscribe Place an Ad Commenting Rules Archives Marketplace Cars Homes Classifieds Newspaper Ads Sections News State Government Sports The Voice Local Entertainment Information Social Media Directory E-edition Today's Front Page Text Alerts Calendar Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Article tools PDF Rights & Permissions Subject terms: Technology Ethics Society Armando L. Sanchez/Chicago Tribune/TNS/Getty Chicago police use algorithmic systems to predict which people are most likely to be involved in a shooting, but they have proved largely ineffective. This week, the White House published its report on the future of artificial intelligence (AI) — a product of four workshops held between May and July 2016 in Seattle, Pittsburgh, Washington DC and New York City (see go.nature.com/2dx8rv6). During these events (which we helped to organize), many of the world’s leading thinkers from diverse fields discussed how AI will change the way we live. Dozens of presentations revealed the promise of using progress in machine learning and other AI techniques to perform a range of complex tasks in every­day life. These ranged from the identification of skin alterations that are indicative of early-stage cancer to the reduction of energy costs for data centres. The workshops also highlighted a major blind spot in thinking about AI. Auto­nomous systems are already deployed in our most crucial social institutions, from hospitals to courtrooms. Yet there are no agreed methods to assess the sustained effects of such applications on human populations. Recent years have brought extraordinary advances in the technical domains of AI. Alongside such efforts, designers and researchers from a range of disciplines need to conduct what we call social-systems analyses of AI. They need to assess the impact of technologies on their social, cultural and political settings. A social-systems approach could investigate, for instance, how the app AiCure — which tracks patients’ adherence to taking prescribed medication and transmits records to physicians — is changing the doctor–patient relationship. Such an approach could also explore whether the use of historical data to predict where crimes will happen is driving overpolicing of marginalized communities. Or it could investigate why high-rolling investors are given the right to understand the financial decisions made on their behalf by humans and algorithms, whereas low-income loan seekers are often left to wonder why their requests have been rejected. A singular problem “People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they’re too stupid and they’ve already taken over the world.” This is how computer scientist Pedro Domingos sums up the issue in his 2015 book The Master Algorithm1. Even the many researchers who reject the prospect of a ‘technological singularity’ — saying the field is too young — support the introduction of relatively untested AI systems into social institutions. In part thanks to the enthusiasm of AI researchers, such systems are already being used by physicians to guide diagnoses. They are also used by law firms to advise clients on the likelihood of their winning a case, by financial institutions to help decide who should receive loans, and by employers to guide whom to hire. Analysts are expecting the uses of AI systems in these and other contexts to soar. Current market analyses put the economic value of AI applications in the billion-dollar range (see ‘On the rise’), and IBM’s chief executive Ginni Rometty has said that she sees a US$2-trillion opportunity in AI systems over the coming decade. Admittedly, estimates are difficult to make, in part because there is no consensus on what counts as AI. Source: CB Insights AI will not necessarily be worse than human-operated systems at making predictions and guiding decisions. On the contrary, engineers are optimistic that AI can help to detect and reduce human bias and prejudice. But studies indicate that in some current contexts, the downsides of AI systems disproportionately affect groups that are already disadvantaged by factors such as race, gender and socio-economic background2. In a 2013 study, for example, Google searches of first names commonly used by black people were 25% more likely to flag up advertisements for a criminal-records search than those of ‘white-identifying’ names3. In another race-related finding, a ProPublica investigation in May 2016 found that the proprietary algorithms widely used by judges to help determine the risk of reoffending are almost twice as likely to mistakenly flag black defendants than white defendants (see go.nature.com/29aznyw). Three tools How can such effects be avoided? So far, there have been three dominant modes of responding to concerns about the social and ethical impacts of AI systems: compliance, ‘values in design’ and thought experiments. All three are valuable. None is individually or collectively sufficient. Deploy and comply.Most commonly, companies and others take basic steps to adhere to a set of industry best practices or legal obligations, so as to avoid government, press or other scrutiny. This approach can produce short-term benefits. Google, for example, tweaked its image-recognition algorithm in 2015 after the system mislabelled an African American couple as gorillas. The company has also proposed introducing a ‘red button’ into its AI systems that researchers could press should the system seem to be getting out of control4. Similarly, Facebook made an exception to its rule of removing images of nude children from its site after the public backlash about its censorship of the Pulitzer-prizewinning photograph of a naked girl, Kim Phúc, fleeing a napalm attack in Vietnam. And just last month, several leading AI companies, including Microsoft, Amazon and IBM, formed the Partnership on AI to try to advance public understanding and develop some shared standards. Yet the ‘deploy and comply’ approach can be ad hoc and reactive, and industry efforts can prove inadequate if they lack sufficient critical voices and independent contributors. The new AI partnership is inviting ethicists and civil-society organizations to participate. But the concern remains that corporations are relatively free to field test their AI systems on the public without sustained research on medium- or even near-term effects. Values in design.Thanks to pioneers in the ethical design of technology,including the influential scholars Batya Friedman and Helen Nissenbaum, researchers and firms now deploy frameworks such as value sensitive design or ‘responsible innovation’ to help them to identify likely stakeholders and their values. Focus groups or other techniques are used to establish people’s views about personal privacy, the environment and so on. The values of prospective users are then incorporated into the design of the technology, whether it is a phone app or a driverless car5. Developers of AI systems should draw on these important methods more. Nevertheless, such tools often work on the assumption that the system will be built. They are less able to help designers, policymakers or society to decide whether a system should be built at all, or when a proto­type is too preliminary or unreliable to be unleashed on infrastructure such as hospitals or courtrooms. Craig F. Walker/Denver Post/Getty People with asthma were wrongly graded as low risk by an AI system designed to predict pneumonia. Thought experiments.In the past few years, hypothetical situations have dominated the public debate around the social impacts of AI. The possibility that humans will create a highly intelligent system that will ultimately rule over us or even destroy us has been most discussed (see, for example, ref. 6). Also, one relevant thought experiment from 1967 — the trolley problem — has taken on new life. This scenario raises questions about responsibility and culpability. In it, a person can either let a runaway trolley car run along a track where five men are working, or pull a lever to redirect the trolley on to another track where only one person is at risk. Various commentators have applied this hypothetical scenario to self-driving cars, which they argue will have to make automated decisions that constitute ethical choices7. Yet as with the robot apocalypse, the possibility of a driverless car weighing up ‘kill decisions’ presents a narrow frame for moral reasoning. The trolley problem offers little guidance on the wider social issues at hand: the value of a massive investment in autonomous cars rather than in public transport; how safe a driverless car should be before it is allowed to navigate the world (and what tools should be used to determine this); and the potential effects of autonomous vehicles on congestion, the environment or employment. Social-systems analysis We believe that a fourth approach is needed. A practical and broadly applicable social-systems analysis thinks through all the possible effects of AI systems on all parties. It also engages with social impacts at every stage — conception, design, deployment and regulation. As a first step, researchers — across a range of disciplines, government departments and industry — need to start investigating how differences in communities’ access to information, wealth and basic services shape the data that AI systems train on. Take, for example, the algorithm-generated ‘heat maps’ used in Chicago, Illinois, to identify people who are most likely to be involved in a shooting. A study8 published last month indicates that such maps are ineffective: they increase the likelihood that certain people will be targeted by the police, but do not reduce crime. A social-systems approach would consider the social and political history of the data on which the heat maps are based. This might require consulting members of the community and weighing police data against this feedback, both positive and negative, about the neighbourhood policing. It could also mean factoring in findings by oversight committees and legal institutions. A social-systems analysis would also ask whether the risks and rewards of the system are being applied evenly — so in this case, whether the police are using similar techniques to identify which officers are likely to engage in misconduct, say, or violence. “Artificial intelligence presents a cultural shift as much as a technical one.” As another example, a 2015 study9 showed that a machine-learning technique used to predict which hospital patients would develop pneumonia complications worked well in most situations. But it made one serious error: it instructed doctors to send patients with asthma home even though such people are in a high-risk category. Because the hospital automatically sent patients with asthma to intensive care, these people were rarely on the ‘required further care’ records on which the system was trained. A social-systems analysis would look at the underlying hospital guidelines, and other factors such as insurance policies, that shape patient records9. A social-systems analysis could similarly ask whether and when people affected by AI systems get to ask questions about how such systems work. Financial advisers have been historically limited in the ways they can deploy machine learning because clients expect them to unpack and explain all decisions. Yet so far, individuals who are already subjected to determinations resulting from AI have no analogous power10. A social-systems analysis needs to draw on philosophy, law, sociology, anthropology and science-and-technology studies, among other disciplines. It must also turn to studies of how social, political and cultural values affect and are affected by technological change and scientific research. Only by asking broader questions about the impacts of AI can we generate a more holistic and integrated understanding than that obtained by analysing aspects of AI in silos such as computer science or criminology. There are promising signs. Workshops such as the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning meeting being held in New York City next month is a good example. But funders — governments, foundations and corporations — should be investing much more in efforts that approach AI in the way we describe. Artificial intelligence presents a cultural shift as much as a technical one. This is similar to technological inflection points of the past, such as the introduction of the printing press or the railways. Autonomous systems are changing workplaces, streets and schools. We need to ensure that those changes are beneficial, before they are built further into the infrastructure of every­day life.

While it does generate a list of real people who may be more likely to be involved in violent crime, it does not give the police the right to go round up all of them and detain them for some period of time to prevent their involvement. They might talk with these people, but the laws prevent them from detaining them before a crime has been begun. Laws provide other limits on police actions which I'm not intimately familiar with. CBS-TV had a popular fiction series titled "Person of Interest" which featured a computer which produced such a list. The main characters could get away with a lot more actions to try to prevent the possible crimes, than the Chicago Police can do legally in the real world.

Online Learning Update Online Learning News and Research ~ Ray Schroeder, editor ~ University of Illinois at Springfield « Traditional universities transformed online learning, but can it replace them? MOOC-Based Credential Options Expand in Online Education » Leaders need to start planning now for artificial intelligence. by Geoff Colvin, Fortune Many CEOs tell me their greatest fear is being blindsided by a competitor they never even thought of as a competitor, threatening to make the CEO’s business irrelevant by using technology and a business model the CEO hadn’t imagined. That’s why I urge you to read Roger Parloff’s new cover story on deep learning, how it’s changing our lives, and how, as he says, it “will soon transform corporate America,” and business globally for that matter. We’ve all been reading a lot about artificial intelligence (AI), but we now must understand finer distinctions. Within AI is a set of techniques called machine learning, enabling computers to get better at tasks with practice. And within machine learning is deep learning, involving algorithms by which computers train themselves using multi-layered neural networks and vast quantities of data. If you don’t really understand that, you’d better read the article. http://fortune.com/2016/10/05/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning-employers/ Share on Facebook This entry was posted on Saturday, October 15th, 2016 at 12:10 am and is filed under Online Learning News.

Investing In Your Future: Invest Like A Business Owner Posted on October 15, 2016 by Steve Downey Here’s what an emotional investor does: Checks the market constantly, worries about every uptick and downtick, rapidly realigns his or her portfolio at the first sign of a stock or market downturn, tends to jump into and out of the market chasing hot stocks and dumping down stocks. And here’s one other thing an emotional investor does: Severely limits his or her chances for long-term financial success.  Rational investors know that the best approach is to take the emotion out of investing. Many of them are business-owners and replace emotional investing with a business-owner approach. They have found success incorporating these business-owner principles into their investment plans.  Clear investment goals: Rational investors set goals and have the discipline to stick to them. Yes, they want to make money but they set their return objectives against clear short- and long-term goals.  Know when to delegate: Successful business-owners know they can’t do everything themselves so they hire capable people with the talent and ability to enhance their business. Similarly, rational investors delegate their investment decisions to professionals who have the talent and ability to help them achieve and sustain their financial goals.  Be risk averse: Both rational business-owners and rational investors definitely want to create wealth but they also understand the need for wealth protection. That’s why their portfolios are carefully crafted and well-diversified to reduce risk and provide more stable returns over the long-term.  Just the facts: Rational investors make investment decisions based on facts not on feelings. They do not get caught up in “the investment flavour of the moment” and are careful to keep their emotions out of investment choices.  In the know: Rational business-owners keep a daily watch on investment news and consider its implications but like rational investors, they also keep their focus on long-term trends not day-to-day fluctuations.  Seize opportunity: Rational individuals, business-owners and investors alike, trust their intelligence. They actively seek money-making opportunities – especially in a volatile market – by hedging, shorting and using other investment strategies to pick up assets at bargain prices.  If an unemotional business-owner approach to investing appeals to you – and it should because it’s often a better path to financial success – then talk to your professional advisor about the investment strategies that work best for you.
