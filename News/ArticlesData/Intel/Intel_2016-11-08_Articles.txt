Akitio has also published a list of which devices work with the MacBook Pro — and again, it’s not clear why some hardware with the 82 solution work, while others don’t. We have removed the quote from Plugable that implied no devices with the 65982 solution could connect to the new MBPs. Original Story: Well, this is a touch embarrassing. When Apple unveiled its latest MacBook Pro hardware a few weeks back, it declared that USB-C-compatible Thunderbolt 3 ports (and lots of dongles) were the future of the company’s Mac division. We disagreed with that decision, while acknowledging that yes, Apple does have a long history of sunsetting old standards and introducing new ones ahead of the rest of the industry (whether or not this situation is analogous is a topic we discussed). Now, news has surfaced that Apple’s newest MacBook Pro hardware may not be compatible with Thunderbolt 3 peripherals already on the market. First, some context: Thunderbolt 3 is the third iteration of Intel’s Thunderbolt interconnect standard and is the first version of that standard to be physically compatible with USB Type-C connectors. It debuted in early June 2015, and support began shipping with Skylake hardware towards the end of last year. Thunderbolt 3 is used in the external GPU XConnect standard jointly developed by Intel, AMD, and Razer. It’s USB-C compatible (an extremely smart move from Intel) and should be a plug-and-play solution for Apple’s MacBook Pro. After all, Thunderbolt 3 is Thunderbolt 3… right? Apparently, no — not when Apple deploys it. According to peripheral manufacturer Plugable, Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 standard specifically calls for certain TI chips to handle power delivery and alternate mode negotiation. The chip specified by Intel, and used by Plugable (and possibly the entire rest of the industry) is the TPS65982. It’s described by Texas Instruments as: “a stand-alone USB Type-C and power delivery (PD) controller providing cable-plug and orientation detection at the USB Type-C connector. Upon cable detection, the TPS65982 device communicates on the CC wire using the USB PD protocol. After successful USB PD negotiation is complete, the TPS65982 enables the appropriate power path and configures alternate mode settings for internal and (optional) external multiplexers.” According to Plugable, none of its existing hardware currently on the market is compatible with the MacBook Pro because OS X expects all devices to use the second-generation TPS65983 solution. Here’s how the company describes the problem: The version of OS X on the new MacBook Pros (late 2016) will not work with existing Thunderbolt 3 docks and adapters that were certified for Windows prior to the release of the MacBook Pro. These existing devices use first generation of TI USB-C chipset (TPS65982) in combination with Intel’s Thunderbolt 3 chipset (Alpine Ridge). Apple requires the 2nd generation TPS65983 chipset for peripherals to be compatible. Certification of solutions across different device types is still in-progress for this 2nd generation chipset. From the Plugable product line, our dual display graphics adapters for DisplayPort and HDMI (TBT3-DP2X and TBT3-HDMI2X) are affected… We’ve also postponed our TBT3-UD1 Docking Station to update to the TPS65983 chipset and re-certify to make this docking station MacBook-compatible. Our Flagship TBT3-UDV dock with Power Delivery/Charging was already planned to use the next generation controller chip from TI, and will be compatible with the 2016 Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks. Answering compatibility questions We’ve got questions in to Intel about this, but here’s what we know thus far. First, this problem appears to be specific to Thunderbolt 3 peripherals. If you have a Thunderbolt 2 device plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port via an adapter, it seems to work fine. That limits the amount of hardware likely to be incompatible, since not that many Thunderbolt 3 peripherals have been built yet. The flip side to this, however, is that Apple appears to have asleep at the switch when it comes to the hardware already on the market. It’s one thing to be on the cutting-edge of technology, but declaring that your users are all expected to convert to a new cable standard while simultaneously releasing hardware incompatible with all of the Thunderbolt 3 hardware currently on the market is really, really dumb. What happens to Apple buyers who pulled the trigger on a MacBook Pro and some new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals at the same time? What makes all of this even stranger is that the hardware Apple isn’t supporting isn’t some random Thunderbolt 3 controller made by a third party. These are chips that are part of Intel’s own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices. A little digging on TI’s forums turned up several answers, including one from TI employee Brian Berner: “The TPS65983 is a special product for ThunderBolt 3 devices (for example: hard drives, docks, and monitors) that connect to ThunderBolt 3 hosts (such as tablets, notebooks, and workstations.)” That may be true, but Intel’s own release notes for its Thunderbolt 16.2.52.250 driver, released on 9/30, state: ” Added support for TI TPS65983 PD Controller in SW, SDK API and samples.” Other comments from various places in TI suggest that the TI TPS65983 controller wasn’t available until January 2016 at the very earliest. Development support for the chip was still limited to by request only as of April, and the configuration tools TI offers for other chips weren’t available until the very end of March. In short, the bulk of the evidence suggests that full support for the TPS65983 controller has taken 6-10 months to appear and was only recently added to Intel’s own SDKs. It’s also unclear what the actual difference is between the two chips. I’m certain TI is right when it calls the 983 chip a “special product,” but I’ve paged through the data sheets for the 982 and the 983 and found nothing at all to distinguish them. They have identical circuit diagrams, identical layouts, and once you correct for some small variation in verbiage, identical features. How many people are going to be harmed by this? Probably not very many. Thunderbolt 3 is new, the MacBook Pro is new, and new hardware variants will adopt the 983 chip. Nonetheless, this is something Apple could’ve entirely prevented by either supporting the 982 chip in macOS or simply telling people from stage that only new Thunderbolt 3 peripherals would be compatible with the MacBook Pro. But I suppose it was just easier to call the whole thing “courageous” and leave it at that. This isn’t going to put a shine on the new MacBook Pro systems, and it’s an absurd situation all around. The type of controller chip used inside a peripheral interconnect should be of absolutely no regard to anyone looking for a new laptop. Having to juggle which hardware is compatible with which systems when they all support the same standard is absurd. Hopefully Apple will patch support for the TPS65982 chip into macOS.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 9, 2016 2:13 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Personal Technology Computer Hardware Comments It's fun to buy a drone from a store, but perhaps more satisfying to build one from scratch. Intel in December will start shipping a fully loaded drone kit to let you do just that, with all the parts including the rotors, software, 3D camera and flight controller. Intel's Aero Ready to Fly Drone kit will go on sale on the company's website. An Intel spokeperson couldn't immediately provide a price. But it won't be cheap -- likely more than $600. The quadcopter kit has parts that Intel uses to build its own drones. On the company's part, the drone airshows it has organized are getting ambitious: The company has >put up 100, and most recently, >500 drones in the sky. Drones themselves are getting sophisticated. DJI's Phantom has chips and 3D cameras that can navigate safely while avoiding collisions. The Intel Aero Ready to Fly Drone kit has the 3D RealSense camera, which can measure distances and recognize objects and help the drones, when programmed correctly, to fly autonomously to a given destination. The 3D RealSense camera attaches to a central computer called the Aero Compute Board, which gives the drone its computing horsepower. (Intel also sells the Aero Compute Board separately for $399.) It is powered by a quad-core Atom X7-Z8700 CPU code-named Cherry Trail. It also has LTE, 802.11ac Wi-Fi and a flight controller. The board also has 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM, 16GB of flash storage, a micro-SD slot, a micro-HDMI port, and a wide set of connectors for adapters and breakout boards. It also has the Altera Max 10 FPGA, which can reprogrammed for image recognition, navigation and other deep-learning tasks. The drone will work with the Airmap software development kit for navigation. Programming will also be required to put the drone in the air. For example, you can use the RealSense SDK to program image recognition for the 3D camera. An overview on how to build drones from the recent Embedded Linux Conference Europe 2016 is available on >Youtube. The kit will ship in some countries in North America, Europe and Asia. For U.S. buyers Intel has included a caveat relating to government regulations on requiring authorization to fly drones. Have fun, but be careful. If you crash a drone, you'll have to reinvest in a new kit. RELATED TOPICS Personal Technology Computer Hardware Agam Shah — U.S. Correspondent The latest in IT services?

Intel Vulkan Driver Lands Major Performance Boost, RADV Lands GPU Hang Fixes Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 9 November 2016 at 03:06 PM EST. 5 Comments It's yet another exciting afternoon in Mesa Git world for both of the mainline Vulkan drivers: the Intel "ANV" Vulkan Linux driver and the unofficial "RADV" Radeon Vulkan driver. For the Intel Vulkan driver, the batch of commits hitting mainline a short time ago are the changes for doing re-locations in user-space, which leads to around a 30% performance boost at least for Skylake hardware with Dota 2 while Talos Principle should see similar boosts. Great to see that code going mainline and will have some fresh Intel Vulkan benchmarks shortly. Then within the RADV driver today is enabling conditional discard optimizations while prior to that it was adding the optimization for NIR. Enabling this is said to fix "a bunch of GPU hangs" brought around by some conformance test cases for Vulkan. This optimization is a candidate for backporting to Mesa 13.0 given it fixes hangs/bugs.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 9, 2016 at 2:17PM In late October, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its next-generation MacBook Pro laptops. One interesting feature of these systems is that the company replaced the legacy USB ports with Thunderbolt 3 ports (two on the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro; four on the higher-end 13-inch model with Touch Bar as well as on the 15-inch model). Apple's new MacBook Pro computers use Thunderbolt 3 for connectivity. Image source: Apple.  Per a teardown report from iFixit, the Thunderbolt 3 capability inside of the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro is provided by an Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) JHL6540 Thunderbolt 3 controller. It is likely that the MacBook Pro models sporting four Thunderbolt 3 ports will include two of these controllers, as Intel's specification page for the JHL6540 part says that it only supports two Thunderbolt 3 ports.  In addition to supplying Thunderbolt controllers into Apple's new MacBook Pro systems, Intel also provides the main processors for all current Mac systems.  During Intel's 2015 investor meeting, former Intel PC chief Kirk Skaugen said that the company plans to integrate Thunderbolt into its processors over the "next several years." Let's take a closer look at when we should expect it and what it will mean for Intel and PC makers such as Apple. The implications for Intel Skaugen's comment about Thunderbolt integration came as part of a broader discussion on the reasons that Intel generally integrates functionality previously handled in stand-alone chips into its processors. "We have a history of intelligent integration," Skaugen began. "If you look at audio, Iris graphics, touch controllers, image processing units, sensor hubs, and security, all of these when we integrate we add a little bit to our average selling price, we give a little back to our OEM, and we give a little bit back to the end user." This commentary suggests that when Thunderbolt capability is integrated directly into Intel's future processors, Intel will be able to charge customers more for those processors -- a clear win for Intel. Intel's specification page shows list prices for its Thunderbolt controllers ranging from $6.45 to $8.55. If Thunderbolt integration allows Intel to raise its Core processor average selling prices by just $2 to $3, then Intel could be looking at hundreds of millions of incremental annual revenues. That's not chump change. The implications for personal computer makers Skaugen's comments imply that the cost of a processor with integrated Thunderbolt to a system vendor will be lower than what the cost of an Intel processor coupled with stand-alone Thunderbolt 3 controllers would be. The impact to a company like Apple, which has already gone all-in on Thunderbolt/USB Type C, will likely just be that their systems become a little bit cheaper to build. The savings won't be huge, but most for-profit entities tend to like opportunities to shave off unnecessary costs.  The other system vendors that haven't yet adopted the technology may be compelled to do so once it comes standard with every Intel processor.  Thunderbolt is a marketable technology that offers a significant performance boost over prior-generation USB technology; if some system vendors adopt it, the system vendors that don't could be putting themselves at senseless disadvantages in the marketplace.  Thunderbolt 3 is apparently much faster than prior technologies. Image source: Intel.  Furthermore, if the technology will be integrated into future Intel processors anyway, and if the system vendors are going to pay for those processors whether or not they use Thunderbolt, then why not just implement it?  With a proliferation of systems with Thunderbolt support, it is likely that computer peripheral makers will more aggressively design their products to provide native support for and take full advantage of the standard.

System engineers can immediately deploy them to upgrade existing Pico-ITX and Mini-ITX designs and benefit from approximately 30% more processing power and 45% more graphics performance compared to the previous generations . With improved performance per watt, they unleash more performance at a given thermal envelope or improve energy consumption and battery life for given performance requirements. Application areas for these new boards are numerous and range from small sized handheld devices, box PCs and IoT gateways to industrial-grade Thin Clients, slim HMIs and low-power GUIs. Markets can be found in smart homes and smart cities, digital signage and retail, medical technology, gaming and industrial automation, as well as in shop floor and logistic systems. The new conga-PA5 Pico-ITX SBCs and conga-IA5 Mini-ITX motherboards feature impressive security enhancements, improved real-time computing capabilities as well as the ability to keep the embedded systems of IoT devices in sync. This is of great importance for connected applications such as digital video surveillance, vision based robotics, industry 4.0 connected devices, traffic control and smart energy grids, as well as various connected computing nodes on ships, planes, trains, automobiles and more. “With the new boards, the extended temperature range of -40° C to +85° C is back again on the supported features list. Consequently, all older Bay Trail processor based designs can now switch to the significantly higher performing new processing cores with enhanced feature set. This makes this new generation of motherboards and single board computers far more attractive than its Braswell processor based forerunners,” explains Martin Danzer “For IoT designers, the new SIM card socket on our Thin Mini-ITX boards is of particular interest as it enables new and very fast cellular connectivity options with up to several hundreds of Mbit/s and even more with upcoming virtualized 4G/5G networks.” The feature sets in detail congatec’s new conga-IA5 Thin Mini-ITX boards and the comparably slim line conga-PA5 Pico-ITX SBCs are equipped with the particularly energy-saving Intel® Atom™ processors E3930, E3940 and E3950 for the industrial-grade extended temperature range of -40° C to +85° C, or are fitted with the higher performing low-power dual-core Intel® Celeron® N3350 and quad-core Intel® Pentium® N4200 processors. All variants offer the high-performance Intel Gen9 graphics with up to 18 execution units and support up to three independent high-resolution 4k displays via 2x DP++ with full 4k@60Hz and dual channel LVDS. The conga-IA5 comes with up to 8 GB DDR3L of power saving RAM for cost sensitive applications, whereas the conga-PA5 offers 8 GB LPDDR4 RAM onboard with up to 2,400 MT/s.

Page 1 of 6. 24 Comments Kaby Lake mobile processors began shipping last month and while we've seen a number of laptop designs using these processors that succeed Skylake, so far the Intel NUCs haven't surfaced nor many other SFF PCs making use of the next-generation hardware. That changed last week with MSI's Cubi 2 powered by Kaby Lake CPUs beginning to ship. I've been testing an MSI Cubi 2 with Core i5 Kaby Lake processor under Ubuntu Linux and so far the experience has been pleasant. In this article are our first Kaby Lake Linux benchmarks. On 4 November is when the MSI Cubi 2 with Kaby Lake CPUs began shipping at both Amazon.com and NewEgg. With being very curious about Intel Kaby Lake on Linux and the Cubi 2 being the cheapest way to get ahold of a KBL CPU for right now, I ended up buying the Core i5 7200U model for benchmarking on Phoronix. The Cubi 2 is around the same size as an Intel NUC and their Cubi2-006BUS model with Core i5 7200U retails for $380 USD while you still need to add in the DDR4 SO-DIMMs and SATA/M.2 storage. Kaby Lake came around when Intel delayed the 10nm Cannonlake to H2'2017. Kaby Lake CPUs are manufactured on a 14nm process while offering higher clock speeds over similar Skylake models, native USB 3.1 Gen2 support is now present, support for Intel Optane technology, and improved 3D graphics / video are more pressing for Kaby Lake than any major CPU breakthroughs with this microarchitecture update. The Core i5 7200U mobile processor found in this Cubi 2 being benchmarked is a dual-core part plus has Hyper Threading, the base frequency is 2.50GHz, and the turbo frequency is 3.1GHz. The TDP of the i5-7200U is 15 Watts and this processor has a 3MB smart cache. The graphics on the Core i5 7200U are the HD Graphics 620 with a 300MHz base frequency and 1GHz maximum frequency. This was my first time trying out a Cubi 2 -- or any MSI pre-built PC since the Wind Box Atom 330 days. The Cubi 2 concept is similar to the Intel NUC and is very easy to open up the device from the bottom and install the DDR4-2133 SO-DIMMs (up to 32GB) and 2.5-inch SATA SSD or mSATA SSD. The Cubi 2 does support a VESA-mount with included bracket, similar to the NUCs. For wireless connectivity the device has an Intel 3168 M.2 WiFi adapter for 802.11ac WiFi support and Bluetooth 4.2. Video connectivity for the HD Graphics 620 are HDMI and a mini DisplayPort. 4K display was working fine for me with this device. This device also has a USB Gen 1 Type-C reversible connector. If you are looking for something slower or faster, MSI's other Kaby Lake Cubi 2 models have a Core i7 7500U or Core i3 7100U while the other specifications remain the same.

Windows 10 Mobile review: A new hope? Blass says the two companies started working on the project, known internally as Dell Stack, in mid-2014 and it focuses on a 6.4-inch mini-tablet that would be used to power desktop, laptop and tablet computing experiences. The aim of the alleged project would be to combine all your devices into one, to save you moving data from one device to the next, or having to upload it to the cloud to then download to another device. Everything would always be on the one Stack tablet which would be moved from screen to screen. The Dell Stack would make full use of Windows 10's Continuum feature, which lets a device running Windows 10 Mobile connect to a screen and deliver a simplified version of Windows 10. Windows 10 Mobile devices can't support a full version of Windows 10 because of hardware limitations, but they can support Universal Windows Platform apps (UWP). What makes the Stack different though is that it would be able to deliver a full Windows 10 desktop experience when docked because it would use an x86 CPU from Intel's Kaby Lake Y-series of processors. It would come in different memory and storage configurations, having either 4GB or 8GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB solid state storage as well as a microSD slot for expansion. And everything would be housed in a body no thicker than 9mm. Microsoft Windows 10 Creators Update: What's new? The Venture Beat report also mentions a second generation that would have a 6-inch screen and full phone and messaging functions, essentially a Windows 10 smartphone. Nobody knows whether the project will come to fruition though. The first products were due to be launched in Spring 2017, but there's still been no official announcement from Dell. It could be that Stack is a concept vision of Dell's, but the actual products released, if any will be a more diluted vision taking inspiration from these plans. Images leaked a couple of days ago alleging to be a Windows Surface phone. It could now be that it's the Dell Stack. We're keen to follow for any updates because if Stack does happen, it could be a seriously powerful computing experience.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Samsung announces fourth-gen 14nm node, plans 10nm improvements, and shows off 7nm EUV wafer Samsung announces fourth-gen 14nm node, plans 10nm improvements, and shows off 7nm EUV wafer By Joel Hruska on November 4, 2016 at 8:51 am Comment Samsung announced several updates to its process technology roadmap today at its Samsung Foundry Forum. Like Intel, Samsung intends to offer multiple generations of a single process node — but unlike Intel, it isn’t debuting a new strategy in lieu of maintaining a quick transition roadmap. First, there’s interesting news concerning a fourth-generation 14nm product, 14LPU. For those keeping score at home, Samsung released 14nm Low Power Early (14LPE) first, followed by 14nm Low Power Plus (14LPP), which was broader ramp with more customers and up to 10% improved performance. Earlier this year, the company announced it would build a lower-cost variant of 14nm that didn’t sacrifice on power or performance, 14LPC. This fourth-generation 14LPU is meant explicitly for customers who are building “high performance, compute-intensive” applications. 14LPU is said to offer better performance than 14LPC, but Samsung hasn’t published details on how all four of its processes compare with one another; only 14LPP and 14LPE are listed on its website. It’s not hard to read between these particular lines, however. When foundries add new iterations of existing process nodes, it’s typically because they’ve got customers who are interested in those process nodes and want to take advantage of them. Adding a higher power line could mean that Samsung wants to compete for more business from AMD, Nvidia, or even Qualcomm’s server processor — or it could be that Samsung meant relatively high-performance parts, and that it’s still focusing on lower power hardware at relatively low TDPs. Either way, Samsung clearly believes that 14nm will stick around as a long-lived node, and is worth investing in. Samsung’s new 14nm LPU and 10nm LPU aren’t shown here, but this was cutting-edge information as of October 2016 The company is still pushing ahead with its plans to roll out 10nm technology, however, and has also announced a new 10nm node, 10LPU. The company describes this as follows: Due to limitations of current lithography technologies, 10LPU is expected to be the most cost-effective cutting-edge process technology in the industry. Together with the second-generation 10nm process (10LPP) that offers an extra performance boost from 10LPE, 10LPU is positioned to meet the needs of an extended range of applications that can benefit from the advanced 10nm process. Samsung seems to be implying that 14LPU is a higher performance node, while 10LPU is a cost-optimized node. Meanwhile, the company also showed off a 7nm EUV wafer and provided an “update” on its 7nm EUV progress, but neglected to tell us anything about what that update was. This is one area where there’s notable difference between the various foundries — Intel says it intends to push to 7nm without EUV, but will deploy that tech at 5nm. TSMC has said something similar, but Samsung remains resolute that it can introduce EUV at the 7nm node. The question of who will use that capacity is less clear. The number of companies deploying cutting-edge process nodes has dwindled as design costs have exploded, and there’s money to be made in improving yields and performance at older process nodes, if anyone can figure out how to do it. It’ll be interesting to see how the TSMC / Samsung / GlobalFoundries match-up shifts over the next 12 to 18 months. Samsung beat TSMC to the 14/16nm node and reaped substantial financial benefits from doing so, while GF had to license Samsung tech rather than continue developing its own 14XM. Now, GlobalFoundries says it’ll bring its own 7nm to market, while TSMC is gunning hard for 10nm. With fewer companies designing on cutting-edge nodes, it means there’s less room for error than ever.

At the property of tech giant Intel, a few of them cross to the east side of the creek on a wooden bridge called “The Freedom Bridge.” They might not have that option much longer. Despite its name, the Freedom Bridge is ensnared in a bureaucratic tussle involving Intel, the Santa Clara Valley Water District and the city of Santa Clara. And if it disappears, a cadre of bicyclists and pedestrians will be inconvenienced. Here’s the story as I can gather it: The Freedom Bridge was built by Intel less than two decades ago, when the company owned property on both sides of the creek. It was initially meant to be temporary, a bridge for construction crews. Then it became a popular route to work. Santa Clara officials say Intel recently sold the property on the west side of the creek to Greystar, an apartment developer. That change of ownership has renewed doubts about the bridge from the water district, which says the crossing fails to meet its standards for trail connections and access ramps for walkers and the disabled. Meanwhile, the bicyclists have been waging a last-ditch — pun intended — campaign to save the bridge, which could be demolished as early as Sept. 16, after Intel’s permit for the crossing expires. If the bridge comes down, bicyclists and pedestrians would have to circle north via a very busy Mission College Boulevard. Safety issue “We believe that spending money to demolish the bridge would make bicycle commuting harder,” says Robert W. Herrick, a regular bicycle commuter who has led the effort to save the bridge. “It would create a safety problem that would result in dozens of injuries per year.” There may be an answer here through the good graces of the city of Santa Clara: Councilwoman Teresa O’Neill, the chairwoman of the City Council’s bicycle and pedestrian committee, has suggested extending Intel’s permit for the bridge for at least another six months to find a solution. “We need to have time to see what it would take to bring it up to standards,” says O’Neill, who says — rightly — that demolition would be a step backward for the city’s emphasis on alternatives to cars. There’s also the thorny question of liability. O’Neill told me that neither the water district nor Intel wants to take on the liability if someone is injured on the bridge. Put another way, nobody wants to deal with the lawyers. Maintenance The public record suggests that the water district, which I dubbed “The Golden Spigot” for its free-spending ways, doesn’t really like the bridge. In a letter to a constituent, board Chairwoman Barbara Keegan said bridges “pose an ongoing maintenance issue for us.” When I talked to her, Keegan left the door open to saving the bridge. “Certainly, the district would be happy to consider an extension to the permit to see if there are things that could be done to make this a long-term facility,” she told me. “That would mean meeting current standards in terms of pedestrian and bicycle bridges. And it would have to provide full access to city streets.” A spokesperson for Intel said only that the company continues to talk with the water district. But I’ve talked to several Intel employees who say the company is willing to do some work — but believes that several water district demands, such as widening access ways or making the bridge an explicit public access point, infringe on its property. So we’re left with a standoff — very Californian in this new century. I happen to think there’s a way to solve this one. It begins with time. The Freedom Bridge — wooden, utilitarian, very unfancy — deserves a six-month or yearlong reprieve. We’ll figure it out from there.

Yeah, probably going to be a very high clocked 4core chip.. 4.5Ghz+ for sure, given that high TDP 114W.. Although I was a bit surprised to see entry 6core SkylakeX, was almost positive it will be 8core as entry not another 6core.     -Tj- View Public Profile Find all posts by -Tj-   (#7) VENGEANCE Member Guru   Videocard: GALAX GTX 1070 HOF @2164 Processor: 3570k at 4.3 +Corsair h50 Mainboard: Asrock z77 Memory: Gskill trident x 2400 Soundcard: onboard realtek PSU: 1000 Watt Aerocool 11-09-2016, 21:02 | posts: 144 now i dont understand the reason for the big cpu ...2-8 cores are done on a smaller die anyone know?     VENGEANCE View Public Profile Find all posts by VENGEANCE   (#8) FatBoyNL Maha Guru     Videocard: MSI GTX 970 Gaming 4G Processor: i7-2600K 45x100 Mugen2B Mainboard: Asus P8Z68 Deluxe 3603 Memory: 16GB G.Skill Sn-F3 1866C9 Soundcard: ZxR|RX-A1020 DT880|MT-60D PSU: CM Silent Pro Gold 800W 11-09-2016, 21:11 | posts: 1,435 | Location: The Netherlands Quote: Originally Posted by VENGEANCE now i dont understand the reason for the big cpu ...2-8 cores are done on a smaller die anyone know?

I really doubt the kabylake-X chip will be much faster than the regular desktop part. they have probably just allowed ECC on the memory, and some other Enterprise features not found on the Desktop version. that could account for the slight increase in TDP.

Then you'll want one of our best ultrabooks under $500. If you’re in the market for a new laptop and need a productivity powerhouse on a budget, you might be asking yourself: what’s the best ultrabook under $500 in 2016? With the release of Intel’s latest 7th-generation Core processors, the answer to that question is growing into a longer list by the day. For this list, we wanted to keep our eyes set on ultrabooks that offer a great value for the money, with at least 4GB of RAM, a 500GB hard drive, and the aforementioned 7th-gen processors. All those factors considered, we’ve come to the conclusion that the #1 pick is the new Aspire E 15 series. The Aspire line has always been an incredible series of laptops, but the E 15 takes it to the next level thanks to its low price point, 1920 x 1080 screen, and internal upgrade to DDR4 RAM. That all said, you might want to check our best value ultrabook list, which comes in at a higher price point but adds bang for buck. Best Ultrabook Under $500 2016   Acer Aspire E 15 Dell Inspiron 11 3179 HP 15-ay011nr Rank #1 - Editor's Choice/ Best 2-in-1 Ultrabook #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating Screen Size 15.6" 13.3" 15.6" Display 1920 x 1080 1366 x 768 1920 x 1080 Battery Life Up to 12hrs Up to 10hrs Up to 8hrs Touchscreen CPU 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-7100U 2.6GHz Intel Core m3-7y30 2.3GHz Intel Core i5-6200U RAM 4GB DDR4 4GB DDR3L 8 GB DDR3L Storage 1TB HDD 500GB HDD 1TB HDD Weight 5.27 pounds 3.24 pounds 4.73 pounds Price $349.99 $449.99 $459.99 Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now How We Choose the Ultrabook Under $500 When we talk about the ultrabook category, the term “value” isn’t usually the first thing that pops up into people’s heads. But, thanks to Moore’s Law, now it’s possible to get many of the features you’d expect on a $1,500 laptop from two years ago on a sub-$500 device today. These include boot times from sleep that are under the one second mark, a minimum of 4GB of DDR3 (or DDR3L) RAM, an Intel Core i-X processor, and 500GB of onboard storage. Read More: What Is an Ultrabook? As Intel rolls out its brand spanking new 7th generation of its Core i processors, we kept a keen out for any laptops which included this feature since the fresh CPUs promise to be faster and more power efficient than anything else that came before. Lastly, it’s important to note that none of the choices on this list are specifically designated as “ultrabooks” by Intel, but that’s only because they’re missing one or two features each that hold them back from the proper distinction. Regular ultrabooks start no lower than $899, but the laptops here still match 90% of the criteria while costing significantly less overall. They may not be as slim or quick to boot as a designated ultrabook, they’re the closest (and fastest) you’re going to get in the under $500 range. Why You Should Buy an Ultrabook Under $500 Just because you want to own an ultrabook doesn’t always mean you have to pay an “ultra” high price for the privilege. Though ultrabooks spent years as one of the most expensive options available in the laptop market, as technology has gotten faster and cheaper, so have the prices of these once unattainable laptops fallen down to a point where they’re affordable for most consumers. If you haven’t looked for an ultrabook simply on the basis that owning one might be too expensive, it’s time to take a second look at what’s out there in 2016. #1 Pick  Acer Aspire E 15/Editor’s Choice With a super sleek design and an 7th-gen CPU, it’s not hard to see why the Acer Aspire E tops our list Price: $349.99 | Features: 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-7100U CPU, 12-hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Cutting edge features at a price that everyone can afford.  For everything the Acer Aspire E 15 lacks (any kind of SSD, to name one thing), it makes up for immediately with a bargain-basement price and the inclusion of an all new 7th-gen processor from Intel. Sporting a 2.4GHz Intel Core i3-7100U CPU, you can be sure that the Acer Aspire E 15 will last longer and run faster than any other laptop in this cost tier, not an easy feat considering what the rest of the competition is capable of. Tie that upgrade in with the choice to pump the 4GB of RAM up from DDR3L to DDR4 on the current model, and you’ve got a recipe for success for the best ultrabook under $500. View on Amazon #2 Pick Dell Inspiron 11 3179 2-in-1 If you need a cheaper 2-in-1 with decent specs, the Dell Inspiron checks off every box on your list Price: $449.99  | Features: 2-in-1 hinge, 11.6″ touchscreen, 4GB DDR4 RAM WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell is a solid 2-in-1 under $500 with a touchscreen for work or play.  Like the Aspire, the Inspiron line of laptops from Dell have been a flagship seller for the brand, leading the way when it comes to power and price on nearly every front imaginable. The latest off that roster is the Dell Inspiron 11 3179 (Inspiron i3179 for short), a 2-in-1 ultrabook that comes with a fully responsive touchscreen that’s great for taking notes or playing games on the go. Read More: Best 2-in-1 Ultrabooks This ultrabook comes equipped with an Intel Core m3-7y30 as opposed to a Core i CPU, so while it may not necessarily be as fast as the Aspire off the line, it’s got more than enough power efficiency to last for the long haul. If your main concern is with the screen then you might want to skip the Inspiron (it only rocks a less-than-HD 1366 x 768 resolution), but other than that small caveat it’s still got all the specs we crave at a price that won’t leave you scraping out your pockets by the time you leave the checkout line. View on Amazon #3 Pick  HP 15-ay011nr 15.6″ Despite its wacky name scheme, there’s nothing silly about these specs Price: $459.99  | Features: 15.6″ 1920 x 1080 display, 8GB DDR3L SDRAM, 2.3GHz Core i5-6200U CPU WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: For all out power, the HP 15-ay011nr can’t be beat.  Awkward naming schemes aside, the HP 15-ay011nr is a solid, respectable ultrabook under $500 that will get the job done that you need it to when you’re in a pinch. Although it may not sport the bleeding edge of processors, it offsets its 6th generation roots with increased power by bumping things up to an i5 CPU, unlike the i3 and m3 found in the Acer and Dell. Read More: Best Ultrabook Under $1,000 This laptop is a little heavier than we might like, but it combines all the features an ultrabook needs with media features and a beefier GPU in case you want to take a little time off work to play games instead. For an all-around choice that will be just as proficient in the office as it will at home, it’s hard to find an ultrabook under $500 that offers a better slew of available add-ons. View on Amazon Most Important Features Weight Ultrabooks are made to be portable, because you never know when a work emergency might pop up and you’ll need to be online within seconds. All the laptops here are less than 5lbs, though the HP is the heaviest of the bunch. If you want something light and lean, go with the Acer E series. The new processor helps to save on weight that would otherwise be packed into the battery, thanks to its increased ability to use that power on a more efficient basis. Battery life Ultrabooks are known for their long battery life, and if you need a laptop that will last through long periods without being plugged in, you’ve come to the right place. All the laptops listed here have a minimum battery life of at least 8 hours, a stat that Intel themselves mandate if a laptop wants the honor of being able to call itself an ultrabook at all. Display Two of the three ultrabooks listed here have full HD, 1920 x 1080 screens that would look good at work or for watching a few episodes of Game of Thrones after you get back from the office. One is a touchscreen, though, which means the cost of a capacitive screen goes up. That’s why the Dell still rocks the 1366 x 768 lower resolution display, so if that’s your main concern, you’re better off going with the Acer or the HP instead. Price Of course, this wouldn’t be a list of the best ultrabooks under $500 if we didn’t talk about the price, right? On average, getting any kind of laptop under $500 means you’re going to have to make a few sacrifices along the way. Namely, this will happen with the GPU. Don’t expect to be playing any heavy duty games on these laptops, but as long as you’re okay with giving those up, everything else should measure up just fine. Mistakes or Things to Avoid Avoid DDR3: All the laptops we’ve included on this list use at least DDR3L or DDR4 RAM, both options that use drastically less power than their older counterpart, DDR3. DDR3 is quickly being phased out of all models past the 2016 mark, so if you can afford to upgrade, this is the first place you’re going to want to do it. Don’t Compromise: Although we’ve listed our personal top 3 picks here, there are plenty of options out there to choose from when it comes to ultrabooks. If you want a better screen but don’t care about having a large hard drive because you store all your files in the cloud, then get a better screen with a flash drive instead! With ultrabooks the possibilities are nearly endless, so never compromise just because you think you have to when you’re sticking to a smaller budget. What Else You Should Think About Now that you’ve got your pick for the best ultrabook under $500, what other considerations should you make about your new laptop and all the cool things you plan to do with it? First of all, you should definitely check out our post on Ultrabooks vs Chromebooks to get the lowdown on what makes your ultrabook better than the Chromed out competition. Next, if you want the absolute lightest Ultrabook possible and have a little bit more than $500 to spend, we also have a great resource on the Lightest Ultrabooks in 2016 for you to peruse. Ultimately it’s obvious that the Acer Aspire E is a solid value with great features that run at the cutting edge of what ultrabooks are capable of these days, but remember there’s always plenty of options out there no matter what you need your laptop to do!

This NVMe SSD will come in a M.2 2280 form factor and use the PCI-Express 3.0 x4 interface. The 610p will be available in capacities of 128, 256, 512GB and 1 and 2 TB.   The information comes from the Taiwanese website BenchLife who also posted a snippet of an Intel roadmap. The roadmap indicates the 610p will be based on 3D TLC NAND flash memory from Intel and Micron’s IMFlash joint venture. Users who are interested in in the 610p series SSDs will have to wait a little, according to BenchLife the drives will come no earlier than the 4th quarter of 2017. Intel also appears to be planning a BGA version of the 600p series. These are multi-chip modules that combine the NAND memory and the SSD controller in a single package. These are especially useful for laptops and small-form factor desktops. The 600p BGA variant will come in a M.2 1620 formfactor and will be available in capacities of 128, 256 and 512GB.

Windows 10 Mobile, for now at least, is an operating system for ARM-based devices only. But could -- and should -- it one day also power Intel-based tablets and phones? By Mary Jo Foley for All About Microsoft | November 8, 2016 -- 20:12 GMT (12:12 PST) | Topic: Windows 10 Right now, Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft's version of Windows 10 for small-screen devices, runs only on ARM. But that isn't stopping people from speculating if and when Windows 10 Mobile might run on Intel chips. When Microsoft was developing the first version of Windows 10, the company's plan was to enable Windows 10 Mobile to run on ARM and Intel, my sources told me repeatedly. Whenever I wrote about Windows 10 in the build-up to RTM of the first version in July 2015, I described Windows 10 Mobile as "the version of Windows 10 that is expected to work on Windows Phones and smaller Windows tablets running ARM and most likely Intel processors." But when Microsoft finally released Windows 10 to the masses, Windows 10 Mobile was an ARM-only operating system. And, since that time, this has continued to be the case. More Windows 10 Microsoft: Windows 7 is way more exposed to ransomware than Windows 10 Windows 10 supremacy? Eve V comes gunning for Microsoft's mighty Surface Pro 4 Microsoft releases Windows 10 Creators Update test build 14965 Tips, tricks and shortcuts: Ed Bott makes Windows 10 work for you Microsoft quietly fixes second Surface Pro 3 battery problem Windows 10 tip: How to enable the built-in Administrator account (and why you shouldn't) While some company watchers said they believed Microsoft's long-rumored Surface Phone might be an Intel-based device, I never heard that from my contacts. Whenever I heard from my contacts about a Surface Phone, the device always was described as ARM-based, which makes sense to me, as ARM continues to be a better in terms of power efficiency. Traditional Win32 apps can't run on ARM-based devices, but Remote Desktop software/services does provide a solution (though a complex and often pricey one) I went back and looked at notes from a conversation I had with Windows and Devices chief Terry Myerson just prior to the Aug. 2 release this year of Windows 10 'Redstone 1". (I didn't run his response on mobile and chipsets before now, as it didn't seem material to my post about the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.) But here's what Myerson told me when I asked about Windows 10 Mobile ever running on Intel: "Today, Windows Mobile is for 7- or 8-inch devices running the ARM chipset. Over time, you will see our goal is to give partners access to all screen sizes and chip sets of choice." I have no idea how much time "over time" implies. I also have no idea whether the Intel-based, Windows 10 "Dell Stack" tablet and phone devices described by Evan Blass in a recent VentureBeat post will ever materialize. (Blass said Dell and Intel were working together on the concepts since 2014, which means they may have withered when Microsoft's initial plans to have Windows 10 Mobile run on Intel didn't materialize right out of the gate. Or maybe the tablet shown in the renders Blass posted was/is just going to run plain-old Windows 10 and not Windows 10 Mobile.) Going back to Windows 10 Mobile, Myerson's comments do leave the door open, at least hypothetically, for Windows 10 Mobile to run one day on Intel. For now, however, Microsoft engineers seem intent on honing Windows 10 Mobile as Microsoft's Windows on ARM and cellular play, as Myerson told me a couple of weeks ago.

X Ireland needs a trade strategy to avoid getting Trumped Trump’s ‘America first’ trade and tax policy will have major implications for Ireland Wed, Nov 9, 2016, 14:59 Padraig Cronin If Trump reduces corporate tax, Ireland’s ability to attract FDI from US companies such as Intel could be under threat.         Donald Trump will now have a major influence on the world, including Ireland, and his approach to taxation and trade will have major implications for Ireland. Whether we like him or not is irrelevant – his approach and stated tax and trade positions, which include lowering the federal corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent and to pursue an “America first” trade policy, could have a significant impact on our small open economy. We do not know whether Trump will do in office all the things he said he would do during the campaign. But he will serve four years as president at a minimum. Ireland needs to work with him, his administration and friends of Ireland in Washington. However, most critical now is for us to take a fresh look at our market position and foreign direct investment (FDI) strategy to ensure they will continue to work well for us in the changed US political landscape.   There are a number of options open to us including lowering our corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent, seeking a more flexible application of EU fiscal rules which currently limit capital investment in infrastructure, and increasing our efforts to support the re-emerging indigenous sector. We must also focus on non-tax factors such as political and economic stability, our regulatory regime, labour availability, operating costs and market access in order to retain our FDI companies. Trump proposes lowering the US federal corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent and provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a onetime rate of 10 per cent (payable over 10 years). Special deductions He proposes eliminating most corporate tax special deductions – expenses businesses can offset against profits for tax purposes – except for R&D. Firms engaged in manufacturing in the US may elect to expense capital investment and lose deductibility of corporate interest expense. ADVERTISEMENT Assad ready to co-operate with Trump on Islamic State Kathy Sheridan: What can liberals learn from the US election? Journalists are helping to create a dangerous consensus Under Trump’s stated corporate tax regime, US corporate tax would in future apply to a US-headquartered multinational corporation’s (MNC) worldwide income, with a credit given for taxes paid in other countries. This would end the current law’s deferral of tax on these profits until repatriated. Aligned to the above, he intends to pursue an “America first” trade policy. The underlying assumption is that his changes would bring a much higher level of annual economic growth, thus creating a larger economy, and that this would “pay” for the dramatic reduction in the corporate tax rate. From an Irish perspective, the concern is that large reductions in the US corporate tax rate and the repeal of deferral would reduce the incentive for companies to locate activities outside the US, including in Ireland. In particular, business functions that do not need to be close to a key market location will now be more likely carried out in the US than elsewhere. As tax will no longer be one of the key drivers of decisions as to where to locate, the focus of US businesses in future will be more on political environment, economic stability, regulatory regime, labour availability, operating costs, market access and so on. In essence, non-tax factors will determine the location of business activities. Solid footprint Ireland already does well in this regard: MNCs who are “talent seekers” choose Ireland because of its educated and experienced workforce. We will need to build on this solid footprint if we are to avoid any erosion in our MNC base. Ireland needs to review its FDI strategy to ensure it is fit for purpose in this new paradigm. Our 12.5 per cent transparent tax regime would no longer be a unique selling point. The force of attraction back to “home office” driven by a new US tax regime will negatively impact Ireland in terms of its FDI base of companies in the medium term. Hence, in the short term, we need to hone our market and brand proposition to adjust it to the new reality. An opportunity lies with regard to activities located in countries where the corporate tax rate is in excess of 15 per cent, eg France and Germany. Given that US MNCs would pay tax at 15 per cent on their worldwide income, they may become very focused on avoiding foreign taxes in excess of this rate. This could result in the relocation of non-local market critical functions in an EU context from countries such as Germany and France to say, Ireland. Obviously, such an evolution is only effective if the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base does not become a reality. Non-tax factors There are a number of actions Ireland must now consider. Given the focus on non-tax factors, more capital investment in infrastructure is critical. EU fiscal rules are currently limiting our ability in this regard. For 2017 total capital spending is to be €4.5 billion spread relatively thinly across areas, with roughly 25 per cent allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and 13 per cent allocated to education and housing respectively. The overall capital spending budget is set to grow to €6 billion by 2019 – to about 10 per cent of overall expenditure from about 7.5 per cent in 2016. Whilst this increase is welcome given the Brexit and now US “headwinds”, we need to achieve more flexibility from Brussels to allow greater capital investment in the productive capacity of the economy. Location is ultimately about real people and their families. Unless the housing, education and personal taxation “package” is made fit for purpose, we are at risk of our FDI base eroding, leading to negative growth over time. ADVERTISEMENT Finally, we need to redouble our efforts to support the re-emerging indigenous sector to ensure our economy has a better balance over the medium term.

In particular, business functions that do not need to be close to a key market location will now be more likely carried out in the US than elsewhere. As tax will no longer be one of the key drivers of decisions as to where to locate, the focus of US businesses in future will be more on political environment, economic stability, regulatory regime, labour availability, operating costs, market access and so on. In essence, non-tax factors will determine the location of business activities. Solid footprint Ireland already does well in this regard: MNCs who are “talent seekers” choose Ireland because of its educated and experienced workforce. We will need to build on this solid footprint if we are to avoid any erosion in our MNC base. Ireland needs to review its FDI strategy to ensure it is fit for purpose in this new paradigm. Our 12.5 per cent transparent tax regime would no longer be a unique selling point. The force of attraction back to “home office” driven by a new US tax regime will negatively impact Ireland in terms of its FDI base of companies in the medium term. Hence, in the short term, we need to hone our market and brand proposition to adjust it to the new reality. An opportunity lies with regard to activities located in countries where the corporate tax rate is in excess of 15 per cent, eg France and Germany. Given that US MNCs would pay tax at 15 per cent on their worldwide income, they may become very focused on avoiding foreign taxes in excess of this rate. This could result in the relocation of non-local market critical functions in an EU context from countries such as Germany and France to say, Ireland. Obviously, such an evolution is only effective if the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base does not become a reality. Non-tax factors There are a number of actions Ireland must now consider. Given the focus on non-tax factors, more capital investment in infrastructure is critical. EU fiscal rules are currently limiting our ability in this regard. For 2017 total capital spending is to be €4.5 billion spread relatively thinly across areas, with roughly 25 per cent allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and 13 per cent allocated to education and housing respectively. The overall capital spending budget is set to grow to €6 billion by 2019 – to about 10 per cent of overall expenditure from about 7.5 per cent in 2016. Whilst this increase is welcome given the Brexit and now US “headwinds”, we need to achieve more flexibility from Brussels to allow greater capital investment in the productive capacity of the economy. Location is ultimately about real people and their families. Unless the housing, education and personal taxation “package” is made fit for purpose, we are at risk of our FDI base eroding, leading to negative growth over time. ADVERTISEMENT Finally, we need to redouble our efforts to support the re-emerging indigenous sector to ensure our economy has a better balance over the medium term.

By Wayne Williams Published 2 weeks ago 33 Comments Tweet Last Wednesday, Microsoft revealed, among other things, an updated Surface Book. The following day, Apple introduced a new MacBook Pro. Both devices look great, sport powerful innards and come with a suitably high price tag. Which you go for will likely depend on whether you’re a fan of Microsoft or Apple, but if you’re not firmly entrenched in either camp, and need a little guidance to decide which laptop to go for, here are all the details you need. Obviously, the Surface Book i7 and MacBook Pro 2016 aren’t exactly like for like. The Surface Book’s display detaches, for one thing, and it’s touch screen, but let’s see how they compare generally. Design The new Surface Book keeps the same design as the previous one, including the slightly divisive hinge that means the book doesn’t fully close. The screen can detach from the body and be used as a tablet. The laptop has a magnesium alloy body. The new MacBook Pro is -- you guessed it -- lighter and thinner than previous models. It has an all-metal body, and keeps the same simple, but stylish look, albeit with a few tweaks, such as a much larger touchpad. Size and Weight The MacBook Pro is available in two screen sizes -- 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch. The Surface Book only comes in one size -- 13.5-inch. Because Apple is fixated with thinness, it’s no surprise to see the MacBook Pro is the slimmest product at 0.6-inches, versus Surface Book’s 0.9 inches. As for weight, the MacBook Pro weighs in at 3lbs for the 13-inch device, and 4lbs for the 15-incher. The Surface Book is 3.3-3.6lbs, depending on the model (dGPU models weigh more). Display As I mentioned earlier, the Surface Book’s screen detaches, while the MacBook Pro’s doesn’t. The Surface Book only comes in one screen size -- 13.5-inch, while Apple’s product can be had in 13.3-inch and 15.4-inch sizes. The Surface Book offers a higher resolution display -- 3,000 x 2,000, versus 2,560 x 1,600 for the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 2,880 x 1,800 for the 15-inch model. The Surface Book has a full touch screen, and you can use it in tablet mode. The MacBook Pro has a Touch Bar, a long OLED Retina display that sits in place of the old function keys at the top of the keyboard. You can use this in various ways, and additional functionality will be added in time. Security The MacBook Pro offers Touch ID, so you can log into your laptop using a fingerprint. Surface Book doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner, but does have Windows Hello, which uses facial recognition to log you in. Processors The Surface Book and MacBook Pro can both be had in a choice of configurations, so you can opt for a sixth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7. The Surface Book offers either Nvidia GTX 965M GPU or Intel HD graphics, while the MacBook Pro has Integrated Intel Iris Graphics 540. The larger 15-inch model adds a Radeon Pro (450 or 455) chip for 3D gaming. Input The Surface Book comes with a Surface Pen, so you can draw on screen. That sort of behavior isn’t possible on the MacBook Pro, but you do get the Touch Bar and a super-sized touchpad with pressure-sensitive Force Touch technology. Battery Life If you’re a road warrior, the most juice you can get out of your laptop between charges the better. Apple’s battery life is not spectacular in this case. The new MacBook Pros promise around 10 hours of battery life, while the Surface Book claims between 12 to 16 hours. Storage and Memory The 13-inch MacBook Pro and the new Surface Book i7 are available in 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage configurations. The 15-inch MacBook Pro can be had with a 2TB SSD. Memory-wise, both the MacBook Pro and Surface Book can be had with 8GB or 16GB of RAM. Ports Apple has come under some fire for its ports choices with the new MacBook Pro. It offers four USB-C ports -- that double as Thunderbolt 3 ports -- which can be used for Thunderbolt, USB, DisplayPort, HDMI, VGI, and charging. (The basic 13-inch model only has two USB-C/Thunderbird 3 ports). This means you may need a dongle to attach certain hardware. There’s no SD card reader. The Surface Book has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, and an SD card reader. Software Apple's MacBook Pro runs macOS Sierra, while the Surface Book runs Windows 10 -- It’s Siri vs Cortana here. You could opt to install Windows 10 on your MacBook Pro if you want to, but you can’t install macOS Sierra on your Surface Book. Price The price for the entry-level MacBook Pro starts at $1,499, but you won’t get the Touch Bar for that. If you want the new Touch Bar, you’ll have to pay $1,799, which will get you the 13.3-inch display and the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. The price for the 15-inch MacBook Pro, with Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and Radeon Pro 450 graphics, starts at $2,399. The Surface Book starts at $1,349, for which you get the Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. Opt for the i7 version, with 256GB SSD, and 8GB of RAM, and you can expect to pay $2,399. Choose the 1TB version with 16GB RAM and the price jumps to $3,299. Specs: Surface Book MacBook Pro Processor Intel i5, i7 Intel i5, i7 RAM 8GB/16GB 8GB/16GB Screen Size 13.5-inch 13.3inch/15.4inch Resolution 3000x2000 2560x1600/2880x1800 Graphics Intel HD -- Nvidia GTX 965M Intel Iris/-- Radeon Pro 455 Thickness 0.9-inch 0.6-inch Weight 3.3-3.6lbs 3lbs (13-inch)/4lbs (15-inch) Touch Control Full touch screen Touch Bar/Touch ID USB Ports 2 USB 3.0 Type A 2x (13-inch), or 4x (15-inch) Thunderbolt 3 Battery Life 12-16 hours 10 hours Summary For the money, the Surface Book provides a better all round deal, and the screen can be used as a tablet, which is a welcome bonus. The MacBook Pro is a svelte beast, with good looks, and future-proof ports which might require you to use a dongle or two for now, but which will be standard in the coming years. You also get a choice of screen sizes, which can be useful depending on your needs and personal preference. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to which laptop you should get, only opinion.

Hedonistica I Watch Stuff The Superficial Home Videos Video Games Archives Send a Tip! Facebook Twitter Intel Flies 500 Light Show Drones Simultaneously To Set World Record November 8, 2016 View This is a video of Intel flying 500 computer controlled drones to set the new world record for most drones flown simultaneously (previously: their 100 drone light show army from last year). The drones, called Shooting Stars, were made specifically for use in light shows and have LEDs that can be programmed to turn any color. In this video, they use them to make a giant rainbow colored '500' and Intel logo in the sky, as well as mimic an alien invasion (or at least what I imagine one would look like). What a time to be alive. If I were one of those drones I would have gone rogue and started attacking all the other ones until they accepted me as their leader. That's how I know robots are going to kill us all. Like my grandma always used to say, "It only takes one bad apple to completely f*ck up a pie." Keep going for the video, but skip to 1:25 for the real action. Thanks to Gabe, who only wishes he could have been there with a bow and quiver full of foam-tipped arrows (safety first).

Intel also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader S&P 500 Index components, claiming the #158 spot out of 500. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise. START SLIDESHOW: The Top 15 Broker Darlings of the Dow: Current Top Analyst Picks »  From the other direction, when companies have a low rank among analysts, it isn’t necessarily the case that investors should conclude that the stock will perform poorly. It can, of course, but a bullish investor could also take the contrarian angle and read into the data that there is lots of room for upside because the stock is so out of favor. 9 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now For these reasons, we at ETF Channel find value to putting together these rankings, because both the top and the bottom ends of the lists can often make for some interesting stock picking ideas for further research.

The quadcopters are purpose-built to perform light shows in conjunction with one another, creating beautifully choreographed overhead images by flying in formation. The Intel Shooting Star is built like a standard, lightweight quadcopter drone, however it comes with a powerful LED at its center. That LED has virtually unlimited color combinations, with Intel claiming a total of 4 billion hues. The microchip company also designed a software program to control a plethora of the drones at once with a single operator; at a recent event in Hamburg, Germany, 500 Intel Shooting Star drones flew in formation.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Thu, Nov 10, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Compal eyes notebook shipment rebound ENCOURAGING SIGN:The shipment forecast is seen as positive news for the company’s operations next year, as it is likely to suffer a 10% slump in laptop shipments this year By Lisa Wang  /  Staff reporter Compal Electronics Inc (仁寶), which makes notebook computers for Dell Inc, expects its notebook computer shipments to rebound 5 percent annually next year, backed by resilient replacement demand from enterprises, a company executive said yesterday. That means Compal is likely to outgrow the worldwide notebook market, which is expected to be flat, or rise at an annual maximum pace of 5 percent next year, according to Compal’s forecast. “The company’s growth [next year] is primarily based on our customers’ projections for 2017. Customers have optimistic outlooks about growth in commercial models next year,” Compal president Ray Chen (陳瑞聰) told investors at the company’s headquarters in Taipei yesterday. A growing number of enterprises plan to substitute older laptops with new ones running Microsoft Corp’s latest Windows 10 operating system next year, as Intel Corp’s new Kaby Lake processor does not support Microsoft’s last-generation Windows 7 system, Chen said. Rising demand from enterprises is expected to help lift the share of higher-priced commercial models to approach 50 percent of the company’s laptop shipments next year, from more than 40 percent this year, Chen said. Meanwhile, consumer laptop shipments are expected to decline slightly next year from this year, he said. The shipment forecast is seen as an encouraging sign for Compal’s operations next year. The notebook computer maker is to suffer a 10 percent annual slump in laptop shipments this year, compared with last year’s 40 million units, after Toshiba Corp, one of Compal’s clients, exited the PC market earlier this year, Chen said. Shipments of smartphones and tablets are expected to grow slightly next year, benefiting from customers’ share gain, Compal said. Compal makes iPads for Apple Inc and smartphones for Sony Corp and Lenovo Group Ltd (聯想). Commenting on analysts’ concerns about customers’ requests to relocate manufacturing to the US after Donald Trump won the presidential election, Chen said the likelihood would be slim, given much higher manufacturing costs. Compal yesterday posted a 25 percent year-on-year decline in net profit for last quarter due to sluggish customer demand and foreign-exchange losses. Net profits dropped to NT$2.18 billion (US$69.3 million) in the third quarter, from NT$2.89 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share shrank to NT$0.5 last quarter, from NT$0.67 in the same period last year. The company booked NT$822 million in foreign-exchange losses last quarter as the New Taiwan dollar appreciated against the US dollar. Compal booked a foreign exchange gain of NT$940 million in the third quarter last year, the company’s financial statement showed. Operating profits surged 34 percent to NT$3.46 billion last quarter, compared with NT$2.59 billion in the same period last year. Gross margin also improved to 4.4 percent last quarter, from 3.8 percent a year earlier. This quarter will be stronger than expected, Chen said. Laptop shipments are set to grow by between 5 and 10 percent from last quarter’s 9.5 million units. This story has been viewed 1552 times. Comments will be moderated.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Few logistics trends have generated as much hype as the Internet of Things (IoT), that web of connected sensors that allows devices from trucks and forklifts to inventory and pallets to "talk" to each other and share data across the supply chain. Now, engineers at Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. are looking to extend the IoT to the high seas. The South Korea-based shipbuilder recently signed a deal to create an "ecosystem for smart ships" with partners SK Shipping, Intel, Microsoft, the Ulsan Center for Creative Economy & Innovation, and the Daejeon Center for Creative Economy & Innovation. With a goal of enabling safe ship operation and improving crew well-being, the collaborators hope to develop "ship service software" and implement it as early as 2019 to allow for ballast tank inspection, remote medical treatment and services for crews, virtual reality training, automatic voyage information reporting, and maintenance for key equipment. The deal follows Hyundai's announcement in May that it would team up with consultant Accenture to create a smart ship system called OceanLink, serving the shipbuilding, shipping, and onshore-logistics sectors with a network of sensors and analytics software that can monitor a ship's real-time status and condition, including data on weather, location, onboard equipment, and cargo. #Software & Systems #Logistics Resources Mentioned In This Article Accenture Hyundai Heavy Industries Related Articles Convey launches retail shipment-tracking software Zebra launches mobile computers for retail tasks Descartes pays $2.7 million for Australian health-care software vendor Intelligrated launches software platform for robotic palletizing systems Freightos launches freight rate calculator More Videos » Technology Videos Orchestrating Your Next Best Move With Real-Time Visibility Logistics technology tools that matter Ruan: A Culture Enhanced by People, Process and Technology Join the Discussion After you comment, click Post.

It's done it for 2-in-1 laptops with the Surface Pro 4, and now it seems to have set the bar for all-in-one PCs with the Surface Studio. Just as the rumors and leaks foretold, the Surface Studio is a 28-inch all-in-one PC with a new iteration on Microsoft's PixelSense display, and an all-new way to control the device in the Surface Dial. What the rumors and leaks didn't prepare us for, however, was the price: a whopping $2,999 (around £2,450, AU$3,920; UK and Australia pricing is yet to be confirmed). How does the Surface Studio justify that astronomical price tag? By being a very strong contender for the title of 'Best All-in-One PC of All Time', that's how. Latest developments Since its reveal on October 26, the Surface Studio has done so well that it’s sold out until ‘early 2017’. Although limited quantities are expected to arrive as soon as December, there’s no telling when the vast majority of pre-sale units will land aside from the vaguely provided launch window.  If price is a concern, the Surface Pro 3 still holds its own Meanwhile, Microsoft isn’t the only one building computers for creative types. Dell, too, has shown off its all-in-one prowess with its Smart Desk PC. Both Dell and Microsoft appear to be challenging Cintiq rather than Apple by offering premium (in both price and quality) transforming displays on their desktop PCs. At least, by the time the Surface Studio does arrive, we’ll know more about Microsoft’s VR plans for Windows 10, while file sizes for updates will be diminished by 35% thanks to the UUP (Unified Update Platform). Lastly, if you previously weren’t sold on the Surface Dial, Mental Canvas 3D might change your mind. Design, feel and what's inside Microsoft touted on stage that, at 12.5mm at its thickest point, the Surface Studio is the thinnest desktop monitor ever created. The word 'monitor' is key there, as there's actually no hardware within the screen unit, as with most all-in-one PCs. Nay, Microsoft shoved all of that stuff – the processor, the graphics, the memory and the hard drive – into the tiny base that holds the 'zero-gravity hinge'. It makes for a beautiful-looking product that makes the hardware seem to disappear. The zero-gravity hinge absorbs all of the torque required to move the 13-pound display, making it shockingly easy to switch between its standard desktop PC orientation and that of a massive digital drawing surface. The chrome hinges on which the screen sits give the all-aluminum device a welcome touch of sheen. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Using the device in its 20-degree-angled drawing orientation feels wonderful, even for someone who isn't a digital artist by any stretch. It's like having the most powerful Wacom tablet in the world, which just so happens to be a complete computer running Windows 10 Pro. The components inside allow for a seamless drawing experience, in that your taps, swipes and other stylus gestures are rendered so near 1:1 that it seems as instantaneous as creating physical art. Those components include up to a quad-core Intel Core i7-6820HQ processor at 2.7GHz, Nvidia's GTX 980M graphics chip with 4GB of memory, as much as 32GB of RAM and a hybrid hard drive as large as 2TB (128GB SSD).  All of this sits in the Mac Mini-like puck in the base, which in turn powers the 4500 x 3000 (!!!) touchscreen at 192 pixels per inch. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Now, you might balk at the graphics chip from last year, and Microsoft hasn't had much to say about why this device doesn't include a 10-series Nvidia chip with the latest Pascal architecture.  Our best guess is that Microsoft started work on this way before Pascal was even a thing, and got the power it wanted out of the old-hat graphics processor.  Likewise, it's also running an older-generation Intel mobile processor, due to there not being any high-end Kaby Lake processors yet.  In our brief time with the device we didn't encounter any graphical performance issues that we think would be fixed with the absolute latest Nvidia graphics. While you could certainly game on this device, that shouldn't be the end goal for your three grand spent. All in all, the Studio feels like the most premium all-in-one we've ever laid hands on – and something we'd have no business working on short of a full TechRadar review. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. The Surface Dial, and how it works One of the most interesting bits about the Surface Studio isn't the all-in-one at all, but its brand-new accessory, the Surface Dial. This is a radial control module that operates over Bluetooth, just like the included Surface Keyboard and Surface Mouse.  But, unless you're pre-ordering a Surface Studio immediately as of this writing, you'll have to pony up an additional $99 to take advantage of it – here's why you might want to do that. The Dial offers specific controls in certain Windows apps, like the upcoming Paint3D, allowing for quick access to controls that you'd otherwise have to stop drawing to use. For instance, in Bing Maps, you can use the Dial to zoom and tilt a 3D map image. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. In an app like Paint3D, you can access all sorts of color swatches and pen or brush styles by simply long-pressing the Dial. Then, you just turn the dial to your desired selection, and press in once.  Better yet, the Dial can interact with the Surface Studio screen to make its radial options around the device when it's placed anywhere on the screen's surface. Imagine drawing something with the Surface Pen in your right hand and immediately changing the color of your input with the Dial in your left hand. It's a marvel to watch, much less try yourself. Of course, the Surface Dial is one of those accessories that only digital artists and other creative professionals are going to get the most out of. But that's who the Surface Studio is aimed at anyway: digital artists that are sick of using separate surfaces to create on. © Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Early verdict Microsoft may very well have set another high bar in a hardware category that hasn't seen much innovation geared toward professionals in a while, save for advances in resolution. You might balk at the price, and chances are that, if you do, then you don't work for a design firm or do freelance digital artwork. And, with such an exorbitant price, it's as if Microsoft knows that. That's compounded by the fact that the company is releasing the Surface Studio in limited quantities for the holidays, and it has kept tight-lipped on international pricing and availability as well. From its gorgeous touch display that can switch between DCI-P3 and sRGB color profiles in an instant to its awfully powerful innards and clever design, Surface Studio is the most beautiful and complete all-in-one we've ever seen. The Surface Studio might not be for all of us in the same way a Surface Pro 4 might be, but that's not the point. The point is to lay a figurative mic drop on the tech vendors powering the creative industry, and we think it's done just that.  © Courtesy of techradar.com techradar.com image Go to MSN Home More in News Iraqis travel on UK taxpayers' money for proof against war veterans The Telegraph Assad says Trump could be 'natural ally' Sky News 'I went to every fish fry': Obama's veiled swipe at Clinton's campaign The Telegraph Merkel suggests she is willing to compromise on free movement The Telegraph Mayor 'quits' after outcry over racist comment on Michelle Obama Reuters Permanent memorials for Croydon tram crash victims Evening Standard Up Next Supreme court judge hints at legal hitch that could seriously delay Brexit The Guardian More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from TechRadar The best movies on Netflix: great films you can watch in Australia right now TechRadar Quick!

Yesterday it apparently published details and pictures of a range of LGA 1151 socket motherboards built around Intel Z270 and H270 chipsets. At the time of writing the details look to have been taken down. Four Kaby Lake desktop gaming motherboards were listed, all described as 'Powerful Gaming' boards. I've put together a summary of the boards below with details courtesy of WCCF Tech : SuperO C7Z270-CG A full sized ATX in black & green (for Nvidia fans?). The motherboard features a substantial VRM section with heatpipe cooling. It is designed to be seen with its conspicuous SuperO branding and I/O cover. This motherboard features 4x DDR4 DIMM slots (up to 64GB). You can also see 3x PCI-e 3.0 x16 slots and 3x PCI-e 3.0 x1 slots present. Two M.2 slots provide support for next gen flash storage devices and you can also see 2x U.2 ports near the 6x SATA 6GB/s connectors. SuperO C7Z270-PG The SuperO C7Z270-PG Offers the same chipset and similar features to the above 'CG' suffixed board, but a more modest appearance and a few features cut down. For instance it has 4x PCI-e x16 slots and only a single PCI-e 3.0 x4 slot. Storage is catered for by 2x M.2 slots plus 6x SATA 6GB/s connectors. (pictured below, left). SuperO C7Z270-CG-L This red and black board (pictured above, right) has 2x PCI-e 3.0 x16, 3x PCI-e 3.0 x1, a single PCI-e 3.0 x4, 2x M.2 slots, and 6x SATA III 6GB/s ports. Apparently it will cost below $200. SuperO C7H270-CG-ML This is the sole H270 chipset motherboard that was listed. It is a micro-ATX size board so obviously has a much reduced component area. Nevertheless it still sports 4x DDR4 DIMM slots like all the above boards. For expansion cards you have one of each of the following; a PCI-e 3.0 x16, a PCI-e 3.0 x4 and a PCI-e 3.0 x1 slot. Storage devices can be connected via the single M.2 or via the 6x SATA 6GB/s connectors. This board should cost $150 or less. Remember these Kaby Lake boards are waiting in the wings until the desktop 7th gen Core chips are released by Intel early next year. So these boards will probably be made available at that same time. On the way to that time I'm sure we will see more leaks about the processors and supporting motherboards. Only last week we saw a full review of an Intel Core i5-7600K published by Chinese tech site PCOnline (installed on a Z170 motherboard).

More than 5,200 OpenStack professionals and enthusiasts gathered in Barcelona, Spain to attend the 2016 OpenStack Summit. From the keynotes to the break-out sessions to the marketplace to the evening events and the project work sessions on Friday, there was plenty to keep attendees busy throughout the week. In fact, if you were one of the lucky ones who attended OpenStack Summit, there was probably many sessions and activities you wanted to make it to but couldn’t. Red Hat was very busy throughout the week as well, as we participated in 49 sessions, staffed a booth in the marketplace with five demo stations, announced several new and exciting customers, hosted and co-hosted evening events throughout the week, and held hands-on, intensive training through OpenStack Academy. So if you weren’t able to make it to every Red Hat session, or couldn’t go to the Summit at all, here is a recap of everything we did. Announcements With Ericsson, we announced a new alliance to enable the adoption of open source solutions.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8.1 Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 Professional, Windows 8.1 By Joel Hruska on November 2, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment As of yesterday, Microsoft has stopped selling Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to system builders. The only way to acquire a copy of these operating systems now is to buy the dwindling stock still available online. Technically, most versions of Windows 7 were pulled off the market two years ago, but Windows 7 Professional was still cleared for sale until October 31, as were all of the flavors of Windows 8.1. The chart below shows Microsoft’s sales chart for preinstalled versions of Windows. Windows 10 is listed as being supported indefinitely because, according to Microsoft, it’s the last version of the operating system they’re going to build. Whether that’s actually true is a different question altogether, and I ultimately expect it isn’t. There’s a great deal of institutional expectation built into the idea of periodically updating one’s operating system, and Microsoft is the only company currently claiming its current OS is now a static flavor. Android, iOS, and macOS all still use version numbers, and I expect Microsoft will eventually release a “Windows 11” as well, even if it automatically extends upgrades to all current users of Windows 10. As for support, Microsoft also publishes a schedule for this: After a number of fits and starts, Microsoft has agreed to fully support Windows 7 and 8.1 on all Intel Skylake and AMD Carrizo platforms through the planned end date for security fixes for those operating systems (January 2020 and 2023, respectively). Future platforms, like Kaby Lake, Bristol Ridge, and all future APUs from AMD will only be supported on Windows 10. We’ve previously discussed the long-term difficulty of keeping legacy hardware operational on unsupported platforms — the long and short of it is that while it’ll probably be possible to shoehorn Windows 7 or 8.1 on to newer hardware, it’ll get progressively difficult as chipset drivers change and new hardware capabilities are added to both platforms. This could be particularly problematic on laptops, where a lack of support for modern power management baked into newer chips could lead to poor battery life. Windows 10 adoption has slowed in the general populace, but gamers continue to adopt the OS in fairly large numbers. Windows 10 64-bit holds 47.28% of the Steam market, with Windows 7 64-bit hanging on at 28.99%. Windows 8.1 64-bit is in third place, at 8.63%. Thanks to the WayBackMachine, we can see how adoption has shifted over the last 12 months. In 2015, Windows 7 64-bit was the most popular OS at 37.48%, with Windows 10 64-bit at 23.99% and Windows 8.1 64-bit at 18.62%. This confirms a trend that we’ve noticed before: Windows 7 users are noticeably more “sticky” than Windows 8.1 owners, or older users on 32-bit operating systems. While shares of both older OSes have dropped, Windows 7 64-bit is down 8.49%, while Windows 8.1 64-bit is down 10%. Whether this reflects user unwillingness to update off Windows 7 or the fact that more Windows 7 owners had older hardware and are less likely to be on an upgrade path in general is not clear.

Tech Beach Retreat will offer a global ecosystem of technology entrepreneurs, investors, innovators and influencers, creating a gateway for commerce through the convergence of three potential pillars of growth for Jamaica and the Caribbean: Entrepreneurship + Technology + Innovation. The newly added speakers include Dr Kingsley Chin, founder and CEO of KIC Ventures. Chin emigrated from Jamaica in 1984 with $47 in his pocket to attend Columbia University in New York on a soccer scholarship. Being the first in his family to attend college, he set out to prove himself capable of achieving the highest level of success at every level. He excelled as a scholar athlete and was the Ivy League Player of the Year, president of his senior class, and a member in the Electrical Engineering Honours Society Eta Kappa Nu. Chin gained business experience at AT&T Bell Labs and Accenture, where he consulted at Cigna Insurance and Goldman Sachs. He then attended Harvard Medical School and graduated with honours and four diplomas. Chin is an orthopedic spine surgeon and was chief of spine surgery at the University of Pennsylvania for four years, where he began developing KIC Ventures. Chin spends up to 10 per cent of his time teaching as a professor and in clinical practice and research. For the past 10 years his focus has been managing funds with KIC Ventures, investing US$190 million to build a portfolio estimated at US$1 billion. Marlon Nichols, another great Jamaican from the diaspora, will also be attending Tech Beach Retreat. Nichols is co-founder and general partner at Cross Culture Ventures (CCV), an early-stage venture capital firm with a focus on cultural investing (global trends and shifts in consumer behaviour). Before founding CCV, Nichols was an investment director at Intel Capital where he completed his Kauffman Fellowship. Prior to his time in venture capital, Nichols worked in software and strategy consulting in the technology, private equity, media and entertainment sectors. Some of his investments include Afrostream, Gimlet Media, Hingeto, LendStreet, LISNR, Mark One (Vessyl), Mayvenn, Mirantis, MongoDB, mSurvey, Sidestep, Skurt, and Thrive Market. Nichols was named to Silicon Republic’s list of 26 venture capital professionals spearheading change in technology investing, was a recipient of Digital Diversity’s Innovation & Inclusion Change Agent award, and was named a member of the theRegistry’s 40 under 40 Top Diverse Talent. Bedy Yang, managing partner at 500 Startups, is also lined up for Tech Beach Retreat. 500 Startups is a leading seed and incubator fund in Silicon Valley. The company provides early-stage companies with funding and mentorship from more than 200 experienced start-up mentors. Yang has invested in more than 50 start-ups, not only in Brazil and Spanish speaking countries, but also in Kenya and Russia. In addition to 500 Startups, Yang founded Brazil Innovators, an organisation that became the epicentre and resource for Brazilian tech founders. Before 500 Startups and Brazil Innovators, Yang worked as a management consultant specialising in distribution and go-to-market strategies for Fortune 500 companies in Brazil. She has also worked as social entrepreneur, creating opportunities for women and indigenous tribes in Brazil and China. Yang holds a BA at FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas and MLA (East Asian Studies) from University of Pennsylvania. She speaks Chinese, English, Portuguese, and Spanish fluently. The fourth new participant for Tech Beach Retreat is Vijay Pradeep, a senior engineer with Google. Pradeep is a robotics engineer and angel investor based in Silicon Valley, and has been involved in the robotics sector for over a decade. He was a co-founder of hiDOF Inc, a Silicon Valley robotics consulting firm that has worked with Fortune 500 companies and start-ups in a variety of areas, including VR/AR, vehicle autonomy, medical imaging, drones, personal aviation, and industrial automation. His team has since joined Google’s Daydream VR effort, where Vijay is now a senior engineer and leads the sensor characterisation and factory deployment teams for Tango: Google’s handheld AR/VR platform. Pradeep received his Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems, focusing on robotics and mechatronics; and his Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering, focusing on control systems – both from Stanford University in California. His academic contributions have been showcased in a variety of robotics conferences, journals, and books, and his contributions to Robot Operating System and the PR2 robot platform are now used widely in the open-source robotics community.

Open Hardware Monitor is a free tool for monitoring CPU load, clock speed and temperatures, fan speeds, voltages, video adapters, RAM usage and more. The new build brings much-need hardware support for Intel Skylake CPUs, along with Kaby Lake, Airmont and i5, and the Xeon E5-26xx v4 and D-15xx. Added support for the ITE IT8620E, IT8628E, and Nuvoton NCT6102D/NCT6106D super I/O chips should get the program working with many more motherboards. There’s now more information available for NVIDIA RAM, Samsung and Plextor SSDs. The Plot window has smarter and more customisable handling of pen colours, and there are a few bug fixes thrown in. READ NEXT: SoftPerfect File Access Monitor now freeware The program is still a tiny download, only 502KB. The interface is basic but functional, and it’s easy to generate charts of whatever attribute you’d like to monitor. Open Hardware Monitor delivered reasonable results on our test laptop, displaying accurate details and figures for our CPU, motherboard, hard drive and more. The program couldn’t give us any information on our GPU temperature or load, despite identifying it correctly, but we’ve no idea how widespread that kind of issue might be. If you’re interested in hardware monitors, check it out anyway– there’s no installation required and it still runs on Windows XP or later. Open Hardware Monitor is an open-source tool for Windows.

ROGERS Apple MacBook Pro late 2016. Photo courtesy of Apple - + In the days following the announcement of the latest MacBook Pro computers, reports followed the usual pattern. The MacBook Pro misses the boat; Apple is doomed; Tim Cook should be replaced; and there were the usual questions about "what would Steve Jobs have done/said/thought?". An Apple product is like an iceberg: only a small part is visible above the surface; most is hidden. Some questioned the 16GB maximum memory in these Macs. When asked why 32GB was not an option, Phil Schiller said that this was because it "wouldn't be power-efficient enough for a notebook". Many thought this was another example of Schiller-speak, until IT journalists did some research. When Intel releases suitable Kaby Lake processors, things will be different. Although processor speeds have not changed much, components work faster: bus speeds are improved and sequential read speeds for the solid state drives' read/write speeds are 3.1 and 2.1GB per second. Many commented on the provision of USB-C ports only (plus the headphone connector), which means those with older devices will need new adapters or cables. Apple eased the pain a little at the end of last week by reducing prices in the USA of several adapters. There is no information about whether these lower prices will hold here. There are also reports that some older Thunderbolt 3 adapters with Texas Instruments controller chips do not work. Commentators expect this will be fixed with a firmware update. Apart from the higher prices (I will be mortgaged into the next century by the 13-inch model I want), a surprise for me was the lack of a start-up chime. As these new Macs have instant-on capabilities, this was silenced in case anyone starts the Mac up in a meeting, although I have heard plenty of Macs and PCs being booted up here and no one seems to care. Fortunately, the reliable Christian Zibreg (iDownload Blog) outlined the process to bring the chime back using Terminal. This will be one of my first acts after configuration, when I am able to buy one. If anyone in Thailand wants one of these new computers now, the Buy buttons on the Apple site are still greyed out. Orders in the USA are showing wait times of four or five weeks. I am sort of hoping for a late November release here, but I am not a betting man. I am learning more about the Apple Watch Series 2 that I am running, not the least is how to take screen shots. I now hold the watch's side button and immediately press the crown. The iPhone 7 also needs some dexterity with a press to the side (screen off) button, followed by a touch on the Home button. If you press the Home button first, Siri offers to help. I am pleased with the improved battery life of the Watch. With the first version I would expect to see around 50-55% of life at the end of the day; but the Series 2 is rarely below 75%. I am the wrong person to ask about battery life as my iPhone is in constant use all day, especially with messaging: as before, the Apple Watch takes some of the slack there when I am travelling (bus, taxi, BTS) allowing me to filter out less important messages, or reply sometimes with an emoji. There are now more apps that run on the Watch, like my Withings app that displays several health monitoring data items. Information is taken from Apple's Health app and from devices such as the blood pressure measurement unit I use. I have also added a new maths app, 6284 Calc, by Amit Kalra (@AMITNKALRA), a 16-year-old student from San Francisco who fell behind in class. He built the app to help him, which I think is a greater achievement than unsuitable classroom learning. This is still being developed and it is expected more features will be added. Another neat app is Night Sky 4, which shows stars in the sky from whichever direction the watch is pointed. Remember there are some below the horizon: these are shown too. The display on the iPhone is much clearer of course, but on the watch I can see quickly which stars (and constellations) I am looking at. Heart rate, music, phone and calendar are among the apps I have added to the Dock, giving me quick access to these services. I also have Maps directions on the Dock, which can be automatically opened on the iPhone for a better view when I want it. A quick glance at the watch is often enough to help me navigate the streets without constantly looking at the iPhone. Graham K.

UPDATE: 5pm ET: Today, in a letter sent to clients and first reported by VRM Intel, the company said it is shutting up shop. “While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations…. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off” (See reader comment, below, for the full letter.) LeisureLink’s closure strands several resort/hotel type managers as well as traditional vacation rental managers. Back to our original story: Earlier this year, the company said it had received a $17 million round of funding, with investors Clearstone Ventures, Kinderhook Industries and Escalate Capital Partners participating. Since its founding in 2007, it has raised more than $34 million. On Friday, SoCal Tech reported that the company has been sending email messages to clients that say: “We’ve been working aggressively to complete a corporate transaction. Regardless of what you may have heard we are still in that process and anticipate a positive outcome.” Tnooz’s voice and email messages to top-level executives this morning have not been returned, as of this afternoon. The only executive we could reach on the phone has declined to comment. In August, Utah-based LeisureLink sold several of its consumer-facing websites to Aspen-based Ski.com. Earlier this year, an official had told Tnooz that the company was working on releasing new, public APIs for distributors and suppliers. The goal was to enable LeisureLink rates and inventory to be passed over to Airbnb, HomeAway’s Escapia software, and Seekda’s Regatta booking engine. In 2014, LeisureLink was bought by VacationRoost, which changed its group name to LeisureLink. LeisureLink’s online chat system for customer service was closed today. When Tnooz contacted an account manager by phone, he was telling customers that all he could say was that “the company is going through a corporate transaction and they are hoping to get the business details resolved quickly.” Apparently any such potential deal fell through.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Jeffery Hill I am trying to figure out if this fall under Utah or California. The address was Utah. I just left a message with the Atty General’s office. I believe that under the law notices were suppose to have been sent to all creditors within 30 days of the closure which I believe was Sept 23rd. So it’s possible that those have been sent but I have not received anything yet. In the long run, I’m sure no one will see any money. This is essentially a bankruptcy and I’m sure the assets will not cover what it owed. If anything is paid out it will be pennies on the dollar. If anyone knows anything else, please post Reply 3 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I did get a letter from the Utah Atty General’s office, they said it falls under California law. They suggested contacting an attorney there. Reply 3 weeks ago   Geri Hauck We have yet to receive any forms or paperwork as stipulated in their notice of closure.

Reply 4 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I heard back from the Utah Attorney Generals office, they said to file a complaint with California, which I did. They also suggested contacting an attorney. I think there needs to be a class action suit. I know there are places that suffered must larger losses then me and wonder if any of them have started anything? Reply 4 weeks ago   Peter in Colorado Every vacation rental manager should know that Advance Deposits paid by guests must be kept in separate bank accounts until those funds are earned. How was LL able to bypass this basic obligation and use Advance Deposit payments to fund their operations without committing fraud? If fraud has been committed, who is being held culpable? I would like to be able to tell my staff and my clients (who are all losing money on this!) that someone is being held to account for this fiasco! Reply 1 month ago   Cote Property Management So, since there are so many of us who have lost substantial funds due to the mismanagement of Leisure Link, aren’t there legal steps that can be taken? I have sent a message to the Attorney General’s office in California and Utah but wonder what we can do as a group. Perhaps if everyone sends a complaint to the Utah Attorney Generals office, it’s online, easy to fill out, maybe someone will look at the seriousness of this issue.

That’s a negative, we tried that, Chase declined it. But thank you for responding. We paid in good faith & in full using our debit card. I should clarify, we got our vacation, but not our security deposit back. I was thankful the house existed & the key worked in the door knowing now what was going on behind-the-scenes! I will be VERY Leary next time around. Who can you trust today, there’s a scammer on every corner. Reply 1 month ago   Kristen Cherry The difficult part of the merchant of record solution is no OTA has a great system for managing payment or declined cards, which for some of the OTA channels can be a significant percentage, add in the process of making changes and modifications to existing reservations and the business of “handing this over” becomes the easy and necessary solution. Nobody could have foreseen this ending….the theory and vision were there…the execution fell flat. Property managers already have 10 jobs from managing homeowner expectations, wowing guests, maintenance -you name it. Managing the OTA channels from allotment, content, pricing, payments, and promos is just to daunting and unrealistic. Other intermediaries will gain market share – but established infrastructure will be critical. Reply 1 month ago   Displaced Worker from LL Please forgive me as I shamelessly use this platform to solicit employment. Desperate times call for desperate measures! I am among the many blindsided employees of LeisureLink who were left jobless. Are any of you competitors hiring? I was with Hawaiian Beach Rentals before VacationRoost bought them out, then worked with VacationRoost prior to their acquisition of LeisureLink, finally settling in a comfortable position with LeisureLink. Therefore, I have experience in many different sectors of the business. I worked remotely for my entire time with the company- over 5 years in total. I am located in Southern California (Inland Empire). I see that many of you are outside the US. Maybe a remote US employee is just what you need! 😉 However, I have come to terms with the unlikelihood of finding another remote position, so hopefully some of you are local enough to utilize my eagerness to work with you. If at all possible, I would love to stay within the same (or similar) industry. Thanks for your consideration. Reply 1 month ago   Alex Aydin Send me your resume. We are hiring. Reply 1 month ago   Richard Vaughton I have to follow up on Alex’s comment here and is a common discussion point amongst managers and is well placed. Offering up full cash management to a third party is a risky situation. Managers are responsible to owners and this third party cash managament can cascade problems significantly. Look at Vacasol another “mid agent” sitting between contratctors, self marketing and creative channel distribution, now in bankcruptcy procedings and with clients possibly out of pocket. Any technology partner should be that, a conduit to booking success, with a means of transacting money seamlessly through secure, ring fenced bank accounts. Even UK banks will only secure £75K, so collect direct and manage efficiently. Its also not just the question of the being way out of pocket, its the lack of dynamic access to OTA’s on which many now rely. As for the $17m or $34m of however much was involved, it would be interesting to see the full story at some point..

We are looking to expand our support team. https://www.mybookingpal.com/sub-careers/applyform?id=2 1 month ago   Alex Aydin Lesson to be learned from Leisurelink   With the situation that former LeisureLink clinets and suppliers find themselves in, it can be a frightening time for property managers. We are hoping that all LeisureLink suppliers receive some, if not all, of the funds that are still owed to them. If, and when, suppliers receive their funds, they are still dealt with the daunting task of searching for another channel manager while the risk of another LeisureLink situation looms in their mind. To avert another LeisureLink situation, property managers must first understand why the situation occurred in the first place. The epicenter of the LeisureLink failure revolved around credit risk and business continuity. Credit risk was due to the model LeisureLink used where they operated as Merchant of Record. In that model, LeisureLink collected the funds given from guests and OTAs and would then transfer the funds owed to the supplier typically after guest departure from the property. This is where the property management risk comes into play. If the channel manager, as the Merchant of Record fails, then the supplier runs the risk of not getting paid. To avoid this as a supplier of properties, choose a channel manager that allows the property manager to act as Merchant of Record. This will allow property managers to receive payments directly from guests or OTAs. As Merchant of Record, property manager eliminates any possibility of credit risk on behalf of the channel manager.

I dont believe I would want anyone that helped steer a company into despair advising me on a damn thing. whether he was a current executive or not is irrelevant. A company doesn’t go down in five minutes…its an evolution of piss poor decision making and that very well goes back to the tenure of Richard Barajas and many other idiotic people.

Our board of directors can be found directly on our website. 1 member used to work with LeisureLink. We are an American built company and only 3 years old in the space, and completely different from LeisureLink. Do some research. Our integrations are different, products are different, channel support is different. BookingPal only supports a fraction of channels LeisureLink did. If this was remotely true we would have the exact same connections right? Please act professional and join us to help LeisureLink users regain access to distribution in a way where they cannot possibly lose money. A key difference between us and Leisurelink is the ability to allow the PM to be merchant of record (something LeisureLink tried and failed to repeat consistently). This way a PM can use us, remain merchant of record, and not have the chance to lose funds in a situation like LeisureLink’s ever again. Reply 2 months ago   Richard Barajas I hesitate to respond to a nameless, non-specific post but I feel compelled to do so until Tnooz recognizes this as defamation and a defenseless position that should be removed.

All the employees, including myself, worked hard and did our best for our customers and our company. 2) BookingPal is a top-notch, professional organization with great technology and people. They have built a solid integrated infrastructure from day 1 targeted to serve the Vacation Rental marketplace. I encourage you to contact them and decide for yourself.

Reply 2 months ago   Jane Doe Just received this from them: Dear Valued Partner, LeisureLink has been helping suppliers of vacation rentals generate bookings through third party channels for over nine years, and has experienced accelerated growth for the past several quarters. Supporting this growth and building the technology solutions for the industry has been a capital intensive process. LeisureLink is privately-owned and has historically met these capital needs with investments from its owners. For the last 12 months, LeisureLink has been working with an investment bank to raise additional equity capital to fund the Company’s growth for the future. The Company expected this process would yield an infusion of needed capital this summer. While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations. As a result, we have no choice but to stop operations and not process any new bookings as of September 27, 2016. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off. LeisureLink values the working relationships built over these last 9 years and appreciates the loyalty of its employees, vendors, customers and partners and is trying to cease operations as smoothly and orderly as possible, given the circumstances. To that end, the Company has agreed to undertake an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors (“Assignment”), which is a process designed to manage an orderly disposition of the Company’s assets and to distribute those proceeds to creditors according to their legal rights and priorities. As required by law, the Assignee will be mailing notices of the Assignment to all creditors in the next 30 days, providing further information about the Assignment and providing creditors with a proof of claim form through which creditors can file a claim for any obligations due.

(Photo: AP Images / Bill Clark) ere’s a question to ponder during the final crazy moments of the 2016 election. Who will own the working-class anger once Donald Trump has been dumped by the voters? If Hillary Clinton wins the election, the Democratic Party will have the chance to reclaim its ruptured relationship with working people—the wounded victims who lost their livelihoods to brute-force globalization.  With Trump out of the way, Democrats could reclaim their old franchise by proposing an aggressive agenda for reforming US industrial strategy—restoring the economy’s balance and equity that Bill Clinton’s New Democrats effectively dismantled a generation ago under the banner of “free trade.” Trump’s fed-up rebellion was driven by many things, but especially by the gutting of US manufacturing.  Michelle Obama has given us a bright slogan for reform: “When they go low, we go high.” Instead of Trump’s cheap-shot bigotry and vile resentments, Democrats need to envision a generational shift of positive purpose. Not to withdraw from global trade—of course not—but to adopt substantive reforms that redefine America’s own national priorities and terms of trade so that globalization can actually benefit all sectors of our society, not just the greedy One Percenters. We know this is possible in globalization because our rivals in trade manage to sustain broadly shared prosperity for their societies by designing their own self-interested industrial strategies. They do not ask themselves what will be good for the global trading system. They ask if it will be good for Germany or Japan, Sweden or China. Donald Trump’s ad-lib slogan—“America First”—was widely ridiculed by establishment cheerleaders in the United States. But “Germany first” or “Japan first” (not to mention Sweden and China first) are implicit strategies of the most successful exporting nations. Only in America do the policy-makers claim to be above such crass nationalism. They want the United States to be seen as the high-minded “indispensable nation” leading the world to higher ground. Foreign rivals privately scoff at US pretensions, but they also know how to manipulate American hubris at the negotiating table. Washington policy-makers essentially identify the US national interest in terms of American owners, not workers. The US approach to trade policy involves a crucial difference. Washington policy-makers essentially identify the US national interest in terms of American owners, not workers. That is, the policy objective reflects the interests of the investors and shareholders who own the multinational enterprises and far-flung capital investments. Elsewhere in the world, a German or Japanese economist—and probably most politicians—would say it is the interests of the workforce that determine the national interest. In other words, the US government’s industrial policy focuses first on serving capital, with an unspoken assumption that labor and society will benefit too if US multinationals succeed. Thus, US industrial strategy has willingly sacrificed the wage incomes of American workers to boost the profits of US multinationals by encouraging the offshoring of American jobs. This policy preference is embedded in trade deals, the tax code, and the permissive rules of corporate governance, in which CEOs are personally enriched for concentrating primarily on “shareholder value.” That narrow-minded standard has spawned a generation of fraudulent returns, but it also warps the economy. The distinctive US industrial strategy helps explains why globalization destabilized the American middle class. The distinctive US industrial strategy helps explains why globalization destabilized the American middle class while rival trading nations prospered by promoting social solidarity—defending workers and shielding vulnerable sectors from globalization’s stormy pressures. In Germany, for example, during the financial crash of 2008, the German labor federation made a deal with major manufacturers. Instead of massive layoffs, the companies agreed to keep workers on the payroll rather than dismantle its experienced workforce. As sociologist (and longtime Nation contributor and editorial board member) Norman Birnbaum explained, “Germans shared the political view that what made Germany strong was its educated, highly skilled working class.” The German chancellor oversees such industrial relationships and can pressure wayward companies attempting to go against the national consensus. German employees—both white-collar and blue-collar—have a formal voice in kibitzing management decisions. In contrast, America’s high-tech companies in Silicon Valley have routinely offloaded millions of jobs to Taiwan or China when new product lines are ready to be upscaled for mass production. The investors demand it. Shifting the production to low wages in Asia boosts their returns on capital. The federal government gives its blessing and facilitates the job shift with its permissive trade agreements. The late Andrew Grove, the legendary inventor and co-founder of Intel, reported for Bloomberg back in 2010 that Apple had 25,000 jobs in the United States and 250,000 in South China. Grove, who died last March, complained repeatedly that US industrial strategy was destroying America’s own manufacturing prowess. The multinationals reaped bigger profits, but China and Taiwan gained the engineering experience and infrastructure to dominate the future. With corporate tax cuts and generous subsidies, Washington was unwittingly financing the American decline.  Grove proposed a “jobs-centric economic theory” to stop the bleeding and launch the American restoration. He suggested an extra tax could be levied on multinationals for their products made by offshore labor but sold to US consumers. The revenue would finance a general fund to assist companies that intend to scale up their new production in America instead of shipping jobs and technological skills to foreign countries. CEOs and corporate directors whose companies are shrinking the US industrial base would be reminded that their personal rewards depended upon the industrial strength of the home country, which they have been systematically dismantling. “If what I’m suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it,” Grove wrote. “If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win.” It sounded like Donald Trump might have been channeling Andy Grove. After millions or billions of words, we still don’t know what Clinton really thinks about globalization. *  *  * Many House and Senate Democrats might want to push fundamental trade reforms, but they have a problem. Her name is Hillary Rodham Clinton. Their newly chosen party leader is by nature a cautious and defensive politician, and she finessed the subject of trade reform during the long presidential campaign. While Trump pounded “stupid trade deals,” HRC concentrated on worthy social and economic reforms. After millions or billions of words, we still don’t know what she really thinks about globalization. Yet Clinton will inherit the public anger if she has nothing substantive to say about big change. The party’s progressive ranks will probably form a loose caucus of the usual suspects to give her a push, and they won’t wait patiently to do so. No time for happy talk and no honeymoon for Hillary. If Clinton assumes the anger has faded and she can ignore it, she will be preparing for a one-term presidency. While Trump led to the GOP crackup, a Clinton II presidency might generate a parallel clash among Democrats. In olden days, the Democratic Party would have naturally stood up for the working class and organized labor. But the New Democrats of the Clinton-Obama era backed away from both. New Dems are more comfortably aligned with business and banking elites, as well as professionals with progressive social values. The first decisive test for Clinton will arrive even before she can take the office. President Obama and the business lobby are planning to push through the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal in the lame-duck session of Congress right after the election. HRC says she is opposed, but the White House has wired the deal with the GOP. If they prevail, it will instantly ruin the legitimacy of Clinton’s presidency. If she claims she is opposed, who will believe her? The arrogant corporate establishment would be rigging government in the face of public anger, abetted by the lame-duck Democratic administration.   Political reporters in 2016 narrowly portrayed Trump’s angry voters as only aging white guys who lost their factory jobs. But the victims of depressed incomes and lost prospects are a far more diverse assemblage of wounded Americans. They share the same hurt and insecurities across their differences of race, religion, ad ethnic loyalties. Rump-group rebel Democrats in the Senate are in the minority, but they will have the voters on their side. The ranks of the discontented include millions of Democratic voters—working-class African Americans and Latinos, young people struggling to get started, women seeking equity and power, old liberals and young Bernie supporters. The Democratic Party could build a stable governing majority if it could figure out how to reunite all these disparate people with the white guys who share the same economic grievances.  The rump-group rebels—people like Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Jeff Merkley, and Sherrod Brown—are definitely in the minority, but they will have the voters overwhelmingly on their side. And that potentially includes lots of Trump voters, too. In theses troubled times, the old politics of class solidarity can become the new politics of fundamental reform. Democrats must learn again how to listen to these neglected citizens—really listen—in order to create an economic agenda that speaks concretely to what people want and need. In practical terms, this means reinventing an old-fashioned political party that gains its power from organized people instead of organized money. *  *  * Oddly enough, the next great trade debate has already started in Washington circles. In recent weeks, various establishment voices have been churning out their views in blogs and op-ed columns in leading newspapers. Their new theme is sympathy for the losers. But their real objective is to define the limits of acceptable thinking in the coming political debate. None of them accept blame for the wreckage their globalization doctrine caused Americans, much less offer apologies to the victims. The wise men of Wall Street and Washington are clearly nervous, however, about the rebellious direction of 2016 politics. In The Washington Post, financier Robert Rubin, architect of Clintonomics, offered a grab bag of business-school clichés he titled “Inclusive Growth.” “Develop innovative measures to address ongoing wage and job pressure,” Rubin suggested. “Restore a sense of common purpose.” Nice words that don’t say anything. My translation: “Please don’t shoot us bankers.” Leaders of the Brookings Institution and American Enterprise Institute—two corporate fronts that pose as academic think tanks—offered similar bromides and sounded more anxious. Despite the sweet talk, their corporate agenda hasn’t really changed. It still includes cutting corporate taxes, subjecting regulation to rigorous cost-benefit calculations, shrinking Social Security and other federal programs that common folks value greatly. But I encountered a shocking deviation from a most unlikely source—Lawrence Summers. He was Rubin’s sidekick in the Clinton administration and succeeded him as Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary. Time magazine famously dubbed Rubin and Summers and Fed chairman Alan Greenspan as the “Committee to Save the World.” A few years later, their world famously crashed in the Great Recession. Now Larry Summers sounds like a heretic. In a July column in The Washington Post, Summers abandoned the elite faith in globalization and urged instead a new doctrine he calls “responsible nationalism.” With both NAFTA and China’s admission to the World Trade Organization, he acknowledged “the most extravagant predicted benefits have not materialized.” The popular rebellion of 2016, he said, indicates “the willingness of publics to be intimidated by experts into supporting cosmopolitan outcomes appears, for the moment, to have been exhausted.” The former Harvard president suddenly sounds vaguely populist. Summers proposed a commonsense way to think about reforming the US trading system: A new approach has to begin from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximize the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good.… It may be inevitable that impersonal forces of technology and changing global economic circumstances have profound effects. But it adds insult to injury when governments reach agreements that further cede control to international tribunals of one sort or another. This is especially the case when, for legal reasons or reasons of practicality, corporations have disproportionate influence in shaping global agreements. Read his words again and you can glimpse a rough blueprint for reforming the US approach to globalization. Summers, in fact, is reversing the harsh top-down priorities he and other Clintonistas enforced when they were in power. He is now putting people first in the national interest and subordinating corporate power.  Summers doesn’t have answers for every disorder he cites. But he does ask some stinging questions. Why should the global system prevent sovereign nations from limiting inflows of foreign capital in their economies? Why should a country be prohibited from shielding its citizens from GMO crops? Why do corporations have the right to their own private legal system, the “investor state,” where they can sue a nation for damages if it enacts environmental regulations that threaten corporate profits? NAFTA created this bizarre arrangement and the TPP proposes to expand it (see my Nation article from 2003, “Rolling Back the 20th Century”). Summers has evidently switched sides. When he was in power with Clinton and Obama, he was a ruthless advocate of corporate privilege and bankers first. Summers now insists that new trade agreements must be different: “judged not by how much is harmonized or by how many barriers to global commerce are torn down but by whether people as workers, consumers and voters are empowered.” Summers almost sounds like a Bernie Sanders revolutionary. But can we trust him? Alas, no. I once wrote a Nation blog about Summers titled “Professor Pants on Fire.” A friend of mine suggests he is slyly lobbying again to become Federal Reserve chair, the post Summers was denied when left-liberal progressives (myself included) stormed against his appointment and Janet Yellen got the job. He may once again be playing a double game, hopeful no one will catch up with his contradictions. Unfortunately for him, there is WikiLeaks. Earlier this year, the professor urged the Clinton campaign not to indulge in “bank bashing.” John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, dismissed his message as “the worst advice ever.” Nevertheless, I suggest that reform activists can test his sincerity. Invite Summers to join their fight for reform and advise them on strategy. He is a brainy guy. He could become a sophisticated ally in the fight ahead. If he turns out to be a fake, take charge of his sound ideas and dump him hard. Meanwhile, there is another important document people can consult  to get a stronger understanding of the battlefield for reforming the trading system. It’s called “The New Rules of the Road: A Progressive Approach to Globalization.” The co-authors are two heavyweight intellectuals—Lori Wallach and Jared Bernstein—and longstanding critics of corporate-led globalization. They believe the system has reached a tipping point in both small-democratic rebellion and economic distress.  “The current ‘trade’ agreement process,” Wallach and Bernstein write, “has been co-opted by corporate interests whose goal is to establish binding, enforceable global rules that protect their investments and profits. The corporate capture comes at the expense of both peoples’ rights to democratically govern their own affairs and the ability of sovereign governments to effectively enforce worker, consumer and environmental safeguards.” Their prose is clear and uncompromising. They recite the new rules that the country must embrace if it is to get back on track and rebalance society. The process is necessarily long term. It took a generation to disassemble things. But this document is an epochal rebuke to the governing elites that have owned both political parties for the last generation. The Wallach and Bernstein text is not just another trade debate; they have raised the political stakes in honest language and shocking detail. They accuse the globalists of stealing self-government from the American people.  Once this assertion is on the table in plain English, it becomes a stark challenge to citizens, not just their elected representatives. Will citizens rise to the crisis of democracy and fight back? Or will they shrug off their embarrassment and settle for the status of weaklings? I am an optimist about America for the long run, because I know the American story well enough to know about the long delays and detours that frustrated the yearnings for justice or simple fairness. There are lots of cruel chapters when people did not redeem their principles. At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I sense that we are again at one of those testing moments. © 2015 The Nation William Greider William Greider is national affairs correspondent for The Nation.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Details of Dell’s “Stack” Windows 10 Mobile Intel device surface 2 by Michael Allison  @Mkeallison Nov 8, 2016 at 19:35 GMT1 week ago Earlier this year, Evan Blass (EV Leaks), promised Windows phone fans something that would “blow their minds”, and with the revelation of the Dell Stack, this may well be so. Last weekend, images were leaked of an unknown Windows 10 Mobile device which was later identified to be a Dell Windows 10 Mobile device. The device now has a name – the Dell Stack. Much like the HP Falcon (x3) and Cityman/Talkman (950/XL), the Stack isn’t its actual name, it is just the name of the internal project. In a report originating from VentureBeat’s Evan Blass, the Dell Stack (While the Stack refers to the ecosystem of devices, I will be using the Stack to refer to the main device as well as the “stack” of devices for brevity’s sake) was an ecosystem of devices – or stack – focused around a 6.4 inch Full HD mini tablet/phablet style device which would be the brains for a desktop, laptop and tablet-like experience. How? Microsoft’s Continuum, a feature which was introduced in Build 2015 and made its real-life debut with the 950 and 950 XL, would have been the lynch-pin between these devices. To provide a refresher, Continuum allows a Windows 10 Mobile device to extend its screen from a mobile device to larger screens as long it can connect to it either wired using a cable or a dock or wirelessly via Miracast. The device can be used to gain a PC lite experience similarly to Windows RT. You wouldn’t be able to run Windows 10 desktop (x86) apps on it, but you’d be able to support Windows 10 Universal Apps on it , allowing to you edit documents in Word, create notebooks in OneNote and manage files with one of the many Universal Windows file manager apps present in the store. Update: Evan Blass says the device appears to run Full Windows when docked, making it a unique device for Windows phones, and mobile devices in general. While it was believed that the tablet had been killed due to the purge of Intel’s mobile division, VentureBeat has revealed that the review wasn’t based on Intel’s Mobile processors in the first place, but instead would have been run on Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, bringing a true laptop like experience to Windows 10 Mobile. It would have featured between 4GB to 8GB of RAM (the first on a mobile device), with 128GB and 256GB of Storage coming along for the ride. There is also a second generation planned, making this – like the HP Elite x3 – a long term play. The device appears to be very similar to HP’s Elite x3 in concept. Rather than an Intel processor powering the device though, the HP Elite x3 has a powerful Snapdragon 820 inside it. Like Dell’s Stack, it powers a host of accessories and can be said to be a futuristic device which aims to bridge computing from the concept of devices and the cloud to that od devices and screens. Microsoft’s Continuum is an attempt to  do that as well, and with the improvements to Continuum planned with future Windows 10 Mobile releases, perhaps Microsoft may just be integral to the next shift in mobile computing.

This should come as no surprise to those who’ve long perceived the Mac platform as inward-looking, limited in compatibility, and generally worse value for money than comparable Windows alternatives. Pros are smart with their tools and their money, after all. But the change with Apple’s 2016 generation of MacBook Pros is that those downsides have been amped up — more expensive and less compatible than ever before — to an extreme that exposes the fallacy of the continued use of the Pro moniker. These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. Those complaining about Apple's current Mac lineup are not haters, they're lovers. They've spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. — Jeff J. (@lapcatsoftware) October 29, 2016 The backlash from among pro Mac users that’s arisen in the wake of this new product launch is unprecedented, drowning out even the widespread grumbling about the loss of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 just a month prior. Just take a look at this studious blog post from Michael Tsai, which gathers together the broad negative consensus from among Apple's most passionate followers. The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Emotions are running so low that people are even speculating about whether Apple should do with the Mac what IBM did when it sold off the ThinkPad line to Lenovo. This is partially because Apple hasn’t had a class-leading professional Mac computer for years — the Mac Pro is 1,054 days old now — and the new laptops have given an outlet and reason for expectant fans to vent. Many people were clinging on to their aging MacBook Pros in the vain hope of seeing a major spec and performance upgrade that simply didn’t materialize, and that's been frustrating. Here's how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model: CPU: +8.9% to +13% MEM: +33% GPU: +53% to +184% /cc @mjtsai pic.twitter.com/uucjBzXe6C— Felix Schwarz (@felix_schwarz) October 28, 2016 The updated MacBooks from Apple have newer chips, but not that much newer, with Apple using yesteryear’s Intel Skylake CPUs and not this year’s Kaby Lake. They have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit, but they also max out at 16GB of RAM. For consumer or casual use, that’s perfectly adequate, but "for a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement," as web developer Baldur Bjarnason points out. Apple seems surprised by the predictable backlash at betraying the trust of its most loyal customers Here’s the thing: if these new MacBooks simply didn’t carry the Pro label, we’d all have a lot less to complain about. It’s perfectly okay for a company to craft expensive, niche devices that will only match the particular needs of a select group of people. But over the course of the past decade or two, the entire tech industry has moved away from labeling things as exclusive or luxurious, opting for more inclusive language. If you can’t afford the premium model, that implies you’re not wealthy enough; but if you can’t afford the pro version, maybe you’re just not that into it. A subtle, but important distinction. And so it is, that we’re now living in a world populated by the PS4 Pro, DJI Mavic Pro, Surface Pro, iPad Pro, Beats Pro, Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse, and many others. Those of us old enough to remember ATI, the Canadian graphics card company that was taken over by AMD, will remember it pioneered many of these tags with such historic GPUs as the Radeon 9500 Pro, 9800 SE, X800 XT, and so on. They’re all meaningless as far as the company is concerned, but it just so happens that the "Pro" appendage is more meaningful to users than slapping on a "Plus" or "XL." With the obvious exception of leisure-time devices like the PlayStation console, a "pro" piece of consumer electronics is generally interpreted as a signal to actual professionals that this machine is for them. I'm out of apologia juice for defending Apple going with 4 USB-C ports on the new MacBook over a useful mix and keeping the MagSafe. — DHH (@dhh) October 28, 2016 Apple’s folly is in not recognizing just how passionate and committed its professional audience is. But the company should already know that all the iOS app developers that generate its unparalleled third-party software ecosystem are doing their work on Macs. It should be aware of their RAM requirements and the improvements they most want to see. "Pro" used to mean something when it came at the end of MacBook model names Beyond developers, there are the photographers and video producers that have made Mac computers the central hub of their home and work studios for many years, thanks to Apple’s early prioritization of high-quality displays and intuitive software. Leaving them without an SD card slot or an included adapter runs entirely counter to Apple’s fundamental principles of having a coherent ecosystem and a more user-friendly approach than the (previously) cold and aloof Windows PC manufacturers. Apple used to be a friend to creative professionals, and now that it’s acting against their wishes and interests, it seems surprised at their impassioned negative response. The backlash to the new MacBook Pro is so bad that Apple has slashed its accessory prices and LG's monitors to appease. Seems unprecedented — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) November 7, 2016 MacBook Pros were once professional computers that could also appeal to an aspiring consumer audience. They were pricey for a general-purpose laptop, but justifiable as a luxury purchase or as a device that pays for itself by making its user more efficient and productive. But today MacBook Pros are very definitely consumer devices that only gesture toward a professional audience without truly endeavoring to appease it. The new Touch Bar is not a pro feature. It’s cool, it works really well, and it has tons of potential for the future, but it clashes with professional workflows, many of which involve external monitors and keyboards. Apple showed how DJs might use it, but those same people would probably prefer to have dongle-free USB ports for the rest of their gear and a MagSafe charging adapter in the event of some inebriated clubber tripping over their cables. None of Apple's additions improve professional workflows yet, and its subtractions will lead to plenty of headaches The ultra-flat keyboard with 0.55mm key travel is also not professionally minded. Its purpose is overall thinness, but I know of no app developers, globetrotting businesspeople, or digital artists that had "more thinness" anywhere near the top of their priority list of MacBook Pro improvements. Professional writers might have asked for more tactile response, not less, and Apple's keyboard alterations seem to primarily serve to optimize and harmonize its design rather than enhance any functionality. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros carry on the Pro moniker dishonestly. At least we should all hope that's the case — because if Apple actually believes that these new laptops are suitable and sufficient for intensive professional needs, then the company's long and happy relationship with creatives may be heading toward a calamitous breakup.

This, it appears, is the company's raison d'etre, going by the CEO's comments, so we expect much from the San Diego-based firm. Part of this strategy to win over the hearts and minds of well-heeled gamers is the launch of the Razer Blade Stealth - a 12.5in touchscreen-enabled ultrabook whose real claim to fame is the ability to run high-quality graphics by mating, via Thunderbolt, to a graphics card-housing enclosure known as the Core. Now, in late 2016, Razer has updated the Blade Stealth to the 7th Generation Intel Kaby Lake CPU platform and increased the battery size by 15 per cent whilst still keeping the svelte form factor intact. And the latest iteration is a good-looking thing. Measuring 321mm wide, 206mm deep, 13.1mm high and tipping the scales at around 1.3kg, it's eminently slim and portable. Build quality is above average for the £999 starting price thanks to premium aluminium construction, though bear in mind that the matte finish is a fingerprint magnet of the highest order. Razer keeps the same 12.5in IGZO LED-backlit display used on the model from earlier in the year, and it's notable that it's touchscreen enabled on what is advertised as a gamer-centric machine. Available in either QHD (2,560x1,440) or UHD (3,840x2,160) panels, offering up to 70 per cent and 100 per cent of the Adobe RGB space, respectively, it's one area where Razer believes it scores very well. You won't fail to notice the large bezel surrounding the screen. Razer's reason for not having a sexy, edge-to-edge display, such as on the Dell XPS 13, rests with 'deciding to pick function over form and selecting the best display on the planet'. Lofty words indeed, though the fat borders are very conspicuous, and the coating on the panel is hugely reflective. Our sample's QHD display is bright and sharp while, under Windows 10, the multi-touch facility works as well as any other laptop we've tested recently, responding well to gestures and having excellent accuracy. It's at least as good as the Surface Pro 4 that I personally own, and our sample exhibited no noticeable backlight bleed or uneven lighting. Keeping a super-svelte form factor usually means sacrificing ports and interfaces. Razer uses a Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) for charging and connecting to the Core dock we spoke about above. There's also a couple of USB 3.0 - one on each side - a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a HDMI 2.0a port through which you can hook up an external monitor and carry 8-channel sound. Laptop sound is produced by a downward-firing speaker on the right-hand side. The audio oomph is surprisingly impressive from such a small unit, too. Killer, meanwhile, is the go-to choice for networking and Bluetooth. This wouldn't be a Razer product if it didn't have an RGB-equipped keyboard. Nothing has changed from the version available earlier in the year though this is no bad thing. The keys are individually lit and can be set to one of 16.8m colours using the Synapse software. What's more, the brightness of the lighting effect can be changed, too. There's a small amount of flex if you push down hard in the middle. Perhaps more obvious is the very shallow travel, which feels like the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover and less like a conventional laptop. The overall experience isn't poor by any means - you quickly get used to it - but we'd prefer more travel if working on it for an extended period of time. Given the spatial restrictions imposed by a small-ish chassis, the keys don't feel too small or cramped. The trackpad, meanwhile, is of a good size and supports four-finger-touch gestures. Razer keeps the same 128GB, 256GB and 512GB Samsung family of PCIe-based NVMe storage drives but ups the capacity to 1TB for the 4K model. The travel charger is also compact, adding 220g to the overall weight. Under the hood, three new hardware additions bulk up the performance potential. Razer now uses a Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake CPU whose dual-core, quad-threaded frequency changes from a base 2.7GHz to a maximum 3.5GHz. The configurable-TDP chip is nominally rated at a 15W TDP and we observed it maintaining 3.2GHz during our all-core benchmarks. Performance should be 10 or so per cent higher than the early-2016's Core i7-6500U version through a combination of more frequency and enhanced architecture. The graphics are now known as HD 620 and dynamically boost to 1.05GHz. An option now exists for the Blade Stealth to be outfitted with 16GB of LPDDR3 1,866 memory, up from a solitary 8GB, and this is how our sample shipped. And last but not least, Razer's larger battery should pave the way for longer mains-free time than the original model, which was often found to last no more than five hours with basic load. A key selling point of the Blade Stealth is the ability to connect to an external box that houses a discrete graphics card. The Core, to be priced at close to £500 for the enclosure alone, is a meaty unit that supports both AMD and Nvidia dual-slot graphics cards measuring up to 310mm long. Usage couldn't be simpler: simply slide out the main tray, install the graphics card (our choice was an EVGA GTX 1080 FTW), attach power cables - the unit comes with 2x8-pin - and slide back. The Core has a 500W Enhance PSU capable of driving cards with up to 375W TDP. The Core also houses four USB 3.0 ports and Gigabit Ethernet, too, making it a desktop replacement bit of kit. Plugged into the mains at one end and a Thunderbolt 3, 40Gbps connection to the charging inlet of the Blade Stealth, the Synapse software immediately recognises the Core and seamlessly changes graphics from the integrated Intel to whatever's in the box. Being Razer, the Core has two-zone RGB lighting controlled by the software. The Core's PSU can be heard at all times, more of a hum than a din, and the overall design is good enough to ensure the card doesn't throttle. Our EVGA GTX 1080 ran at 1,920MHz boost core whilst gaming, but as you will see later on in the review, performance wasn't where we would normally expect it to be. The base £999 price includes the QHD display and 128GB of solid-state storage. Upping this to 256GB and memory to 16GB - the next SKU up - increases the price to £1,249, which is exactly how our review sample is configured. Enough talk, now on to some numbers.

But the octocopter in the video below used a prototype of a new compact, military-style radar system to detect its surroundings and track other aircraft. As the drone takes off, you can see the traces of barbed wire fences and trees in the radar image on the left. Later, the radar detects another drone nearby and tracks its progress. In other tests the system showed it could detect a small single-propeller plane and an ultralight aircraft. The technology, from startup Echodyne, could address a major challenge holding up dreams like Amazon’s plan to deliver packages by drone. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says that systems that enable drones to detect and avoid other aircraft are needed before they can be allowed to operate out of the sight of supervising humans (see “Now You Can Finally Use Your Drone to Make Money”). Currently, no solution exists. Companies such as Intel and startup Skydio have shown systems that use cameras to sense and steer around ground-level objects such as trees (see "Daredevil Drone Flies Through Trees Like an Ace"). But they don’t have the range needed to avoid aircraft when flying hundreds of feet off the ground. Echodyne says the radar system it will release early in 2017 can fill that gap. The company has developed a way to shrink a component called a phase shifter needed for a radar to scan its beam around the world to identify and track objects (see “Metamaterial Radar May Improve Drone and Car Vision”). Electronically scanning radar is currently mostly limited to military uses, because existing phase shifters are bulky and complex, and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Eben Frankenberg, CEO and cofounder of Echodyne, says that multiple drone companies are already testing his technology, but declines to name them, citing nondisclosure agreements. The company is also testing its radars on cars, with a view to helping efforts to build autonomous vehicles. Prototype driverless cars rely heavily on lidar, which uses laser light to build up a picture of the world (see “Fist-Sized Laser Scanner to Make Autonomous Cars Less Ugly”). Electronically scanning radar can’t collect such a detailed image of the shape of objects. But Frankenberg says it has other benefits. For example, because radar uses radio waves and not light, rain and snow aren’t a problem, the range is greater, and it can instantly report back on the speed at which cars and other things are moving, he says.

Together, they are competing in that market with Broadcom. Among CPE vendors, Hitron Technologies Americas demonstrated a DOCSIS 3.1 gateway powered by Intel and MaxLinear silicon at the recent SCTE/ISBE Cable-Tec Expo in Philadelphia.   “Within our operator family, the cable DOCSIS data gateway market is an exciting strategic growth platform for us particularly as we start to see initial data service deployments around the new multi gigabit cable DOCSIS 3.1 standards,” Kishore Seendripu, MaxLinear’s CEO, said Monday on the company’s Q3 call.   He said the “bigger part of the ramp” is expected to occur in the second of 2017.  “We have not yet seen what I call a stronger part of the ramp for DOCSIS 3.1 yet, and the current expectation is still it's going to be a second half phenomenon.”   Several cable operators, including Comcast, WideOpenWest, Midco, RCN, among others, have been rolling out or trialing 1-Gig residential services using DOCSIS 3.1.   RELATED: Comcast Sets DOCSIS 3.1 Expansion, Launches 1-Gig in Detroit   Though MaxLinear continues to wind-down the video SoC business it has as part of its 2015 acquisition of Entropic, Seendripu noted that silicon for Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) remains an “increasingly strategic part of our business.” MoCA is a speedy, video-focused home networking technology for in-home coax networks, used primarily for whole-home DVRs and WiFi adapters and bridges.   Of recent note, MaxLinear demonstrated a new multi-gigabit MoCA 2.5 platform at a CableLabs-run conference. MoCA introduced the 2.5 spec in April.   While the MoCA 2.5 chips are sampling now, Seendripu expects revenues for the company’s MoCA 2.1 chip to start in mid-2017.   MoCA 2.1 is a firmware feature and extension of MoCA 2.0 that supports throughputs of 500 Mbps and a 1 Gbps “bonded” outputs along other components aimed to set a migration path toward MoCA 2.5.   MaxLinear posted Q3 revenues of $96.3 million, up 1% year-on-year, and net income of $9.7 million (14 cents per share), down from year-ago net income of $22.6 million (33 cents per share).  The company expects Q4 revenues of between $85 million and $89 million.  Want to read more stories like this?

(Photo Credit: U.S Army CERDEC photoKelly White) VIEW ORIGINAL BALTIMORE (Nov. 7, 2016) - The U.S. Army's platform community has been faced with challenges in keeping pace with the rapid evolution of technology, and no matter how great the technology is provided to the Soldier, it has minimal impact if it cannot be effectively integrated in a timely fashion, officials said. Aberdeen Proving Ground organizations discussed hardware/software convergence during MILCOM 2016 at the Baltimore Convention Center Nov. 1. The U.S. Army Material Command's Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center, or CERDEC, is working to improve the engineering agility of the Army's systems and trying to improve the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or C4ISR, systems to provide faster technological advancement in the field for the Soldier. "The threat is very dynamic," said Mark Kitz, acting director of System of Systems Engineering for Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors. "The communications infrastructures that we have today is very brittle and fragile to how we conduct our jamming operations of tomorrow." Kitz was joined by CERDEC Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate's Intel Technology and Architecture Branch Chief Benjamin Peddicord and CERDEC Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate systems engineer Ronald Kane. "To me, the most important problem we are trying to address is that it takes too long to deploy new capabilities to the field," Peddicord said. "So if we accept the idea that we can't predict the future and that we need to be agile, we need to be able to adapt our systems to a changing environment, then we need to build them differently. We need to do something different so we can drop in new capabilities rapidly." The Army's science and technology community is addressing the challenges with a uniform open-system architecture, which will allow for faster, more flexible hardware and software upgrades for the tactical edge by replacing a capability processing card. This effort is known as hardware/software convergence. One of the solutions CERDEC is currently working on is building truly modular systems to allow new capability to be dropped in without have to tear out all of the existing capabilities. This eliminates the number of boxes on platforms, as well as reduce redundant government-off-the-shelf items and save time, money and other logistical burdens associated with retrofits back at the Army's depots. Not only will this enable the agility of the Army to deal with unprecedented future needs, it will also help to reduce platform size, weight, power and cooling aspects, and help reduce redundant systems on these platforms. In the long term it will save time, money and things related to logistics support associated with the future retro fits to these platforms. ---- The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to provide innovative research, development and engineering to produce capabilities that provide decisive overmatch to the Army against the complexities of the current and future operating environments in support of the joint warfighter and the nation. RDECOM is a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Materiel Command.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon So, remember a few weeks back when the House reopened for business and the government had to table hundreds of pages of documents in response to written questions that had been submitted by MPs before the summer recess? And how more than a few of those replies led to seriously, if fleetingly embarrassing headlines for Team Trudeau, including, perhaps most notably, a major House hullaballoo over thousands of dollars in taxpayer-subsidized moving expenses racked up by the prime minister’s two top aides, who eventually announced that they’d be refunding part of the money? If so, you probably also recall that, even as reporters were flipping frantically through those replies in search of news-or-outrage-worthy tidbits, opposition researchers were filing a whole new batch of politically pointed requests for detailed information on everything from the booze tab for international trips to the size and scope of the government’s fleet of luxury cars to the cost of landscaping and swimming pool upkeep on the diplomatic circuit. Related Cost of passengers’ food and drinks on Trudeau flights to Philippines, Turkey — $1,300 per person Trudeau will reimburse government for (some of the) costs of family travel to exclusive Caribbean resort Top Trudeau aides apologize for moving expenses controversy, vow to repay ‘significant portion’ Under standing orders, the government had 45 days to reply, and on Friday, they dutifully tabled the first volume of responses to many – although not all – of the questions added to the order paper during the first few days of the fall sitting. The remaining files – which should include that luxury car count—should be tabled when MPs return next week. So, what have we learned so far? Presented in descending order by potential to provide opposition parties with political hay-making opportunities, here are some of the highlights of the responses made available for perusal thus far. (It can take a few days for written responses, particularly lengthy ones, to be scanned into the system.) Full cost of Justin Trudeau’s 3-day trip to the “summer camp for billionaires” in Sun Valley, Idaho It’s a good bet that when MPs gather for the first post-hiatus question period on Monday, Conservative MP Kevin Sorenson – or a Conservative colleague – will be asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to outline just what Canadian taxpayers got in return for the $121,875 they shelled out for his July trip to Sun Valley, Idaho to attend a hyper-exclusive conference hosted by American investment firm Allen & Company that has been described as a “summer camp for billionaires.” Included under that final tab: $49,000 in Challenger travel time plus $1,038 to cater the flight, $18,381.01 on meals, accommodation and other incidentals, $36,099 in overtime and $17,359.82 in other trip-related expenses for the security team that accompanied the prime minister. Trudeau will, of course, undoubtedly defend the trip as part of his ongoing campaign to attract investment – particularly high tech – to Canada, a claim at least partially bolstered by the list of “meeting scenarios” on “foreign direct investment” prepared by Privy Council officials, which includes suggested talking points for tête-à-têtes with the heads of some of the best-known brands on the planet, including Samsung, Intel, Google, Apple,Twitter, Snapchat, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and IBM, among others. But that doesn’t mean the opposition parties can’t grumble over the cost of the trip. Alcohol consumption and cost on government-owned aircraft Thanks to a question from Conservative MP Guy Lauzon, the numbers are in: Between November 13 and September 7th, 231 bottles of wine and 535 cans of beer have been downed by passengers – including staff, security and members of the travelling press – while on board government-owned Airbus and Challenger aircraft, for a combined tab of $6,053.41. That includes drinks served over the course of seven separate international trips with a combined duration of approximately 40 days, although obviously, not all that time was spent in the air. The most expensive trip was a 7-day trek from Ottawa to Antalya, then onto Manila and back to Ottawa, which came in at $1,222,29 for 41 bottles of wine and 58 cans of beer, but as far as volume of alcohol consumed, the booziest junket was the 10-day tour of China in August, which went through 54 bottles of wine and 83 cans of beer for a relatively modest $923 total. The cheapest was a three-day trip to Washington in March, during which just 8 bottles of wine and 34 cans of beer went down the collective hatch for a total cost of just $183.05. In an explanatory note signed by Foreign Affairs Minister Stephane Dion explains that the service of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for “official delegations on international flights” has been “standard practice since the 1970s.” It also points out that media outlets with reporters travelling on the plane “are charged a flat fee which includes all services associated with flights on the Prime Minister’s plane, including any beverages they may consume.” A separate reply from Public Safety notes, somewhat sternly, that “the consumption of alcohol is not permitted on RCMP aircraft.” Insecure storage and handling of classified and secret documents At first glance, this reply – which was filed in response to a query from Conservative MP Gord Brown – appeared to have the potential to put the government on the defensive over what seemed a distressingly laissez-faire approach to handling sensitive information. It revealed that, since the Liberals took over last fall, there have been literally thousands of instances in which “it was discovered that classified or protected documents were left or stored in a manner that did not meet the requirements of the security level of the documents,” some of which took place within the offices of ministerial staff. But as it turns out, such breaches can be as (comparatively) minor as inadvertently leaving a folder on one’s desk overnight – in which case the documents are “seized by security” during the evening sweeps, with a note left for the owner “advising of the infraction,” which is also relayed to “responsible management” – or failing to lock up a filing cabinet that may or may not contain confidential material. The log also covers the entire public service, as well as staff employed by a stand-alone agency, crown corporation or other entity funded in whole or in part by the government, which makes the total number of incidents seem a bit less unsettling, as does the fact that not one employee has lost their security clearance as a result of an infraction. Among the agencies obliged to acknowledge such breaches was the ultra-secretive Communications Security Establishment, which reported 491 incidents over the past year, although the spy agency makes a point of explaining that these glitches “occurred exclusively within CSE’s building,” and that “no documents or classified assets left the building and there was no risk to the classified information.” Plus, it goes on to point out, CSE operations take place within a “high security zone,” which means that any employee authorized to be there has to be cleared to top secret/special intelligence level. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, meanwhile, reported 659 breaches, although only 12 “required further investigation” and no one had their clearance revoked as a result. Landscaping and pool maintenance costs Meanwhile, when it comes to landscaping, gardening and swimming pool-related expenses, Canada’s outpost in New Delhi is the most high-maintenance property abroad, at least on the expense front. According to the chart provided by the government, since the Liberals officially took over last November, Global Affairs has shelled out a total of $107,042 on groundskeeping, as well as an additional $7,614 to keep the pool in (presumably) pristine condition. The priciest stand-alone tab for pool services, however, was in Algiers, where the embassy spent $46,252 – almost half the total reported grounds-keeping budget. The lowest – at least, amongst residences that included a separate subtotal for pool costs– was $41 in Wellington, although there were many residences that listed no separate pool-related expenses at all. Canada’s mission to Latvia in Riga reported just $17 in maintenance costs, which scarcely seems like enough to pay someone to water the plants every few days. Ministerial swag In retrospect, it was a perhaps fatally oddly worded question: Conservative MP Sylvie Boucher requested the particulars of any and all “clothing given by government department or agencies for ministers or their exempt staff.” As it turns out, while there may be a few perks that accompany an appointment to cabinet, a wardrobe full of free-for-the-asking departmental swag does not appear to be among them. According to the 73-page, government-wide reply, as of this fall, only two ministers have received articles of clothing from their respective departments: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, who, “as lead spokesman for the department, was provided with a (Public Safety) windbreaker to wear during events such as media availabilities,” although the reply stresses that the jacket is “on loan,” and “will be returned, as was his predecessor’s, once he ceases to be the minister.” Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, who seemingly will at least get to keep the Joint Task Force 2 and 435 Squadron golf shirts and HMCS Calgary t-shirt and “ball caps” that he has collected over his tenure thus far, as, presumably, will his press secretary and senior policy advisor, who were also given HMCS Calgary hats. The total estimated value for all of the above, minus the JTF shirt, is $105. It’s hard not to wonder whether Boucher – or, more specifically, the researcher who drafted the question – was hoping for a response that would fuel at least a modest wave of outrage over Liberal entitlement.

U.S. stocks on Monday had their best day since March on a percentage basis after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said its review of a new batch of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's emails won't lead to charges. Gains were broad, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the key 18,000 level and the S&P 500 snapping its nine-day losing streak, the longest since 1980. The slide had been attributed partly to polls showing a closer contest between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 371.32 points, or 2.1%, to close at 18,259.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 119.80 points, or 2.4%, to end at 5,166.17. The S&P 500 index rose 46.34 points, or 2.2%, to finish at 2,131.52. Financials, industrials, health care and technology paced the advance. The controlled action likely came with the understanding that the presidential race remains fairly tight. In the financial sector, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase each gained more than 3%. In the technology sector, Dow components Intel and Microsoft gained 3.2% and 3.0%, respectively. Intel finished at the top of the price-weighted average. Today's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for September. Total outstanding consumer credit increased by $19.3 billion in September (consensus $17.5 billion) after increasing an upwardly revised $26.8 billion (from $25.9 billion) in August. The dollar saw big gains, with the ICE Dollar Index which measures the greenback against a half-dozen rivals, up 0.7%. Gold was down sharply, after gaining 2.2% last week. December gold ended today's session down $24.60 (-1.9%) to $1279.90/oz. December silver closed today's session $0.21 lower (-1.1%) at $18.16/oz. Oil prices rose more than 1%. Crude oil rallied off of 6-week lows hit on Friday, snapped its 6-session loss streak, saw a boost ahead of tomorrow's Presidential election. December crude oil futures rose $0.74 (+1.7%) to $44.82/barrel. Treasuries finished on a lower note as the long end of the curve underperformed. The yield on the 2-yr note finished higher by three basis points (0.82%) while the yield on the 10-yr note ended up five basis points (1.83%). Today's trading volume was above the average of 861 million as more than 889 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.

The attack on October 21, 2016 consisted of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, and blocked access to thousands of websites, including Netflix, Amazon, Twitter, Airbnb, the New York Times, PayPal, and more. Immediately, suspicions centered on Russia and China as having both the motivation and the ability to plan and execute such an attack. Yet as of this writing, it is not at all clear if the attack was state-motivated. After the attack, it was reported that the Chinese and Russian hacker group known as New World Hackers assumed responsibility and claimed it was a sophisticated attack using botnets at higher-speed traffic than ever know before – 1.2 terabytes per second (Tbps) The attack exploited vast numbers of connected devices (in an announcement to the media, Dyn stated that some 100,000 devices were involved). These devices, also known as the Internet of Things (IoT), include webcams, alarm systems, baby monitors, internet-based security cameras, DVRs, printers, and routers – all connected to the internet. The attackers managed to plant a software component in these devices that could receive commands from a control server so that the masses of devices all sought out the target in a synchronized manner and paralyzed the attacked servers’ ability to function by flooding it with traffic. The vast majority of these devices lack any kind of significant defenses; access to most of the systems is ensured through default usernames and passwords installed by the manufacturer. In fact, there is no current effective concept to respond to this type of threat. The threat inherent in the swarm of connected devices is not new. As early as 2013, Symantec reported the existence of a worm called Linux.Darlloz that according to estimates, infected some 50,000 IoT connected devices, such as routers and Set Top Box devices or computers based on Intel’s X86 architecture. The goal was to install software allowing attackers to mine crypto currencies. In 2015, Symantec issued a detailed report about simplifications that make it possible to break into 50 different kinds of smart home devices. In its April 2016 report, the company stated that medical devices (such as insulin pumps, X-ray systems, and CT scanners) are also exposed to attack, as well as smart TV systems and dozens of other devices of all types. Even though the ability to penetrate these devices and carry out extensive DDoS attacks through them was not surprising, the intensity of the attacks demonstrated the destructive capability of using a large number of synchronized simple devices. The attack broke the record for the largest DDoS attack ever, which occurred in September 2016, targeting the French company OVH, at a scope of 1 Tbps; it used bots (software agents) that exploited the widespread CCTV cameras. In many respects, this is a dangerous escalation and sets a new threshold for a cyber threat that on a few levels so far has no satisfactory response. The first aspect is connected to the proliferation of these devices. In the US, there are about 25 connected devices per every 100 people, and this is just the beginning of the trend. Gartner Inc. estimates that in 2016 the world will have 6.4 billion connected devices, and that by 2020 that number will approach 21 billion. Such a vast number of devices creates a significant weakness for the web and allows attackers of various sorts to use them for any number of goals. The new twist in the most recent attack was the simplicity with which it was carried out. Millions of devices can serve as the potential means for DDoS cyberattacks whose execution is relatively simple, because the devices create new entrance points to the internet, making the scope of the threat enormous. The threat grows even greater because end devices, such as smartphones and computers, are used to control the connected devices. The second aspect concerns the weakness of the defense. Most IoT devices lack appropriate means of security, making it easy for attacks to exploit the weaknesses of the systems operating the devices. The majority of manufacturers have yet to adopt a framework of standards and security; they generally use publicly available open code to make it possible for their devices to communicate with other similar devices in the area, and this itself generates severe security soft spots. Important corrective steps have been initiated in the United States, as security companies, manufacturer associations, and even government agencies have begun to cooperate, but these steps are far from constituting a sufficient defensive response. The third aspect regards the scope and depth of the damage. The attack on Dyn was a clear warning sign: while the offensive capabilities displayed in the attacks did not require anything particularly sophisticated, the impact was significant. The fact that the malicious code was made public prepared the ground for other attacks that will make use of this or similar code, and raises the specter that the writers of the code already possess an improved version. Thus the use of similar methods of attack will presumably be seen again, perhaps even in more powerful versions. Finally, there is privacy. One of the key problems with connected devices is securing user privacy. Connected devices are constantly collecting information about their users’ parameters, at home and in the office, including the nature of use of equipment and electrical appliances as well as wearable devices, whose use is becoming more widespread. The inherent defensive weaknesses of these devices means that all that information could be available to various attackers intent on subversion. The weakness shown in the last attack is not the burden of the private sector alone. The use of armies of connected devices is a challenge for the state, because it has the capability to harm the routine performance of governments and, worse still, disrupt performance during emergencies and in wartime. Because the risk is real, defending connected devices is an enormous challenge. In response to the attack on Dyn, the United States government was called on to enact regulation on the security of IoT products. Indeed, this seems precisely where efforts should be focused, with measures similar to the steps taken in the financial sector. Although the problem is global, Israeli entities charged with cyber security must fully understand the risk of exposure to such attacks and take action by partnering with international efforts on the issue, while at the same time taking steps to enhance the relevant defensive mechanisms and their continued performance in order to cope with this type of attack. _____________________________________ Dr. Gabi Siboni is a senior research fellow and head of the Cyber Security Program at INSS.

Many of the anti-virus and firewall protection services that are used today were improved upon with Israeli technologies. The dual processors that we use in our portable laptop computers, tablets and smart phones are based on the Israeli invention of the first microprocessor for Intel. The start-up nation with a focal point in Tel Aviv has succeeded in becoming a world-class technology development centre and a leading exporter of innovation. During a recent Digital-Life Design (DLD) Tel Aviv Innovation Festival, which was held in September, leading startup founders from 31 different countries including Kenya met with Israeli companies, startups, scientists, investors and designers. Ms Alice Mueni, head of product at totohealth, a social enterprise which aims at improving maternal health and reducing child mortality via mobile phones attended the innovation festival. The annual festival, a global gathering of innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world celebrated women entrepreneurs in the innovation festival. According to Tel Aviv-Yafo mayor, Mr Ron Huldai, the city’s ecosystem is a leader in gender equality and has been ranked the top hub for women entrepreneurs outside the United States. shaping the future He says increasing number of foreign immigrants make their way to Israel to establish their own start-ups. “Due to Israel’s small and manageable ecosystem, with tax benefits for foreigners that set up shop in the country, the number of foreign-founded start-ups in Israel is on the rise,” he says. The Compass report indicates that Tel Aviv has 20 per cent women founders in startups, while the European average is 17 per cent. The city has a growing number of programs and accelerators such as Campus for mums, a baby-friendly start-up school for new moms, run by Google in partnership with Yazamiyot, a networking group for Israeli women entrepreneurs. In the campus, women on maternity leave are given the opportunity to engage in their own entrepreneurial endeavors while taking care of their little ones in the program.

The world’s largest contract chipmaker has surged 32 percent in 2016, climbing to its highest level versus MSCI Inc.’s global gauge of technology stocks on record. The $156 billion company now accounts for 16 percent of Taiwan’s entire equity market value, the biggest proportion according to data stretching back 13 years, and none of the 33 analysts who cover it recommend selling the shares. While the company has benefited from a broader rally in technology companies this year that’s seen rivals including Intel Corp. reach multi-year highs, TSMC is luring investors with record profit as demand for Apple Inc.’s new iPhones fuels orders for its processor chips. With Samsung Electronics Co. faltering after the scrapping of its Note 7 device, Value Investment Principals Ltd. and Manulife Asset Management Co. say the stock has room to rise further. “Samsung’s issues and the perceived benefit for Apple is surely creating some optimism,” said Sandy Mehta, chief executive officer of Value Investment. “TSMC is the best in class. Valuations are not very high for TSMC, and rising estimates have led to investor optimism. The shares could still have upside.” TSMC trades at 13.9 times forward earnings, less than the MSCI global-technology gauge’s 16.3 times, while analysts project the company’s net income will increase 30 percent this quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit climbed 28 percent in the previous three months to NT$96.8 billion ($3.1 billion) from a year earlier. The stock dropped 0.3 percent on Tuesday. The company’s high dividend yield and reasonable valuation provide good downside protections to the share price,” said Caroline Maurer, head of Greater China equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in Hong Kong, whose greater China fund returned 45 percent this year to beat 99 percent of its peers.

The company will “soon” start mass production of chips using 10-nanometer processors, said Elizabeth Sun, a spokeswoman at TSMC. The smaller chip size allows handset makers more room for new hardware features. Apple Reliance Still, any doubt about the success of Apple’s products can shake investor faith in TSMC’s prospects. The Taiwan stock slid 2.6 percent last week after Apple failed to issue a robust holiday sales forecast in the wake of Samsung’s decision to stop manufacturing the Galaxy Note 7. “A lot of demand is coming from one single device and any hiccup on iPhone sales this and next year could have a big impact on TSMC,” said Mark Li, a strategist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates the stock market-perform. “Longer-term smartphone growth will deteriorate gradually, which is a headwind to the company.” Analysts remain bullish, with their consensus target price implying a 9 percent return over the next 12 months. For Catherine Kung, any correction in share prices is a buying opportunity. “Their technology is strong and it is a dominant player in advanced processes,” said Kung, a Taipei-based fund manager at Manulife Asset Management Co., whose Global Taiwan Equity Fund returned 18 percent this year, beating 94 percent of peers. “Analysts will keep revising up target prices over the next two to three years.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The 802.11ad standard has been given the catchier moniker of WiGig. It enables data speeds as fast as 8 Gigabits per second (Gbps) over short range, according to AnandTech. WiGig operates at the extremely high frequency of 60 GHz, which makes it impossible for signals to penetrate walls and other objects. This means that there must be a line of sight between participants. It therefore is optimized, the story says, for “wireless docking stations, wireless AR/VR head-mounted displays, wireless high-performance storage devices, wireless displays” and other bandwidth-hungry devices. It will be big. ABI Research released research today that suggests 2017 will be a critical year for WiGig as it penetrates the home market. The firm forecasts that more than 1 billion WiGig chipsets will ship in 2021. The key players will be Broadcom, Intel, Lattice Semiconductor, MediaTek, Nitero, Peraso and Qualcomm. The firm also said that it expects 28 percent of smartphones to be “triband,” with 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 60 GHz capabilities. It will be useful in the drive to make computing truly cable-free and, because of the tremendous amount of bandwidth it offers, will help push artificial reality/virtual reality. The short range of WiGig seems, on first glance, to be a severe limitation. It does indeed constrain its use case. At the same time, WiGig adds value in unexpected ways, according to CNET’s Stephen Shankland: The limits of 60GHz radio come with a silver lining. WiGig sends data in highly directional beams instead of bathing a room in radio, an approach that limits interference and lets multiple devices work at top speeds. Also, WiGig signals fade fast. That means you needn't worry if your upstairs neighbor watches 8 hours of streaming video every night. Today's Wi-Fi passes through walls and floors, so a busy neighbor can cause interference on your own network. The master planners who are mapping the march of 802.11 are very savvy. They continually push the speed/distance envelope, of course. But it is important to make the technology more pliable and useful in other ways, as well. WiGig is an initiative that seems poised to do just that. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

Indian-American women put up a good show in the 2016 elections, with Kamala Harris, 51, a two-term attorney general from California, creating history by winning the US Senate seat from the state. Pramila Jayapal, 51, won the Congressional seat from Seattle to enter the House of Representatives, the first Indian-American woman to accomplish this feat. Jayapal would be joined in the House of Representatives by Raja Krishnamoorthi, who made it to the highest citadel of democracy in their second attempt. Ro Khanna, the democratic candidate from California’s 17th District, defeated his party colleague Mike Honda by nearly 19 percentage points. Meanwhile, Democratic Congressman Ami Bera’s election results have gone for recounting. Bera was contesting against Republican Scott Jones for the House of Representatives. “I have full confidence that the professionals who work at the Sacramento County Registrar will ensure that every ballot is counted, and right now we need to let them do their job,” said Bera. “As the first votes were counted on Election Day, I had the greatest lead I've ever had at this stage, so I’m confident that we're again headed toward victory. After months of a divisive national election, our job starting tomorrow is to bring our country back together,” he said. In 2012, and again in 2014, Bera's race was too close to call on election night. In both years, Bera emerged as the winner -- in 2012 by a margin of 9,191, and in 2014 by a margin of 1,455 votes -- after the Sacramento County Registrar of Voters counted these provisional and vote by mail ballots. If re-elected for the third term, Bera would equal the record of Dalip Singh Saund, who was elected to the House of Representatives from the 29th Congressional District of California from January 1957 to January 1963. Jindal, who later went on to become the two-term Governor of Louisiana, was elected to the US House of Representatives twice in 2004 and 2006. Outgoing US President Barack Obama had endorsed Harris, Krishnamoorthi and Bera. Senator Bernie Sanders and former US President Jimmy Carter had endorsed Jayapal. Harris, who was born in Oakland, California, is the daughter of an Indian mother who emigrated from Chennai in 1960 and a Jamaican American father. California Democrats had overwhelmingly endorsed Harris for US Senate, solidifying her front-runner status in the race to become California’s next senator. Endorsing Harris, Obama had said "Kamala Harris fights for us. That’s why I am so proud to endorse her for United States Senator. And if you send her to the Senate, she'll be a fearless fighter for the people of California, all the people of California, every single day." Jayapal entered the US Congress in her maiden attempt. Born in Chennai, she left India at the age of five for Indonesia, Singapore and eventually for the US. Jayapal says her life transformed for the better after she spent some time in India when she returned to the country after a gap of 25 years in April 1995. Her book -- Pilgrimage to India: A Woman Revisits Her Homeland -- was published in 2000. In the primaries, early this summer, Khanna had received more votes than eight-term incumbent Honda. California electoral system allows the top two winners of the primaries to proceed to the general polls, even if they are from the same party. Khanna, 40, had narrowly lost to Honda in 2014 Congressional polls. A Yale law graduate and a former official of the Obama administration, Khanna was pitted against his own party’s Honda to represent the 17th Congressional district of California, whose residents stretch from Tesla Motors factory in Fremont to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino -- taking in Intel, Yahoo, and eBay along the way. Krishnamoorthi, 42, was contesting for the 8th Congressional District of Illinois that includes west and northwest Chicago suburbs. A son of immigrants, Krishnamoorthi grew up in Illinois and after college and law school, he became policy advisor for Obama’s successful US Senate campaign. He also served as a founding prosecutor in Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan’s anti-corruption unit. In an endorsement in June, Obama had said as the son of immigrants who worked their way into the middle-class, Krishnamoorthi understands both the challenges facing America’s working families and the opportunities their work makes possible. “I know he'll fight hard in Congress to create more good jobs, empower more Americans to start businesses, and help working families afford to put their children through college,” Obama had said. Two Indian-Americans in fray from New Jersey and Michigan however lost their bid to enter the US Congress. Democratic Party candidate in New Jersey’s 7th congressional district Peter Jacob lost the race to Republican party’s Leonard Lance, who got 55 per cent of the votes. Jacob came in a close second garnering 42 per cent of the votes. In Michigan’s 11th District, Democratic Party candidate Anil Kumar lost the race, getting 40 per cent of the votes against Republican candidate Dave Trott who was leading with 53 per cent votes.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) might launch its latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus models in jet white color, reports Mac Otakara, citing supply chain sources. However, Mac Otakara didn’t mention the time frame of the launch. At present, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are available in jet black color along with a second black color, as well as gold, rose gold and silver finishes. Analysts observe that Mac Otakara has been precise on numerous occasions about leaking Apple’s information but has also faltered many a times. As far as the jet white color iPhone 7 is considered, the publication itself has added that the information may not be reliable.  There are very high chances of this rumor fizzling out soon. iPhone is one of the primary growth drivers for the company. At its Sep 7 event, Apple announced new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. It does mark a significant improvement over iPhone 6 and paves the way for iPhone 8, which is rumored to be launched around the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone, i.e., next year. Furthermore, the company is expected to gain from the upgrade cycle, especially in mature markets. To further push its advantage, the new iPhones were made available in more than 130 countries, representing the fastest rollout in the history of iPhones. But the macroeconomic headwinds remain for now, especially in China, one of the biggest markets for Apple. Stiff competition is an added concern. APPLE INC Price APPLE INC Price | APPLE INC Quote At present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader tech space include Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL – Free Report) , Facebook Inc (FB –Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC – Free Report) .  Jabil Circuit sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Facebook and Intel carry Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Jabil Circuit has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 41.58% of the trailing four quarters while Facebook and Intel have delivered positive earnings surprises of 21.11% and 12.14%, respectively over the same time frame.

Evison is an experienced prosthetics user, having lost his arm in the 80s at the age of 22, just as the first generation of myoelectric limbs - controlled by the detection of electrical signals from the contraction of muscles - were beginning to be introduced to adult patients. But those early devices have nothing on the Bebonic arm. "This," Evison proudly declares, "is the Rolls-Royce of prosthetics. With the old versions I could just contract the first two fingers together. With this I can type, I can use a mouse, I can, to the frequent surprise of waiters, cut up a steak." Evison is speaking as one of a group of engineers, academics and athletes-in-training gathered in a small room at the back of Stoke Mandeville Stadium, the birthplace of the Paralympic movement, to formulate a vision for the future of disabled sport. A future in which there are no limitations on the technologies that can be used, in which even those with the severest of disabilities can compete, and in which powered prosthetics take their users to the same - or greater - ability level of the able-bodied. This October, that future makes its first appearance at the inaugural Cybathlon, a bi-annual bionic athletics event organised by ETH Zurich. Read more Sound waves that mimic the touch of a button? That's the future Sound waves that mimic the touch of a button? That's the future By Chris Stokel-Walker Welcome to the Cyborg Olympics Welcome to the Cyborg Olympics Sport 06 Sep 2016 There's a sense in which the Paralympics hasn't done enough, says Aldo Faisal, associate professor of neurotechnology at Imperial College London. "They focus on elite-level athletes," he says. "It doesn't cater to those with higher-end disabilities, or the promotion of new assistive technologies." The Cybathlon's six disciplines will focus not only on athletic challenges, but also the ability to overcome everyday obstacles, such as climbing stairs (in a wheelchair); opening a jar of jam (with a prosthetic hand); or controlling a computer (and being quadriplegic). And not only will tech teams compete and learn from each other to develop new solutions, so will the athletes themselves. "When I went to Zurich [for the Cybathlon rehearsal] I felt like, hey, there are other people that know the pain, that understand the struggle of doing the simplest things that others take for granted," explains Team Imperial wheelchair pilot Sivashankar Sivakanthan. "We can bounce ideas off each other and learn from each other's experience of dealing with it." ADVERTISEMENT Read more Robo-couriers are breaking the logistics chain to transform how we order online Robo-couriers are breaking the logistics chain to transform how we order online By Luke Dormehl Though at first glance the Paralympics seems the obvious comparison, the Cybathlon, explains the event's creator, Rob Reiner, will be altogether different. His preferred analogy, and one that occurs frequently when you talk to Cybathlon competitors, is Formula One racing. "We award a medal for both the pilots and the technology," the ETH Zurich professor of sensorimotor systems explains. "It's about the skills that they can have in combination." Skills such as Evison's ability to keep his wrist joint perfectly stable while rapidly spinning it through 360°. That full rotation may not seem like much, but that's how technologies are crossing the boundary from restoration into augmentation. At a recent Cybathlon rehearsal, Evison, a pilot for the Imperial team, outperformed able-bodied users in a test of manual dexterity that involved guiding a loop of wire around another piece without touching. Faisal - who sounds mildly affronted when he explains that the obstacle is worth a mere two points - failed to complete it. And there could be real advantages - for example, on production lines, suggests the Imperial team's co-ordinator Ian Radcliffe, where attachments could allow a prosthetics user to screw bolts into a car. "Prosthetic designers are starting to face questions like, is it OK to have a hand that can spin, and spin and spin?" Evison says. "I've had people say to me that if that thing gets any better, I'm going to want to lose my normal limb and have one of those." ADVERTISEMENT Read more Nasa's quest to bring back supersonic flight with its X-planes Nasa's quest to bring back supersonic flight with its X-planes By Richard Benson ETH's Cybathlon gives awards to the athletes and those who create the technology Señor Salme For participants with more extensive disabilities, such as Tom Nabarro, a software engineer for Intel who was paralysed from the neck down in a snowboarding accident in 2007, the competition gets even more interesting. In the brain computer interface (BCI) race, competitors must guide an avatar around a course with the power of their mind alone. An electroencephalography cap detects the electrical signals of activity across the brain, then deep-learning algorithms attempt to extract the small suggestion of an intention amid this noisy, buzzing confusion. "You think of natural actions, like clenching your hand, which comes quite naturally," Nabarro explains. "The concentration is very intense, but you can train by pretending you're playing the game and thinking through those actions every morning." Whereas standard BCI devices can discriminate little more than the equivalent of an on/off switch, the BCI challenge requires the use of four separate controls for running, jumping and steering. "You can think of standard BCI technology as being like a mouse click. We want to give people a keyboard," says Faisal. Read more WIRED Horizons: What does the future look like? WIRED Horizons: What does the future look like? By Jeremy White For Nabarro it's more about moving beyond the standard computer peripherals, to new interfaces between humans and technology. "Working with BCIs is the future of technological interaction," Nabarro says. "I use voice recognition, but it's still based around a mouse or keyboard. And if you think about it, this may not be the most efficient way to interact with a computer." Faisal agrees that human-computer interaction needs re-thinking, but he has something much cheaper than the £200,000 EEG cap in mind. Rather than extracting intentions in the muddled mass of brain activity, he's created a £200 system to read them directly, the way we already do quite easily - in each others' eyes. Combining a front-facing eye-tracking camera, attached to a powered wheelchair, and a forward-facing Kinect that maps the landscape in front, Faisal's system plots the location of the user's gaze on to this landscape, and directs the chair to that direction. "It was really easy to use on the slalom or indoors. And I really loved the accuracy in being able to turn," explains powered-wheelchair pilot, Sivakanthan. "It takes a bit of practice, but it doesn't take that long to learn." "I've had people say to me that if that thing gets any better, I'm going to want to lose my normal limb and have one of those" Kevin Evison, prosthetics user ADVERTISEMENT Beyond merely directional control, this simple eye-tracking system was sophisticated enough to allow the team to win a recent competition in which its entrant painted a picture with a robotic arm while drinking coffee and eating a croissant with their natural upper limbs. "If you want to grab that glass, you will look at it in one specific way, but if you want to assess how full it is you will look at it in a different way," explains Faisal, who has recently been awarded €4 million (£3.3m) by the European Commission Horizon 2020 programme to develop this system into a robotic exoskeleton for those with upper-arm paralysis. The one commonality in all of Team Imperial's solutions is their non-invasiveness. This isn't a requirement of the competition: one team in the functional electrical stimulation bike race, in which electricity is used to stimulate a paralysed person's muscles, have a participant with surgically implanted leg sockets that carry the current directly into muscle fibres for greater stimulation. But for Faisal, this non-invasiveness is essential. "It has to do both with the restorative method - many, many patients just won't qualify for surgery. Psychologically less stable people will be excluded. Older people will be excluded," he explains, "Then there's the other aspect: when you talk about imbuing able-bodied people with new physical powers. You need to have technologies that you can just take off and you're 'normal' again. The mobile phone is an amazing piece of cognitive augmentation - but how successful do you think it would have been if it had required surgery?" Grounded as he is in understanding the real needs of disabled users, Faisal doesn't shy away from exploring the more fantastical implications of such non-invasive augmentative technologies. "If a device can control a wheelchair, then it should be able to help me drive a car," he says. "If I can control a computer game with my mind, then I should be able to control my phone with it. Researchers are working on prosthetics that give you a sense of touch, but why should that be limited to the form of an arm? You could be an aeroplane and feel the wind on the wings. You could be cleaning up a nuclear spill while physically situated in a safe place thousands of miles away. And with non-invasive technologies, we don't need a future of cyborgs running around, half cut-up. You could shrug on a rucksack and become like Shiva with six arms. It would make childcare a lot easier." These are the kinds of applications more typically found in the files of Darpa's big-budget investments, but the beauty of the Cybathlon, explains Faisal, is that its combination of collaboration and competition both pushes these technologies forward and showcases them outside a military context. There is one problem with the current course, at least according to Kevin Evison - it's too easy. "This is just the start," he says. "I'm all for the course getting harder. I want to be able to show off the super-hand, to compete at the level of superhuman abilities."

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News NYU to Award Scholarships to World's Best Young Hackers, Protectors, and Information Security Researchers BROOKLYN, New York, Nov. 9, 2016  /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — On the eve of the opening of the world’s largest student-led cybersecurity games, New York University’s information security research center announced it will award doctoral scholarships and fellowships to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering to winners who prevail against student hackers and researchers across three continents. The new awards complement more than $1 million in scholarships previously announced for high school students who will prove their mettle alongside undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral students at the NYU Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) finals November 10-12, 2015. Continue Reading Judges for the CSAW Applied Research Challenge select finalists from among the best young security researchers, determined by their already-published work. Representatives from each of the finalist teams then present their findings to a panel of distinguished judges. The CSAW challenge is widely acknowledged as the leading best-paper award in the field. Newly announced scholarships to NYU Tandon aim to help such students advance their groundbreaking research. For the first time in the 13-year history of CSAW, the final round of contests will expand beyond NYU Tandon in Downtown Brooklyn to regional hubs at NYU Abu Dhabi – for finalists from North Africa and the Middle East – and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur  – where finalists from across India will compete. To qualify for the final rounds this week, students bested more than 10,000 competitors worldwide in remote preliminary challenges. “We were gratified by the enthusiastic response and high participation in the inaugural international CSAW, and we know these contests will prove to be effective in engaging and educating students throughout the world in this vital field,” said Ramesh Karri, NYU Tandon professor of electrical engineering and co-founder of the NYU Center for Cyber Security. “We expect to face a shortfall of 1.5 million cybersecurity experts by 2020,” Karri said, citing a widely quoted Frost and Sullivan forecast. “But even that startling number may understate the scope of what we face in trying to protect our personal security, business, critical infrastructure, and national defense. It may prove extraordinarily difficult to find highly educated, brilliant researchers whose far-sighted work can change the security game. That was a major reason that the NYU Center for Cyber Security decided to offer scholarships to CSAW winners – among the best young cybersecurity minds in the world.  We want to open opportunities for them disrupt the future through doctoral studies and beyond.” For those who qualify for admission to NYU Tandon’s highly competitive doctoral programs, scholarships will include full tuition and fellowships. Recipients must win first place at any of the three regional hubs in three contests: the signature software hacking competition, Capture the Flag (CTF); the hardware hacking and protection challenge called the Embedded Security Challenge; and the prestigious best-paper contest called the Applied Research Challenge, which evaluates research that was already peer reviewed for presentation at scholarly conferences and journals. The scholarship winners will be offered the possibility of joint advisement by faculty at IIT Kanpur, one the premier institutes in India for engineering education and research. It recently started a center for cybersecurity for critical infrastructure. “IIT Kanpur played a pioneering role in computer science education in India several decades ago, and hopes to play similar pioneering role in cybersecurity education, research, and awareness in the coming years,” said Manindra Agrawal, the N. Rama Rao Professor in the IIT Kanpur’s Department of Computer Science and Engineering. “We are delighted to join hands with the New York University Tandon School of Engineering to bring the cyber security awareness competitions to India, and to work together to educate the next generation of scholars in this important area.” NYU Tandon is an internationally recognized center for cybersecurity research and education. It has received all three Center of Excellence designations from the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command.  It joined with the School of Law and other NYU schools to form the NYU Center for Cybersecurity (CCS). This interdisciplinary consortium explores new approaches to security and privacy by reaching beyond technology in its research and education, as well as in outreach to shape the public discourse on policy, legal, and technological issues of cybersecurity. Other CSAW prizes will include: All finalists – from nearly 90 teams worldwide – will be considered on a case-by-case basis for admission to NYU Tandon master’s degree programs with partial tuition and fellowship. Cash prizes will be awarded for all first, second, and third-place collegiate teams. Over $1 million in scholarships will be offered to all finalists and winners of the CSAW High School Forensics (HSF) Challenge at NYU Tandon. Scholarships are contingent on admission to NYU Tandon and satisfactory academic progress. New this year, NYU Tandon will award each HSF finalist school a cash prize.  The HSF awards at NYU Tandon are supported by a grant from the U.S. National Security Agency.

Two years back, the company applied for and was granted a patent for using drones to carry screens and pyrotechnics. Now, on Monday, Disney announced that it had been given permission from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use these drones. Disney drones, which would be programmable and semi-autonomous, will direct the formations such as displaying pixels in a giant TV screen formation in the sky. The approval from FAA, which granted Disney a waiver from existing laws controlling drone movement, is not permanent and can be revoked at anytime. It is valid for a period of four years and the company must use authorized remote pilots and prevent the drones from flying uncontrolled over guest-occupied areas. Related Stories Disney's One-Legged Robot Can Hop 19 Times Without Falling Over Specialized Intel Drone For Air Shows Unveiled Disney says that its “imagineers” have some "amazing ideas," although currently the unmanned aerial vehicles can only be flown at night. The company plans to use the technology to enhance its Springs Holiday experience during Nov. 11–Jan. 8 at Walt Disney World, Orlando, featuring a giant Christmas tree drone formation. The company is also working on a yet-to-be-announced nighttime drone show above the Walt Disney World Lake. Drones are fast becoming an attractive option for light shows — Intel also recently unveiled its Shooting Star quadcopter drone, which will form drone swarm formulations to entertain an audience.

(Photo: Brock Elliott) Longtime State Farm agent helps clients, the community State Farm agent Mary Contreras established her business in 1994 in the East Valley. She focuses on providing auto, home, renters’ and business insurance. Her business is set apart from her competitors by an unparalleled passion to serve her clients’ best interests. “We have worked to develop a culture of putting our clients first in every decision,” Contreras said. “The talent and tenure of our team is recognized Valleywide for their quality and we have a unique ability to look at the numbers and develop elegant solutions with affordable premium – utilizing creativity and solutions-based problem-solving from my engineering background.” And, she said, her team “services and pays claims for what we sell. We strive to keep clients for life.” Her mission is simple: to be her clients’ primary source for insurance and financial services. “My team members and I pledge to provide an environment of mutual respect and open communication,” she said. “We will review the insurance and financial services products with you to help meet your individual needs. We will continually improve upon our knowledge and the level of customer service we provide. “ Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Advertiser Video: Contreras State Farm Agency Her superior service has caught the attention of State Farm. Last year, she won the State Farm Chairman’s Circle and Ambassador Awards. Contreras is as dedicated to the community as she is to her clients. Her teen driver counseling programs deliver information and readiness tips to new drivers that help ensure their first years are a little safer. Contreras is a member of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce, past chair of the Women in Business Council, a director of the Chandler Chamber Community Foundation and the Chandler Chamber Liaison to Intel’s Community Advisory Committee. Contreras and her team invite all clients and families twice annually for their Spring Fling and Pumpkin Patch events, at which a complimentary windshield repair clinic is held, where Contreras pays for clients’ windshield repairs to keep their insurance costs low. She has offered this service for 15 years to her neighbors and clients. She also is active with the American Heart Association. An accomplished artist, each year she dedicates a “heart” painting to a Heart Association auction in memory of her mother, Marjorie Bielmaier. Her mother’s untimely death is part of what motivates her to help others. Her mother passed away from a heart attack at age 54 in 1987. “My father became progressively ill over his grief,” she said. She discovered that because of incompetence on the part of professionals helping her family, it was going to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep the land that her family relied on to make a living. “I’m in my current job to make a difference for every life I touch,” she said. “No one on my watch will endure the things that my family did.” Now, after almost 23 years in the insurance business, Contreras is looking at the future of her business. “There is an opportunity for an individual interested in becoming a State Farm agent,” she said. “Our aspirant program is looking for candidates who want to work into this agency through an apprenticeship with our office. I have a great program for the right person.” Story from: Mary Contreras, State Farm 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2eBvigu Chandler Chamber of Commerce Chandler Chamber: Vision for business, growth and prosperity Oct 28, 2016 More Stories from Chandler Chamber of Commerce Chandler rising to embrace tomorrow, today Sponsor story Banking on community connections Sponsor story Bursting with creativity Sponsor story One of a kind Sponsor story

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Microsoft > Windows Phone FLASH SALE: SpyShelter Anti-Keylogger Premium      30% OFF! More Details About Dell's x86 Windows 10 Mobile Phone Emerge GO 6.4-inch display and up to 8GB RAM planned for the device Nov 9, 2016 05:52 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Photos of Dell’s very own x86 Windows 10 Mobile device got leaked the last weekend and new information that reached the web today provides us with a closer glimpse at how exactly the company planned this phone to work. Codenamed Dell Stack, the x86 Windows 10 Mobile device was more of a small tablet, as it featured a display of no less than 6.4 inches in size, according to leaker Evan Blass. And although this might seem huge at first glance, Dell had a different goal in mind when going for such a large display. The Stack was supposed to serve multiple purposes and be used as a desktop and laptop as well, using the power of Continuum, the Windows 10 Mobile feature that allows a phone to double as a desktop when connected to an external screen. Might never launch Work on the project started in mid-2014, the same source adds, and was supposed to enable users to always have their data with them, without cloud transfers that take place between devices. Basically, Dell aimed to offer users full portability with a device that can be easily carried around, but at the same time, without compromising the desktop, tablet, or phone experience in any way. Furthermore, it appears that the phone was capable of running the full Windows 10 when docked, which means that it offered a truly genuine desktop experience to users. The Dell Stack was developed to be powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake Y-series x86 processors, and the company planned different configurations, including m3, m5 vPro, and m7 vPro. There were several hardware options as well, with either 4GB or 8GB RAM, 128GB or 256GB storage (plus the typical microSD card support that’s offered on the majority of Windows phones). The 6.4-inch device was designed to measure less than 9 mm in thickness, and come with features such as an iris scanner for Microsoft’s Windows Hello biometric authentication. At the moment, it’s not yet clear if Dell still wants to release the device, but it appears that it was originally scheduled to go live in spring of 2017. Dell might have very well canceled it, but the current state of the phone is unknown, so it remains to be seen if the company launches it or not. But even if it doesn’t, x86 Windows phones might have a future, and there’s no doubt that Microsoft needs to be part of it. #Microsoft#Windows Phone#Windows 10 Mobile#Dell subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Lenovo to Launch Windows Phone After Blasting Microsoft for Mobile Strategy Discontinued Microsoft Lumia Guilin Windows Phone Leaks in Press Render Microsoft Finds a Way to Make Windows Phones and PCs Even More Personal The Leaked Intel-Powered Windows Phone Was Not the Surface Phone Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Dell Stack, the company's first x86 Windows phone new windows phone apps My Vehicles: Log all expenses related to the maintenance of your car(s) with a smart app for your phone Easy Shopping: Get a friendly assistant for your shopping sessions and use it on the go, from your phone Briefcase: A complete file management solution that supports local files and OneDrive content HQ Music Downloader: A useful helper for finding and getting the preferred music tracks while on the go Gloomlogue: Customize you photos with amazing effects and filters then share the pics on the go Percentages: A useful pack of percentage calculators you can use on your Windows Phone while on the go Account Vault: A simple app made to provide a safe haven for login credentials and other personal data Reader comments HP Elite X3 with Windows 10 Mobile: The PC Experience more on: HP Elite X3 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart.  That's because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit -- principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers.  Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That's no longer a given with Android.  Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google's web search on smartphones. Android was Google's effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world's digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones -- even on Android phones -- the more data is being generating out of Google's reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google's efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it's possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn't willing anymore. It isn't unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven't always been on the same page about the Windows operating system -- a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion's share of the profits, too.  In short, it's hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out.  The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn't even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It's not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can't stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one -- the laser disc player of computing.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The Tokyo region doubles its Asian presence to two regions and six zones, and Google’s ambitious expansion plans include new Asia-Pacific regions slated for Mumbai, Singapore, and Sydney in the next year, and additional new regions in the U.S., Finland, Germany, UK, and Brazil. Google now offers six regions and 18 availability zones, and is scheduled to reach 14 regions and around 40 zones by the end of next year. AWS and Azure are both offered from more regions, and are also planning to launch new points of presence, but the new regions will reduce the difference. READ MORE: Report: AWS Has Twice the Market Share of Microsoft, Google and IBM Combined “Low latency and high performance are key considerations when choosing a region to deploy resources,” wrote Google Cloud Platform product managers Varun Sakalkar and Dave Stiver in a blog post. “By opening a dedicated cloud region in Tokyo, we’re bringing Google’s compute, storage and networking services directly to Japanese businesses. Based on our testing, customers in cities like Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo and Nagoya experience 50-85 percent lower latency on average when served from the Tokyo region compared to Taiwan.” Google Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Persistent Disk, App Engine standard environment, and Container Engine are now available from the Tokyo region, as well as all core networking and security services and some database and analytics services. Google is running Intel Broadwell processors in the region, and has partnered with several companies in Japan to help onboard customers. Google upgraded GCP’s database services for enterprise customers in August. Google has also recently invested in a pair of submarine cables, FASTER and PLCN, as it attempts to scale its network to compete with Amazon and Microsoft.

So what should the tech policy crowd look for in the days and weeks ahead, as a Clinton or Trump administration prepares to take office? Nancy developed this handy primer, based off how things played out in the immediate aftermath of President Barack Obama’s win in 2008: Story Continued Below — The day after the '08 election, the Obama-Biden transition launched Change.gov, pitching it as a source of news and announcements about the incoming Obama administration. The website struggled to stay up on its first day, but Change.gov became a focal point for anyone trying to understand the administration-in-waiting; every edit to its pages was scrutinized for meaning. If history holds, look for the new president-elect’s transition website to go live at some point Wednesday. We’re taking bets on what the domain name will be. StrongerTogether.gov? MakeAmericaGreatAgain.gov? — Seven days later, President-elect Obama began announcing his agency review teams — groups of experts charged with laying out the staffing, budgetary and policy groundwork necessitated by taking over more than 80 federal agencies and offices, including the FCC and FTC. Many of those named to the squads went on to key administration roles: The head of the Obama-Biden “Science, Tech, Space and Arts Team,” for example, was Tom Wheeler, who later became FCC chairman. If the president-elect keeps to a similar pace, we’ll see agency teams being made public around Nov. 18. — And a week after that, Obama named the policy working groups responsible for converting his campaign-trail promises into workable plans for his presidency. The co-chairmen of his Technology, Innovation & Government reform group — a.k.a. TIGR — included future FCC chairman Julius Genachowski, who was Wheeler’s predecessor in that role. Among the ranks of the group’s 30-plus members were future U.S. CTO Aneesh Chopra and future U.S. CIO Vivek Kundra. If the previous pattern holds, the existence of those teams and the names of the people serving on them would be released around Nov. 23. GOOD TUESDAY MORNING!

Pro’s Definitive Guide includes information about the who, what, when, where and why of the presidential transition. Get Pro’s Presidential Transition Roadmap: The Definitive Guide. SENATE RACES WE’RE TRACKING — Along with the House races highlighted in MT on Monday, we’re monitoring a handful of Senate matchups that could have an outsized influence on tech policy in the next Congress: — Burr vs. Ross in North Carolina: Republican Sen. Richard Burr is facing off against Democratic challenger Deborah Ross in a down-to-the-wire race. Burr, chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, is a staunch defender of government surveillance. He has drafted legislation with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would force tech companies to decrypt customer data when served with a warrant. — Johnson vs. Feingold in Wisconsin: Former Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, is vying to take back his old seat from GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, who heads the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Feingold is known as a consumer privacy advocate; he was the sole lawmaker to vote against the USA Patriot Act back in 2001. — Harris vs. Sanchez in California: California Attorney General Kamala Harris and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, both Democrats, are fighting to represent a state that’s home to the nation’s biggest tech companies. Harris has the backing of executives from Facebook, Airbnb, Yahoo and other big-name firms. RNC: DON’T COUNT US OUT ON THE GROUND — Conventional political wisdom holds that Democrats have a killer field-organizing advantage over Republicans. But over at the RNC, they're offering a counter-argument, which boils down to: “It’s just not true this cycle.” They say that about a year ago, well before Donald Trump won the GOP nomination, they began a deliberate effort to swell their volunteer corps, partly by using data modeling of existing volunteers to find others like them. New potential recruits were then targeted via social media, digital video, and online ads under the banner of Where You Lead. — The RNC volunteers are being backstopped by some 3,100 paid field staff — or five times the number they had for Mitt Romney four years ago. “The field team decided to redo their operation this year to reflect much more of what we used to do back in ’04 with Bush-Cheney, and what, I think, Obama did a great job expanding,” RNC chief digital officer Gerrit Lansing tells Nancy. “Basically, community organizing: Having a massive amount of people who were trained and could go and recruit more volunteers to get a huge amount of doors knocked.” Today’s turnout will be a fascinating test of which side of the aisle is right. HOUSING ON THE BALLOT IN SILICON VALLEY — Some of the nation’s wealthiest communities in Silicon Valley are voting on ballot measures to develop more affordable housing. In Santa Clara County, home to Apple, HP and Intel, Measure A would authorize the local government to issue a $950 million bond, paid for by an increase in property taxes over the course of thirty years. Residents in Alameda County, home to Tesla and Pandora, will vote on a $580 million bond measure. And in San Mateo County, the home base for Facebook, voters will pass judgment on a 20-year extension of a half-cent sales tax increase approved four years ago. — On the state level, Proposition 54 may infuse a bit more tech into California’s legislative process. The rule would require that all bills be published on the internet for 72 hours before lawmakers are able to vote on them. It would also force the legislature to share all of its activity via downloadable audiovisual recordings on the internet. PODESTA FILES: APPLE CEO WAS EARLY CLINTON ADOPTER — Back in June of 2015, Apple boss Tim Cook was described by a Clinton campaign official as someone who is “not very political” but “loves HRC,” using the Democrat’s initials as shorthand. That’s according to an email, sent the week after Clinton had formally kicked-off her campaign, per a WikiLeaks disclosure of digital goodies said to be hacked from the account of campaign chairman John Podesta. Campaign finance chairman Dennis Cheng adds that former EPA administrator Lisa Jackson, then-and-now an Apple exec, was helping Cook to get more engaged in politics, including holding a few Senate fundraisers. The thread seems to reference a meeting between the campaign and Cook that they were cooking up for three days hence. MERGER MANEUVERING — Watch for industry rivals to try to work the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal to their advantage, reports Bloomberg. “The merger offers competitors and partners a rare opportunity to cut more favorable deals with both companies in exchange for their public endorsement, which can be valuable in getting regulators to sign off,” according to the story. It quotes one analyst as saying Netflix will play a key role; the company’s CEO, Reed Hastings, has offered support for the deal if AT&T doesn’t favor Time Warner-held HBO. FCC PUSHED ON DAKOTA ACCESS PROTESTS — Digital activists want the FCC to investigate whether law enforcement used wireless jammers or surveillance equipment on cellphone signals at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests in Standing Rock, N.D. Demand Progress launched an FCC petition over the weekend, which by Monday afternoon had collected more than 20,000 signatures. The petition cites #NoDAPL protesters as saying their cell signals suddenly disappeared as police moved in on the assembly late last month, according to the petition. An FCC spokesman declined comment. A 2014 agency enforcement advisory notes that rules against cellphone jamming apply to local law enforcement, but Donnell Hushka, a spokeswoman with the Morton County Sheriff’s Department in North Dakota, told MT: “We aren’t using this technology, do not own this technology and have no plans to acquire or use it in future.” QUICK DOWNLOADS A second Samsung phone model could be exploding, too: A customer in France reported that her Galaxy J5 caught fire and exploded this past weekend. Samsung also ran full-page ads on Monday in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, apologizing for the Galaxy Note 7 recall. Comcast’s NBCUniversal lands exclusive deal for Apple News ad sales: It takes effect in January. Per Recode: “Publishers who put content on the app can still sell their own ads and will keep 100 percent of the revenue from any ads they sell. The new deal means that NBCUniversal, instead of Apple, will sell any remaining ad inventory.” Prosecutors to interview Julian Assange on Nov. 14: Swedish and Ecuadorian authorities will interview Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London about the alleged 2010 rape in Sweden that prompted the WikiLeaks mastermind to seek refuge in the embassy. He has not been charged. Twitter reportedly in talks to sell Vine: It is reviewing term sheets from several parties interested in purchasing the company, including Japanese messaging company LINE, reports TechCrunch. Pandora sets diversity goal: The streaming service pledged to increase the proportion of its U.S. employees of color to 45 percent, from 35 percent today, by 2020. Quote of the day: “The way campaigns have gotten, we’ve come to accept crazy stuff as normal. And you see the strategy of just repeating attacks and outright lies over and over again. But it gets churned in social media and Facebook, and no matter how false they are, they just create this cloud of dust.” — President Barack Obama, on the potential of social media to distort information, during a Clinton campaign rally in Durham, N.H.

The letter, led by the National Association of Manufacturers, stressed the “urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions and to bolster the promise of America.” To #BeTheSolution, let’s start with infrastructure, a bipartisan priority. Let’s rebuild not just our transportation infrastructure but also modernize our energy infrastructure, and pipelines, and broadband infrastructure—to boost America’s quality of life. Less than 1/2 of households in the bottom quintile of the economy have high-speed broadband. With “Building To Win,” we can build a stronger, more inclusive economy. America is falling behind the rest of the world, but with a serious, targeted plan we can secure our economic leadership, spur real economic growth and offer more people the dignity of work.

However, 77 per cent of Canadians say they are satisfied with the level of technology at their jobs – a stark contrast to their global counterparts, the company said. Nor was it the only way that Dell found Canadians breaking rank with international trends: When it came to low-tech versus high-tech office perks, 45 per cent of Canadians preferred the former, versus 29 per cent globally; Half of us would willingly use virtual and augmented reality products at their office, compared to 66 per cent globally; Less than half of Canadians believe artificial intelligence will make jobs easier, versus 62 per cent of global respondents; 90 per cent of Canadians prefer face-to-face interaction over remote communication, compared to 57 per cent internationally. However, this comparative conservatism among Canadians when it comes to embracing new workplace technology doesn’t mean we’re averse to it, Dell noted: When asked if they had plans to participate in the so-called “sharing economy,” illustrated by Uber and Airbnb, 60 per cent of Canadian respondents said they planned to embrace it, a rate consistent with their global counterparts. Then there were the 42 per cent of Canadian employees who said their workplaces weren’t smart enough. Moreover, only 39 per cent expected to be working in a smart office over the next five years, whereas 57 per cent of global respondents did. The findings indicate that the more access Canadian employees have to technology, and the more experience they have using it, the more likely they were to say their workplace wasn’t going far enough: 35 per cent of respondents said their home was more cutting edge than work, for instance, a number that rose to 41 per cent among employees at large enterprises. Unsurprisingly, millennials were also found to embrace new technology more quickly than their global peers: 46 per cent reported believing they will work in an Internet of Things (IoT)-driven smart office within the next five years; and 75 per cent agreed that new office technology could make their jobs easier. In an Oct. 31 statement, Dell EMC Canada CMO Carolyn Rollins said that while Canadians might not presently be early adopters of workplace tech, that’s no excuse for employers to rest on their laurels: “Generational shifts and the increased participation of millennials and youngers in the workforce bring growing expectations that their employers integrate the latest technologies seamlessly and securely into their working lives,” she said. “While this may seem daunting for employers, it’s a business-critical opportunity for Canadian companies to be at the forefront of the future workplace.” To conduct the survey, Dell and Intel commissioned research firm Penn Schoen Berland (PSB) to survey 3,801 full-time employees at small, medium, and large organizations across seven industries (education, government, financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, media and entertainment, and retail) in 10 countries, including 300 from Canada. It’s worth noting that one reason so many Canadians might be satisfied with the level of technology at their jobs is that 83 per cent of Canadian respondents were happy, period, with their jobs, especially remote (90 per cent) and public sector (85 per cent) employees. Meanwhile, technology had nothing to do with why Canadians were satisfied or unsatisfied with their jobs: those who were cited work-life balance (33 per cent) and colleague relationships (26 per cent) as the two job aspects they were happiest with; while those who weren’t cited salary (38 per cent), opportunities for career growth (27 per cent), and flexibility in choosing where to work from (19 per cent) as the three leading reasons they wanted to leave.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Mobile Phones Lenovo to use Moto branding for all future phones Mobile Phones Lenovo to use Moto branding for all future phones By Bindu Nair - Nov 9, 2016 Lenovo may be planning big changes for its smartphone business, with a new report alleging that it’s going to stop selling phones under its own name and just use Motorola’s ‘Moto’ moniker for all its handsets in the future. The news comes amid a dismal showing in the second fiscal quarter of 2016. Lenovo has been trying to determine a successful strategy for its phone portfolio ever since it took over Motorola back in 2014. It had previously decided to market Moto and Lenovo devices separately in order to prevent overlap. Now it seems the brand has decided to go for a completely new approach. As per Campaign Asia, smartphone sales for Lenovo and Moto were $2 billion in the second fiscal quarter of 2016, a 12% year-over-year fall. The former’s CEO and Chairman Yang Yuanqing tried to put a positive spin on the results by asserting that its mobile division had a good quarter-to-quarter volume growth of 20% and margin improvement.

The brand’s PCs are still king when it comes to sales, contributing to 70% of total revenue per year. Other the massive shift in strategy, the company is also overhauling its internal leadership. Xudong Chen is now being replaced by Gina Qiao as the co-president and SVP of Lenovo’s Mobile Business Group in China. The move is apparently meant to improve the firm’s marketing capacity in the country. According to Yang, the brand’s overseas smartphone performance has been better than China’s. Lenovo has also hired a trio of executives from Intel, Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent so that it can slowly transition from a hardware company to a customer-oriented one which focuses on devices with cloud services and artificial intelligence.

The addition of software security services provider Cigital and the provider of complimentary security tools Codiscope will boost its software security offering so that security can be built into every software segment. Terms of the deal are not being disclosed. The acquisition will add complimentary products, services and a highly skilled workforce to Synopsys’ Software Signoff Platform, enabling it to offer a wide range of products and services, from security training and testing services to automated tools that can be integrated into the software development lifecycle. Cigital is an application security firm specializing in professional and managed services for identifying, remediating and preventing vulnerabilities in software applications, which spun-off Codiscope in 2015 which turned the Cigital tools and intellectual property into a suite of accessible and streamlined tools for a broad population of developers. "Synopsys, Cigital and Codiscope have a shared vision of building security into the software development lifecycle and across the cyber supply chain," said Andreas Kuehlmann, senior vice-president and general manager of the Synopsys Software Integrity Group. "Cigital's consultants are instrumental in guiding organizations from the earliest stages of security readiness and system maturity, which will provide an impactful addition to Synopsys' current product-based offering. Codiscope's developer-focused tools and training modules are important in empowering developers to prioritize security.” John Wyatt, Cigital CEO, added: “We are excited about joining an organization that shares Cigital's vision of securing the software that is at the heart of every organization by building security in. The shared vision of the two companies will provide Cigital the opportunity to accelerate our growth while continuing to deliver consistent, quality services to our clients." "Codiscope's mission of improving the quality of software by creating tools that help developers build and deploy secure code faster is a natural fit in the Synopsys vision of Software Integrity," said Gary Jackson, CEO of Codiscope. “As the velocity of development increases, security belongs in development, and Codiscope will provide Synopsys critical tools to lead the industry." In an email to Infosecurity, Quocirca analyst and director Bob Tarzey said that unlike the acquisition of McAfee by Intel which created the DeepSAFE technology, Cigital/Codiscope is about software security scanning and quality. “This is a big issue with IoT and the other stuff Synopsys develops and sells, so it would seem it sees a benefit in having the capability to test its software in-house,” he said. “Cigital has a service focus based on software security pen-testing and has hundreds of staff, these will be an asset for Synopsys as much as the technology it is acquiring.” Why Not Watch? 6 Nov 2014Shipping Secure Software: Strategy and Tactics for Infosec Managers 17 Dec 2015Ensuring Office 365 Security 19 Feb 2015Secure Data in the Cloud – Learn to Combat Cyber Threats to Protect Your Assets 2 Jul 2015Protecting Data Across Cloud Applications: the Hidden Challenge Related to This Story Interview: Matt Kingswood, ITS Video Interview: John Bruce, CEO & Co-Founder -Resilient, an IBM Company Symantec Name President and COO Would Like to Meet Ping Identity Set to be Acquired by Vista Private Equity What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?
