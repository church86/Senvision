Both chipmakers posted disappointing gains compared to their industry peers, but could one bounce back before the other? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Sep 10, 2016 at 2:38PM Many chipmakers have rallied over the past year, thanks to improving sales of chips for mobile devices, Internet of Things devices, connected cars, and other gadgets. That optimism boosted the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index by 20% since the beginning of 2016, which easily outperformed the Nasdaq's 6% gain. However, two major chipmakers, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), underperformed the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index by a wide margin. Intel shares rose just 6% during that period, while NXP gained a mere 3%. Image source: Getty Images. Did those two stocks underperform the sector for valid reasons, or are they poised to catch up? Let's compare the two chipmakers' core businesses, growth, and valuations to decide. What do Intel and NXP sell? Intel is the world's largest manufacturer of x86 CPUs for PCs and servers. Its core client computing business, which includes its PC chips, generated 54% of its revenue last quarter. The data center group accounted for 30% of its revenue. The remaining 16% of Intel's revenue came from its programmable solutions group (programmable chips acquired from Altera), non-volatile memory solutions group, Internet of Things group, and Intel security group (formerly known as McAfee). Intel recently agreed to sell a majority stake in Intel security to private equity firm TPG. NXP sells a wide variety of chips for connected cars, security devices, and mobile chips. Through its acquisition of Freescale last year, NXP became the world's largest manufacturer of automotive chips. It also supplies the NFC (near-field communication) chips used for "tap and pay" payments and file transfers used by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other mobile device makers. NXP's BlueBox platform for autonomous cars. Image source: NXP. Last quarter, 36% of NXP's sales came from automotive chips, 22% came from SCD (secure connected devices) chips, 19% came from its SI&I (secure interface and infrastructure) business, and 8% came from SIS (secure identification solutions) chips. These chips are all classified under its HPMS (high-performance mixed signal) division. Thirteen percent of NXP's revenue came from its standard products division, which sells discrete, logic, and PowerMOS chips to a wide variety of industries. NXP is currently divesting this slower-growth unit to Chinese investment firm Jianguang and private equity firm Wise Road Capital for about $2.75 billion. How fast are Intel and NXP growing? Intel's revenue rose just 3% annually last quarter, with a 3% year-over-year decline in client computing revenue and 5% growth in data center revenue. Its client computing sales fell due to the ongoing slowdown in PC sales and Intel's failure to gain a foothold in the mobile market dominated by ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH)-based chips. Its data center growth was also disappointing, because the chipmaker previously claimed that the segment could achieve 15% annual sales growth between 2015 and 2019. Looking ahead, analysts expect Intel's revenue to rise 4% this year. NXP's revenue rose 57% annually last quarter, but that figure was greatly inflated by the Freescale acquisition, which closed last December. On a combined and adjusted basis, which normalizes those figures, NXP's sales actually fell 8%. Automotive revenues rose 5%, but that growth couldn't offset double-digit declines across all three of its secure solutions businesses. A large part of that decline was caused by lower orders of NFC chips for mobile devices, which are included in its SCD segment. Analysts expect NXP's revenue to rise 55% this year, due to the purchase of Freescale, but only grow 5% next year. NXP also faces significant Brexit-related eurozone headwinds, since the chipmaker is based in the Netherlands. The aforementioned divestment of its standard products unit could also weigh down year-over-year comparisons. Profitability and valuations Intel's GAAP net income fell 51% annually to $1.3 billion, but that still gave it a decent net profit margin of 9.6%. On the same basis, NXP reported a net loss of $13 million last quarter, compared to a profit of $300 million a year earlier. That's because Intel's operating margins have been consistently higher than NXP's. Data source: YCharts. Analysts expect Intel to post 7% non-GAAP earnings growth this year and an average of 10% earnings growth over the next five years. This gives it a five-year PEG ratio of 1.5, which is higher than the "undervalued" threshold of 1. NXP's non-GAAP earnings are expected to rise just 3% this year but improve 34% annually over the next five years as the market for connected cars grows. This gives NXP an "undervalued" five-year PEG ratio of 0.5. The verdict: NXP has more room to grow Intel is still a solid "mature tech" play with a decent forward dividend yield of 2.8%, but its upside potential is limited by the sluggish PC market, its low exposure to mobile devices, and its questionable ability to challenge ARM-based chipmakers in new markets like IoT. NXP doesn't pay a dividend, but it arguably has more room to grow in connected cars and NFC chips, and its lower PEG ratio also makes it a better long-term growth play. Therefore, I believe that NXP is clearly a better buy than Intel at current prices. Leo Sun has no position in any stocks mentioned.

As a result of its collaborative with Nvidia, however, IBM now claims to have supercomputers-in-a-slot that are faster and cheaper than equivalent performing Intel-based supercomputers. "Designed from ground up for the cognitive era and datacenter Big Data, our on-chip V-Link to Nvidia Tesla P100 Pascal GPUs delivers 5X faster interconnect data transfer than PCIe — a bi-direction 160 Gbytes per second from CPU to GPU compared to 32 Gbytes for PCIe," Dylan Boday, senior offering manager of Linux infrastructures told EE Times. IBM's supercomputer-in-a-slot claims to have finally bested Intel in price as well as in performance. (Source: IBM) The high-end of its new supercomputer-in-a-slot line is the IBM Power S822LC for higher-performance computing (HPC) applications requiring up to a terabyte of instant-access memory. Plus its POWERaccel Coherent Acceleration Processor Interface (CAPI) enables high-speed interconnects with FPGA accelerators by members of the OpenPower community (nixing another advantage Intel used to have when it purchased Altera). "We have opened up the POWER architecture to all, with an expanding ecosystem surrounding our new servers for faster time-to-market and industry-first innovations available only on POWER," Boday told EE Times. "Our NVLink is embedded at the silicon level and incorporated into the overall system design. This tight coupling of IBM and NVIDIA technology enables data to flow 5X faster than on an x86-based system." IBM is offering three initial models of its supercomputer-in-a-slot with pricing starting as low as $6000. (Source: IBM) Besides the S822LV, IBM is offering two other versions of the new servers: the Power S821LC (a single-slot version of the 822 at a 30 percent lower cost); and the Power S822LC (at 33 percent lower cost than an Intel-based Hewlett-Packard DL380 for an 80 percent better price/performance ratio for Big Data application loads). All three new servers leverage GPU acceleration which can be expanded using Nvidia Telsa K80 GPU accelerators on PCIe cards. "Overall IBM now offers 2.5X better performance than any Hewlett Packard x86 systems, plus we offer a water cooled option for improved efficiency and the ability to run indefinitely at peak turbo-boost speeds," Boday said. "We can also accommodate 42 percent more virtual machines (VMs) per server than Hewlett Packard's x86 systems or can accommodate the same number of users while reducing the number of required servers by two-thirds." All comparisons were made to Intel E5v4 based Hewlett Packard servers, and when asked IBM had no comparison data available for Intel Xeon Phi based supercomputers. However, the U.S. Department of Energys (DoEs) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and several large corporations have already signed on for initial installations in 2017. Pricing starts at $6000. For all the details on IBM's price/performance comparisons see IBM Power Systems — R.

Integrate Intel Corporation's Modem Tech in Future A-Series Processor? Not anytime soon, if ever. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 9, 2016 at 7:05PM A wafer of Intel chips. Image source: Intel.  After Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent iPhone launch event, it became clear that the iDevice maker had opted to use cellular modem chips from microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for a solid portion of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Interestingly, in the wake of the launch event, analyst Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company speculated (via Barron's) that, at some point in the future, Apple and Intel could deepen their collaboration. In particular, the analyst thinks Intel could license its modem technology to Apple for integration into a future A-series processor. That integrated processor, then, would be manufactured by Intel. Is such a scenario likely any time soon? I would actually argue, "No." Here's why. The amount of risk Apple would take in this scenario would be much greater The risk that Apple took on by using an Intel modem for the iPhone 7 is fairly minimal. Had Intel failed to deliver with the modem, Apple had a perfectly acceptable backup solution: simply launch the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)-powered iPhone 7 into all regions. The modems in this case are discrete components and Apple has multiple potential sources, so the risk of a show-stopping issue related to Intel (a new entrant into the iPhone supply chain) was pretty much nil. However, if Apple and Intel were to collaborate in the fashion that Arcuri suggests, the amount of risk the iDevice maker takes on becomes substantially greater. First of all, in such a scenario, Apple wouldn't have two modem suppliers, it would have one. To be blunt, Intel's track record with respect to modems is getting better, but Qualcomm is still the "proven" supplier. This means that if Intel hit a roadblock with its modem technology, it would derail Apple's launch schedule. Additionally, even if Intel executes as needed on the modem side of things, there would still be the risk associated with integrating that modem technology onto the same piece of silicon as Apple's A-series processor. If something went wrong with that integration process it would, once again, force a delay in Apple's product launch schedule. The risk doesn't end here, either. Apple has been using proven contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) to manufacture its chips. Intel is a world-class manufacturer of chips, but to date it has only manufactured chips designed by Intel's in-house teams (and Intel still relies on third party contract chip manufacturers for some product lines, including the very modems that it's currently selling to Apple). It has not proven itself as a capable and reliable contract chip manufacturer. So in this case, Apple moves away from a proven partner that has been able to ramp new technologies on schedule to a completely unproven contract chip manufacturer. This sounds risky to me. This may be possible at some point far in the future, but not anytime soon What Arcuri suggests might be possible at some point in the distant future. Once Intel has built a long and successful track record of delivering world class modems on schedule, and once Intel has proven itself as a contract chip manufacturer, then maybe such an arrangement would be possible. However, such a deal -- were it ever to happen -- would very likely be many years away. Given the fast paced nature of technology, predictions going that far out aren't particularly useful.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Some iPhone 7 Models Are Apparently Packing Intel’s Modems By Tyler Lee on 09/09/2016 18:48 PST For the longest time ever, Apple has relied on Qualcomm for its LTE modems. However rumors from earlier this year suggested that both Intel and Qualcomm could be supplying the modems, which shouldn’t really be surprising as Apple has typically favored diversifying their suppliers so as not to have too much reliance on one of them. However are the rumors true? According to a report from Recode, it looks as though rumors of some iPhone 7 models packing Intel’s modems could be true after all. How did they arrive at this conclusion? Apparently in the fine print of the iPhone 7, it notes that customers who purchase the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus for AT&T and/or T-Mobile will be getting a phone that won’t fully work with Verizon or Sprint. AT&T and T-Mobile are GSM-based carriers, while Verizon and Sprint rely on CDMA technology. Intel’s latest modems, as it stands, does not support the old CDMA standard that Sprint and Verizon are still using, hence the fine print. Unsurprisingly neither Apple nor Intel have offered to comment on it, meaning that we’ll most likely have to wait for a teardown of the iPhone 7 in order to see for ourselves. While diversification is good, Apple did find themselves in a spot of controversy last year when it was discovered that the iPhone 6s/6s Plus had chipsets made by either TSMC or Samsung, with TSMC’s version apparently offering better battery life (at least on paper). Hopefully Apple will be able to avoid this with the iPhone 7/7 Plus. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Intel, iPhone, iphone 7 and Qualcomm.

It seems likely, but Intel will need to close the technological gap with Qualcomm longer term to continue to be inside of Apple's iPhone. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 9, 2016 at 9:05PM Image source: Apple.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has finally made it into the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. The chipmaker is supplying a portion of the modems inside of the iDevice maker's iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus phones. This isn't the sort of win that's going to move the financial needle for the chipmaker, but it does serve as a very real validation of the chipmaker's efforts to build capable cellular modems. With Intel in the mix this year, one has to wonder whether Intel will be able to continue to win future iPhone designs. In this column, I try to answer that question. Beyond XMM 7360 The Intel modem that Apple is likely using inside of the iPhone 7 is the XMM 7360. The modem supports up to 450 megabits-per-second download speeds and 100 megabits-per-second upload speeds. Intel's next modem, a device known as the XMM 7480, still tops out at 450 megabits-per-second download speeds, but it sees an upgrade on the uplink to handle up to 150 megabits-per-second upload speeds. If Apple chooses to keep Intel as a modem supplier for the next-generation iPhone, it would almost certainly use the XMM 7480. Why using XMM 7480 could make sense It's likely that Apple is using Qualcomm's (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X12 modem for the non-Intel versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. That modem, interestingly enough, actually supports 600 megabits-per-second download speeds and 150 megabits-per-second upload speeds. However, Apple only advertised the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as being capable of 450 megabits per second download speeds. I suspect that Apple is sandbagging the capabilities of the Qualcomm modems in the versions of the iPhone that have Qualcomm modems in order to support its dual-sourcing strategy. What I expect, then, is for Apple to continue using the Snapdragon X12 modem inside of the non-Intel versions of its post-iPhone 7 smartphones, but this time, enable them to reach their full upload-speed potential, because the XMM 7480 will finally be able to match it. Intel has a foothold, but it needs to improve its products Frankly, it's quite interesting that Apple was willing to sacrifice the peak download speeds that it was able to advertise for the sake of bringing Intel on as a modem supplier. In the near term, I would expect it to be a mild inconvenience for Apple, as competing smartphone vendors will be able to advertise faster download and upload speeds relative to the new iPhones. Longer term, it looks to me that Apple is making a long-term bet on Intel in a bid to diversify its modem suppliers. By making the required sacrifices to bring Intel onboard for the iPhone 7, Apple makes it worth Intel's while to continue to invest aggressively in future modem technology. With that in mind, Intel is going to need to step it up in terms of features and performance. I don't think Apple will want to artificially restrict the cellular capabilities of its phones in order to accommodate Intel in perpetuity. If Intel doesn't achieve feature/technology parity with Qualcomm over the next, say, three to four product generations, it wouldn't be farfetched to think that Intel would no longer be inside of the iPhone.

Earlier this year, the company said that it used Movidius' vision chips with the Boson's imaging cores. (Image courtesy of Movidius). For years, Intel has traded in a familiar brand of computing. It creates the tiny processors inside desktop computers, laptops, and data centers powering internet services like email. But lately the chipmaker has eyed specialized processors that handle images better than keystrokes. Last year, Intel licensed chip technology from General Vision, a small machine vision chipmaker, for its wearable Curie module. Earlier this year, the company said it was buying Itseez, a startup that writes machine vision algorithms for different types of hardware. Brian Krzanich, Intel’s chief executive, has stressed that its FPGA chips can be used for processing and classifying images. On Tuesday, Intel added to its stockpile of machine vision hardware, announcing plans to buy chip startup Movidius. With customers like Google and Lenovo, the startup is known for making low-power SoCs that find patterns and recognize objects in images. Related Mobileye Reveals Specs for Future Autonomous Driving Chip Seeing is Believing in Embedded Machine Vision Intel Buys Machine Vision Developer Itseez The chips consume so little power that they can perform image recognition without help from the cloud. That, according to Josh Walden, general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, makes them ideal for tiny connected devices that make decisions based on what they see. That includes everything from smartphones and sensors to security cameras and drones, he said in a blog post. “Computer vision will trigger a Cambrian explosion of compute,” said Walden, referring to the evolutionary event that started more than 540 million years ago and produced most of the major animal groups on earth. Movidius’ chips are based on its vision processing unit (VPU), which takes tricky machine vision tasks out of the main processor’s hands. A standard processor would consume too much power and generate too much heat handling the same tasks. VPUs sip a few hundred milliwatts, making it sensitive to the batteries inside tiny devices. In addition to the hardware, Movidius also develops algorithms for deep learning, a type of program that forms abstract concepts by studying huge amounts of data. Movidius’ chips are efficient enough to conduct deep learning tasks, like identifying objects, inside devices. Usually, these tasks are carried out in the cloud, which handles most of the processing. Intel said that it would work toward using Movidius’ chips with its RealSense 3D cameras, which are designed to sense depth and track human motion. The combination, according to Intel’s Walden, could be used in technologies ranging from collision avoidance for drones to eye tracking for virtual reality headsets. Intel has fiercely promoted its RealSense camera in recent years. At the Intel Developers Conference last month, it was the focal point of several big announcements, including Intel’s Project Alloy virtual reality headset and autonomous drone piloting system. A new version of the RealSense camera also factored into the new Euclid and Joule modules. “When computers can see, they can become autonomous and that’s just the beginning,” said Remi El-Ouazzane, Movidius’ chief executive, in a blog post about the deal. He said that merging Intel’s cameras with Movidius’ chips will enable devices to “understand their surroundings and navigate accordingly.” Investors have also acknowledged the potential for Movidius’ vision chips. Founded in 2006, the fabless chipmaker defied investor apathy for chip startups and raised $86.5 million in funding. The San Mateo, Calif.-based company has about 180 employees. Movidius also supplies chips to the same hardware makers that Intel is courting with its own processors. Google used the chips inside its Project Tango tablets and later licensed Movidius’ processor design for other devices. In June, Lenovo said that it is using Movidius’ vision chips in its virtual reality headsets. The chipmaker has also worked with drone manufacturer DJI and thermal camera maker FLIR. Neither company revealed terms of the deal. But Intel has not been stingy in acquiring new chip designs. It paid $16.7 billion last year to acquire Altera's FPGA technology. Last month, technology news site Recode reported that Intel paid over $400 million for Nervana Systems, a start-up making server chips for artificial intelligence. Founded in 2014, Nervana had raised $24.4 million in funding. For Intel, the acquisition marks its latest bet on the Internet of Things, which it has said is the fastest growing part of the company. It represents another ripple from Intel’s decision this year to eliminate 12,000 jobs and de-emphasize its PC business. El-Ouazzane said that Movidius dovetails with Intel other business efforts around cloud computing and 5G wireless networks. “Movidius has been attacking this challenge from the device level,” he said in a blog post. “At Intel, we will be part of a team that is attacking this challenge from the cloud, through the network, and on the device.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 user-1230872 on Sep 12, 2016 Intel’s RealSense platform was the star of its Intel Developer’s Forum conference in San Francisco last month and it seems the company is only looking to grow the scale and capabilities of its computer vision tech.

But what's missing grabbed most of the attention: the headphone jack. On The Late Show, host Stephen Colbert delivered a parody of Wednesday's release, dressed in the style of Apple CEO Tim Cook, in an untucked dark-blue shirt. He took away not just the headphone jack but also the home button, the glass front -- and the back. "We thought, if less is more how much more could we less?" he said. Apple's all-too-serious move to remove the connection to its iconic white earbuds and urge people to use cordless AirPods -- sold separately for $159 -- points to the company's vision of a "wireless future," which could someday extend to home appliances, cars and more. There was other news: Nintendo's Super Mario is coming to the App Store, and you can be part of the Pokémon Go scavenger hunt on a revamped Apple Watch. It was a consumer tech show for sure, with no mention of business. But CIOs should take notice. Even though its iPhone sales have flagged recently, Apple still sells big to consumers -- and those who buy also go to work. "CIOs would be best served by paying attention to what kind of technology their employees like and prefer to use," said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester Research. "But most important, focusing on how mobile can help them, because the business impact is undeniable." Apple-to-apples comparison Irwin Lazar, an analyst at Nemertes Research, said CIOs should think about the new iPhone 7 features and other Apple announcements in digital-transformation terms: "What can we deliver to mobile devices both internally and externally?" he said. The Apple Watch, for example, which comes with a faster, dual-core processor, might be able to run business applications that couldn't be run before. And apps may require tweaking to offer what the new phone has. "If I'm delivering an application that allows people to take pictures of something," Lazar said of a CIO, he or she should "make sure that I can support the enhancement that the camera provides." Overall though, the tweaks Apple introduced were incremental, Lazar said, and won't have as big a business impact as the release of the new mobile operating system, iOS 10. The new version, which will be released Sept. 13, will work with third-party applications like corporate phone systems from Cisco or Microsoft, making it easier for workers to make business calls from their personal devices. Hefty, hefty iPhone 7 But some of the tweaks Apple was proudest of, like the iPhone 7's new "ruggedized" exterior, could prove beneficial in a number of contexts, Voce said, including retail and air travel -- and it will compete well with efforts rivals like Samsung have been doing to make their devices tougher and more resilient to drops and bad weather. "There are scenarios where organizations might use devices in less-than-ideal conditions," he said. "You get on a flight nowadays -- every flight attendant is going to have a mobile device, and it usually has been ruggedized to a certain extent." Apple also debuted real-time collaboration capabilities in its iWork productivity suite -- which includes word processing, presentation and spreadsheet applications. The new feature will allow people working on the same project to contribute images, text or graphics. That may seem like Apple wants a piece of the market segment dominated now by Microsoft, with its Office suite, and to a lesser extent Google, with its cloud-based Apps for Work. But its impact will be primarily in education, not business, Voce said. Making inroads in business would be "extraordinarily difficult." Lazar's forecast: "Most people won't be using iWork in a business context." 'Increased competition' The Apple rollouts may have another, less-direct effect on business, Voce said: It may very likely trigger industry-wide change. The company has "spurred an intensity" in the tech market, Voce said, pushing Microsoft to make its Surface tablet offering easier to use, for example, and Dell to improve its XPS computer line. "What you've seen is that kind of focus on experience has driven the whole industry to raise their game," Voce said. "And as consumers and employees, we benefit. Apple led that charge and the benefit is increased competition." CIO news roundup for week of Sept. 5 The iPhone 7 and other Apple upgrades prevailed in the news this week. Here's what else made headlines: HPE is slimming down. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will spin off and merge its non-core software assets with UK-based technology firm Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion, HPE said Wednesday. "With today's announcement, we are taking another important step in achieving the vision of creating a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company well-positioned for our customers and for the future," Meg Whitman, president and CEO, said in a press release. HPE's non-core software assets -- Application Delivery Management, Big Data, Enterprise Security, Information Management & Governance and IT Operations Management -- will combine with Micro Focus' portfolio to help drive software innovation and create a "pure-play" software company, according to the release. HPE shareholders will have a 50.1% ownership of the merged company, and Micro Focus will pay $2.5 billion in cash to HPE. This follows the announcement in May that HPE would merge its IT services business with Computer Sciences Corp. Google plans to acquire Apigee. The search giant said it is set to acquire San Jose, Calif., API management provider Apigee for $625 million. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are used by developers to interface and integrate with outside applications and services, and "the addition of Apigee's API solutions to Google cloud will accelerate our customers' move to supporting their businesses with high-quality digital interactions," said Diane Greene, senior vice president for Google Cloud services, in a blog post. The deal is expected to close by end of this year. Apigee was founded in 2004 as Sonoa Systems, and the company went public in 2015. Its customers include Walgreens, AT&T, Burberry and Live Nation. In other Google news, the company announced its partnership with Box on Wednesday. Intel boosts computer vision strategy. In an effort to bolster its RealSense platform, chip maker Intel is acquiring computer vision startup Movidius, Intel announced Monday. Movidius designs system-on-a-chip (SoC) products, and its low-power and high-performance SoC platforms will help accelerate Intel's computer vision applications, said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager at Intel's New Technology Group, in a blog post. "This acquisition brings algorithms tuned for deep learning, depth processing, navigation and mapping, and natural interactions ... and machine intelligence," Walden wrote. Intel will deploy Movidius' vision chip technology in devices like drones and robots, and use it to improve augmented, virtual and merged reality technologies. Mobile device infections on the rise. Smartphones accounted for 78% of infections detected in mobile networks during the first half of 2016, according to a new report by the Finnish mobile phone company Nokia. The report's data was aggregated across the networks where the Nokia NetGuard Endpoint Security solution is deployed. The report found that the smartphone infection rate rose 96% between January and July this year when compared with the second half of 2015. The mobile infections hit an all-time high in April, with malware affecting one out of every 120 smartphones, the report states. Android devices where the most targeted, accounting for 74% of all mobile malware infections. The Nokia Threat Intelligence Report - H1 2016 identified Uapush.A, Kasandra.B and SMSTracker as the top three mobile malware threats, accounting for 47% of all infections.

Add My Comment Cancel   [-] abuell - 10 Sep 2016 7:06 PM I found it interesting that there's some controversy around Apple removing the headphone jack on the iPhone 7. Accusing them of benefiting through the move which could spur more sales of Beats. If you don't like it, there's a easy solution to that: don't spend $650+ on an iPhone. That's just foolishness.  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] ncberns - 12 Sep 2016 8:18 AM News of the non-jack has been unavoidable. Of course if buyers are willing to drop almost a $1000 for a new phone they really don't need, an extra $150 for a new headset (they also don't need) won't mean much. What say we all stand by while Apple dukes it out with all the pro-jack folks until there's a clear winner of this tempest in a teapot "advance".  Add My Comment Cancel   [-] AlbertGareev - 12 Sep 2016 4:40 PM I actually find the news in the absence of truly innovative advances from Apple - for quite a while. Another disappointment is due to a gradual degradation of iOS based software quality. Crashing apps slowly become a norm.

Integrate Intel Corporation's Modem Tech in Future A-Series Processor? Not anytime soon, if ever. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 9, 2016 at 7:05PM A wafer of Intel chips. Image source: Intel.  After Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent iPhone launch event, it became clear that the iDevice maker had opted to use cellular modem chips from microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for a solid portion of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. Interestingly, in the wake of the launch event, analyst Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company speculated (via Barron's) that, at some point in the future, Apple and Intel could deepen their collaboration. In particular, the analyst thinks Intel could license its modem technology to Apple for integration into a future A-series processor. That integrated processor, then, would be manufactured by Intel. Is such a scenario likely any time soon? I would actually argue, "No." Here's why. The amount of risk Apple would take in this scenario would be much greater The risk that Apple took on by using an Intel modem for the iPhone 7 is fairly minimal. Had Intel failed to deliver with the modem, Apple had a perfectly acceptable backup solution: simply launch the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM)-powered iPhone 7 into all regions. The modems in this case are discrete components and Apple has multiple potential sources, so the risk of a show-stopping issue related to Intel (a new entrant into the iPhone supply chain) was pretty much nil. However, if Apple and Intel were to collaborate in the fashion that Arcuri suggests, the amount of risk the iDevice maker takes on becomes substantially greater. First of all, in such a scenario, Apple wouldn't have two modem suppliers, it would have one. To be blunt, Intel's track record with respect to modems is getting better, but Qualcomm is still the "proven" supplier. This means that if Intel hit a roadblock with its modem technology, it would derail Apple's launch schedule. Additionally, even if Intel executes as needed on the modem side of things, there would still be the risk associated with integrating that modem technology onto the same piece of silicon as Apple's A-series processor. If something went wrong with that integration process it would, once again, force a delay in Apple's product launch schedule. The risk doesn't end here, either. Apple has been using proven contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) to manufacture its chips. Intel is a world-class manufacturer of chips, but to date it has only manufactured chips designed by Intel's in-house teams (and Intel still relies on third party contract chip manufacturers for some product lines, including the very modems that it's currently selling to Apple). It has not proven itself as a capable and reliable contract chip manufacturer. So in this case, Apple moves away from a proven partner that has been able to ramp new technologies on schedule to a completely unproven contract chip manufacturer. This sounds risky to me. This may be possible at some point far in the future, but not anytime soon What Arcuri suggests might be possible at some point in the distant future. Once Intel has built a long and successful track record of delivering world class modems on schedule, and once Intel has proven itself as a contract chip manufacturer, then maybe such an arrangement would be possible. However, such a deal -- were it ever to happen -- would very likely be many years away. Given the fast paced nature of technology, predictions going that far out aren't particularly useful.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Broad themes include: User-centered design Validated learning (build-measure-learn) Exceptional quality Disciplined execution Radical collaboration ...which help us execute against Mozilla's 2016 planning Top Line Guidance areas: Build for Quality Invite Participation Be Clear Compelling and Focused Grow our Influence Prototype the Future Ideas for speakers are solicited from Mozillians on an ongoing basis using this speaker submission form. Preference is given to practitioners i.e. those with hands-on experience in their particular subject area. The speaker(s) will present live from a mozilla office and be streamed to the rest of the offices via Air Mozilla and publicly archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance is 20-30 with remote attendees ranging from 100-200; follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Goal Our goal is to engineer individual connection points and create compelling opportunities beyond day-to-day work for office-based staff to come together in our spaces (in most cases) to share an experience and interact with the those they may not normally work with. Face-to-face chats among people with different skills might spark new ideas, lead to new solutions or at the least, increase workplace camaraderie. Our ultimate goal is to improve performance, innovation and overall engagement. Testimonials "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Hashtag: #mozSS COMING IN 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 29 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t mozilla: for one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On September 29, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: Currently a senior advisor to Google, from 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others).

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

Hashtag: #mozSS March 24, 2016: The Role of a Product Manager with Josh Elman, Greylock Partners Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, March 24 @ Mozilla MV - 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: The Role of a Product Manager - and Everyone Else "The job of a product manager is to help your team (and company) ship the right product to your users.” Seems simple - but anyone who has worked on a product knows it’s not. At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

This guide describes the implementation of an industrial use case using Intel® IoT Gateway and the IBM Watson IoT Platform running on IBM Bluemix. Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. This guide describes the implementation of an industrial use case using Intel® IoT Gateway and the IBM Watson* IoT Platform running on IBM Bluemix*. The building blocks for implementing this use case are described in Connecting to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform with Intel® Gateway IoT Software Suites. That guide covers setting up an Intel IoT Gateway, connecting sensors, setting up the IBM Watson IoT Platform running on Bluemix, and connecting the gateway to the Watson IoT Platform so that you can send real-time sensor data to the cloud for storage and processing. Use Case and Business Imperative The use case is a facility for storing bulk sugar used in industrial baking. The ideal storage conditions for sugar are at a temperature of 20–25°C with a relative humidity (RH) of 55–60 percent. When stored under proper conditions, sugar has a shelf life measured in years. When conditions are outside ideal ranges, several issues arise: Temperature greater than 25°C promotes caking because water vapor is released. An RH less than 50 percent promotes caking, hardening, and loss of flowability. An RH greater than 70 percent promotes syrup formation, tackiness, and mold and yeast growth. Temperature variations up and down cause the release of water vapor and recrystallization, which results in agglomeration (sticking together). It also leads to crust formation on storage container walls. The storage facility has traditionally used manual techniques to take periodic temperature and humidity measurements at the beginning and end of the work day, evaluate the readings to detect issues and take corrective actions, and maintain records for historical purposes. This process is labor intensive, doesn’t measure conditions 24 hours a day every day, and can fail to detect temperature up/down cycles that degrade the sugar. It’s also difficult to evaluate the storage conditions over long periods of time, which is important, as the amount of sugar stored fluctuates throughout the year due to variations in baking cycles. The storage facility wants to expand its business but realizes that its current approach to managing storage conditions won’t scale. After conducting a series of business strategy sessions involving the marketing, sales, IT, and operations teams, the company identified several operational objectives to help grow and scale the business: Automate the process of continuously measuring temperature and humidity in the storage silo. Automatically detect temperature or humidity issues and alert the operations team so that it can take corrective actions. Have all the measurement data in one place so that up/down variations in temperature can be detected and evaluated over time (including as the seasons change). Be able to view current and historical measurement data. Have the data in a computerized format so it can be used to demonstrate to prospective customers how the company ensures a high-quality product through continuous monitoring of storage conditions. Implementation Approach To implement this use case, you’ll use the following components. Use Connecting to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform with Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suites to get these components up and running. Intel® IoT Gateway and Temperature/Humidity Sensor An Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKE gateway running an Intel® Atom™ processor will reside onsite at the storage facility. The gateway will be used to control an industrial temperature and humidity sensor (OMEGA* RH-USB) mounted in each storage silo. It has a stainless steel housing and is suitable for either wall or duct mounting. The sensor measures temperature from -17 to 49°C (±1°C accuracy). It measures RH from 2 percent to 98 percent (±3 percent accuracy). The sensor provides standard USB output, which you use to read temperature and humidity data using the gateway. You will write the software on the gateway in Node-RED*, which is a graphical tool for wiring Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The gateway software will periodically read the sensors, format and combine readings into a measurement data set, and securely transmit the data to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform for further processing. IBM Bluemix Bluemix is a cloud platform for hosting scalable services, applications, and data. You will use it to run the IBM Watson IoT Platform and IBM Watson IoT Platform Analytics Real-Time Insights services. IBM Watson IoT Platform The IBM Watson IoT Platform allows you to connect devices and gateways securely to the Bluemix cloud so that you can exchange data with other services and applications. It also provides tools that allow you to view device status and monitor real-time device data feeds. IBM Watson IoT Platform Analytics Real-Time Insights This service allows you to monitor and contextualize data from your devices and gateways, visualize what’s happening in your operations, and respond through automated actions. You’ll use this service to create rules and automated actions driven by the temperature and humidity measurements coming from the gateway. Prerequisites and Overview of Changes Connecting to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform with Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suites provides step-by-step details for setting up your Intel® IoT Gateway with an RH-USB sensor, establishing a Bluemix account, and creating instances of the IBM Watson IoT Platform and IoT Real-Time Insights services on Bluemix. Complete those steps, and then verify that real-time temperature and humidity readings appear on the gateway’s Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal and real-time temperature appears on the Watson IoT Platform dashboard. That configuration will be the basis for changes and additions to implement this use case. Gateway Changes On the Intel® IoT Gateway, you’ll make the following changes to the base configuration described in Connecting to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform with Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suites: Modify the Node-RED flow to treat the RH-USB sensor as a separate device attached to the gateway. Report temperature and humidity in a combined data message sent from the gateway to The IBM Watson IoT Platform. IBM Watson IoT Platform Changes On the IBM Watson IoT Platform, you’ll make the following changes to the base configuration described in Connecting to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform with Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suites: Create a new device type for the OMEGA RH-USB sensor. Enable historical data storage in the IBM Watson IoT Platform. Send sensor data to IoT Real-Time Insights using a data schema. Create rules that monitor temperature and humidity thresholds and trigger actions when they are out of bounds. Create actions to send a text message and email when temperature or humidity readings are out of bounds. Implementation Details To implement the use case, you must make some changes and additions to both the gateway and the IBM Watson IoT Platform using what was covered in Connecting to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform with Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suites as the starting point. Log in to the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub and your IBM Watson IoT Platform account using two separate browser sessions. You want to be able to access both systems quickly during these steps. You make changes marked with Gateway on the Intel IoT Gateway. Make changes marked with IBM Watson IoT Platform on the IBM Watson IoT Platform service and changes marked with IoT Real-Time Insights on the IoT Real-Time Insights service. Gateway: Your starting Node-RED flow in the Intel IoT Gateway Developer Hub looks like Figure 1. This flow reads the RH-USB temperature and humidity sensor once per second, displays real-time temperature and humidity values in the Intel IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal, and sends the temperature readings to the IBM Watson IoT Platform, where they’re displayed on the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard. Figure 1. The starting Node-RED flow in the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal. IBM Watson IoT Platform: Complete the following steps: On the Devices page, click the device types tab, and then click Create Type. Click Create device type, and then set the name to RH-USB and the description to Temperature and humidity sensor. Click Next. On the template page, select the Manufacturer and Model check boxes, and then click Next. Set the manufacturer to Omega and the model to RH-USB, and then click Next. Leave the optional metadata blank, and then click Create. You should now see two device types in the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard (Figure 2). Figure 2. Your two devices in the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard. Click the browse tab, and then click Add Device. Choose the RH-USB device type, and then click Next. For Device ID, type RH-USB-1, and then click Next. Leave the optional metadata blank, and then click Next. For Security, you’ll use Auto-generated authentication token, so click Next to use that option. Review the summary page, and then click Add. After adding the device, you see the device credentials. Copy the Organization ID and Authentication Token strings to a text file and save it for later use (Figure 3). After you close this page you won’t be able to see the auto-generated authentication token again, and you would have to re-create the device to get a new one. Figure 3. Credentials for your RH-USB device. You should now see two devices in your device list in the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard (Figure 4). Figure 4. You have now added two devices to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. Gateway: On the Node-RED canvas, double-click the RH-USB node, and then click Edit flow. The details of the RH-USB node open in a new tab (Figure 5). Figure 5. The details of your RH-USB node open in a new tab. Click the plus sign (+) shown in callout 1 in Figure 5 to increase the number of outputs from 2 to 3. Doing so adds a third output that you can reposition to be below output 1 on the flow. Double-click the function node (see callout 2) to edit it. Increase the number of outputs to 3, add the extra code shown in Figure 6, and then click Ok. Figure 6. Extra code for the new function node. This change causes the third output of the RH-USB node to emit a combined temperature and humidity object that you’ll use to send temperature and humidity measurements to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. Wire the third output of the function to output 3, and then add a comment node to describe the third output. The resulting flow should look like Figure 7. Figure 7. The flow after wiring the third output of the function node to output 3 and adding a comment node. Deploy your flow changes to the gateway to make them active. On Sheet 1 of your Node-RED flow, drag another IBM Watson IoT Platform output node onto the canvas and set its properties as follows (Figure 8): Connect as: Gateway (Registered) Credentials: Watson IoT Gateway Credential Device Type: RH-USB Device Id: RH-USB-1 Event type: event Format: json Name: Send to Watson IoT Registered w/Device ID RH-USB-1 Figure 8. Properties for the new output node. Click Ok. Note that you’re specifying the RH-USB device type and RH-USB-1 device instance that you created in the IBM Watson IoT Platform. You set up the Watson IoT Gateway Credential in Connecting to the IBM Watson IoT Platform with Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suites; it defines the name and device ID of the gateway itself. Delete the Node-RED wires going into the Send to Watson IoT Quickstart and Send to Watson IoT Registered nodes, and connect a wire from the third output of RH-USB to the input of Send to Watson IoT Registered w/Device ID RH-USB-1. This path sends the temperature and humidity data to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. The updated flow should look like Figure 9. Figure 9. The updated flow after connecting a wire from the third output of the RH-USB node. Deploy the updated flow to make it active on the gateway. IBM Watson IoT Platform Navigate to the Devices page and click the RH-USB-1 device. In the Recent Events section you should see a series of events: These are the temperature and humidity readings coming from the gateway. Click an event to see the reported data. At this point, you have live temperature and humidity data flowing from the RH-USB sensor to the gateway. The gateway combines and preprocesses the data, and then generates data packets that it sends to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. Next, you add functionality to the IBM Watson IoT Platform to process the data packets. IoT Real-Time Insights Go to your Bluemix dashboard, and then click IoT Real-Time Insights to access the IoT Real-Time Insights dashboard. You must define a schema that describes the data packet coming from the sensor. To do so, complete the following steps: In the navigation links toward the top, click Devices, and then click Manage Schemas. Click Add new message schema. On the Message Schema page, in Name, type Temperature_Humidity. Click Link data source, and then choose Intel IoT Gateway for Data source. For Device type, choose RH-USB. Leave Event set to + (All events), and then click OK. Click Add data points, and then choose Add from connected device. Select d, temperature, and humidity, and then click OK. Verify that your schema looks like Figure 10, then click OK to add it. Figure 10. Your new message schema. Navigate to Devices, then click Browse Devices. Click RB-USB-1. You should see live sensor data, which should match the readings on the gateway’s Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal (Figure 11). Figure 11. The sensor data in your gateway’s Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal. Next, add business logic to monitor temperature and humidity conditions and send email and text alerts when they are out of range. To do so, complete the following steps: Navigate to Analytics, and then to Rules. Click Add new rule. Set the following fields (Figure 12): Name – Temperature problem Description – Temperature is outside desired range Message schema – Temperature_Humidity Figure 12. Adding rules for your sensor data. Click Next. Now you see the rule editor, which is organized as a series of "If This Then That" (IFTTT) rules. If conditions use AND and OR logic to define trigger conditions. You define one or more actions in the THEN section to perform actions when the trigger conditions occur. To monitor the storage temperature range, define an IF condition that detects temperature readings too low or too high. Complete the following steps: Click New condition. Complete the data fields as follows: Compare to: Select Data Point. Data point: Click Select data point, and then choose temperature in the d data set. Operator: Choose <. Compare with: Choose Static value. Value: Type 20. Click OK. Click the plus sign under OR, and then add another condition for temperature > 25: Compare to: Select Data Point. Data point: Click Select data point, and then choose temperature in the d data set. Operator: Choose >. Compare with: Choose Static value. Value: Type 25. Figure 13 shows the complete dialog boxes. Figure 13. Completed properties for your IF…THEN rules. Click Trigger every time conditions are met, and then set the frequency requirement to trigger if conditions are met 10 times in 15 minutes (Figure 14). Figure 14. Set the frequency requirement for your IF…THEN condition. Click Save. In the THEN section, click New action, and then click Add action. You’ll create an email action that sends a notification email to the operations team. Fill out the fields as follows, and then click OK: Type: Send email Name: Send email to ops team To: <Email address to receive notifications> CC: <Additional email address, if desired> Subject: Temperature problem in sugar storage Select Prepend with "IoT Real-Time Insights alert" Figure 15 shows the completed dialog box. Figure 15. The completed Add New Action dialog box. Click the newly created action in the Set the action dialog box, and then click OK to add the action to the THEN section. In the THEN section, click the plus sign next to the email action to add a second action. Complete the files as follows: Type: Send email Name: Send email to ops team To: <Mobile phone’s email-to-text address> CC: <Additional email address, if desired> Subject: Temperature problem in sugar storage Select "Do not include device data in the email message" Figure 16 shows the completed dialog box. Figure 16. The completed Edit Action dialog box. Your IF…THEN rule set should look like Figure 17. Figure 17. The completed IF…THEN rule set. Change the Alert priority to High, and then click Save. All the actions you define you can view and update by clicking Analytics, and then clicking the Actions tab in IoT Real-Time Insights. Actions include sending email, calling a webhook, invoking a Node-RED flow running in Bluemix, and triggering an IFTTT action. Your new rule should show on the Analytics > Rules page and currently be in the Deactivated state (Figure 18). Click the gear icon on the Temperature rule, and choose Activate. Keep in mind that for the IoT Real-Time Insights free plan, rules can only be active for 1 hour, after which they are automatically deactivated. Figure 18. Your new rule on the Analytics > Rules page. Test the rule by raising the temperature of the RH-USB sensor above 25°C for at least 15 seconds. You should receive an email message and a text message from IoT Real-Time Insights similar to Figure 19. Figure 19. Sample alert from IoT Real-Time Insights for an out-of-bounds temperature reading. Next, add a rule to monitor the humidity range. Complete the following steps: Add a new rule named Humidity problem. Use the d.humidity data point. Add two condition checks using the OR operator: one for humidity < 55 and one for humidity > 60. Set the trigger frequency to 10 times in 15 minutes. Create and add two new actions named Send humidity email to ops team and Send humidity text to ops team. Save the rule, and then activate it. The completed rule should look like Figure 20. Figure 20. New rule to monitor the humidity range of your sensor. When humidity is out of range, IoT Real-Time Insights generates an email and text alert, similar to the temperature case. Bringing It All Together At this point, a real-time monitoring solution is in place that will notify the operations team when storage conditions are outside the desired range. To take it further, you can use the power of the Intel® IoT Gateway Technology combined with the IBM Watson* IoT Platform and Bluemix* to implement a variety of additional functionality. Here are a few ideas. With respect to the gateway, you could connect more temperature and humidity sensors or combine data from multiple sensors and send to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. You could drive a live temperature and humidity display and control temperature or humidity remediation devices. In addition, consider using the built-in security features to harden your gateway. For the IBM Watson IoT Platform and other services on Bluemix, you could send temperature and humidity data to a database for long-term retention. Dashboard displays could be added to show sensor data and monitoring alerts or display sensor locations on a map. By adding more complex data analytics and machine learning, you could spot trends and detect undesirable temperature cycling patterns. You can even create and host a mobile app that lets you view storage conditions on a mobile device. The possibilities are virtually limitless.

This guide shows you how to set up and program three key components for designing and developing real-world Internet of Things (IoT) apps Editorial Note This article is for our sponsors at CodeProject. These articles are intended to provide you with information on products and services that we consider useful and of value to developers Get access to the new Intel® IoT Developer Kit, a complete hardware and software solution that allows developers to create exciting new solutions with the Intel® Galileo and Intel® Edison boards. Visit the Intel® Developer Zone for IoT. This guide shows you how to set up and program three key components for designing and developing real-world Internet of Things (IoT) apps: Arduino 101*, with the Seeed Studio Grove* Starter Kit Plus – IoT Edition Intel® IoT Gateway IBM Watson* IoT Platform hosted in the IBM Bluemix* cloud The Arduino 101* (Figure 1) is a low-power processor board for building a variety of sensor applications. It features a 32-bit Intel® Quark microcontroller, an Intel® Curie module with flash and SRAM memory, a Bluetooth* Low Energy radio, and a 6-axis motion sensor with accelerometers and gyroscopes. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 4 can be used as Pulse Width Modulation outputs), 6 analog inputs, SPI and I2C communications interfaces, and a USB interface for serial communications. Its Arduino header allows you to add a variety of Arduino shields for additional I/O and communication capabilities. Figure 1. The Arduino 101* The Arduino 101* can be programmed using the Arduino IDE with standard Arduino programming commands. It can also be controlled remotely using the Firmata protocol and associated Firmata sketch that runs on the Arduino 101*. Seeed Studio Grove* Starter Kit Plus The Grove* Starter Kit Plus provides a way to add mix-and-match sensors and actuators to the Arduino 101* to prototype IoT applications (Figure 2). It consists of an Arduino-compatible shield (which plugs into the Arduino 101* base board), with a set of connectors for different types of Grove sensors and actuators. More than 200 Grove sensors and actuators are available, and the Grove Starter Kit Plus contains components such as: Temperature sensor Buzzer Button LED indicators Sound sensor Three-axis digital accelerometer Touch sensor Light sensor LCD character display Rotary angle sensor Piezo vibration sensor Figure 2. The Seeed Studio Grove* Starter Kit Plus Intel® IoT Gateways Intel® IoT Gateways (Figure 3) are edge-processing nodes that combine an Intel processor; a robust operating system; security software; various types of I/O interfaces; and several networking options, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and wireless WANs. Gateways tie together groups of individual devices — for example, a set of sensors within a building. They allow hierarchically organized IoT systems and provide critical functions such as local device I/O management (for example, combining data from groups of localized sensors), secure access to upstream systems (for example, cloud platforms), network security and device isolation, remote software updates, and the ability to continue performing local processing in the event of WAN issues. Figure 3. The Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE IoT Gateway You can choose from a variety of Intel® IoT Gateways, each with different combinations of capacity, form factor, operating temperature range, and I/O interfaces. Which gateway you use generally depends on the needs of your application and the environment in which it will be deployed (for example, an office environment versus an industrial environment). In this guide an Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE gateway will be used. You can use a variety of languages to program Intel® IoT Gateways, including Python*, Node.js*, C/C++, Java*, and graphical environments such as Node-RED. IBM Watson* IoT Platform The IBM Watson* IoT Platform running on IBM Bluemix* is a cloud-based platform for connecting devices and gateways in the physical world with scalable processing and storage services running in the cloud (Figure 4). It provides a highly scalable environment for building real-world applications in domains such as asset management, facilities management, manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, energy, and smart cities. The IBM Watson IoT Platform lets you register and manage devices, connect devices and applications in real time using the industry-standard Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, securely exchange device commands and data, store and access device data, view operations in a powerful web portal, and allow devices to interact with a wide range of other applications and services available in the Bluemix cloud. All these capabilities are critically important when designing IoT applications that will scale to thousands or millions of devices. Figure 4. The IBM Watson* IoT Platform (l) running on IBM* Bluemix* (r) The IoT Development Process Development of IoT applications typically follows these steps: Create an initial idea and candidate use cases. Test and refine the idea through iterative prototyping. Implement and evaluate scalability and product/market fit through pilots and trials. Productize the solution and design for manufacturing, and design for scale. Bring to market and deploy to production. Operate and maintain over time. The Arduino 101*, Intel® IoT Gateways, and the IBM Watson* IoT Platform provide a rich and scalable set of tools to support each step of such a process, shortening overall time to market while providing the scalability, security, and operational features needed for real-world IoT applications. How This Guide Is Organized This guide shows you how to get started with each component and create running applications. Part 1 explains how to set up the Arduino 101*, Grove* Starter Kit Plus, and the Intel® IoT Gateway. The focus of Part 1 is getting sensors to run in a localized environment and generating data. Part 2 explains how to connect the components from Part 1 to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform running in Bluemix*, where data can be stored, viewed, and acted upon to create scalable, sensor-driven business applications. Part 1: Setting Up the Arduino 101*, Seeed Studio Grove* Starter Kit Plus, and Intel® IoT Gateway The Arduino 101* and Grove* Starter Kit Plus are often used during the iterative prototyping and pilot phases of an IoT project. Their combination of powerful computing, wireless networking, variety of I/O interfaces, Arduino-compatible connectors, and mix-and-match Grove sensors and actuators allow you to turn ideas into running prototypes quickly. Fun with the Arduino 101 provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up the Arduino 101*, install and use an integrated development environment, connect the Grove Starter Kit Plus, and run example programs that interact with digital and analog sensors. With the Intel® IoT Gateway, you can build sophisticated IoT applications that require a combination of functionality, security, manageability, and performance. You can connect sensors and actuators directly to a gateway and process and view their data locally. You can also connect groups of sensors (for example, Grove sensors connected to an Arduino 101*) to a gateway for localized processing and to form sensor clusters. Gateways can be securely connected over the Internet to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform so that you can send data to the cloud, where it can be stored, analyzed, and acted upon. Set Up the Gateway These instructions apply to an Intel® IoT Gateway model Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE with an Intel® Atom™ processor. The gateway is preloaded with an operating system image and configured with default system settings. The operating system is the Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite, a robust Wind River* operating system based on Linux*. Set up the gateway hardware by making the following connections: Connect the power supply and plug it into wall power. Connect the gateway to a wired Ethernet LAN network that has connectivity to the Internet. You won’t need to connect a VGA monitor or USB keyboard because they’re needed only when you log in to the gateway system console for administrative purposes. Connect another computer to the same LAN to allow users to log in to the gateway over the wired network. Note: The VGA monitor and USB keyboard connections are useful for debugging gateway startup issues or logging in to the gateway system console during development. For more detailed information about the gateway and setup options, see the Getting Started with Intel® IoT Gateways with Intel® IoT Developer Kit 3.5. Connect a Sensor to the Gateway There are several ways to connect sensors to the gateway; the options depend on the specific gateway model you’re using. For the Intel® NUC Kit DE3815TYKHE gateway, you’ll connect an OMEGA* RH-USB Temperature and Humidity sensor to one of the gateway’s USB ports, as shown in Figure 5. The RH-USB sensor measures temperature ranging from 1°F to 120°F, and relative humidity ranging from 2 percent to 98 percent. It works as a serial TTY device through the gateway’s USB port and reports temperature and humidity as an ASCII string. Figure 5. OMEGA RH-USB sensor connected to the gateway’s USB port Power up the gateway by pressing its power button until the light comes on. The gateway will use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to obtain an IP address from the wired Ethernet LAN. Log In to the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub The Intel® IoT Gateway Software Suite contains a built-in application called the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub, which you use to view gateway status, configure gateway settings, and create sensor applications. The default settings allow you to access the hub over an Ethernet LAN connection at the following address: Wired: http://<gateway IP assigned by Ethernet LAN DHCP server> For example, if the gateway were assigned wired IP address 192.168.22.108, you would access the IoT Gateway Developer Hub at http://192.168.22.108. Open a web browser, and enter the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub URL. If your gateway is operating in demonstration mode, you may see a Privacy Statement that you need to acknowledge. At the login prompt, use the default user name (gwuser) and default password (gwuser) (Figure 6). Figure 6. Log in to the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub If you see a License Agreement page, review the license agreement, and click Agree if you accept the terms. Now you’re logged in to the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub, as shown in Figure 7. From here, you can monitor the gateway and its attached sensors, see real-time sensor data, adjust gateway system administration settings, access documentation, and load new software packages. Figure 7. From the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub, you can monitor and adjust your gateway. The status area (1) shows information about the gateway. The sensor widget area (2) shows real-time data from attached sensors. Here, the RH-USB temperature is displayed. In the command area (3), you can navigate among different functions in the gateway by clicking their icons: Sensors – display the sensor dashboard. Packages – install or update software packages on the gateway. Administration – access operating system commands and additional configuration tools. Documentation – tutorials, guides and best practices. Note: The RH-USB temperature sensor will appear as Linux TTY device /dev/ttyRH-USB on the gateway, which is a symbolic link to the physical USB TTY port into which the sensor is plugged—for example, /dev/ttyUSB0. If you plug in other USB devices, the physical TTY port number might shift, so this is the first thing to check if you don’t see the sensor in the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub sensor list. When you first log into the gateway, there may be updated software packages available. To check for updates, click on the Packages icon and look at the Install Updates button. If it shows updates available, click Install Updates to download and install the updates. It may take some time depending on how many updates are available. After installing the updates, reboot the gateway by clicking Administration and then Restart OS. Develop a Sensor Application To program the gateway, you can write code in Python*, Node.js*, and other languages and run it directly on the gateway’s Linux* operating system. However, the gateway also contains a powerful software environment called Node-RED*, which provides a graphical environment for creating, testing, and deploying IoT applications. Node-RED is an open-source, visual tool for wiring together hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs), and online services in new and interesting ways. It is written in Node.js, and automatically runs when the gateway starts. For detailed documentation about Node-RED, see the Node-RED Documentation. To access Node-RED, navigate to the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub’s main portal by clicking the Sensors icon, and then clicking Manage Sensors. Doing so takes you to the Node-RED canvas, where you’ll see a default starter flow for the RH-USB sensor. A Node-RED application consists of nodes that perform specific operations and wires that connect nodes together to form end-to-end flows. In the web-based user interface (UI), drag and drop the nodes and wires on the canvas using drag-and-drop actions. There are three main types of nodes: Input nodes – read data and generate events. Output nodes – write data and allow debugging. Function nodes – process or transform data and events. Other types of nodes are used for special purposes, such as email and Twitter integration and disk file I/O. There’s also a large ecosystem of community-developed nodes that you can add to the Node-RED environment to support other types of sensors, send and receive data to cloud services, and perform various processing algorithms. See the Node-RED Library for examples of community-developed nodes. The gateway also contains built-in support for MQTT, which is an industry-standard machine-to-machine IoT connectivity protocol that follows the Publish–Subscribe architectural pattern. As part of that support, there are built-in sensor data display widgets that you can wire into your gateway Node-RED flow to display data in the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal. They display data published to the gateway’s /sensors MQTT topic. To learn how to set up a connection to IBM Bluemix* using MQTT, see Connecting to IBM Bluemix* Internet of Things Using MQTT. Much has been written about Node-RED, and the Intel® IoT Developer Zone has a step-by-step video to help you get the RH-USB temperature and humidity sensor running on the gateway. Follow the steps described in the video. After completing it, you should see both temperature and humidity displayed on the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal (Figure 8). Figure 8. Temperature and humidity displayed on the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal. If you heat or cool the RH-USB temperature probe, you should see the temperature increase or decrease in real time based on the default 1-second sampling rate. Note: The default RH-USB sampling rate is controlled by the Inject input node labeled Interval in the Node-RED flow. Double-click that node to see its parameters and optionally change the rate. If you make any changes, be sure to click Deploy to deploy your modified flow to the gateway. Here’s a brief explanation of how the flow works: The Interval node generates a trigger message once per second that flows into the RH-USB node. The RH-USB node is a subflow that transmits an ASCII command string PA to the RH-USB sensor that’s connected to the /dev/ttyRH-USB serial port on the gateway. The RH-USB sensor returns an ASCII response string over the serial port that’s parsed into separate temperature and humidity values. The separate values flow out of two different output ports of the RH-USB node. The temperature value is converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius through a function node. The function node contains a JavaScript* code snippet that performs the conversion calculation. The temperature and humidity values flow into chart formatting nodes that set display ranges and attributes for the gateway’s charting widgets. The Chart node publishes the formatted sensor data along with the chart display attributes to the gateway’s MQTT /sensors topic, which causes the values to appear on the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal. Notes: To change the temperature display from a gauge-based to a time-based line graph, double-click the Temperature node, and change the Type to Line instead of Gauge. Save the change, and deploy the flow; then, you’ll see a line graph for the temperature. Function nodes allow you to write arbitrary processing functions in JavaScript. For details about writing your own functions, see the Node-RED Documentation. Debug Node-RED Flows An output node named debug is particularly useful for debugging flows (Figure 9). Figure 9. The debug Node-RED output node. When you drag the debug node onto the canvas, anything wired into that node will have each data value displayed on the debug tab of the Node-RED canvas. If the debug tab isn’t visible, you can toggle it on or off by turning the Sidebar on or off (Figure 10). Figure 10. Toggle the Node-RED sidebar on or off. Notes: Turn debugging output on or off by clicking the area on the right side of each debug node. Each time you click it, the debug output is toggled on or off. Clear existing debug messages by clicking the trash can icon on the debug tab. You can use multiple debug nodes in the same flow, each with different connections. Use the Comment node to add comments to your flows. Comment nodes aren’t wired to anything, they only contain text. Use them to describe how your flow works. Role of the Gateway At this point, the gateway is measuring live sensor data from the RH-USB temperature and humidity probe once per second. The values are processed and formatted to the desired units, and the values are published to the gateway’s MQTT broker, where they’re displayed in real-time on the Intel® IoT Gateway Developer Hub portal. If you needed to take additional temperature readings—for example, in a different location, you could add another RH-USB probe and expand the Node-RED flow to measure it, as well. The power of using a gateway is that the gateway can connect groups of sensors, process and combine the raw data locally, and then send the data somewhere else for further processing or long-term storage, which is the focus of the next section. Part 2: Connecting to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform In this section, you connect the Intel® IoT Gateway to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform and send sensor data to the platform for processing in the cloud. The IBM Watson IoT Platform is a cloud-based environment that lets you design, build, scale, and operate production IoT solutions. It consists of a set of services that you configure and connect in building-block fashion. The Watson IoT Platform services are hosted in the Bluemix* cloud, which means that they can also take advantage of the multitude of other cloud services available in Bluemix. You can use the IBM Watson IoT Platform in two basic modes: Quickstart and Registered. For details about these modes, see the IBM Watson IoT Platform Documentation. Connect to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform in Quickstart Mode Quickstart is an open sandbox that allows you to quickly connect a device and view live sensor data. It’s free, and you don’t have to sign up for anything. You can use either real or simulated devices as data sources: No data is retained over time. Quickstart is useful for getting an initial device connected to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform as you’re ramping up your knowledge of it. There are several options for connecting the gateway to the IBM Watson IoT Platform, including writing programs in Python* or Node.js*, and creating flows in Node-RED. In this section, you build your Node-RED implementation from the previous section, and use that method to connect the gateway to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. Start by connecting the gateway to the IBM Watson IoT Platform Quickstart service. To do that, you need a new type of node that knows how to connect to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. An open source Node-RED package named node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot does exactly that. To install the Node-RED components for IBM Watson IoT, add a new package repository to the gateway and install a package from that repository by following these steps: Log into the gateway either from another computer on the Ethernet LAN network or by using a keyboard and VGA monitor connected directly to the gateway. For the Ethernet LAN method, if the gateway’s IP address was 192.168.22.100 the login command would be ssh root@192.168.22.100. Use the correct IP address for your gateway. For the login username use root and the default password root. Run the following command: rpm --import http://iotdk.intel.com/misc/iot_pub.key After the command completes you can log out of the gateway command line shell. The purpose of this command is to install a public key for the Intel software package repository used in the next step. In the IoT Gateway Developer Hub web interface, perform the following steps: Click on the Packages icon and then click the Add Repo button. Under Add New Repository, set the Name field to IoT_Cloud and the URL field to http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/iot-cloud/wrlinux7/rcpl13/. Leave the Authentication information blank. Click the Add Repository button to add the new repository. After adding the IoT_Cloud repository it should be listed in the Existing Repositories list (Figure 11). Click X in the upper right corner to close the Manage Repositories dialog box. Figure 11. IoT_Cloud repository added to the gateway. Next, install the Node-RED Watson IoT packages by performing these steps: Click on the Packages icon and then click the Add Packages button. In the search field, type packagegroup-cloud-ibm which should display the package with that name. Click Install to install the packagegroup-cloud-ibm package. After the installation completes, click X to exit the package installation dialog box. Scroll through the package list to confirm node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot shows on the list of installed packages. Notes: The package installation will fail if the repository public key has not been installed. Next, find the node-red-experience package in the list and click Stop. Then click Start to start it again. The Stop/Start cycle is needed to pick up the newly installed Node-RED package. Click the Sensors icon and then click Manage Sensors. Along the left side you should now see two new types of nodes called Watson IoT: one in the Input section, and one in the Output section. Use the scrollbars to scroll through the list of available nodes. The new nodes allow you to connect to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. Clicking a node in Node-RED displays it’s documentation on the info tab: Input Node Output Node The output node can send data to the IBM Watson IoT Platform, and the input node can receive data from the IBM Watson IoT Platform. You’ll use the output node for your Quickstart connection. Use your mouse to drag the IBM Watson IoT Platform output node onto the Node-RED canvas. Its name will automatically change to IBM IoT Device. Double-click the node to display its properties. The default values will look like the left panel in Figure 12, with the Quickstart ID being randomly generated. Change the values to look like the right panel (set Name to Send to Watson IoT Quickstart) and then click Ok. Figure 12. Customize the input and output node values. Now, add a wire from the F to C node output to the Send to Watson IoT Quickstart node input. The result should look like Figure 13. Figure 13. Add a wire from the F to C node to the Send to Watson IoT Quickstart node. Now, click Deploy to deploy your modified flow to the gateway. Then, double-click the Send to Watson IoT Quickstart node. To the right of the Quickstart Id field, you’ll see a small square button (Figure 14). Click the button to open a new browser window for the Quickstart dashboard, with your randomly generated device ID automatically filled in. Figure 14. Click the button beside Quickstart Id to view live temperature data in your web browser. You should see live temperature data in the dashboard (Figure 15), with a time history graph that updates itself once per second. Your gateway has successfully made its first connection to the IBM Watson IoT Platform. In the Quickstart dashboard in Figure 15, the upper area (1) shows the time history of the received data, and the lower area (2) shows the most recent event data the platform received. Figure 15. Viewing time history and most recent event data in the Quickstart dashboard. Connect to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform in Registered Mode Registered mode is the next step up from Quickstart. You register for an account on Bluemix* and set up an instance of the IBM Watson* IoT Platform running on Bluemix. There are free and paid tiers; which you choose generally depends on the data and processing volumes and the number of devices in your application. For this guide you’ll use the free tier, because the number of devices and amount of data will be relatively small. Registered mode is what you use to create production IoT applications. Create an instance of the IBM Watson IoT Platform running on Bluemix where you can define your device and accumulate data. You’ll also create an instance of IBM Watson IoT Real-Time Insights, which allows you to enrich and monitor data from your devices, visualize what’s happening, and respond to conditions through automated actions. If you don’t already have a Bluemix account, creating one is the first step. On the IBM Watson IoT Platform Quickstart page, scroll to the bottom and look for the Sign Up button. Alternatively, follow this link. Bluemix currently has both a "Classic" UI and a "New" UI. This guide uses the New UI, and you can switch to it by clicking Try the new Bluemix. Keep in mind that Bluemix is a dynamic environment, and the UI will evolve over time. To create a new Bluemix account, click Sign Up, enter the required information, and then click Create Account. Additional information and how-to guides are available on the Bluemix site. The signup process creates an IBM* ID that you use to log in to Bluemix. Log in to Bluemix by using your newly created account. You should see a welcome page that lists a variety of service categories, including Internet of Things. Click Internet of Things: You should see several available IoT services, including the IBM Watson IoT Platform and IoT Real-Time Insights. Click the plus sign (+) to add a new service to your Bluemix account, then click Internet of Things Platform. Select the free plan, and then click Create. Bluemix provisions your Internet of Things Platform service; when it’s ready, it appears as a tile in your Bluemix dashboard. Now, create an instance of the IoT Real-Time Insights service, and select the free plan. When it’s provisioned, your Bluemix dashboard should show both service tiles (Figure 16). Figure 16. The IBM Watson* IoT Platform Analytics Real-Time Insights Bluemix dashboard. Note: In Bluemix, there’s a main account-level console and individual service dashboards for the various services you add to your account. The process of instantiating a service and adding to your account is called provisioning. After a service is provisioned, it appears as a new tile in your main Bluemix console. The Bluemix console and individual service dashboards will have different URLs. The top-level Bluemix console URL may look something like "https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net" and the Watson IoT Platform console may look like "https://xxxxxxx.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/". You can bookmark the console and dashboards to make them easier to access. Now, connect the two services so the IoT Real-Time Insights service can get data from the IBM Watson IoT Platform service. The process is described in the IoT Real-Time Insights documentation and is summarized below: In the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard, generate a new API key. Write down the API key and authentication token. (You can only view the authentication token when it’s first created.) In the IoT Real-Time Insights dashboard, add a new data source, and provide the API key information from step 1. The first time you complete this step, it may take some time during which the browser will be spinning or appear to hang. Give it plenty of time to finish. When setting up the new data source, you enter a name (for this example, name it Intel IoT Gateway), your IBM Watson IoT Platform Organization ID (shown in the Configuration Settings screen of the IBM Watson IoT Platform), and the API key and authentication token created in step 1. Next, connect the Intel® IoT Gateway to the IBM Watson IoT Platform service as a registered device. Navigate to the Internet of Things Platform service in Bluemix, and launch the dashboard. Along the left side, you see the Boards, Devices, Access, Usage, and Settings icons. Click Devices, and then click Add Device. Because this is the first time you’re adding a new type of device, you first need to create a new type of device for the Intel® IoT Gateway. If you click the Choose Device Type list, you’ll see that it’s empty because you haven’t created any device types, yet. Click Create device type, and then choose Create gateway type. In the IBM Watson IoT Platform, there are two categories of connected devices: Device – This is an individual device in the IBM Watson IoT Platform, such as a temperature sensor. A device may or may not have an IP address and the ability to communicate over the Internet. Gateway – This type of device has additional devices connected to it in a hierarchical or cluster fashion—for example, an Intel® IoT Gateway with two sensors connected to it. Gateways are generally able to communicate over the Internet using IP protocols. The difference between the device and gateway device types is that for a device, you perform operations directly between the cloud and the device, whereas for a gateway, you perform operations between the cloud, the gateway itself, and the devices connected to the gateway. In essence, the gateway can act as both a pass-through to the devices and as an intermediate device that can perform device data processing before sending data to the cloud. For details about devices and gateways, see IBM Watson IoT Platform Concepts. The Create Gateway Type function is a set of step-by-step dialog boxes. Enter the following settings as you step through: Name: Intel-IoT-Gateway Description: The Intel gateway <Next> Manufacturer: Checkmarked <Next> Manufacturer: Intel <Next> Leave the Metadata (optional) field blank <Next> <Create> Now that you’ve created a new Gateway type for the Intel® IoT Gateway, it will appear in the list under Add Device. Continuing in the Add Device dialog box, choose Intel-IoT-Gateway from the Device Type list, and then click Next. In the Device Info dialog box, create a unique Device ID for the gateway. Use the gateway’s Ethernet MAC address. Enter your gateway’s Ethernet MAC address (including the leading zeros) in the Device ID field, and then click Next. Leave the optional metadata blank, and then click Next. In the Security dialog box, click Next to use an auto-generated authentication token. On the confirmation page, review all the information. If everything is correct, click Add. If you need to change anything, click Back. When the gateway device has been added, you get an information screen that contains identifiers and authentication credentials. Be sure to save these credentials somewhere safe, because they can not be recovered later. If you misplace them, you’ll have to delete the device and recreate it. Keep in mind that these credentials are sensitive information, so protect them against unauthorized use. When you’re finished looking at the new gateway information and printing or saving it, exit the dashboard by clicking the small circled X in the upper right corner. Now, the gateway appears in the Devices list in the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard (Figure 17). Note that your Device ID will be different based on the MAC address of your gateway. Figure 17. Your device in the IBM Watson* IoT Platform dashboard. Now that the gateway has been defined in the IBM Watson IoT Platform, you can connect to it from the Node-RED flow on the gateway. Going back to the previous Node-RED flow, drag another instance of the Watson IoT output node onto the canvas, and set its properties as shown in Figure 18, being sure to use the correct Device ID for your device. For the Credentials settings, you need the authentication token that you saved when you added the gateway as a new device in the IBM Watson IoT Platform. You also need your Organization ID, which you can find in the IBM Watson IoT Platform Configuration Settings page. Figure 18. Adding a second instance of the Watson IoT output node to your Node-RED canvas. The Watson IoT node expects data in a certain format, so next you add a Function node to format the temperature readings in the correct format. Drag a Function node onto the canvas, double-click it, set the name to Format Temperature, and add the JavaScript* code shown in Figure 19. Click Ok when you’re done adding the code. Figure 19. Configure a Function node. Wire the output of F to C to the input of Format Temperature and the output of Format Temperature to the input of Send to Watson IoT Registered. Then, deploy the changed flow. The resulting flow should look like Figure 20. Figure 20. The changed flow in Node-RED. At this point, live temperature data is being sent from the gateway to both the IBM Watson IoT Platform Quickstart and Registered destinations. In the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard, go to the Devices list and click on your gateway device. You should see a set of Recent Events (changing once per second) and a Temperature reading under Sensor Information. These are the real-time readings that the gateway sends and the IBM Watson IoT Platform receives. Click one of the events under Recent Events: The event data should look something like Figure 21. Figure 21. Viewing your event data under Recent Events This is IBM Watson IoT Platform event JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) that contains a temperature key and corresponding numeric value. It corresponds to the JavaScript code in the Format Temperature node on the gateway: return { payload:
{ temperature: msg.payload }
}; On the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard, navigate to the Boards > All Boards page. The IBM Watson IoT Platform lets you create one or more dashboards (called Boards for short) that display real-time information from your devices. Click on the Usage Overview board, which is a built-in default dashboard. The Intel-IoT-Gateway device should show along with basic data transfer statistics. Next, add a live display of the temperature value to the Usage Overview board. Navigate to the Settings page, which will display at set of Configuration Settings. Under the General section, turn on Experimental Features, then click Confirm all changes. This allows you to add new information cards to your boards. Cards are configurable display widgets that show different types of information on IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboards. Navigate back to the Usage Overview board and you should now see an Add New Card button at the top right of the page. IBM Watson IoT Platform Experimental Features are described in the IBM Watson IoT Platform blog post User Interface Experimental Features. Click Add New Card. In the dialog box that opens, scroll down and click Show more to see all card types. In the Devices section, click Gauge. Choose Intel-IoT-Gateway as the card data source, and then click Next. Click Connect new data set, and then set the following data set fields: Name: Gateway Temp Event: event (pick from menu) Property: temperature (pick from menu) Type: Float (pick from menu, scroll down to see all options) Unit: °C (pick from menu) Precision: 1 Min: 0 Max: 40 Click Next, set size to M (medium), and then click Next. Set Title to Temperature, and then click Submit. You should now see a new widget on your IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard that shows a live display of the RH-USB sensor connected to the gateway. If you warm or cool the sensor, the temperature value should increase or decrease in real time on both the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard and the gateway’s IBM IoT Gateway Developer Hub display. Figure 22 shows the IBM Watson IoT Platform dashboard with the temperature card added. Figure 22. The IBM Watson* IoT Platform dashboard with a temperature card added. Summary and Next Steps At this point, you have an end-to-end running system that collects real-time sensor measurements, processes and displays the data locally on the Intel® IoT Gateway, and sends the data to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform running on Bluemix. The gateway is programmed using Node-RED, which provides an easy-to-use tool for wiring together processing flows and adding sensors or processing algorithms. You could add the Arduino 101* and Grover* Starter Kit Plus – IoT Edition to this environment to prototype additional sensors and actuators by connecting the Arduino 101* to the gateway using USB and adding additional types of Node-RED processing nodes for the Grove components. You’ve also added IoT Real-Time Insights to your Bluemix* environment and connected it to the IBM Watson* IoT Platform service. IoT Real-Time Insights allows you to create if-then logic to monitor sensor data and trigger actions when certain conditions are met—for example, monitoring temperature readings and generating an alert if they exceed a defined range. Industrial Use Case and Tutorial: Intel and the IBM Watson* IoT Platform builds on and extends the foundation established in this guide. The Industrial Use Case develops a sensing application that continuously measures temperature and humidity, and generates email and text message alerts when parameters fall outside acceptable ranges. Having the gateway integrated with the IBM Watson IoT Platform on Bluemix opens a range of other possibilities for storing, processing, and visualizing data using a variety of database and application services available on Bluemix. The Intel IoT Gateway coupled with the IBM Watson IoT Platform on Bluemix provides a robust and powerful environment for building and operating scalable IoT applications.

Prerequisites Intel® IoT Gateway Technology running IDP 3.1 or above with internet access A development device (e.g. laptop) on the same network as the Intel® IoT Gateway Terminal access to the Intel® IoT Gateway from your development device Microsoft Azure account: https://portal.azure.com/ Please see the following documentation for setting up your Intel® IoT Gateway: https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/633284 Adding the IoT Cloud repository to your Intel® IoT Gateway Access the console on your gateway either using a monitor and keyboard connected directly or SSH (recommended). Add the GPG key for the cloud repository using the following command: rpm --import <a href="http://iotdk.intel.com/misc/iot_pub.key">http://iotdk.intel.com/misc/iot_pub.key</a> On your development device (e.g. laptop), open a web browser and load the IoT Gateway Developer Hub interface by entering the IP address of your gateway in the address bar. Tip: You can find your gateway’s IP address using the ‘ifconfig’ command. Log in to the IoT Gateway Developer Hub interface using the credentials root:root. Add the IoT Cloud repository. Go to the Packages section and click the Add Repo + button. Populate the fields with the following information and click Add Repository: Name: IoT_Cloud URL: http://iotdk.intel.com/repos/iot-cloud/wrlinux7/rcpl13 Finally, click the Update Repositories button to update the package list. Adding Microsoft* Azure* support to your Intel® IoT Gateway Click the Add Packages + button to bring up the list of packages you can install. Search for cloud-azure using the search box at the top of the package window. Click the Install button next to the packagegroup-cloud-azure entry. Setup an Azure* IoT Hub In a browser, navigate to the Azure* Portal at https://portal.azure.com and log in to your Azure account. Create a new IoT Hub. Select New in the top left of the Azure Portal. Select Internet Of Things from the list, and select ‘IoT Hub. Give your new IoT Hub a unique Name and select which Pricing and scale tier you require. In the Resource Group section select Create New and give it a unique name in the box provided. Select the ‘Location’ nearest to you and click Create. It will take some time to deploy your new Resource Group and IoT Hub, but eventually you should get a Deployments succeeded notification. Once your new Resource Group has been created, navigate into it by selecting the Resource groups option in the left-hand panel and selecting the Resource Group you just created from the list. Select the IoT Hub you just created from the list, then click the Keys icon. Select iothubowner from the policy list, then click the Copy button next to the Connection string-primary key to copy your IoT Hub connection string to the clipboard. Create a new Azure* IoT Device Tip: To make copying connection strings easier, it is recommended that you use SSH to connect to your gateway or access the command line through the Intel Developer Hub interface. If you are accessing the command line of your gateway directly using a keyboard and mouse, you will need to manually enter the connection string in the next section. Enter the following in your gateway’s console to add it to your IoT Hub: iothub-explorer "[YOUR CONNECTION STRING]" create IntelIoTGateway --connection-string If the device is successfully added, you will get output similar to this: Load the Node-RED interface. Go to the Administration section of the IoT Gateway Developer Hub and click Launch under the Node-RED icon. Configure a Node-RED flow. Drag an ‘inject’, ‘function’ and ‘azureiothub’ node from the nodes panel on the left into the current flow (you may need to scroll down in the nodes panel).Drag an ‘inject’, ‘function’ and ‘azureiothub’ node from the nodes panel on the left into the current flow (you may need to scroll down in the nodes panel). Arrange and connect the nodes as in the screenshot above. Here we have an inject node which will send a trigger at a specified interval to a function which will randomly generate a number to send to your Azure IoT Hub. First we need to configure the nodes. Double-click on the timestamp node to bring up the configuration dialogue. Change the settings so they match the screenshot below, and click Ok when done. This will set the node to send a trigger every 5 seconds. Double-click on the ‘function’ node to bring up the configuration dialog box. Here we are going to add some simple code to generate a random number which we can send to our Azure IoT Hub. In reality this could be a sensor reading, for example. In the ‘Function’ box enter the following code as in the screenshot below: msg.payload = Math.round(Math.random() * 100); Click the Ok button when done, to close the configuration dialog box. Double-click the Azure IoT Hub node to bring up the configuration dialog box again. Add the device connection string you copied/saved earlier into the Connection String box and click Ok. (Make sure you enter the device connection string and not the one for your IoT Hub!) Now your flow is configured you can deploy your flow. Click the Deploy button in the top right of the screen. If everything is working correctly, the status of the Azure IoT Hub node should change to Connected and eventually Sent message, as in the screenshot below. A message will be sent to your Azure IoT Hub every five seconds while the flow is running. If you navigate back to the Azure* Portal and load your IoT Hub instance, you will see the message count in the Usage tile increasing. Monitor device events (Optional). You can monitor devices in your IoT Hub using the iothub-explorer utility from the command line. There is also a Windows utility called Device Explorer if you prefer a visual application: https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md To monitor device events in the command line on your gateway, run the following command: iothub-explorer "[YOUR IOT HUB CONNECTION STRING]" monitor-events [YOUR DEVICE NAME] If the Node-RED flow is deployed and running you should see the random numbers being sent to Azure* in the console output similar to the screenshot below.

As it does every September prior to holiday season, Apple introduced the latest versions of its top mobile products at a major media briefing. This time it was Sept. 7 at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in downtown San Francisco. Apple introduced its next-generation iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphone models, along with an updated version of the Apple Watch. Apple is touting the water-resistance features of both the new iPhone models and the new Apple Watch Series 2. To make the iPhone water resistant, Apple designed the new model without a headphone jack and instead is introducing new wireless earbuds called AirPods. The iPhone 7 is also equipped with a 12-megapixel, 1.8 aperture camera and a 7-megapixel HD camera, along with a speedy new A10 Fusion processor. For those looking to hack the Facebook accounts of others, there is a marketplace for Facebook Hacker tools that offer the promise of point-and-click ease. According to a new report from the Blue Coat Elastica Cloud Threat Labs (BCECTL), the promise made by many Facebook hacker tools is false. Rather than providing access to the Facebook accounts of others, BCECTL found that most Facebook Hacker tools only exploit the users of the tools. "The samples we have analyzed don't perform any real Facebook hacking as opposed to what is being claimed," Aditya Sood, director of Security and Elastica Cloud Threat Labs at Blue Coat Elastica, now part of Symantec, told eWEEK. Intel is spinning out its cyber-security software business in a partnership with private equity firm TPG, marking the latest move by the chip giant to remake itself in an industry undergoing rapid change. Intel officials said Sept. 7 that it's working with TPG to create a new, independent company based on its Intel Security unit in a deal worth about $4.2 billion, a far cry from the $7.6 billion Intel paid for the McAfee security software company in 2010. TPG will own 51 percent of the business and Intel 49 percent. The private equity firm will put another $1.1 billion into the new company to help accelerate its growth. Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of the Intel Security Group, will become CEO of the new company, which will adopt the McAfee name. Intel officials in 2014 pushed the McAfee brand into the background, renaming the business Intel Security. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is spinning out its enterprise software businesses and merging it with Micro Focus as CEO Meg Whitman continues to pare down the company's product technology portfolio to focus on enterprise infrastructure and services. The deal, announced Sept. 7, comes the same day that one of HPE's biggest rivals, Dell Technologies, completed its $60 billion-plus acquisition of data storage leader EMC, creating a much larger company with a broad reach across the enterprise IT landscape. Where CEO Michael Dell said earlier in the day that scale is important for an IT vendor, Whitman told analysts and journalists during a conference call that with the rapid changes going on in the industry around the cloud, internet of things, data analytics and software-defined infrastructure, HPE needs the focus and agility of a smaller company.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Why your AT&T iPhone 7 won't work well on Verizon's network 0 Share: Phones by Stephen Shankland September 9, 2016 11:29 AM PDT @stshank Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy Enlarge Image Some models of Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus reportedly use an Intel radio communications chip.Photo by James Martin/CNET You won't see an "Intel Inside" sticker on your new iPhone 7 the way you do on Windows laptops, but it appears Apple picked the company to supply an important chip for its newest phone. Some models of the Apple's iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will use an Intel modem, a critical chip that handles the radio communications linking phones to mobile networks, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. It's not as important as the central processor, a business Intel pulled back from earlier this year, but it's a prestigious partnership for Intel. And according to Recode it gives Apple more bargaining leverage over Qualcomm, which previously supplied all modem chips. Such deals may seem like obscure business machinations, but it affects everyone. That's because the Intel modems don't work on an older network technology called CDMA used by Verizon and Sprint. That matters if you're considering switching carriers. "The iPhone for AT&T and T-Mobile does not support CDMA and will not work on Sprint or Verizon Wireless," Apple warns on its website. In the longer run, a healthy partnership could help Intel -- now with an expanding foundry business building others' chips -- bring its advanced technology to your pocket by manufacturing iPhone's primary processors, too. Bloomberg reported Intel's modem deal in June, saying it had replaced chips made by Qualcomm in some phones. Apple and Qualcomm declined to comment for this story. Intel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich was in the audience at the iPhone 7 launch event. Apple likes to control important hardware in its products, and indeed it's done well designing its own central processors like the A10 Fusion in the iPhone 7. But modems are a big pain to develop and support, so it's not surprising they let others handle this component. "Modems are pretty expensive and complicated," said David Kanter, an analyst at Linley Group. In addition, they require complex software and said software stack and tight ties with regulatory agencies around the world for certification, he said. "I have no doubt that Apple could do the software and hardware, but it would require hiring a very large team."

The discussion then moves on to introduce Particle, an IoT company (https://www.particle.io/), followed by a description of Particle's popular IoT products—Core, Photon and Electron. This article will cover following topics: Evolution of IoT Hardware and software in the IoT ecosystem Market survey of IoT development boards and cloud services What is Particle? Summary (For more resources related to this topic, see here.) Evolution of IoT It is not very clear exactly who coined the term IoT. Kevin Ashton (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Ashton) supposedly coined the phrase IoT while working for Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Kevin was then working on an RFID (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification) initiative by P&G, and proposed taking the system online to the Internet. In 2005, UN's International Telecommunications Union (ITU) - http://www.itu.int/, published its first report on IoT. In 2008, the global non-profit organization IPSO Alliance (http://www.ipso-alliance.org/) was launched to serve the various communities seeking to establish IoT by providing coordinated marketing efforts available to the general public. IPSO currently has more than 50 member companies including Google, Cisco, Intel, Texas Instruments, Bosch, Atmel. In 2012, IoT Consortium (IoTC) - http://iofthings.org/, was founded to educate technology firms, retailers, insurance companies, marketers, media companies, and the wider business community about the value of IoT. IoTC has more than 60 member companies in the area of hardware, software, and analytics, a few of them being Logitech, Node, and SigFox. A 2014 Forbes article by Gil Press mentions: "Gartner estimates that IoT product and service suppliers will generate incremental revenue exceeding $300 billion in 2020. IDC forecasts that the worldwide market for IoT solutions will grow from $1.9 trillion in 2013 to $7.1 trillion in 2020". Why IoT has become a household word now IoT has, in recent years, become quite popular and an everyday phenomenon primarily due to IoT-related hardware, software, accessories, sensors, and the Internet connection becoming very affordable and user friendly. An explosion in the availability of free Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) have made programming and deployment of IoT really simple and easy. Thus, IoT enthusiasts range from school kids, hobbyists, and non-programmers to embedded software engineers specialized in this area. Hardware and software in the IoT ecosystem Advancement in technology and affordability has made acquisition and usage of IoT devices very simple. However, in order to decide which IoT package (boards, accessories, sensors, software) to choose for a particular application, and actually building projects, it is essential to have knowledge of IoT terminology, hardware, and software. In this section, we will introduce the reader to the essential terminology used when dealing with IoT. This will also help the reader understand and appreciate the features of the Particle IoT products—Core, Photon, and Electron. Essential terminology Let's learn about a few terms that we're going to be hearing all throughout this article, and whenever we work with IoT hardware and software components: Term Definition IoT Development Board A development board is essentially a programmable circuit board which wraps an IoT device. The IoT device's processor/microcontroller, memory, communications ports, input-output pins, sensors, Wi-Fi module, and so on are exposed by the development board, in a convenient way, to the user. A board manufacturer usually provides an IDE with it to write and deploy code to the physical board. A development board with the IDE enables rapid prototyping of IoT projects. Microcontroller A microcontroller is a highly compact single Integrated Circuit (IC) with a processor and limited Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM) embedded in it with programmable peripherals. Microcontrollers are "computer on a single chip". Because of its limited memory and architecture constraints, usually, only one specific program is deployable and runnable on a microcontroller at one time. Preprogrammed microcontrollers are used in electrical machinery such as washing machines, dish-washers, microwave, and so on. Microprocessor A microprocessor is a single integrated chip which in itself is a Central Processing Unit (CPU). The microprocessor has separate RAM and ROM modules, and digital inputs and outputs. The Microprocessor CPU is usually more powerful than that of a microcontroller, and there is provision to add larger amounts of memory externally. This makes microprocessors suitable for general-purpose programming, and are used in desktop computers, Laptops, and the like. Flash Memory Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile storage device, for example, USB pen-drives, memory cards, and so on. Data in Flash memory can be erased and rewritten. Unlike RAM, access speed is lower for flash memories, and also unlike RAM, the data stored in flash memory is not erased when power is switched off. Flash memories are generally used as reusable extra storage. RTOS RTOS as the name suggests, RTOS responds to events in real time. This means, as soon as an event occurs, a response is guaranteed within an acceptable and calculable amount of time. RTOS can be hard, firm, or soft depending on the amount of flexibility allowed in missing a task deadline. RTOS is essential in embedded systems, where real-time response is necessary. M2M Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication encompasses communication between two or more machines (devices, computers, sensors, and so on) over a network (wireless/wired). Basically, a variant of IoT, where things are machines. Cloud Technology Cloud refers to computing resources available for use over a network (usually, the Internet). An end user can use such a resource on demand without having to install anything more than a lightweight client in the local machine. The major resources relevant to IoT include data storage, data analytics, data streaming, and communication with other devices. mBaaS Mobile Backend as a Service (mBaaS) is a infrastructure that provides cloud storage, data streaming, push notifications, and other related services for mobile application developers (web, native, IoT app development). The services are exposed via web-based APIs. BaaS is usually provided as a pay-per-use service. GPIO General Purpose Input Output (GPIO), these are electrical terminals or 'pins' exposed from ICs and IoT devices/boards that can be used to either send a signal to the device from the outside (input mode), or get a signal out from the inside of the device (output mode). Input or Output mode can be configured by the user at runtime. Module Unit of electronics, sometimes a single IC and at other times a group of components that may include ICs, providing a logical function to the device/board. For example, a Wi-Fi module provides Wi-Fi functionality to a board. Other examples are Bluetooth, Ethernet, USB, and so on, Port An electrical or Radio-Frequency-based interface available on a board through which external components can communicate with the board. For example, HDMI, USB, Ethernet, 3.5mm jack, UART (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter). Table 1: Terminology Network Protocols Connected smart devices need to communicate with each other, and exchange large volumes of messages between themselves and the cloud. To ensure near real-time response, smart bandwidth usage, and energy savings on the resource-constrained IoT devices, new protocols have been added to the traditional seven-layer network model (OSI model: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). The following table shows the major OSI network protocols and the IoT network protocols suitable for various smart, connected devices. Layer Examples of Traditional Network Protocols (OSI) Examples of IoT Network Protocols Application, Presentation, Session HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TLS, RPC, JSON, CSS, GIF, XML CoAP, MQTT, DDS, M2M service layer Transport TCP, UDP UDP, DTLS Network ICMP, IPsec, IPv4, IPv6 6LoWPAN, RPL (Zigbee) Data Link IEEE 802.2, L2TP, LLDP, MAC, PPP IEEE 802.15.4, BLE4.0, RFID, NFC, Cellular Physical DSL, Ethernet physical layer, RS-232, any physical transmission medium (for example, Cables) Wires, Sensor drivers to read from sensor devices Table 2: Layerwise Network Protocols – OSI vs IoT Market survey of IoT development boards and cloud services Here we list some of the most popular IoT boards and cloud services, available in the market at the time of writing this article, with some of their important specifications and features. These tables should help the reader get an idea as to where Particle products fit in on the IoT map. IoT development boards The next table lists the main specifications of popular IoT boards. These specs are the basic details one has to consider while selecting a board—its specifications in terms of processor and speed, memory, available communication modules and ports, and IO Pins. Also, while selecting a board, one has to analyze and match the project's requirements with the available boards, so that the right board is selected for the application in terms of fitment and performance.

Particle (https://www.particle.io), formerly known as Spark, is a company started by Zach Supalla. It provides hardware and software for development of IoT projects. Journey of Particle The first company started by Zach Supalla in 2011 was known as Hex Goods, and it sold designer products online. In early 2012, Hex Goods was shut down, and Zach started a second company called Switch Devices, which dealt with connected lighting. Switch Devices was then renamed Spark Devices. The name Spark was used as it provided a double meaning to the founders. Spark stood for spark of light and also sparks of inspiration. In early 2013, Spark transformed to an IoT platform for engineers and developers. The name Spark also did not last long as the founders felt Spark created confusion for a lot of users. There exist 681 live trademarks that include the word Spark. Apart from the number of trademarks, there are some other great, unrelated software and hardware products employing the name Spark in them—some of them being Apache Spark, SparkFun, and Spark NZ. It has been reported that a lot of people logged on to Zach's #spark IRC channel and asked doubts about big data. The name Particle was finally chosen, as it gave plenty of room to grow in terms of products and offerings. Particle, in scientific terms, is a single discreet unit within a larger system. The name draws a parallel with the mission of Particle—the company which provides development kits and devices as single units used to build the greater whole of IoT. We'll cover Particle IoT products in depth, and see how and when they perform better than other IoT development boards. Why Particle? Today, the most recurring problem with all existing IoT prototyping boards is that of connectivity. In order to connect the existing boards to the Internet, additional components such as Wi-Fi or GSM modules have to be attached in the development environment as well as in production. Attaching external devices for communication is cumbersome, and adds another point of failure with frequent issues such as Internet unavailability, intermittent network connectivity, and so on. This leads to a bad experience for the developer. Developers have to frequently (re)write code, deploy it onto the device(s), test, debug, fix any bugs, rinse, and repeat. The problem with code deployment with existing boards is that the boards need to be connected to a computer, which means for even the smallest code update, the device/board needs to be connected to the developer's computer, either by moving the computer to the device (which may be located at a not-so-easily accessible location) or vice versa. This poses a problem when the device, after an update at the developer's site, has to be placed back in its original production environment for testing and debugging the new changes. This means large turnaround times to load new code into production. Particle provides products that have built-in Wi-Fi modules or GSM modules, which help in easy connection to a network or the internet, with support for OTA (Over-The-Air) code deployment. This removes the hassle of adding extra modules on the prototyping boards for connectivity, and it also allows for pushing code or testing/debugging on site. As previously mentioned, one of the important features which differentiates Particle products from other devices is the Particle device's ability of deployment of code over the air. New code can be deployed onto the device or burnt, as the process is called in embedded systems' parlance, via REST API calls, which makes it very convenient to provide updates. This feature of Particle products helps in faster code release cycle and testing/debugging. What does Particle offer? Particle offers a suite of hardware and software tools to help prototype, scale, and manage the IoT products. It also provides the ability to build cloud-connected IoT prototypes quickly. If you're satisfied with your prototype and want to productize your IoT design, no problem there. It helps us to go from a single prototype to millions of units with a cloud platform that can scale as the number of devices grow. The popular Particle hardware devices are listed as follows: Core: A tiny Wi-Fi development kit for prototyping and scaling your IoT product. Reprogrammable and connected to the cloud, this has now been superseded by the Photon. Photon: A tiny Wi-Fi development kit for prototyping and scaling your IoT product. Reprogrammable and connected to the cloud. Electron: A tiny development kit for creating 2G/3G cellular connected products. The Photon and the Core are bundled with Wi-Fi modules, which help them connect to a network or the Internet without adding any extra modules. The Electron has a 3G/2G GSM module, which can be used to send or receive messages directly or connect to the Internet. The firmware for the Photon, Electron, and Core can be written in a web-based IDE provided by Particle, and the deployment of the firmware code to the device is done over-the-air. Particle also offers SDKs for mobile and web to extend the IoT experience from the devices/sensors to the phone and web. Summary In this article, we learnt about IoT, and how it all began.

X Movidius founders eye future as they cash in chips with sale to Intel Acquisition of Irish chipmaker boosts tech giant’s ambitions in internet of things Fri, Sep 9, 2016, 05:30 Ciara O'Brien Movidius founders Seán Mitchell and David Moloney and chief financial officer John Burke. Photograph: Cyril Byrne         When Irish chipmaker Movidius was bought by Intel earlier this week, it made headlines all around the world. But for founders Seán Mitchell and David Moloney and their staff it was business as usual. “We were back at our desks in the morning working away again,” says Mitchell, the company’s chief operating officer. “We’ve committed to making sure Intel realises the [company’s] value, promise and potential and we have a job to do for many years to ensure that will be the case. There’s no retirement yet, I’m afraid.” Movidius can be considered one of the Irish tech industry’s biggest success stories. Amid a string of high-profile deals for its vision-sensing technology, including with Google and drone maker DJI, the company caught Intel’s attention. But the founders have not been cracking open the champagne yet, as there is more work to do before deal is finalised. “We may wait until it’s actually closed,” Mitchell says. He is hopeful that everything will be signed off long before the end of the year, bringing an element of stability to the company and leaving Movidius to get on with what it does best: developing its technology. Internet of things From Intel’s point of view, this is a boost to its ambitions in the internet-of-things sector, and it seems to be throwing its might behind the Irish firm and its products. Management and staff are all staying on after the acquisition is closed. Intel is believed to have paid more than €350 million for the Irish firm, though neither side will disclose the terms of the deal. “The technology obviously has a certain value but without the team it’s very tough to diffuse that and make the most of it,” says Mitchell. “Ultimately they want to see the fruit of the work having an impact on the world and they see this as great opportunity to accelerate that even faster.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s been a dramatic turnaround for a company that, a few years ago, was facing some tough decisions. Mitchell has previously described the period between the company’s first-generation chip and investing in its second-generation Myriad 2 as “very much a touch-and-go period”. But the company managed to sign up new investors, and went on to develop Myriad 2 and raise a further $100 million in funding. Atlantic Bridge, Bosch and Draper Esprit all came on board as investors. Mitchell says that was a watershed point for the company. “It reinvigorated the composition of the board as well,” he explains. “We brought on board some fairly high-profile independent directors as well.” Those new members included a new chairman, Dan Dobberpuhl, whom Mitchell describes as an industry legend with several successful companies to his name. “We’ve really enjoyed working with the guys over the years. It will be sad in some ways to move on from that,” he says. “I’m also personally delighted when people who believed in us get some reward for having done so. In the end, that’s their business, and they had the foresight to make some bets on the things they believed in. It’s great to see some of it pay off for them.” It also takes Movidius out of the fundraising rat race, a process Mitchell admits can be distracting, despite the company’s previous success at raising cash. “It was clear that staying independent as an option was certainly going to require a lot of money,” he says. “Given the way the markets are developing and becoming very competitive now, I think going this route give us an option to accelerate things and take advantage of the scale and reach that a partner like Intel has.” There are no specifics yet about how Movidius will work under this new partnership with Intel; those details are still being hammered out. But Mitchell says there are plans to continue Movidius’s work and even invest further. Dominance “I think it’s going to get very competitive and like many of these things the company that really dominates it is the one that ends up getting something out of it. Second place is barely able to survive. I think a lot of people are trying to be aggressive in these markets and getting to a place of dominance,” he says. “Intel has fantastic process technology and manufacturing capability, it has tremendous reach and great technology, great teams. Also, I think – not to be dismissed – it’s a company of extremely high integrity. I think you couldn’t look for a better home for the team and partner to help us realise the vision where we think the technology can go.” He is clear about where he thinks the next step is: dominating the market. In Movidius’s vision of the future, the company wants to be the dominant force in the internet of things, where machine intelligence is key, and essentially become the de facto platform for those type of applications. The weight of Intel behind it could give it that extra momentum. “This is not in any way an end point,” he says. “It’s a next step, really, the next chapter in the journey.”       Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Ireland could be facing even bigger recession, Martin warns Work Pre-meetings key to successful meetings on contentious issues International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Business Fold-away €5 bike helmet wins Dyson award Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Airbnb takes on tourism industry with move into excursions 17:10 Three UK hit by data breach but no risk to Irish customers 16:28 Abercrombie & Fitch shares slide as sales miss estimates 15:52 Draghi warns against allowing Central Bank to cap mortgage rates 15:50 Germany says Commission has no right to decide on its fiscal space 15:39 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Review: Vivofit Jr, an activity tracker for kids Fool your children into activity by turning it into a game Prynt prints your smartphone photos – and adds video Tech Tools: It’s augmented reality meets actual reality with the help of Zink technology Smart wifi plug gives you the power to control the power Tech Tools: TP Link device means you can use home appliances from your smartphone Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

(Mark Graves/The Oregonian) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 07, 2016 at 1:32 PM, updated September 07, 2016 at 3:43 PM comments Intel confirmed Wednesday that it will spin out its online security division, currently known as Intel Security, and restore its original name – McAfee. Private equity firm TPG will own 51 percent of the new company and Intel will retain the remainder of the business. Intel will get $3.1 billion in cash in the deal, which values the new McAfee at $4.2 billion. Wednesday's deal is a tacit acknowledgment of an expensive misstep for Intel, which paid $7.7 billion in cash for McAfee six years ago. The deal, which carried an unusually large 60 percent premium on McAfee's share price, was Intel's largest acquisition ever at that time. It represented a major bet for Intel, which gambled it could integrate online security software into its microprocessors. Intel never achieved that pairing and the security group sat in an awkward spot in the chipmaker's portfolio. Former Intel President Renée James shepherded the McAfee deal in 2010 but left the company last year, leaving the security business without a champion inside Intel. Intel vice president Chris Young, who currently runs the security business, will be McAfee's chief executive following the deal. "Those of us in the industry, and those defending their businesses and families, have the unique privilege of standing on the good side of a fight that is too important to lose," Young wrote in a letter announcing the deal. "With that in mind, I'm convinced this move marks the beginning of a new future for our customers, partners, and employees." Intel Security currently operates out of offices at Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, California, and at another site in Plano, Texas. Intel said McAfee hasn't determined where its headquarters will be; Young currently works at the chipmaker's offices in Santa Clara. Eccentric tech entrepreneur John McAfee founded the security company named for him in 1987 and it rapidly grew into one of the leading companies for protecting personal computers against viruses. McAfee's behavior grew increasingly odd after he left the company and he briefly moved to Portland in 2013 after police in Belize named him a "person of interest" in a murder there. McAfee left the online security company in 1994 and no longer has any connection to it, except that it will again bear his name. Earlier this week, he sued Intel over the use of the McAfee brand. TPG said it will invest an additional $1.1 billion to help establish the new McAfee as an independent business. The Financial Times reported in June that Intel was in discussions to sell the security business. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

If you don’t, there are plenty of opportunities to get up to speed and perhaps boost future career opportunities. Foote Partners, which tracks information technology (IT) jobs across all skill levels, projects the global demand for cybersecurity talent will climb to six million by 2019 with an expected shortfall of 1.5 million professionals. “We’re going to need as many people as possible to ‘hit the ground running’ to meet the demand,” notes Foote. “Without a doubt, a cybersecurity skills gap has developed on a global basis,” Foote notes in its recently published IT Skills and Certifications Pay Index. “The fact is, it’s going to take years to narrow this particular skills gap, but we’ll get there if the money and incentives are sufficient to get vendors, employers, and training organizations focused on the solution.” With a lack of widely accepted definitions, descriptions, or requirements for cybersecurity positions, Foote says employers are becoming much more aware that they don’t have the right people in their security departments. “They may have good technical people who can fix firewalls and implement basic perimeter solutions,” Foote says in its study. “But what’s missing are enough of the sort of people who can make the case for cybersecurity being linked to business challenges and business developments. That’s going to be the significant weakness. The linkage between the business and the infosecurity practice is still too weak in practice despite a lot of interest in the subject.” While some political leaders have called for increased support for developing the cybersecurity workforce, 76 percent of respondents to the Intel Security/CSIS survey say their governments are not investing enough in meeting the demand for cybersecurity jobs. And more than half of the survey’s respondents believe the cyber skills shortage is worse than talent deficits in other IT specialties, which emphasize continuing education and training. “Government and the private sector haven’t brought enough urgency to solving the cybersecurity talent shortage” says Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security Group, which published Hacking the Skills Shortage in a partnership with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Microsoft has been very vocal about advancing the development of cybersecurity in the Internet of Things (IoT) and globally-relevant IoT standards. The company recently suggested policy actions that government might take to help promote IoT, including establishing a joint government and industry standing body to pursue guidelines for cybersecurity, and reviewing and recommending research and development funding and investment in cybersecurity. IOT JOB RECRUITMENTS Market projections and the rapid development of IoT products and services have become a major influence in cyber recruitment. “The emphasis on analytics is apparent and turning those analytics to address the security issues is something IoT developers are doing now,” says Janel Garvin, CEO of Evans Data Corp., another market research firm. Gartner predicts that by 2020, more than 25 percent of identified attacks in enterprises will involve IoT, although IoT will account for less than 10 percent of IT security budgets. Another study by AT&T, The CEO’s Guide to Securing the Internet of Things, reports that 90 percent of organizations it surveyed lack full confidence in their IoT security. A survey of IoT “stakeholders” by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identifies “workforce development” as a major issue in cybersecurity. (NIST recently published Networks of ‘Things,’ to define the IoT and to help researchers better understand IoT security challenges.) GETTING WITH THE PROGRAM One bright spot in putting a dent in the shortage of qualified cyber “talent” is the growing number of university-level and company, and even government-sponsored cyber training programs. Security certifications posted the highest gains among all IT certification categories over the last three, six, and 12 months, according to Foote data. Cisco Systems recently announced that it plans to cut 5,500 jobs in a corporate-wide shift to higher-margin software programs, including security. In the weeks before the announcement, Cisco posted 88 “software engineering jobs in security” on its Careers website, and said it would invest US $10 million in a two-year Global Cybersecurity Scholarship program to help close the security skills gap. Cisco will offer training, mentoring, and certification that align with Security Operations Center Analyst industry job requirements. Cisco also recently introduced a Cyber Ops Certification to its portfolio of security certifications and revised its Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE) Security Certification to address new expert-level skills. Stanford University has added a new course in network security to its online Stanford Advanced Computer Security Certificate program and updated its emerging threats and defenses course to reflect the latest knowledge. Brown University has launched a 16-month Executive Master in Cybersecurity program starting in the fall 2016 for “highly driven individuals” with five to 15 years of professional and managerial experience. Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey now features an undergraduate program in cybersecurity in its computer science curriculum. Boston University offers a Master’s in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in security that is certified by the Committee on National Security Systems under the National Security Agency’s INFOSEC Education and Training Program, and is recognized by the NSA and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS, meanwhile, has developed its own Cybersecurity Internship Program to recruit people from the nation’s top undergraduate and graduate programs. DHS interns make approximately $5,800 under the full-time 10 week program, but must be U.S. citizens and be enrolled in a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree program with a major in computer science, electrical engineering, computer engineering, software engineering, or a related discipline. India’s National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) is working with the Data Security Council of India and the security software firm Symantec to launch National Occupational Standards, a program aimed at creating a pool of certified cybersecurity professionals in the country. Singapore Telecommunications Limited has formed the Singel Cyber Security Institute to train new IT professionals in basic cybersecurity skills. Accenture, a global professional services company, has opened a cybersecurity center in Bangalore to offer a broad range of cyber defense services. WHO’S HIRING (AND HOW)? Who’s hiring? At this point, government agencies and companies big and small. According to a list published by the University of Maryland University College, which offers degrees in cybersecurity, the top 10 employers of cybersecurity professionals are (in order) Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Science Applications International Corp., ManTech International, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Booz Allen Hamilton, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, CACI, and Accenture. The most in-demand cyber skills? The University of Maryland identifies firewalls, network security, Linux, Unix, CISA, cryptography, transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), system and network configuration, and scanners as the focus of much of its curriculum. Where do you find this much sought after cybersecurity talent? One strategy is to just buy it. A study by The Economist Intelligence Unit, commissioned by Cognizant, calls it acqui-hiring—where companies buy other companies to acquire the talent and skill sets of their personnel rather than their products and services. This is hardly new to technology-based industries. In August, Cambridge, UK-based ARM Holdings, which acquired Israel-based Sansa Security a year ago, added about 40 engineers to the Sansa security engineering team, and about 90 of Sansa’s engineers have joined ARM. “ARM Israel is growing rapidly and we are currently recruiting talented engineers to join our team, with a number of positions open,” says Yaron Magber, director of engineering and design center manager. Magber says the design center is heavily focused on software development with an emphasis on IoT security, “which generates a lot of interest among local engineers.” Magber says much of the focus is on embedded real-time software development on devices and coding using C and other structured languages for Linux and Android targets, through to Cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) technologies. “The Israeli market is highly competitive and vibrant, with many large multinationals offering compelling benefits, professional challenges, and an international atmosphere,” says Magber. “Our local HR team recruits by approaching candidates directly, and may also receive job applications via channels such as LinkedIn or the ARM website.” Analog Devices, Inc. appears to have made a similar move with the acquisition of the Cyber Security Solutions business of Sypris Electronics LLC, which works mostly with military and other government organizations. The CSS team will remain in Tampa, FL and West Lafayette, IN and form the core of ADI's new Secure Technology Group. ADI says it expects the acquisition to create new opportunities for the company in IoT, industrial, and automotive markets. “It is very competitive,” says Jason Taylor, chief technology officer at Security Innovation, which offers a variety of cyber services, including consulting and training through its offices in Seattle, Wilmington MA, and New Taipei City, Taiwan. “Most of our hires are job-ready, or at least 90 percent of the way there. We also hire interns who may not have any security experience but do have good CS skills and proven ability to learn quickly.” Security Innovation job candidates must submit a resume, complete a questionnaire and a series of tests (that may include a take-home coding question), undergo a background check, a phone screen, and a series of interviews. “We’re looking for deep technical skills, a good understanding of application security and the soft skills necessary to be a good consultant and partner to our customers,” says Taylor. “In the future, we will probably need more knowledge of IoT and embedded technology.” “GOVERNMENT” JOB OPPORTUNITIES While you can find jobs in the field just about anywhere, the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metro areas have some of the highest concentration of cybersecurity jobs in the United States. U.S. government agencies, such as the NSA, DHS, NIST, and the Department of Defense (DoD), and government contractors normally require that cybersecurity job applicants be U.S. citizens and have a security clearance, or can obtain one. U.S. intelligence agencies, along with the DoD (which says it hopes to hire 6,000 cybersecurity specialists in 2016), are competing with commercial contractors for cybersecurity tech talent. So is the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is actively seeking candidates for computer scientists positions located throughout its 56 field offices. All applications must have a Bachelor's degree in computer science or Bachelor's degree with 30 semester hours in a combination of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The DHS is hiring cybersecurity specialists and is especially interested in people with experience in digital forensics, network analysis, system administration, computer network defense, and incident response. (More specific information is available on the US-CERT Career website or USAJOBS.com.) The DHS has created a government-wide framework that establishes a set of standard qualifications for cybersecurity personnel for federal agencies. The program, called the National Cybersecurity Workforce Framework, organizes specialty areas into seven categories that define tasks and skills. The framework provides a national standard to align cybersecurity education, jobs, and professional development. The DHS has also developed a Cybersecurity Workforce Development Toolkit, which provides tips and tools to plan and build an organization’s cybersecurity workforce. The Toolkit includes templates and activity checklists for recruiting and retaining cybersecurity tech talent. The DHS also maintains the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) Cybersecurity Training Catalog, which is the nation’s largest searchable repository of cybersecurity training, with access to more than 2,000 cybersecurity courses. Under the DHS Framework academic institutions and training vendors can qualify to become an approved NICCS Training Provider. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has also taken more of an interest in privacy protection. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler recently told a conference that the commission expects to become more involved in promoting cybersecurity through some form of regulation, particularly as more high-frequency bands are opened up to accommodate 5G networks, and in vehicle-to-vehicle communications. And in August, the European Commission (EC) signed a contract for a public-private partnership with the European Cyber Security Organization (ECSO) ASBL. Representing the private sector, ECSO says it will work directly with the EC to improve Europe's industrial policy on cybersecurity. While staffing plans are still not clear, ECSO will host its first working group meetings beginning in September. MILITARY CYBER PROCUREMENTS Not surprisingly, military interest in cyberspace is picking up, with much of the work being conducted by outside tech talent. In March, the U.S. Marine Corps launched the Marine Corps Cyberspace Warfare Group to “perform both defensive and offensive cyber operations in support of United States Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyberspace Command.” While the group is already active, it has joined with the U. S. Navy Fleet Cyber Command in issuing a solicitation for a contract valued at $26 million to cyber train its military and civilian employees. In July, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin Corp.’s Space Systems unit in Sunnyvale, CA an $8.3 million contract to make cybersecurity upgrades to the Navy’s submarine-launched nuclear missiles. The U.S. Air Force has also awarded a four-year cybersecurity training contract with a maximum value of $6.4 million to root9B, an organization of former government and military cyber operations experts. How much can you make as a cybersecurity professional? Foote Partners’ most recent IT Professional Salary Survey update (July data) says cyber specialists are averaging $99,000 in base salary in 67 U.S. cities. Senior level specialists are averaging $117,523 with a top average salary of $147,655 in San Jose. Certified Cyber Forensic Professionals and CyberSecurity Forensic Analyst certifications are currently among the highest paying IT certifications in the entire Foote Pay Index. Noncertified cybersecurity skills also rose 6.3 percent in market value in the first six months of 2016.

Page 1 of 2. 20 Comments Following the seven-way Linux distribution benchmark comparison published earlier this week, on the same system I set out to test a variety of BSD distributions on the same system and ultimately benchmark their out-of-the-box performance too. Those performance benchmark results will be published later this week while today were a few remarks I wanted to share when trying out TrueOS, DragonFlyBSD, GhostBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, MidnightBSD, and PacBSD (Arch BSD) on this modern Intel Xeon system. All of my testing was done on an Intel Xeon E5-2509 v4 Broadwell-EP system with MSI X99A WORKSTATION motherboard, NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN X, 16GB of DDR4 memory, and an OCZ TRION 150 120GB SATA 3.0 SSD. With the seven Linux distributions tested in recent days they all worked fine on the system: Ubuntu, Clear Linux, Scientific Linux, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Fedora, Antergos, and Sabayon Linux. Below are my various brief remarks when testing the different BSDs on this Intel Xeon system. These are my thoughts with admittedly being a Linux enthusiast while just touching BSD, Solaris, and others only on a semi-frequent basis. I am by no means a diehard "Linux fan boy" and have no fundamental objections to BSD, I simply prefer the operating system that best fits my needs and for benchmarking where I can get my tests done in a reliable, reproducible, and timely manner. I at least prefer my operating systems have a clean and quick install process with sane defaults; working generally ~100 hour weeks, I don't have time in 2016 if an OS cannot easily install and boot properly on a modern PC. I enjoy testing out the various BSDs and have no strong bias to any of them. This is the largest BSD testing comparison I've done in the past 12 years on Phoronix at the same time and on the same hardware. TrueOS 20160831: The new rolling-release FreeBSD distribution previously known as PC-BSD on the desktop... The install was a piece of cake (basically the same PC-BSD installer going back years) and was quick and easy. After that, off to the races with benchmarking after having installed a few packages with pkg. I shared more of my thoughts in this week's article Trying Out The FreeBSD-Powered TrueOS With Its Custom Qt Desktop. My main gripe with TrueOS would be its Lumina 1.0 desktop feeling less than baked. DragonFlyBSD 4.6.0: While its installer may not be as friendly as PC-BSD/TrueOS and it's not as desktop-minded, DragonFlyBSD continues to be one of my favorite BSDs. Installing DragonFlyBSD 4.6 on this particular system was easy and ran into no issues. Nor have I ran into any DragonFlyBSD install/boot issues on most of my recent Intel/AMD systems tested. GhostBSD 10.3: I hadn't tested GhostBSD in a while so this was my first time firing up the official 10.3 release with the MATE desktop environment. The graphical installer was simple to work with and similar to TrueOS I was quickly getting my work done. No real issues here. FreeBSD 11.0-RC2: She works well. FreeBSD 11.0 has shaped up quite nicely even though in my past tests have shown it generally can't outperform the Linux distributions, in part due to its defaults without spending any extra time tuning.

That’s a bit of a head-scratcher, given that with the iPhone 6s, Apple had one model that worked across all U.S. carriers. Even though most consumers don’t change carriers during the life of the phone, why would Apple seemingly take a step backward in terms of flexibility and simplicity? The reason has everything to do with the way the company does business. Apple loves to have more than one supplier of any key component. And while it designs the iPhone’s A10 processor (and that chip’s predecessors), it has long relied on Qualcomm exclusively for the iPhone’s modem chip. Exclusivity gives a supplier more leverage, and Apple likes to bargain from a position of strength. So there has been talk for a while now that, with the iPhone 7, Apple was going to split the modem business between Qualcomm and Intel. But Intel’s latest modem chip doesn’t support the old CDMA standard still used by Sprint and Verizon. By creating a separate version for Sprint and Verizon, Apple is able to use Qualcomm exclusively on that model while using chips from both Intel and Qualcomm for the GSM model used by AT&T and T-Mobile as well as many carriers in other parts of the world. Sources familiar with the situation as well as outsiders agree that the modem diversification effort is the likely reason for the separate phone versions. Apple and Intel declined to comment on the matter, and a Qualcomm representative was not immediately available for comment. While having separate models is a win for both Intel and Apple’s effort to gain more power over its suppliers, it’s a modest loss for customers, who now have to make a technological commitment to a carrier even in a world where many are no longer signing long-term financial contracts. As noted above, though, it’s a flexibility that few consumers take advantage of. The vast majority of people who change carriers do so at the same time they get a new phone. There are often switcher deals that make it more financially attractive to do so, and it’s just the way most people think about their cellphone service. For those who really want maximum flexibility, Apple offers the Apple Upgrade Program through its stores. With that program, you finance your phone over two years, but have the option to upgrade phones and change carriers each year. recode_divider In this Storystream All about the iPhone 7 What the iPhone 7 reveals about Apple’s augmented-reality plans Apple created extra versions of the iPhone 7 in order to make room for an Intel chip Apple’s iPhone upgrade program: How to turn your 6s into a 7 View all 13 stories More From Recode DraftKings and FanDuel used to hate each other.

It’s light, portable, powerful, beautiful, and reasonably affordable. We recommend it not only over every other Windows notebook, but also Apple’s MacBook line and Google’s Chromebooks. Still, if you insist, we have picked out the best MacBook for OS X die-hards, the best Chromebook for those who desire an affordable laptop with a super-light OS, and the best laptop if you’ve $600 or less to spend. We’ve also selected the best 15-inch laptop — though it, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the Dell XPS 15. Best for most people Dell-XPS-13-Gold-lid2More Why should you buy this: It’s portable, fast, attractive, and reasonably priced. Our Score Dell XPS 13 (Skylake) Portable, powerful, and beautiful, nothing offers the same value as Dell's flagship XPS 13. $1,030.00 from Amazon $1,349.99 from Best Buy Who’s it for: Everyone except gamers. How much will it cost: $800 to $1,600 Why we picked the Dell XPS 13 Dell’s XPS 13 blends a metallic exterior with carbon-fiber interior. It’s a look that’s premium, yet inviting. The XPS 13 is the kind of cool new toy that you’ll be itching to show everyone willing to look. The super-thin InfinityEdge bezel is another highlight. Most laptops have a half-inch to an inch of plastic surrounding the display on all sides. The XPS 13 has less than a quarter of an inch. That’s as functional as it is beautiful, as it makes the system smaller and lighter. Does that make the XPS 13 too small? Nope. The touchpad is as large as the competition and the keyboard is a breeze to use. The system even squeezes in a large battery, which means most models can last a full day before needing a charge (the top-shelf Core i7 model is borderline, though it can manage eight hours if you’re easy on it). There is just one oddity you should know about — the web cam. The bezels are so thin there’s no room for it, so it’s below the display, rather than above. That makes for an awkward angle. Most people won’t care, but it will bug you if you video conference while traveling. Core i3, i5, and i7 processors are available along with a selection of solid state hard drives and up to 16GB of RAM. It doesn’t set any performance records, but it’s on par with other laptops in the category. If you want speed, though, it’s available. The Core i7 models doesn’t have the Core i7-6500U found in most expensive ultrabooks, but instead opts for the Core i7-6560U, which boasts quicker integrated graphics and a higher maximum clock speed. But the XPS 13 doesn’t earn the “best laptop” title because of its premium configuration. The laptop starts at just $800, and can be handsomely equipped for $1,000. These entry-level versions don’t have the fastest available hardware, but they retain the same design, features, and battery life as the most expensive. Nothing else offers the same overall value, and many competitors feel hopelessly out of date when placed next to Dell’s flagship. Before buying, be sure to read our XPS 13 review, as well as our XPS 13 buying guide. The best Mac Apple-MacBook-Pro-13-Ret-2015-inuseMore Read More Why should you buy this: You refuse to use Windows. Our Score Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina (2015) Apple’s notebook will appeal to speed demons, videophiles, and anyone who despises the finicky touchpads on Windows. $1,299.99 from Apple Who’s it for: Anyone who refuses to use Windows. How much will it cost: $1,300 to $1,800 Why we picked the MacBook Pro 13-inch with Retina Most people are looking at a Mac for one of two reasons. Either you’re a fan of OS X and refuse to use Windows, or you’re attracted to Apple brand and want to buy one based on the company’s reputation. If you’re in the first group, then nothing we say will sway you. In that case, we recommend you purchase the MacBook Pro — the 13-inch model if you prefer portability, and the 15-inch model if you need power. The Air is ancient, at this point, and frankly should’ve been discontinued last year. The 12-inch MacBook is beautiful, but has some quirks, like a horrid keyboard and a single USB Type-C port for connectivity. If you’re looking at a Mac based on its reputation, we suggest you reconsider. The company has allowed its computers to fall by the wayside. All Mac models equip Intel processors that are one or two generations behind the latest, and the vaunted Retina displays are now equal, at best, to the competition. Mac OS X is a fine operating system that does its job, but we think Windows 10 is even better. Finally, Apple’s laptops are much too expensive for the hardware they offer. Apple does have one big benefit — service. The company tends to cover defective hardware that others might refuse to service, and you can take your Mac to a retail store if you need help. This might sway users who are particularly concerned with potential problems. But a Mac is not bombproof, and most modern laptops can easily last five years. We don’t think fear of an ambiguous future problem that may or may not happen should be what guides your buying decision. The best Chromebook acer-chromebook-15-over-the-shoulder-keyboard-1500x1000More Why should you buy this: You want nice, barebones laptop for less. Our Score Acer Chromebook 15 Looking for a cheap laptop to use as a second PC? You can't go wrong with the Acer. $249.00 from Amazon Who’s it for: Students, people who need only basic functionality, anyone who wants a cheap laptop to use as a second PC. How much will it cost: $200 to $300 Why we picked the Acer Chromebook 15 Chromebooks — laptops that run Google’s Chrome OS — have become a popular budget laptop over the last few years, and we quite like them at Digital Trends. The Acer Chromebook 15 is a great example of their strengths. It has a 1080p display, fast Intel processor, and plenty of memory, all starting at $300 when the product first came out. No Windows notebook priced at $300 comes close. And today you can get it for less even than that. If you’re looking for a budget laptop, Chromebooks are a good choice. But these systems rarely sell for north of $500, with the obvious exception of Google’s Chromebook Pixel, which is too niche for us to recommend. The price brings limitations, of course. You won’t find a Chromebook with a quad-core processor, a fast solid state drive, or an optional discrete GPU. Even if Chromebooks were equipped to compete with the best laptops, the operating system would hold them back. Chrome OS, which is designed around Google’s Chrome Web browser, is wonderfully simple and intuitive, but it can’t run “normal” software. It only runs extensions and Web apps. So while you can access Word Online, for example, you could never install Word. This, of course, means you’re reliant on Wi-Fi access, which isn’t a problem in most situations but becomes a very big problem if the Internet cuts out. Google has upgraded Chrome OS over time to combat this. Now, you can download your Gmail inbox and Google Drive content for offline access. But it’s not enough to make a Chromebook completely reliable. The best budget laptop asus-ux305-desk-1500x1000-3-1500x1000More Why should you buy this: You want an affordable PC that’s also a joy to use. Our Score Asus ZenBook UX305 The Zenbook starts at $600 and has fantastic specs — and far better than what you'll find in other competitors. We're not sure how Asus make... $678.99 from Amazon.com $699.00 from Best Buy Co, Inc. Who’s it for: Everyone except gamers, other power users. How much will it cost: $600 to $800 Why we picked the Asus Zenbook UX305CA The Dell XPS 13 starts at $800. We don’t think that’s a lot for a laptop, but the world obviously disagrees; the average selling price of new laptops has hovered around $600 for years. One option is to watch out for a sale. You shouldn’t have to wait long. Refurbished models have sold for as little as $470, and new systems sometimes dip near the $600 mark. Keep an eye out for coupons on Dell’s site and for sales at major retailers including not just the usual suspects but also the Microsoft Store, which carries a selection of the best Windows laptops. If that doesn’t work, then we suggest the Asus Zenbook UX305CA, another ultrabook we’ve awarded an Editor’s Choice. The Zenbook isn’t as powerful as the Dell XPS 13, and doesn’t emulate the Dell’s strikingly thin bezels. But it’s otherwise an incredible machine. And its value can’t be beat. The base model, which is routinely priced at $600 on the Microsoft Store, has a Core m3 processor, eight gigabytes of RAM, and a 256GB solid state drive. That’s twice the memory and storage of the $800 Dell XPS 13 — and far better than what you’ll find in other competitors. We’re not sure how Asus makes money off it. If you don’t mind spending $50 more, you might consider the Asus Zenbook UX305UA. Only one letter separates its name from the UX305CA, and they’re as similar as that suggests. The UX305UA is slightly larger, slightly heavier, and has a quicker Core i5 processor. These changes make it a better choice for power users. The best large display Dell-XPS-15-2015-featMore Why should you buy this: You want a sleek PC, but also need excellent performance. Our Score Dell XPS 15 Beyond great specs, the Dell XPS 15 can be provisioned with Nvidia mobile graphics and a stellar 4K display. $1,699.99 from Dell Who’s it for: Power users, and those who want a big, beautiful display How much will this cost: $1,000 to $1,650 Why we picked the Dell XPS 15 Okay, the XPS 13 is great. But maybe you want a larger display. You’re not alone. Sales figures have continually shown 15-inch systems beating their smaller rivals. We think this is partially because good, small laptops aren’t cheap — but some people just want a bigger display. There’s nothing wrong with that. Fortunately, Dell also has the XPS 15. It’s great for all the same reasons the XPS 13 is great and, because it’s larger, can be optioned with the fastest hardware available today including a quad-core processor, Nvidia mobile graphics, and a 4K display. We don’t like it quite as much its little brother because it’s quite expensive, and the battery doesn’t hold up as well relative to the competition. But it’s definitely the best 15-incher available right now. The XPS 15 starts at $1,000, though, which is a steep sum. Is there anything more affordable? There is, but nothing stands out as the clear winner. Acer’s Aspire E15 is affordable and powerful, but not attractive. Asus’ X555UB-NH51 looks and feels more luxurious, but is priced higher without a performance bump. Dell’s Inspiron 7000 is a powerful do-it-all entry that can even serve as a budget gaming laptop, but its display is disappointing. Acer’s Chromebook 15 can’t be beat in value, but you have to alright living with Chrome OS. Yes, that’s a lot of options. Picking a budget 15-inch is a tough choice, but if you’re tired of looking and just want a name, go with the Acer Aspire E15 (make sure you buy one with a 1080p display). It’s ugly, but it’ll do the job well enough at an extremely low price. Should you buy now, or wait? Intel has recently announced its new 7th-generation processors. If possible, it’s a good idea to wait until you see an update to the 7th-gen hardware before buying the particular model you have your eye on. But it’s not critical. The new generation isn’t that much quicker than the previous version, and the battery life gain in 7th-gen is minimal. If you can buy a 6th-generation model at a slight discount, or you have reason to believe the 7th-gen update won’t come soon, go ahead and make a purchase. AMD also has new hardware available. While we don’t generally recommend AMD over Intel in laptops, the company’s APUs can make sense in some affordable systems. Keep and eye out for the new chips, which are detailed in this post. Also, this is the holiday buying season. That means a plethora of discounts. A keen eye and quick trigger finger could snag you hundreds of dollars in savings. How we test You’ve read our laptop reviews. You’ve read our conclusions. And now you’re wondering how we came to them. Good question. Reviews often lack context, which is evident in the wildly different scores some laptops receive from different publications. Conflicting opinions can actually make buying a laptop more difficult if the review’s criteria isn’t made clear. Allow us to lift the veil. Here we’ll explain the benchmarks we use for objective testing and the perspective from which we approach subjective topics. We don’t expect everyone to agree with our opinions, but we hope that sharing our process will leave you better equipped to decide what laptop best fits your needs.

A broad swath of retailers, from department stores to fast-food chains, also notched losses, while most of the big gainers were oil production and drilling companies. They got a boost from a report indicating fuel stockpiles fell precipitously last week. The price of U.S. crude also jumped on the report, and closed nearly 5 percent higher. U.S. bond yields also surged, as traders reacted to the European Central Bank’s decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged and hold off on extending a stimulus program. Still, in the absence of any major new economic data, the stock indexes continued a recent pattern of mostly sluggish trading. “It’s been many, many days since we’ve had a substantive move either to the upside or the downside in the market,” said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. “It still feels like a holiday week.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 46.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,479.91. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 4.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.30. The sell-off in technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 24.44 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,259.48. The tech-heavy index set all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. Apple slid 2.6 percent a day after the consumer electronics giant introduced its newest slate of products, including a new iPhone that doesn’t come with an analog headphone jack. The stock shed $2.84 to $105.52. Investors also got a dash of tech sector deal news. Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to spin off part of its business software unit to Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion. The pact calls for HP Enterprise to remain majority owner of the new company. Shares in HP Enterprise slid 71 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $21.38. Separately, Intel said it will spin its cybersecurity business into a new company called McAfee for $3.1 billion in cash. Private equity firm TPG will invest $1.1 billion in the new company and own a majority stake. Intel slipped 2 cents to $36.44. All told, technology stocks were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, shedding 0.9 percent. The sector is up 9.1 percent this year. “The tech sector has been strong and outside of today continues to be strong,” said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. Investors hammered retailers Tractor Supply and Pier 1 Imports. Tractor Supply slumped 16.9 percent after the farming and hardware goods retailer said its business is being hurt by poor economic conditions in rural, energy-producing areas where it does most of its business, and other factors. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $14.15 to $69.38. Pier 1 Imports tumbled 15 percent after the home decor retailer gave weak quarterly guidance and said its president and CEO will leave the company at the end of the year. The stock slid 72 cents to $4.08. Several oil drilling and production companies rose on the latest oil stockpiles figures, pushing the S&P 500’s energy sector 1.7 percent higher. The sector is up 17.4 percent this year. Chesapeake Energy rose 93 cents, or 13.7 percent, to $7.74, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 index. Diamond Offshore Drilling gained $1.43, or 9 percent, to $17.40. Murphy Oil climbed $1.90, or 6.8 percent, to $29.75. Traders also bid up crude oil prices. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $2.12, or 4.7 percent, to close at $47.62 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained $2.01, or 4.2 percent, to $49.99 in London. The news out of the European Central Bank helped ease demand for U.S. bonds, driving their prices lower and pushing yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.60 percent from 1.54 percent late Wednesday. “They’re not adding more stimulus, and that maybe makes people feel less like they need to pile into U.S. bonds,” said Delwiche. At a news conference, ECB President Mario Draghi seemed relatively confident about the economy and less inclined to hint at more stimulus than some analysts had expected. He urged governments to do their part. Despite Draghi’s more confident tone, the ECB will have to take more stimulus action at its October or December meetings, analysts said. News of the ECB’s decisions weighed on most of Europe’s major stock indexes. Germany’s DAX fell 0.7 percent, while France’s CAC-40 declined 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares rose 0.2 percent.

More like this Upgrading to Windows 10 and questioning <i>The New York Times</i> A bug fix bake-off Your step-by-step guide to repairing Windows 10 Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles The 2006 HP Compaq Dc7700 with venerable Core 2 Duo processor looking up at me from the far end of the work bench was going to be my next Linux OS load victim. Problem is, it’s easier to take an existing 32-bit load of Windows 10 and upgrade to the 64-bit version. I do want to get back to Linux. Lubuntu is going to be one distro I will consider trying on older PCs. But there are a couple of problems with any Linux distro on vintage machines: USB Wi-Fi adapter support is not nearly as great as for Windows 10 boxes, and; Available graphics resolutions are typically a crapshoot (with minimal choices); I need more than 1024 x 768 out of the box, even on aged desktops. The performance of Windows 10 on older PCs continues to impress. If an Intel box is running Windows 7, it’ll, generally speaking, run Windows 10, although I advise boosting ram if at all possible. You pretty much can’t go wrong with the Microsoft upgrade process. Redmond will inform you if the PC doesn’t make the cut upon attempting installation. The 32-bit version of the Windows 10 OS residing on the HP Dc7700 was an update from Windows 8.1, and prior to that, Windows 7. Updates work OK, but there’s nothing like nuking and paving for a fresh start that restores the PC to optimal performance. Erasing the hard drive is the only path from Windows 10 32-bit to 64. In this instance, it was a no-brainer to back up anything important and begin the reformat and OS install. I did take the base install of 2GB of memory and increase it to 4GB before starting. The machine can take 8GB, but 4GB is adequate for this project. Like a load of some form of Linux on this box, I anticipated Windows 10 64-bit graphics being equally limited with respect to the base display resolutions the built-in Intel graphics could provide running this OS. Sure enough, the display resolution that greeted me at first boot after install was the inadequate 1024 x 768 variety -- and that was the most advanced option available. No problem, I thought, maybe I could find some updated graphics drivers at HP’s site. I give HP a lot of credit for maintaining an active repository of drivers and things like BIOS updates for machines of this vintage. But I’m a realist. I didn’t know how far beyond Windows XP support the repository would go. I fully expected it to tap out not much beyond XP. And I was correct. Windows 7 Professional 32-bit is the end of the road in terms of HP's Windows operating system support for this PC. But I needed 64-bit Windows 10 Support. What’s an old geek to do? Lower his expectations. Clicking the drop down menu for OS support and scrolling down further revealed drivers for Windows Vista Business 64-bit. Voila! Or so I thought. After downloading and installing Intel Graphics Driver for Microsoft Windows Vista (64-bit Editions) (International), and attempting to install I was greeted with: “This version is incompatible with this operating system.” I tried running as Administrator and the installer went a bit further before booting me out with the same message. I thought “some” of the install may have been completed, however, so I rebooted. I went to the desktop, right clicked and checked available resolutions. I had over a dozen new choices available for selection. The HP desktop with a fresh load of Windows 10 Pro 64-bit was working great. The 3rd party after-market USB Wi-Fi adapter that Linux never recognized worked out of the box on this machine. The graphics were fine, now, too. Microsoft’s Windows 10 has succeeded in a big way. Its adoption rate is way up. Part of the reason is it doesn’t hurt that Windows 10 supports very old machines with minimal tweaking. Some form of 64-bit Linux may yet find its way back to this vintage PC. With Windows 10 Pro 64-bit running capably, though, the Tech Oracle doesn’t envision that happening any time soon.

Similar to Microsoft dedicated Halo, ReCore is playable via cross-platform Windows 10 and Xbox Play Anywhere. (Photo: Ian Gavan/Getty Images for Halo by Xbox 360) Microsoft-exclusive video game "ReCore" is hitting the road this Sept 13, plying along the Xbox One and Windows 10 PC roads. From the looks of the game, older PCs will never hit the minimum system requirement of this eye-candy. Starting with just the minimum requirement, ReCore can be played on PCs with at least core i5-4460 Intel processors. This means that AMD FX-6300 with 2.7GHz can accommodate the game too. Either AMD Radeon R7 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 can qualify on the low limits of video cards. Considering that most older PCs are running with 4GB of RAM, there is a need to double this to 8GB for ReCore though. Now for the recommended system requirement, a 3.9GHz Intel Core i5 is highly-desirable. Only the video card comes steep for since 4GB is preferred. ReCore will land with AMD Radeon R9 in this category while Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 is another excellent choice. RAM will exponentially scale up under the recommended line because Microsoft pins at 16GB, according to PC Gamer. Ironically, PC gamers looking at these specs and respective prices will toy with the idea of purchasing an Xbox One instead. It is now a cramming call to decide whether to go with Windows 10 for flexibility or a dedicated Xbox One. Additional depth about ReCore's system requirements is provided on the Official Website store of Windows. At any rate, the consolidating factor about ReCore is being a cross-platform game. Achievements and game saves can be retrieved with Xbox One and Windows 10 PC vice-versa. Also, there is a good compromise about game controllers. Xbox One controller is suggested but cheaper option is to use keyboard and mouse that are Windows-compatible. To reiterate, ReCore will invade the shelves this Tuesday, Sept 13 for Xbox One and Windows 10 platforms. Buy preorder for either PC or console at $39.99 and you get both platforms for no add-on charge. This is possible because ReCore is part of Xbox Play Anywhere titles.

Soft Machines' claim to fame is its VISC processor architecture – that's Variable Instruction Set Computing. VISC processors contain a bunch of physical cores that are presented to software as virtual cores. Two or more physical cores can be joined together to act as a single virtual CPU. Those virtual cores execute x86 and 32-bit and 64-bit ARMv8 code via a translation layer that converts the instructions into RISC-like VISC instructions. A load-balancing frontend assigns physical cores to virtual CPUs executing virtual hardware threads. This assignment is dynamic and changes depending on the application running; if a particularly wide core is needed, then so be it. This is supposed to bring performance benefits. Virtual insanity ... Soft Machine's VISC design Soft Machines taped out a 500MHz 28nm prototype in 2014, and late last year had a 16nm test chip fabricated. The biz was planning to show off a 2GHz 2W 16nm FinFET system-on-chip codenamed Mojave, featuring its Shasta core design, this year. Mojave was going to have two physical cores that map to one or two virtual cores. Future SoCs were promised with more physical CPUs. Below is a video of CTO and president Mohammad Abdallah describing the technology at a Linley Processor Conference two years ago: Youtube video Over the past 12 months or so, Intel has been negotiating purchasing Soft Machines for roughly $250m, a source close to the talks told The Register. We're told a deal has been done, and it's not particularly good news for investors who have so far poured at least $200m in funding into the biz since it was founded in 2006. It was hoped Soft Machines would become a Silicon Valley unicorn – a billion-dollar startup, in other words – but its VISC designs have not performed as well as was promised, thus denting the organization's value, it is claimed. Besides Intel, other suitors included Chinese businesses hoping to form a joint venture with Soft Machines, we're told. Chipzilla is on a mild acquisition spree at the moment, gobbling up Movidius and Nervana over the summer. A spokeswoman for Intel declined to comment. No one was willing to talk at Soft Machines, either. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 11 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Join For Free Access the survey results 'State of Industrial Internet Application Development' to learn about latest challenges, trends and opportunities with Industrial IoT, brought to you in partnership with GE Digital. Not too long ago I wrote about using Couchbase to synchronize data on an Intel IoT Gateway device. In this project, I was creating a Java application that was installed to an IoT device that had Bluetooth and wireless Internet available. This application would scan for iBeacons and sync the data with a remote server and between devices. Since having designed that prototype, I decided to take it to the next level and create a summer project from it. Above is the visual end result of the summer project that I've been working on. Let me break down the scope of what this project accomplishes. While the Intel IoT Gateway is cool, it isn't as popular as say, the Raspberry Pi. I went and purchased two Raspberry Pi 3 devices that have embedded wireless and Bluetooth. The goal here was to plant these Raspberry Pi units at various locations around the office. I also purchased five Gimbal iBeacons to distribute to a few people around the office. It was my intention to record the movement of these staff members as they navigate the office throughout the day. This is demonstrated through the dashboard in the above picture. The Java application that made use of Couchbase was near identical to that which was used in the previous blog post with a few exceptions.  Instead of using a single document to track the activity of every one beacon, a new document was created for every activity. With this, I removed the need to pull data from Couchbase Server, only save and push. The other difference is that a custom Couchbase Lite SDK had to be used that supported the ARM architecture of a Raspberry Pi. While the Raspberry Pi was using a Java application to communicate with Couchbase Lite, the dashboard for viewing activity actually used Node.js and AngularJS.  With N1QL queries, the data was aggregated and used in the charting in the UI. The full source code to this project can be found on GitHub.  It includes the dashboard as well as the code for Raspberry Pi.

NUMA-aware scheduler for Go NUMA-aware scheduler for Go Dmitry Vyukov, dvyukov@ Sep 2014 Abstract With the advent of Intel QPI and AMD HT technologies even commodity SMP servers become NUMA. As core counts continue to grow, this trend will continue as well. When per-package computational power will reach a threshold, even a single package will require multiple memory lanes effectively becoming NUMA (see e.g. Tile-Gx72 processors). Temporal and spatial locality of computations with respect to data becomes exceedingly important in such world. Go misses the bus. The goal of this document is to propose a general infrastructure that allows to do NUMA/cache-aware scheduling and computation/data migration; describe a set of signals that the scheduler can use and a set of simple policies that look like a clear win. Once we implement it and gather more information, the signals and policies most likely will need to be refined and tuned. Reference Target Machine Let's consider a typical machine with 4 Processors and 4 Memory packages: Latency between P0 <-> MEM0 is minimal; latency between P0 <-> MEM1 and P0 <-> MEM2 is larger; latency between P0 <-> MEM3 is even larger. This Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA) dictates need for spatial locality. And each processor is: Caches store recently accesses data and are much faster than memory. Caches dictate need for temporal locality. Note than caches alleviate NUMA effect, as remote data in local cache is fast. Current Architecture The main concepts in Go runtime are: M - OS thread (Machine). P - Logical CPU (Processor), there are exactly GOMAXPROCS P's. G - Goroutine. Netpoll - network poller (epoll descriptor). RunQ - scheduler queue with runnable G's. MHeap - global memory allocator state (contains central caches and free spans). MCache - per-P memory allocator cache. GC - garbage collector. Current system architecture can be depicted as follows: Runtime does not try hard to ensure any locality, resources like P's and M's are pooled. Runtime is not aware of system topology. MCache is tied to P, and this provides some locality. But then P is not tied to M, so this locality is easily destroyable. New G's are generally submitted to the local RunQ, but once again P is not tied to M. When an M returns from a syscall quickly, it tries to re-acquire the same P it used before the syscall. Proposed Architecture In short: global resources (MHeap, global RunQ and pool of M's) are partitioned between NUMA nodes; netpoll and timers become distributed per-P. In order to get the most benefit we need to ensure affinity throughout the stack: core <-> M <-> P <-> G and Memory. If one of the levels does not work, benefits significantly diminish. Let's consider different subsystems in detail. Memory allocator Heap is partitioned between NUMA nodes. When a P needs another span, it allocates it [preferably] from the node's MHeap. This ensures that we always allocate local memory. MCache is attached to P as now. But this time we have P <-> M affinity, so MCache affinity propagates all way down to processor cache. GC bitmap also needs to be partitioned. Once we grab a new 64K block from OS, we map 4K of bitmap on the current NUMA node as well. This ensures that malloc always work with bitmap in local memory. GC GC allocates worker threads on all NUMA nodes. A GC thread scans stacks of goroutines with stacks allocated on the current node. This ensures that accesses to the stack are local. Also there are chances that such goroutines run on this node and thus allocated heap objects on this node as well. Consequently, transitive heap references are local with high probability. GC has per-node queues with to-be-scanned (gray) objects. When a thread is out of local work, it first tries to steal/request work on local node. This ensures that even after dynamic load-balancing some notion of locality is preserved. Sweeping. We have 2 types of sweeping: background (done by a dedicated sweeper goroutine) and on-demand (done by user goroutines). On-demand sweep sweeps spans that the goroutine is about to use; thus locality is automatically ensured by the memory allocator (a goroutine uses local spans). Background sweeping functionality is moved into scheduler (as we don't have means to bind goroutines to NUMA nodes). Once in a while scheduler decides to sweep one of the remaining local spans. There are yet no plans for locality-driven object migration. First, we don't have capability to move objects; second, it's easy to do more harm than good by wasting CPU cycles on data migration. Stacks We have 2 caches for stack segments: per-P and global. Per-P cache is OK as is. The global cache is partitioned per NUMA node. Stack allocation always goes to local per-P cache, then to per-node cache, then to per-node MHeap. If we free a remote stack segment it is freed directly into remote node cache. This is required to ensure that goroutines always start with local stacks. As opposed to heap objects, we are able to move stacks in memory. Also required heuristics seems to be simpler for stacks. For example, if a goroutine is long running (has passed through scheduler enough times) and was scheduled on a remote node (as compared to stack segment node) last N times, we can decide to migrate stack segment to that node. The right time for migration seems to be right before goroutine execution. More data and experiments needed to work out exact policy. Scheduling M's (threads) are hard bound to NUMA nodes, and each node has own pool of idle M's. For M <-> core affinity we rely on OS. Alternative: It is possible to bound M's to exact cores instead of nodes. It would allow us to do smarter scheduling (e.g. steal work from the HT sibling first). But at the same time it is subject to the following negative effect: 2 processes can decide to do work on threads bound to the same core, both will work 2 times slower w/o realizing it. Binding M's to nodes gives OS more flexibility in inter-process contention resolution. Binding of M's to cores would require API similar to SetThreadIdealProcessor (ideally - soft affinity to a core, hard affinity a node), but unfortunately it's unavailable on unixes. P's (logical processors) are strictly partitioned between NUMA nodes. That is, if we want to start a P bound to NODE0, we need to get an M from NODE0 M pool. Each P has own local RunQ as now. Global RunQ and pool of idle G descriptors become partitioned between NUMA nodes. To ensure P <-> M affinity, lastm field is added to P. When runtime wants to start a P it first tries to get p->lastm M to run it. What's left is scheduling policy. Current scheduling policy is very simple: new and unblocked goroutines go to local RunQ; network poller injects work into global queue; work stealing is completely random; GC reshuffles goroutines to balance work. Most likely we stay with "new and unblocked goroutines go to local RunQ" as it's the cheapest strategy. But the rest needs to be changed. First, GC does not reshuffle goroutines, it just leaves them where they are. Then, work stealing prefers stealing from the same node: per-node RunQ -> per-P RunQ's on the same node -> per-node RunQ's of remote nodes -> per-P RunQ's of remote nodes. We don't bind threads to exact cores, so we don't take into account HyperThread siblings and shared caches. Then, scheduling order changes from strict FIFO to mostly LIFO. LIFO is generally much better in cache utilization. But we still need a bare minimum of fairness (ensure that every runnable goroutine is eventually scheduled). To provide fairness each P pops from the other end of local RunQ once in a while. Global RunQ's stay FIFO as locality is not important for them. Then, netpoller and timers are used to migrate stolen goroutines back to "home" P. Consider that a goroutine has registered in netpoller of Pi and then was stolen by Pj. When Pi runs out of work, it first checks local netpoll/timers. If the goroutine becomes runnable, it returns to Pi. If we decide to use a different policy -- prefer to run a goroutine on P where it last run -- we can re-register the goroutine in the necessary netpoller. But still netpoller is used as means to bring a goroutine to the desired P. The latter strategy can actually be preferable as Linux kernel tries to service the network interrupt on the core where the last EAGAIN read on the socket was executed. So most likely the received data is in the cache of the core that last run the goroutine. If we only try to ensure locality, we will end up with situation when all goroutines consider the starting P0 as their home (as all goroutines are rooted in the main goroutine). So besides ensuring locality we also need some mechanism to evenly distribute "root" goroutines (e.g. a new goroutine servicing a new connection) across P's. Assigning each new goroutine to P's round robin is too expensive. There is at least one very good signal: goroutines created by a goroutine that executes syscall.Accept should be considered "root" and distributed round-robin. I don't have any other good signals right now. But we can look at communication patterns or accesses to the same fd by different goroutines and similar things. For example, if a goroutine creates a bunch of new goroutines in quick succession, they may need to be distributed across P's and nodes. Distribution of work may require splitting local RunQ's into two queues: the first is "I would like to do this work myself", which is lock-free single-producer and LIFO; and the second one is "I am ready to share this work with others", which is mutex-protected multi-producer and not necessary LIFO. This separation also gives us some notion of priorities, as the first queue is polled first. Regarding priorities. Network writes should have higher priority than network reads, as it helps to reduce latency and reduces memory consumption (finish old work before accepting new). Similarly, network accepts should have even lower priority than reads (deal with old connections before accepting new ones). Local per-P RunQ's can be used to express these priorities. Namely, goroutines unblocked on network writes are queued at the front of the first RunQ; network reads -- at the end of the first RunQ; network accepts -- queued into the second RunQ. This soft priority scheduling can be used in other contexts as well; e.g. a goroutine unblocked on chan recv can be given a higher priority than a goroutine unblocked on chan send (the idea is that the goroutine unblocked on chan recv will consume the data that the current goroutine has just produced). But such policies require more investigation. Non-NUMA Systems On non-NUMA systems this design mostly reduces to the current design (per-node data effectively becomes global). However, there are several differences: We will [hopefully] get some additional locality with respect to caches (as we try to keep goroutines on the same cores and do LIFO scheduling). We will get partitioned per-code network poller and timers. This should reduce contention on epoll descriptors and timers and improve locality as well. Risks Even this relatively modest affinity scheme has potential to degrade an application performance. Several processes can decide to schedule threads on the same NUMA node. If each process has only one runnable goroutine, the NUMA node will be over-subscribed, while other nodes will be idle. To partially alleviate the problem, we can randomize node numbering within each process. Then the starting NODE0 refers to different physical nodes across [Go] processes. Consider that a program allocates a very large data structure on a single node, and then the data structure is heavily accesses by all goroutines. The memory bus of the node will become a bottleneck, while memory buses of other nodes will be idle. It's known that the so-called "stripped" allocation works better in this case.

Photo: AFP Recent Vietnamese graduate looking for an English language teacher? There is an app for that. Or hunting the best bowl of pho in your Hanoi neighbourhood? There is now an app for that, too. A decade ago such technology would likely have been developed in California’s Silicon Valley, but today those apps are being churned out by Vietnam’s start-up sector — an industry driven by local techies trained overseas, but returning home to prowl for opportunities. The sector’s growth in a young tech-hungry nation has caught the eye of foreign firms — French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday led a group of businesspeople to meet tech investors in Ho Chi Minh City, the communist country’s start-up hub. Much of the technology, which also includes popular mobile games and e-commerce software, is being produced for local consumers in Vietnam, where the median age is 30 and Internet connectivity is rapidly expanding. “The local market is large, young, fast growing, and not fully tapped,” said Eddie Thai of 500 Startups, a venture with a US$10 million pot — mostly of foreign cash — to splurge on tech enterprises for Vietnamese users or made by local developers. US-born Thai, 31, whose parents fled during the Vietnam War, belongs to a vanguard of entrepreneurs who have arrived to offer expertise in the country, where Intel and Samsung already have a foothold in the hardware industry. “I kept getting tugged by Vietnam. I saw that the opportunity to make an impact and make money doing it were bigger the sooner I came back,” he said. For Thai, the mathematics made the move a no-brainer: 90 million people, 45 million Internet users, 30 million smartphone users and Internet usage 10 times what it was a decade ago. He arrived in 2012 to work for a corporate firm, and eventually joined 500 Startups, which has funded ventures, including the language-learning app Elsa and online ticketing platform Ticketbox. Other apps developed in Vietnam include Lozi for food lovers and mobile bespoke tailor UKYS. However, much of the talent is also homegrown: Vietnamese teens rank ahead of peers in the US, Britain and Sweden in mathematics and science, according to the latest survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2012. That educated labor force, which comes cheap compared with China or Singapore, is helping to pique interest from tech heavyweights like Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, who took time away from his holiday in December to speak to tech entrepreneurs in Hanoi. Comprehensive official figures are not available. However, state media reported that turnover in the software and information-technology (IT) services industry was US$3 billion last year, up from US$2 billion in 2010, citing the Vietnam software and IT services association. The government has also outlined its own strategy for the sector and founded Vietnam Silicon Valley in 2013 to create an “ecosystem of innovations and technology commercialization.” However, some observers say investors should be wary of the hype, warning of red tape and murky local laws. “Vietnam has hidden tech potential, but it could take another five years maybe really to create these huge massive companies that have global influence,” said Anh-Minh Do of Singapore-based Vertex Venture Holdings. “The law needs to be better, the government needs to be more supportive, there needs to be more interaction from Vietnamese-Americans, specifically Vietnamese-Californians because of the ‘Valley’ connection.” 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 2200 times.

You get the choice of the dual-core M3, M5, or M7. It breaks down like this - the Core M3 is a 1.1GHz chip that Turbo Boosts to 2.7GHz. The M5 is 1.2GHz with Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz. Finally, the Core M7, which is a built to order option, is 1.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz. Each model rocks the Intel HD Graphics 515 chipset, which is 25% faster than last years graphics chip. What’s interesting is that these models seem to be in Turbo Boost mode at almost all times. In fact, the M7 model is just about 4% slower than the previous-generation MacBook Pro in terms of processor speed, and that’s quite the surprise. FASTER FLASH STORAGE, RAM, AND GRAPHICS The second big change to the 2016 lineup is the inclusion of faster flash storage. This is the chips used to store your data on the MacBook. The new chips can do sequential reads of up to 1 GBps, which is 20% faster than the previous model. While a 20% read speed gain in great, even more impressive is that write speeds are 90% faster on the 2016 MacBook when compared to its predecessor. That’s a big deal, and means that when you are using the MacBook to get things done, you won’t feel the squeeze. The 2016 MacBook is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. The faster flash storage is paired with faster RAM as well - you get 8GB or 1867MHz DDR3 RAM, which is an increase from last years 1600MHz RAM. On top of that, there’s also the new Intel HD Graphics 515 chip, which Apple says increases graphics performance by 25%/ My main complaint with the 2015 MacBook is that it always felt like it was one step behind me, always trying to catch up to what I was doing, whether it was launching apps, or even the simple act of typing. With the new model, that issue has all but disappeared. ROSE GOLD Apple introduced the Rose Gold hue on the Apple Watch Edition - that was real Rose Gold. Then it brought Rose Gold colored aluminum to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus smartphone line. Shortly after, it brought Rose Gold to the Apple Watch Sport. A couple of weeks ago, the 9.7-inch iPad brought Rose Gold to Apple’s tablet line, and now with the 2016 MacBook, Apple brings the hue to its computers. From the outside, the 2016 MacBook looks exactly the same as the 2015 version, with the Rose Gold color being the only external choice that sets it apart visually. In some light the color looks more pink, in others it looks damn near close to the standard gold. It can even take on a copper color. Of course, if Rose Gold isn’t your thing, you can also pick up the MacBook in Silver, Gold, and Space Gray as well. CONCLUSION So, should you buy it? Ultimately, the 2016 MacBook feels like a much more capable computer than its predecessor. There’s always the waiting game you can play, which in this case would be waiting to see what Apple has up its sleeve for WWDC before pulling the trigger, just in case there’s a thinner, more powerful MacBook Pro around the corner. However, with the faster internal specs, the MacBook is capable of accomplishing those everyday tasks that you’ll want to throw at it, and this year it does it without complaining back at you by way of a multi-colored beachball.

Other than the iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 Plus, the Apple Watch Series 2, and a Super Mario game, there was nothing about the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro or the rumored iPad Pro 10.5-inch or the wireless charging special feature from the Cupertino-based tech giant. Latest reports now have it that the non-appearance of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro on September 7 only proves that Apple will be having another launching event next month to finally unveil the latest device in its laptop line and also the next iteration of its iPad Pro, reports the MacWorld of UK. However, these remain as speculations pending the confirmation from Apple, which seems unlikely to do it anytime soon. It would be the third time that the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro did not show up in an Apple event this year starting in March during the company’s “Let Us Loop You In” event, and then again in June during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2016. The reports are also saying that the launch of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro in October shall either be a single event or even a quiet update, the same way that the company did with the latest MacBook in April this year. Rumors gaining steam Rumors are now gaining steam that the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall come with a Retina Display and shall be running on Intel processors that are two or three years out of date, notes C/Net. The speculations are also rife in saying that the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall have identical prices as its current models. But the rumors are also fairly consistent in saying that the excellent features of the latest laptop from Apple are the OLED touch bar, the Touch ID, and the Apple Pencil Trackpad. Accordingly, the 2016 MacBook Pro shall have a massive redesign from its previous model because it will be lighter and thinner than its predecessors. However, the laptop’s best feature would be its touch-ready secondary OLED display that shall be replacing the entire function key row atop the keyboard. Easier to interact with device’s features The secondary OLED display of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro shall offer contextual shortcuts to the user, making it even easier to interact with frequently used features that are going to be just one touch away. The OLED bar should offer system-wide shortcuts, but also app-specific shortcuts, on the assumption that developers shall extend support to the feature. Apple has yet to officially name the OLED display on the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro but insiders say that the company refers to it internally as the ‘Dynamic Function Row.’ The best feature of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro seemed to have been confirmed no less by reputable Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo of KGI Securities as early as May this year. What is also exciting users about the upcoming Apple laptop is its reported new features including a fingerprint scanner, a near-field communication (NFC) chip, and a wireless charging capability. These major features are already common in some of Apple’s devices including iPhones and iPads, but they have yet to touch base on its laptop lines. In fact, because of these reported features of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro when it officially comes out in the next few months that it is projected by analysts that laptop and notebook shipments are set to rebound beginning in the third quarter of this year. Of the three rumored major features of the 2016 Apple MacBook Pro, the wireless charging capability seems to be the one that shall be a bit of a challenge because Apple has yet to launch an iPhone that has a wireless charging IC.

After 18 years living in San Jose, she moved to Folsom so she and her husband could buy a house. She knows of at least five other friends who've been "priced out" in the San Francisco Bay Area in just the last year and a half.

The Silicon Valley capital just became too damn expensive. Her husband, Krishna, really wanted to buy. But even with his engineer’s salary, the couple could only afford to rent a one bedroom town home. The Atreyas soon realized that if left the San Francisco Bay Area, they could actually buy a piece of the proverbial American dream. So they started house-hunting farther and farther afield, in places like Pleasanton, Dublin and Livermore. But their goal of homeownership continued to remain elusive. “We kept getting bought out by people who were offering cash,” Atreya says. Finally, the Atreyas found their way to Folsom, east of Sacramento. Erika Atreya loves the small city’s easy-going vibe and its proximity to nature. But she misses San Jose. A year and a half out, she continues to struggle with the emotional fallout of the change. “There was more than an adjustment,” says the self-taught visual artist, who lived in San Jose for 18 years before she and her husband decamped for Folsom. “There was depression, and loneliness.” For one thing, San Jose’s demographic mix makes for a richer, multi-cultural feel, which Atreya loves. For another, the art gallery scene in Folsom doesn’t really compare to her old home base. “Back home, I had so many people to reach out to in my art community,” Atreya says. Room to paint in Folsom That said, the Atreyas’ new three-bedroom house gives the couple space to breathe and grow. Now, instead of ever so carefully spreading out on the couch with her materials, as she used to in San Jose, Atreya has her own studio in the garage. She also has enough wall space in the house to accommodate 40 works of art, many by friends she had to leave behind. Atreya is constantly adding to the collection with new works, like this one: “Eve,” by Folsom artist Erica Atreya, was produced for a show with a collective called reCREATE, that upcycles items like this body form of a female torso. (Photo: Courtesy of Anthony Barbaria) “I did lot of detail and texturization with puff paint,” Atreya says of one of the pieces on display in her home, titled Eve. “So you can actually touch the piece.” Not Johnny Cash’s Folsom The Folsom the Atreyas moved to is not the one that comes to mind from the 1968 Johnny Cash song “Folsom Prison Blues.” These days, the city is like a comfortable, middle class Sacramento suburb. Intel is the biggest employer. Half the population hails from the San Francisco Bay Area or Southern California. The Atreyas moved numerous times within San Jose before they left. “We kept moving further away from the main tech companies, because it would get cheaper the further we moved,” but those rents rose, too. (Photo: Courtesy of Erica Atreya) “It’s cyclical,” explains Mary Ann McAlea, senior vice president of the Greater Folsom Partnership, a consortium of organizations that oversee tourism, trade and economic development in the region. McAlea says Folsom’s population expands every time real estate booms to the west. “It’s tied to the real estate values on the coast.” McAlea says Folsom has witnessed a spike in in-migration over the last five years, especially young families looking for more square footage in an area where they can also find well-paying jobs. Dramatic losses for San Jose In recent years, rising real estate prices have pressured – or forced – artists to leave San Francisco and Oakland for cheaper places elsewhere. The same thing is happening in Silicon Valley. The average rent for a San Jose apartment these days is $2,600 according to the real estate brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap. That’s not as bad as San Francisco, but San Jose rents are still steep, and nearly 50 percent higher than they were five years ago. Even for those who can afford to pay the rent, the pull to leave for cheaper living is hard to resist — especially if you’re an artist whose partner makes the bulk of the household income. These days, Erica Atreya still drives three hours from Folsom to San Jose every month to participate in Arte nella Piazza, an art bazaar in San Jose’s Little Italy. (Photo: Rachael Myrow/KQED) In the time since she left for Folsom, Atreya says she knows of five other artists who left their hearts in San Jose. This number includes a musician who like her also moved to Sacramento County, a painter who moved in El Dorado County, and three people who left for Oregon. “We know the market has changed drastically,” acknowledges Kerry Adams-Hapner, San Jose’s director of cultural affairs. Adams-Hapner says the city of San Jose is surveying its artists for the second time in eight years to get a current handle on their housing and work space issues. Real estate costs are dramatically higher now. But even five years ago, 47 percent of the 700 artists canvassed in the survey found San Jose area housing unaffordable; two-thirds reported spending more than 30 percent of their income on mortgage or rent. “People need a space to live, fundamentally,” Adams Hapner says. “Also, people need a space to present their work. They need a space to rehearse. And they need spaces also to connect with each other and network.” Many Silicon Valley artists, including Steve Borelli of Campbell, don’t even begin to pay the rent with their art. But that’s not a reason to give up the practice, or the community. (Photo: Rachael Myrow/KQED) In Folsom, Atreya is gradually building a new network of friends and professional contacts. But she still feels an emotional pull towards her old home. “All my art family’s there, mostly,” Atreya says. “So, my heart’s still here in San Jose.” Atreya still regularly drives three hours southwest to reconnect with her friends in San Jose. She’s still a member of the San Jose Art Salon, a group of creatives who meet regularly for collective inspiration. And every month, she returns to Arte nella Piazza, an art bazaar in San Jose’s Little Italy neighborhood. Those that stayed behind This exodus of artists is depressing for those left behind in the South Bay, too – even if they’re not about to get priced out. At the art fair, Steve Borelli has his own table set up near Atreya’s with his abstract drawings available for sale. “Every passing day, I feel I’m luckier,” Borelli says. Borelli bought a house years ago in Campbell, near San Jose. Borelli pays the mortgage with his salary as a graphic designer. But his true love is drawing – and his connection to the local artists’ community. “I fear for the future,” Borelli says. “You know, if it keeps going the way that it is, eventually you’re going to see a mass migration out, and I just hope it never comes to that.” Mia the cat gets interviewed at Erica Atreya’s Folsom home. (Photo: Courtesy of Erica Atreya) The exodus is a function of the economy, says Matthew Mahood, president and CEO of the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce. The loss of school teachers and firefighters might seem to be a more pressing concern for San Jose than the flight of artists. But Mahood says quality of life is equally essential for the region to thrive going forward.  “In order to attract and keep a quality workforce, you have to have arts and entertainment,” Mahood says. “Those things where people want to call this home.”   Explore: Arts, News, Visual Arts, audio, feature Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Show Comments (1) Hide Comments Mary949 Newsflash, Erica.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Comtrade Software Chooses Hub of Innovation for Company’s International Headquarters Comtrade Software Chooses Hub of Innovation for Company’s International Headquarters Posted on September 9, 2016 by BeGraciousDaily in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer When GE announced it was moving its headquarters to Boston, Massachusetts, for many, it was no surprise. Massachusetts has long been known for being an innovation economy. And, for technology companies, in particular, Massachusetts has always been attractive to build and grow for the future.  In 2015, in a report by CompTIA, the leading tech industry association, the state claimed highest per-capita ranking nationwide in tech-related patenting, licensing, and venture capital. And, according to The Boston Globe, the state claimed the No. 1 spot nationally in high-tech notably in research and development, testing and life science industries. Simon Taylor, President, Comtrade Software, shares inspiring insight about the corporate reasons behind the decision to locate in Boston. “So it’s in keeping with the states’ history in innovation that we chose Massachusetts, and Boston, as the venue to host the international headquarters for Comtrade Software. With our long-term growth strategy in mind, Boston was a natural choice. What may have surprised me most was answering the question, “Why not Silicon Valley?” In spite of Silicon Valley’s attractiveness, giving rise to many cutting-edge companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Intel to name a few, for us, Boston fosters an environment ripe for technology innovation. The city also provides access to talent and brings us closer to our hundreds of New England customers. It’s also a great location to help us accelerate our growth plans for all of North America.  The choice was also personal for me. As a Bostonian with European roots, I am always impressed by the city’s history, pride, and cultural strength. And these are the same qualities Comtrade Software shares with Boston and why it truly feels like a perfect match. On the operational side – relatively short flights to a number of important destinations and proximity to Europe are also advantageous as we truly are a global business. Therefore we can see our new US location as central to reaching and connecting with our US and Global partners and clients.  I’m also looking forward to continuing to give back to the Boston community, both personally and for Comtrade Software. College Bound Dorchester, a local organization that focuses on helping hard-to-reach students achieve their greatest potential through education and enrollment in college, has been one of many organizations I am personally proud to help in any way I can. As a business, we have aggressive plans for growth and I know that being headquartered in Boston will make sure we meet our objectives. We’re excited to be here and I’m looking forward to keeping you all posted on how things progress. And please make sure to check back as I share photos from our Boston office opening reception!“  Location: 109 State Street, Suite 304 Boston MA 02109, USA http://www.comtradesoftware.com/ For Comtrade Software Enquiries Contact: Biljana Bartulac, Comtrade Software Biljana.Bartulac@comtrade.com About Comtrade Software Comtrade Software is a leading provider of IT infrastructure management solutions specializing in data, system, network and application performance.

How does it work? Reporter Theresa Chong talks to Richard Marks, director of PlayStation Magic Lab, to find out. Theresa Chong for USA TODAY Derric Clark, program champion of game studies at the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, demonstrates virtual-reality technology on Sept. 1, 2016. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) Story Highlights Virtual reality is poised for growth as equipment and computer prices have come down The industry is expected to grow more than 180 percent per year Growth in the near term is expected from the gaming market, followed by business applications If the thought of strapping on a big black mask and getting lost in another world through virtual reality sounds a bit awkward to you, get over it. Experts predict many of us will be using virtual reality or at least augmented reality in a few short years as the technology proliferates. For now, it’s mostly used in games, and it’s a modest $5 billion industry. But as doctors begin to use augmented reality to assess patients, and factories begin using the technology to repair and maintain large industrial machines, the market is expected to reach $162 billion in 2020, according to a recent forecast from International Data Corp. And the University of Advancing Technology, a private 750-student college in Tempe, began this semester offering a virtual-reality bachelor’s degree and incorporating the technology into other aspects of its curriculum. “The media industries are all very interested,” UAT Provost David Bolman said while standing in a computer lab in the campus near Baseline Road and Interstate 10. The private technology college offers bachelor’s and advanced degrees in various fields of computer science. “Now the workforce is so hot for technology,” Bolman said. “Recruiters say, 'We’ll take all of your grads, but have them ready.' ” RELATED: Shopping for cars using virtual reality | PGA Tour dipping a toe into virtual reality | Tempe company uses virtual reality to train Arizona police | Pokemon Go's augmented reality Out of the lab and onto smartphones Virtual reality involves the use of masks or other gear that create a three-dimensional environment that users can interact with. In these environments, hand-held controllers become tools or weapons in the virtual environment, and they react to input from the user. Virtual reality in the spotlight In addition to the popularity of the Pokemon Go game that uses augmented reality, a handful of headlines from the past few weeks show how ubiquitous virtual reality and augmented reality could become in society. Cedar Fair Entertainment Co., which owns three North American amusement parks including Knott’s Berry Farm in California, introduced a virtual-reality experience this year themed for Halloween. Guests at the amusement parks wear a virtual-reality headset and are strapped in wheelchairs, where they experience a haunted-house-like tour through a mental hospital. In early September, Intel announced plans to acquire Movidius, a chipmaker focused on the autonomous-vehicle market whose chips are used in virtual-reality applications. In June, Google announced a new phone from Lenovo would be enabled with its Tango technology, which enables the phone to view and understand physical spaces. With the specially enabled phone, customers can, for example, superimpose pieces of furniture onto a view of their living room to determine if the new couch will fit and whether it will match the paint and flooring. President Obama narrated a virtual-reality tour of Yosemite National Park earlier this year to help celebrate the centennial of the National Park Service. Augmented reality is where features of a virtual world are superimposed on a user’s view of the real world. The popular Pokemon Go game uses augmented reality to superimpose characters on an image of the real world as seen through a user’s smartphone. Augmented reality also can be incorporated into devices such as the Google Glass eyewear. Several recent graduates of UAT have gone on to work in virtual reality, which the university predicted when it first offered such a degree in 1991. “It was a bit ahead of its time,” Bolman said. The degree was suspended a few years later as virtual reality remained an expensive, clunky technology that often employed the use of awkward helmets known for making people seasick. “The technology plateaued forever,” said Derric Clark, program champion for Game Studies at UAT. “Now, it fools you. Now we are crossing that threshold.” Indeed, a quick demonstration of the latest virtual-reality systems in the school’s New Technology lab confirms that the new masks from companies such as HTC and Oculus can quickly transport users to three-dimensional settings that appear incredibly realistic. The visual effects are accurate enough to give users a sense of vertigo when, for example, the scene changes to make it appear the user is standing at a cliff’s edge. The Oculus Rift sells for about $600, while the HTC Vive costs about $800. Sony Playstation will begin selling a virtual-reality headset next month for about $400. The Samsung Gear device that is compatible with some phones can be bought for less than $100. “These things used to cost $25,000, and now you have the same technology, like a tilt sensor, in your phone,” Clark said. “We finally are at the point of it being an extravagant Christmas gift, rather than something only found in a research lab.” Poised for growth Derric Clark, program champion of game studies at the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe, demonstrates virtual-reality technology on Sept. 1, 2016.  (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic) Trevor Berninger is a recent UAT graduate now working in Bellevue, Wash., for Limitless Ltd. He programs VR content for the Playstation.  He said the technology quickly converts the skeptics. "When I give demos to people who have never used Vive or Oculus before and are skeptical about how good VR will be, once they are done with the experience they often tell me how amazed they are that VR technology has gotten where it is and they are completely sold on the future of VR," he said. "I think it will be a big thing and there will be plenty of jobs in the future," he said. “The (virtual-reality) technology plateaued forever. Now, it fools you. Now we are crossing that threshold.”Derric Clark, program champion for Game Studies at the University of Advancing Technology in Tempe He got his degree in game programming, but said there is a need for virtual-reality training in colleges. "VR is very new and none of us VR developers really know what we are doing yet and so there is a ton of experimenting going on right now," Berninger said. Games will help sustain the industry for the next year or two, but business uses for virtual reality will be soon to follow, said Chris Chute, vice president of customer insights and analysis with IDC in Boston, which published the recent forecast for the virtual reality market. “We’re not saying everyone will have a Samsung headset to play the new Resident Evil game,” Chute said. “The next innovation will be outside the consumer realm. From a spending perspective, it is a lot different when you are a children’s hospital and you are developing a surgical program with the technology." Another reason IDC forecasts the virtual- and augmented-reality markets to take off is the fact that computing to run the systems is so widely available. USA TODAY Retailers look to high tech to hook store visitors “It is a question of cost, and it is a question of who will come up with the next application,” he said. Bolman said as the technology becomes more ubiquitous, it will create a snowball effect where new uses for the technology are discovered. “Virtual reality is special and different,” Bolman said. “It won’t always be that way.” Practical applications The practical applications of virtual- and augmented-reality already have shown themselves to UAT staff and graduates. UAT built a virtual “clean room” for Motorola in 1995, and by testing the design virtually, the company realized the layout was inconvenient. The company saved thousands of dollars redesigning the facility before it was built thanks to the program from UAT, Clark said. “I think (virtual reality) will be a big thing and there will be plenty of jobs in the future.”Trevor Berninger, recent UAT grad now working for Limitless Ltd. in Washington programming VR content for the Playstation Another virtual-reality program was used in 1991 to evaluate how the baseball stadium in downtown Phoenix would look, he said. The stadium, called Bank One Ballpark when it opened but now called Chase Field, used the virtual-reality program to determine the best places for signage. When that virtual model was completed, Clark said, stadium officials thought UAT had made a mistake because from certain vantage points in the virtual stadium, the aisles looked crooked. “They said, 'You did it wrong,' ” Clark said. “We said, 'No, that’s what you are going to build.' ” Law enforcement and first responders also can use virtual training to get accustomed to doing their jobs in high-pressure situations, he said. The applications going forward are limitless, Bolman added. Imagine using a device such as Google Glass to assemble furniture such as that from retailer Ikea, he said. Instead of having to turn your attention from the instruction book to the furniture pieces, a virtual-reality program could superimpose instructions over the coded pieces, telling you how to put them together. The same principle could be used to help people make household or automotive repairs, or to install a new stereo. Or to help technicians who repair industrial equipment. Bolman said that while some might fear a future where everyone is cut off from society because they are working and playing in virtual environments, the faculty at UAT are conscientious of drawing boundaries regarding technology. UAT offers a course on technology and society. Among the topics covered is when to use technology and when it is not appropriate. “We consider things such as, if everyone around is on their phone, what does that do to society,” he said.

Laura Janet Baker appeared to confirm the long-rumoured flagship via a double negative. It could be the end of the silly season; judge for yourself. Rumours abound that Microsoft will kill off production of its current Lumia range by the end of the year. The brand has gradually been deprecated in favour of “Windows phone devices”. Only four Microsoft Windows 10 Lumias were ever announced, the fourth seven months ago. Their success can be measured by the fact Microsoft introduced a BOGOF (buy one, get one free ) offer in June in various markets, via AT&T in the USA, for example. Microsoft currently offers a bundle of a Lumia 950 case, screen protector and wireless charger for £312 or the larger 950 XL for £400.99. Top trolling Speculation about an Intel-powered Surface Phone – a marquee product leveraging the Surface brand, capable of running legacy x86/x86-64 apps – began to circulate when it became clear the mobile phone portfolio acquired from Nokia was being run down. The company confirmed as much in June. “We’ll lead with some high end and category innovation like we’ve done with Surface, and OEMs will go and build the breadth of the catalogue," Windows VP Kevin Gallo told us. The plan floundered when Intel pulled out of making any more LTE modems. HP has other ideas, though. It isn’t going to settle for the scraps in a negligible consumer market, having thrown the kitchen sink at its business-focussed Elite X3, and built a virtualisation service to pipe over the x86 apps that the phone can’t run natively. It’s hard to imagine what “category innovation” Microsoft can bring to the market, since all phone makers are stuck for ideas. Perhaps the Microsoft Surface Phone will be magnetic, and collect up all the stray earpieces your iPhone 7-toting friends have lost. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 49 Comments More from The Register Microsoft Azure sets up shop in France Bonjour, mes fluffy white amis 22 Comments What strange madness is this?

The lightweight platform now includes an extension for Visual Studio Code, which is Microsoft’s new code editor for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, according to Silicon Angle. Windows 10 IoT Core now offers a Universal Windows Platform application for the Raspberry Pi2 and 3, provided they have the Sense HAT add-on board. Microsoft said that the Windows 10 IoT Core will also support Intel’s Joule developers kit, which was introduced at last month’s Intel Developer Forum. The story – and the blog by Microsoft Senior Software Engineer Paul Monson – is aimed at those with deep programming expertise. The bottom line is that operating systems for the IoT have to be extremely efficient and sharply targeted due to power constraints and other factors. Microsoft and other vendors are trying to pack as much punch into their platforms as possible within those limitations. Lighter LTE Radios Coming for the IoT A similar challenge faces networking companies. During the early dates of the IoT, even the smallest sensor needed a full-scale LTE radio. That’s not efficient. The answer is LTE Category M1, which focuses on low-powered radio more in line with the limited jobs IoT devices are called upon to do and the small amount of energy they have to do it. PCWorld’s Stephen Lawson writes that LTE Category M1 was a big deal at the CTIA Super Mobility Show in Las Vegas. Verizon Wireless will deploy by year’s end and AT&T will run a pilot in the San Francisco Bay area in November, the story said. Chip vendors also are working on M1 products. Malware Still Proliferates in Mobile The industry is nowhere near out of the woods in regard to malware on smartphones. In April, according to the Nokia Threat Intelligence Lab, more than 1.06 percent of devices were infected. The culprits were ransomware, spy-phone applications, aggressive adware and others. The rate of infection, according to Network World, doubled during the first half of the year. Android “got pummeled” and was responsible for three-quarters of the infections. Android’s woes don’t end there: More bad news for Android is that its app ecosphere became significantly more infected over the period, the lab says. Nokia says it’s seen a 75 percent surge in contaminated apps there. Blighted apps, which it records in a malware database, shot up from 5.1 million in December 2015 to a staggering 8.9 million by July. Games are the main culprit, according to Nokia. FCC’s Wheeler: Municipal Approvals Key to 5G Success The short version of the message delivered by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Tom Wheeler in his keynote to the CTIA Super Mobility 2016 conference was that at least one big obstacle to 5G remains. A big challenge, Wheeler told the conferees, is that municipalities across the nation must approve the deployment of small cell equipment. If the millions of small cell towers are not given the go-ahead more expeditiously than the past generation of macro cells were, “few communities will ever have the benefit of 5G,” Wheeler says. His suggestion is that the industry make fast approvals more likely by talking to municipal officials about the benefits 5G offers to their communities and the people who live in them. A Tale of Two Wearables IDC released data for wearables this week. Overall, 22.5 million wearable devices shipped during the second quarter. That represents a 26.1 percent year-over-year increase. Commentary in the press release says that fitness remains the low-hanging fruit, though communications, mobile payments and enterprise use is increasing. There are two distinct trends within the category, according to IDC. Devices that don’t support third-party applications (called “basic” by the firm) grew by 48.8 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. Wearables that accept the outside apps (“smart”) declined at a 27.2 percent clip. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

PC gaming fan Michael Passingham explores the first-ever '4K' gaming console. Amidst a sea of well-targeted negativity surrounding Sony’s omission of an Ultra HD Blu-ray drive, a seriously impressive technical achievement seems to have been lost: Sony has produced the first games console in history to output games at a resolution greater than Full HD, which steers it into territory that only custom-built gaming PCs costing in excess of £500 have been able to achieve. In our Best Gaming PC spec guide, resident custom builder Ed Chester managed to construct this PC for around £500. Granted, it's slightly more powerful and has loads more storage, but if you're playing on a TV a few feet away, you can spend a lot less on a PS4 Pro and get (possibly) a very similar experience. ___________________ The £500 gaming PC: CPU: Intel Pentium G4400 – £54 at Overclockers.co.uk | $60 at Amazon.com Motherboard: ASRock H170A-X1 – £73 at Scan.co.uk | $73.99 at Amazon.com RAM: Corsair Vengeance LPX 8GB 2400MHz, 2 x 4GB – £36 at Ebuyer.com | $44 at Amazon.com Graphics card: AMD Radeon RX 480 4GB – £209 at Ebuyer.com | $249 at Newegg.com SSD: 120GB Kingston SSDNow V300 – £39 at Amazon.co.uk | $43 at Amazon.com HDD: WD Blue 1TB – £39 at Amazon.co.uk | $49 at Amazon.com Power Supply: Corsair VS450 – £33 at Amazon.co.uk | $58 at Amazon.com Case: BitFenix Nova – £26 at Overclockers UK | $40 at Amazon.com Cooler: Included with CPU Windows 10: £75 ___________________ And that's before we get into buying a controller. As a die-hard fan of PC gaming, I have to admit I'm impressed with what Sony has done. It has produced the most powerful console available today for a much lower price than many would have imagined. There are several ingredients to this success. First is AMD’s Polaris architecture. The fruits of this labour can be seen in the company’s Radeon RX 480 graphics card that retails for under £200 in its 4GB guise. It’s a card that’s capable of smooth Full HD (1080p) gaming at Ultra settings on PC and good 1440p performance at Ultra, too.AMD's RX 480 was a game-changer when it arrived earlier this year The addition of Polaris-based hardware to the PS4 Pro has given the console mid-range gaming PC levels of performance in terms of raw, brute-force power. In fact, the chip inside is exactly the same as the one in the RX 480 (albeit at a slightly slower clock speed), which is a great sign. This in itself is impressive, but it’s actually some software wizardry from both Sony and AMD that has allowed the graphics chip to perform far beyond its specifications would suggest. Indeed, without this new technology, there’s no way the PS4 Pro would be able to get even close to the visual fidelity that’s been claimed. Related: PS4 Pro vs Xbox One S What have they done? For 4K upscaling, the prevailing theory is that the PS4 Pro renders double the number of pixels to Full HD (around 2,688 x 1,512 according to Digital Foundry) and then uses advanced upscaling technology to delicately massage it up to 4K resolution. This is done by using clever anti-aliasing algorithms that take an intelligent look at a set of pixels and decide how to upscale them. The result? Sharper-looking transitions between objects, more detailed images and none of that horrible, blurry softness you get with the most basic upscaling tech. This means the GPU only has to render double the number of pixels to Full HD instead of six times for 4K. That makes a huge difference to performance. It’s never going to be as good as true 4K, but the promise is that many games will be able to run at the crucial 60fps at this upscaled resolution, which is unheard of for a GPU of this calibre. If developers are actually able to make this happen, this is a huge deal. Watch PS4 Pro: Everything you need to know This house of cards is held up over the assumption that the player is plugging the PS4 Pro into a TV that’s a few feet away from them. The closer you get, the more obvious this anti-aliasing will appear. If you game on a TV that’s, say, 10 feet away, it’ll be a lot harder to see the slightly softer image created through this anti-aliasing tech. If you play on a monitor that’s on your desk, mere inches away, you might be disappointed. Until someone on the Trusted team has seen it with their own eyes, this is purely speculation. Don’t have a 4K TV? Don’t fret: the PS4 Pro could still be for you. The suggestion is that PS4 Pro owners will be able to play games at higher graphical settings if their console is hooked up to a Full HD TV. If this turns out to be a seamless experience, this could be a very tempting upgrade path for current PS4 owners who don’t yet have the cash to buy a 4K TV. Bottom line: getting this sort of performance on a compact living room PC for £349 is impossible right now. While I am disappointed Sony hasn’t bothered to include an SSD instead of a clunky old mechanical hard disk, it’s an impressive piece of kit.The Xbox Scorpio could still be a threat Of course, you can’t write a piece like this without acknowledging the Xbox Scorpio. We know that it’ll be around 50% more powerful than the PS4 Pro when it launches at the end of next year, which is certainly not to be sniffed at. But without a price or any further details, it’s entirely up to buyers as to whether they’ll wait a year or buy a PS4 Pro right now. Custom PC builders need not fear: there are still enormous advantages to building your own PC, not least the ability to upgrade the graphics card every two or three years when gaming technology advances. That, and the fact actually buying PC games is a lot cheaper in the long run. The so-called 'PC Master Race' probably isn’t worried, but everybody else looking for higher quality graphics on consoles should be delighted. Watch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week Do you agree with Michael? Let us hear your thoughts in the comments below. 0 shares Read Comments Paul September 10, 2016, 1:52 am To be honest as a PC gamer I wasn't really that impressed with PS4 Pro, it's made the PC seem more appealing and cheaper, also I think they should've focused on 1080p 60fps upscale to 4k and not try to do native 4k because the power isn't there, it could also backfire for Sony because they keep going on about 4k this 4k that and many console gamers are going to think it's 4k native when hardly any games will be, many might end up feeling conned over time. Also, anyone thats got a half decent rigs will think it's not worth getting the PS4 Pro when they can plop in a better gpu in the PC for less money, and with no online sub, cheaper games and DX12 and Vulkan that will likely make PC gaming even cheaper and more powerful in the long run, I have to wonder why Sony would try to compete with the PC because they can't win that unless they are willing to bump up the price a lot and even then it's unlikely. Fleetwood September 10, 2016, 5:17 am Not impressed. This is just clearly a path to satisfy the console crowd from abandoning the PS(console) ecosystem for more raw performance elsewhere. Couple points to clear out; - There isn't much to support this being a underclock RX480 <--To early to call it out. - $400-500 "gaming" computers are mostly 1st timers getting their feet wet (entry-level market, nothing to worry about) - Playstation always had the lower-level GNM api, PC now has Vulkan(Thanks AMD ;) The console space was in need of a faster hardware release change to satisfy the market. So seems the incremental hardware updates are here to stay. Every 4 years expect a new "incremental" hardware release of the previous console. This can be good for the console crowd but still pales in comparison to what the PC enjoys. IMO, this just shows how desperate and fragile the console space is. Hopefully Nintendo continues in their own path. L4lefty September 10, 2016, 11:10 am This Pc vs Console debate is quite frankly, boring...and yet, amusing at the same time. Your bias is clear, which is your prerogative of course. But, I'd suggest your lack of perspective and tediously dismissive attitude towards individuals (not a crowd) who chose a platform you don't, simply perpetuates the negative stereotype that gamers and their pursuits are childish. You presumably enjoy your chosen hardware, good for you...To each their own. Sun Streaker September 10, 2016, 1:43 pm If it is to each their own, then why not leave him to it?, why take the high horse?. Fleetwood September 10, 2016, 4:25 pm There isn't a debate of which is the superior platform in my eyes, to each their own. Something you fail to realize, and where am I displaying a "dismissive" attitude? Just because I wasn't impressed? There is no entitlement when someone simply points out the facts in this sudden, major change from the console space. Recount the last 10 years of what was stated by console titans themselves; console, lasts more than 5 years without ever needing to upgrade, game visuals/performance is the same for all on the same game per console, just plug-in-play, never needing higher visuals/FPS to play a great game, etc... It's simply that the traditional console lifestyle has changed drastically from what it once was. -Do I think that's bad? No. -Do I hate consoles? No. -Do I bring false information to slander the author or console fans? No. It was painfully obvious the PS4 Pro was meant as an alternative against the PC from the get go. Here's a quote where Sony boss speaks to Guardian: - Regarding the PlayStation 4 Pro, he suggested the Xbox wasn’t even being considered its main competition. Rather, it was the PC. “I saw some data that really influenced me,” he said. “It suggested that there’s a dip mid-console lifecycle where the players who want the very best graphical experience will start to migrate to PC, because that’s obviously where it’s to be had. We wanted to keep those people within our eco-system by giving them the very best and very highest [performance quality]. So the net result of those thoughts was PlayStation 4 Pro – and, by and large, a graphical approach to game improvement.” Sizzor September 10, 2016, 6:30 pm Game are rendering at 1440p and then upscaled to 4k with some anti aliasing algorithm.I think only games will look nice will be playstation exclusive titles like God of wars etc. rest of the 3rd party title will just upscaled version and will get worse as the console life cycle degrades. If on a budget it is a better option. L4lefty September 10, 2016, 9:22 pm To each their own...opinion. My opinion is, terms like 'desperate and fragile', and 'pales in comparison' hide a thinly veiled PC master race snobbery. I don't have to prove my point, or even qualify what I write, the same as Fleetwood doesn't. Is that okay with you? :-) Sun Streaker September 11, 2016, 9:11 am But you don't need to prove and yet you somehow call yourself right in this situation and he doesn't have to prove either and yet he's somehow wrong?. I believe you're twisting this to benefit your own side rather than admitting that you took the high horse the moment you entered the stable. Also "pales in comparison" isn't a negative way to describe something. You could have a scientist tell you that our planet pales in comparison to the sun in terms of size, energy etc and you shouldn't *choose* to feel offended, same goes for fragile. The smiley face at the end tells me that you're not really taking this in stride and that you're eventually going to crack down with witty retorts, I hope to god I'm wrong and that you don't go down that path, because that's what a good chunk of random folks end up going with on the net. L4lefty September 11, 2016, 11:57 am The smiley face was my attempt to calm you down, as you seem quite angry for some reason, and you've taken this all very personally and seriously. You hope to God you're wrong about what I write, and how...really? Hopefully this reply fits in with your expectations and how you'd hoped to control, or stifle conversation...I have no wish to cause you more anxiety, so I'll leave you to the self-aggrandizing weirdness. All the best :-) Edonus September 11, 2016, 12:02 pm The second some one says forget 4k Blu Rays I know they are full of crap and cant be trusted. I am a gamer. I dont like gaming on PC but understand why some do and am not opposed to some of the benefits PC gamers get like better performance and graphics in my games. But.... I am also an entertainment consumer. As the TV and tech get bigger and better I grow with them. Not at audiophile or videophile levels but when HD became a thing I bought a 32in 720p, then later 2 plasmas 42 and 50in 1080p tvs over the last 8 years. 4k is the new thing about 4 months ago I bought a 55in 4k tv....... soon to buy a 55-70in 4k tv because the sales rep didnt tell me anything about HDR. Now.... with that said I want some real 4k content for my current and future TV. I play X1 games and they look great to me..... sure they can probably look better but Halo 5 looks awesome, and I am sure Gears 4 will too. I could get a Ps4 Pro and get a decent I guess bump in some games and that would be nice but it would not be using my 4k tv to its fullest. Now I have an Xbox One and am looking at a One S..... sure the game will not be as nice looking as the Ps4 Pro but my movies will with the 4k Blu Ray player. Right now that is the only device that will make having a 4k TV really worth it...... I am going to try and hold out for the Scorpio but it gets hard. Ps4 Pro can still sell me if PsVR proves to be worthwhile. Sun Streaker September 11, 2016, 12:14 pm I'm actually quite relaxed at the time of writing that reply as well as the others, so no need to worry that much there. At last you have gone with the self fulfilling prophecy of the internet. Bob Sacamanto September 11, 2016, 1:07 pm The PS4 Pro is a lot of things, like UGLY, UNDERWHELMING, made of the CHEAP plastic and so on, but one thing it is not, and that is hugely impressive. Anyone who says it is, is either heavily influenced by Sony marketing, or a complete diehard Sony fanboy and by extension lacking in credibility. Fleming_007 September 11, 2016, 1:21 pm Frankly it is odd that sony isn't including 4k blu ray playback. In my case, I wasn't going to upgrade my 50+blu ray collection to 4k anyway. I just wanted to play ps4 exclusives and upscale my movies which ps4pro does ( I think?). If anything this actually got me thinking to purchase a 4k hdr tv so I can enjoy upscaled movies and upscaled ps4 titles. Yeah its not real 4k and I'm ok with this since I already have a gaming PC capable of native 1440p. YOUDIEMOFO September 11, 2016, 1:30 pm Yeah, so save that money on the gimped experience you will get and spend that on a capable TV!? It's only going to be like $1200 to get a decent one, so I guess the goes your cheap console price for half the experience. And BTW streaming is no where near the capable quality of a physical disc, so the quality all around is a joke. YOUDIEMOFO September 11, 2016, 1:38 pm Came here just for the title of the article.... Because it is onlyclick bait. First off it is a lie and the author is lying because one will have to have a capable TV in order to take advantage of the PS4 PRO's feature set. Go ahead and look at all the video comparisons online.....they ALL say that one needs a 4K HDR capable screen in order to "actually see the difference.....!!" That is just watching a video on YouTube, but I guess the experience is going to change once you are sitting in front of your eight year old 1080p TV. This incremental system BS release is just that BS..... The newer system is to be held back by the older system and so forth.....they have even concluded that it was the case just by saying they had to keep the RAM for developmental "parity" sake!! When the "new NEW" drops in a couple years if not next year it will still be held back by the same developmental parity. That is unless they ditch the old all together and make an upgrade the only option they will still be coding backwards! Sony: "Hey........do we have a deal for you guys....!" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! The truth-ier September 11, 2016, 1:48 pm This is a terrible article, written by a sony fanboy, and no die hard PC gamer is going to build a mid range at best rig like that. The PS4 PRO is not impressive to any die hard PC Gamer, and your excuse in your opening is just a precursor to more crap. Jason V September 11, 2016, 1:54 pm What PC fanboys are forgetting is that these more powerful consoles may not gimp their games. As probably a few of you know consoles have held back the PC market for years. Having more powerful consoles allows for those games that are made on console first easier and less of a hassle for devs to port to PC in a higher resolution and graphical quality. Yes we all know the broken record story of "PC games look better" But this makes so much easier for devs in the long run. Imo PC gamers are the worse of all the fanboys. I game on 3 current gen platforms (including some PC), retro consoles and a few handhelds. I don't really care too much about what a game looks like or try to prove a corporation is better than another. Because really they are not. All just want your money. Whether it's SONY vs MS, Nvidia vs AMD or Intel vs AMD. So put your money where your mouth is, shutup and stop being an arse. Just enjoy gaming. Hvd September 11, 2016, 2:00 pm a die hard pc gamer impressed by 4k upscaleing?...lmao i have herd it all now. LordCancer Kain September 11, 2016, 2:50 pm edit- Fleming_007 September 11, 2016, 2:50 pm Reading must be hard for you. Matthew Bunton September 11, 2016, 5:03 pm It's an opinion piece you fool. Matthew Bunton September 11, 2016, 5:06 pm Why not its a small £350 console offering near to 4k quality graphics albeit via 1440p etc. scaling and some clever algorithms. Kelarth September 11, 2016, 5:28 pm Hardcore PC gamer impressed with 4K upscaling that isn't really even 4K. Stop it we all know that TrustedReviews is just another Sony shill site. Kelarth September 11, 2016, 5:30 pm An opinion piece written by a fool for other fools.

But a lack of unification and vendor support has, in some cases, stalled its adoption in the enterprise. Initiatives like the Open Compute Project (OCP), however, have increased the interest in open source, as organizations push the concept in their data centers. Here are frequently asked questions that examine recent advances in open source technology, as well as the benefits and challenges of using these technologies in the data center. How does open source technology benefit data center admins? Open source technology can bridge the gap between common data center issues in various locations around the world -- a problem that occurs in one location is likely to occur in another. The sharing of specs and code, along with the flexibility to edit or manage that code based on the needs of specific users, allows administrators to fix problems based on similar situations in other data centers. With open source technology -- be it software, hardware or a cloud platform -- users can minimize the costly IT purchases and upgrades associated with proprietary offerings, and instead utilize code already available through open source sharing. This can also prevent vendor lock-in, as users can pick and choose the features or services they want, based on their needs. What are some of the latest open source projects from the OCP? Google and major telecom companies, such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications, are making waves in the OCP, an open source initiative that aims to push more efficient server and data center designs. When a primary driver to switch to open source is the financial aspect, spending money on the necessary support can create a dilemma. Google teamed up with Rackspace to develop Open Compute servers that will use IBM's Power9 CPU after its release in 2017. The move signifies Google's challenge of Intel's dominance in the CPU market. Google also released blueprints of its 48V server architecture, marking the first time that Google publicized designs through open means. The design focuses primarily on the power mechanisms that Google uses, shifting away from alternating current lines to an approach that reduces cooling requirements and boosts efficiency. In the telecom industry, AT&T and Verizon recently joined the OCP Telco Project with the goal of sharing information on data center hardware and networking. Adoption on a wider scale remains slow -- despite financial and oil exploration companies using the technology -- but cost considerations are pushing companies toward open source channels. What other open source data center initiatives are there besides the OCP? A new data center open standard has emerged that offers an alternative to some of the more complicated designs associated with the OCP. The Open19 project, launched by LinkedIn Corp., attempts to appeal to a wider base than the OCP, focusing on servers and related equipment in a 19-inch data center rack. Using multiple vendors is a way to avoid vendor lock-in -- a big appeal for Open19, as smaller organizations want to find open source opportunities. The project also looks to shrink shared hardware in the rack and remove power supply units in servers. LinkedIn hopes to push the standard into a wider base, while coexisting with the OCP as another option for data center standards across different-sized racks. VMware's new Project Photon -- a container-friendly platform to support cloud-native applications -- was also recently added to the open source mix. In conjunction with the new Photon OS, Project Photon aims to smooth the transition from server virtualization to managing cloud-native apps on an open source operating system. The move signifies a push from VMware toward container workloads, and could be a draw for developers. What's the biggest challenge data center admins face with open source technology? When deploying or running open source technology, the lack of professional support can leave IT scrambling. Even after combing through search engine results and discussion boards, admins still might not have an answer for an urgent question. Professional support is lacking with open source tools, and although some vendors offer support services, they often comes at a cost. When a primary driver to switch to open source is the financial aspect, spending money on the necessary support can create a dilemma. Some larger companies have the resources -- both from a financial and staffing standpoint -- to support open source hardware and software in the data center, but smaller organizations often struggle to do so. When will open source become more prominent in IT, and what's holding it back? Since Facebook launched the OCP in 2011, larger companies have made the shift toward open source adoption -- but smaller ones linger behind. There's no telling when, exactly, open source and OCP will be the go-to when it comes to data center hardware and software infrastructure, as problems with staffing and support still hamper movements for small-scale operations. However, the market for open source platforms such as OpenStack continues to grow. OpenStack revenues will exceed $2 billion by 2017, according to analyst firm 451 Research. Much of that growth will be in the service provider market, but OpenStack distributions and IT training services are projected to drive growth in the enterprise, as well. With over 600 companies in attendance at the 2016 OCP Summit, including Microsoft, Apple, Google and larger financial services firms, the momentum for open source products seems to be picking up steam at big-name companies. The leaders of the pack are making waves in the field, but adoption remains low in smaller data centers. In production-style deployments, OCP is still off in the future.

Is Likely Using 10-Nanometer Tech for A10X It's a matter of economics with a side benefit of better performance. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 9, 2016 at 10:45AM Image source: Apple.  A little while back, KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo (via DIGITIMES) claimed that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) next-generation tablet processor, which is likely to be dubbed the A10X or A10X Fusion, will be manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 10-nanometer technology. By contrast, the A10 Fusion chip inside of the recently announced iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, is manufactured using TSMC's more mature 16-nanometer manufacturing technology. In this column, I'd like to offer up a potential explanation for why Apple may opt to adopt 10-nanometer for A10X. A question of economics According to Apple, the A10 Fusion chip is made up of 3.3 billion transistors. I estimate that on TSMC's 16-nanometer manufacturing technology, this chip will be quite large. To estimate just how large the A10 Fusion is, note that the Apple A8 chip -- manufactured in TSMC's 20-nanometer technology -- packed more than 2 billion transistors (per Apple) into an area of 89 square millimeters (per Chipworks). Since TSMC's 16-nanometer technology didn't provide a meaningful area reduction over its 20-nanometer technology, a crude estimate of the A10 Fusion's die size based on the A8 would peg it at approximately 147 square millimeters. That's gigantic for a smartphone chip. Heck, the majority of microprocessor giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) laptop/desktop processors aren't even that big. Given that the A10X is likely to cram in even more graphics cores and potentially other features over the A10, the chip would necessarily be well in excess of 150 square millimeters in TSMC's 16-nanometer technology. This would be doable, but it could be quite expensive. A move to 10-nanometer should help costs The A10X chip implemented in TSMC's 10-nanometer technology would be significantly smaller than the same chip manufactured in TSMC's 16-nanometer technology. Assuming that the area reduction that 10-nanometer brings more than offsets the wafer cost increase associated with moving from 16-nanometer to 10-nanometers, the A10X should be cheaper to build on 10-nanometers. Another factor that could further tilt costs in favor of the 10-nanometer node for the A10X would be yields. TSMC's 16-nanometer technology should be quite mature at this point, but it is well known that -- all else equal -- manufacturing yields of larger chips tend to be worse than those of smaller chips. Assuming that TSMC's 10-nanometer technology is generally healthy when it comes time to ramp the A10X into production, yields on A10X on 10-nanometer may simply be better than yields of a hypothetical, equivalent A10X on TSMC's 16-nanometer technology. There's a performance/power benefit, too Although the main benefit in transitioning from 16-nanometer to 10-nanometer should be cost, TSMC does claim some performance/power benefits to its 10-nanometer technology relative to its 16-nanometer technology. The performance benefit should allow Apple to wring out a bit more performance than it otherwise would have been able to on the 16-nanometer technology. Expect a performance monster with A10X Apple's A10 Fusion is already a monster mobile chip, and I suspect that the iDevice maker has something very impressive cooking with its next-generation iPad chip. Apple's chip designs are generally impressive irrespective of the manufacturing technology used, but the transition to 10-nanometer should help with both cost and performance.

Laura Janet Baker appeared to confirm the long-rumoured flagship via a double negative. It could be the end of the silly season; judge for yourself. Rumours abound that Microsoft will kill off production of its current Lumia range by the end of the year. The brand has gradually been deprecated in favour of “Windows phone devices”. Only four Microsoft Windows 10 Lumias were ever announced, the fourth seven months ago. Their success can be measured by the fact Microsoft introduced a BOGOF (buy one, get one free ) offer in June in various markets, via AT&T in the USA, for example. Microsoft currently offers a bundle of a Lumia 950 case, screen protector and wireless charger for £312 or the larger 950 XL for £400.99. Top trolling Speculation about an Intel-powered Surface Phone – a marquee product leveraging the Surface brand, capable of running legacy x86/x86-64 apps – began to circulate when it became clear the mobile phone portfolio acquired from Nokia was being run down. The company confirmed as much in June. “We’ll lead with some high end and category innovation like we’ve done with Surface, and OEMs will go and build the breadth of the catalogue," Windows VP Kevin Gallo told us. The plan floundered when Intel pulled out of making any more LTE modems. HP has other ideas, though. It isn’t going to settle for the scraps in a negligible consumer market, having thrown the kitchen sink at its business-focussed Elite X3, and built a virtualisation service to pipe over the x86 apps that the phone can’t run natively. It’s hard to imagine what “category innovation” Microsoft can bring to the market, since all phone makers are stuck for ideas. Perhaps the Microsoft Surface Phone will be magnetic, and collect up all the stray earpieces your iPhone 7-toting friends have lost. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 49 Comments More from The Register Microsoft Azure sets up shop in France Bonjour, mes fluffy white amis 22 Comments What strange madness is this?

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. WASHINGTON (CNN) Donald Trump might not have revealed state secrets, but his controversial description Wednesday night of the agents who gave him his recent intelligence briefings still caused waves. At an NBC commander in chief forum with the presidential candidates, Trump said that the intelligence briefers had indicated through "body language" that they were "not happy" because "our leaders did not follow what they were recommending." In fact, he said, President Barack Obama and his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, had done "exactly the opposite" of what the intelligence community recommended. The remarks left intelligence professionals scratching their heads and Republicans scrambling to interpret their candidate's remarks -- because if they're true, they mark a radical departure from decades of standard practice. Since the intelligence community began briefing presidential candidates in the 1950s, a central pillar of their approach has been to focus on explaining global situations, not offering advice about them, according to David Priess, a former intelligence briefer for President George W. Bush. "Wildly unlikely, let me tell you," Priess said of Trump's description of his briefings. "Intel briefers do not make policy recommendations. Period." A national security expert familiar with the process said Trump's briefers would not have expressed displeasure in any way. That expert asked to speak anonymously because of political sensitivities. Intelligence analysts and briefers present assessments of global situations to try to reduce uncertainties for an administration making policy decisions, Priess and other former briefers said. They do not recommend a course of action. Doling out policy advice, Priess said, is "the third rail of intelligence -- you don't touch it." The senior-level intelligence teams that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper set up to handle the candidates' briefings are career military and intelligence officers, not political appointees, and wouldn't make such a "rookie mistake," he said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comment. In contrast, the picture Trump painted seemed quite different. In a commander in chief forum on NBC, Trump said he received briefings from experts on Iraq, Iran and Russia, and that one thing had "shocked" him. "It just seems to me that what they said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry -- who is another total disaster -- did exactly the opposite," he said, mentioning the current secretary of state. He went on to say that he learned "that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts ... said to do." "I could tell," Trump added. "I'm pretty good with the body language. I could tell they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending." Trump advisor Mike Flynn, who attended the briefings with the candidate, supported Trump's comments in an interview with NBC. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said he also saw briefers convey displeasure with White House policy. "I sure did ... in a very specific way," said Flynn, who added that intelligence officers made distinctions between their briefing points and White House policy, according to NBC. Some Republicans asked about the comments made by their party's presidential nominee took issue -- if cautiously -- with his characterization. "Typically, I will say, with intelligence briefings they really attempt not to give you a direction," Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told CNN's Jake Tapper. Corker complained that Tapper's question put him in a "personality referee position, which is not a position that I should be in or want to be in." He then echoed Priess' point that intelligence briefers "try to keep it to the facts of the intelligence gathering they've put together." Priess said it's possible, given that Trump has no prior experience with intelligence briefings, that the officers describing global hotspots said "something that he interpreted as a policy recommendation." The national security expert said it's also possible that the analysis presented by the briefers didn't align with the president's narrative. The source offered as an example Obama's 2014 reference to ISIS as a "JV team," when many in the intelligence community regarded it as a strong and growing threat. The other interpretation, Priess said, was that Trump is "seeking to politicize intel briefings he's received in a way that no other candidate has ever done." Trump's claims about his briefings weren't his first apparent inconsistency on intelligence matters. At Wednesday night's forum, Trump said he had "great respect for the people" who delivered his intel briefings. A day earlier, on FOX News' "Fox and Friends," Trump had been asked if he trusted intelligence. "Not so much from the people that have been doing it for our country," Trump said. Referring to the previous decade as "catastrophic," Trump said, "I won't use them, because they've made such bad decisions." Trump also took aim at the top tier of US military leaders Wednesday night, saying they'd been "reduced to rubble" by Obama. Asked about his plan to have generals submit a proposal to defeat ISIS when he's declared he knows more about the terror group than they do, Trump said, "Well, they'll probably be different generals, to be honest with you. I mean, I'm looking at the generals." A President Trump could do that, according to retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a former intelligence officer in the Air Force. But he'd face some hurdles as president that wouldn't exist for a CEO firing employees, he added. There are historical precedents for presidents handing their generals pink slips, but Trump wouldn't be able to simply slot in replacements on his own: Generals have to be approved by the Senate. In an institution like the military where leaders pick their replacements, Leighton said that a new face could be "hard to sell to the rank and file -- you have to consider morale and the ability of an organization like the Army or Air Force or Navy or Marine Corps to fall in line behind somebody who may not have the credentials they want." Leighton added, "It could be potentially disruptive to the services." Copyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion MacBook Pro 2016 vs. Razer Blade Stealth: Clash of High-End Laptops; Features and Specs Compared By Christian Ver Marcelo Sep 9, 2016 | 12:52 AM When it comes to premium high-end laptops, the MacBook Pro is a surefire frontrunner. However, there's the unpopular Razer lineup that only the gaming population probably knows about that boasts beast specs. How will the upcoming MacBook Pro 2016 stack up against the Razer Blade Stealth? Design and Form Factor The inconspicuous and iconic design of the MacBook Pro will make its way to the 2016 version. Shallower curves around the edges would give Apple's laptop a sleeker overall look and feel, along with the high-class chassis it boasts. The slightly heavier and bulkier body of the Razer Blade Stealth is built to be solid and sturdy. The black, sleek design rightfully earns the stealth branding, which houses the powerful internal specs of this gaming ultrabook. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Hardware The MacBook Pro 2016 is heavily rumored to sport Intel's sixth generation i5 or i7 Skylake processors. The graphics will be powered by the Polaris lineup from AMD. Novelty features such as the touch-enabled OLED strip atop the keyboard and Touch ID functionality are also integrated to the new MacBook iteration. As the Razer Blade Stealth is already confirmed, specs are already detailed. The Intel Core i7 also makes an appearance, complete with up to 16GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD storage. The Razer Blade Stealth also attaches to Razer Cores, boosting its graphics to the powerful Nvidia GTX 1080 for optimal gaming performance. Display The upcoming MacBook Pro 2016 is expected to support a Retina display. The 13-inch variant comes with a 2560 x 1600 resolution, while the 15-inch model comes with a 2880 x 1800 one. It is also said to be equipped with the True Tone technology that adjusts screen color based on ambient lighting. The smaller 12.5 inches of screen size of the Razer Blade Stealth is no slouch though. It is a touchscreen capable display and comes in two variants. The base model comes at 2K resolution with 2560 x 1440 resolution, and the 4K model comes in at a whopping 3840 x 2160 resolution, perfect for gaming. Battery The current MacBook Pro lineup already offers up to 10 hours of battery life for the 13-inch Retina version, and up to 8 hours for the 15-inch model. With the introduction of the power-efficient Skylake processor and software optimization through macOS Sierra, battery life is expected to last longer with the 2016 MacBook Pro. The 53.6 watt-hour battery of the Razer Blade Stealth seems to promise great battery life for the laptop. However, with a very high resolution screen, intense performance, and poor power management by the Windows 10, actual battery life clocks in at only about 4 to 5 hours. Pricing The current MacBook Pro starts at $1099, so the next generation MacBook Pro lineup is expected to stay within the same range. However, the Razer Blade Stealth starts retailing at $999.99, with incremental upgrades for additional SSD storage and display upgrade.

The platform is now making it easier than ever for local businesses to tap into that worldwide audience. Facebook has updated its “lookalike audiences” targeting tool to allow businesses to easily reach people in new countries that are similar to their existing customers. In the past, business pages would have to manually target international users with detailed analytics, now Facebook automatically does the hard part. Facebook is also expanding its location-targeting tools with a focus on the global. Business users now have the broad option of setting their ad targets to reach users “worldwide,” or by region (i.e. Europe). Facebook also allows pages to set the ad-targeting field by free trade area. Facebook claims that by automating a process that previously relied on manual “guess work” it has freed up businesses to “explore new markets.” Related: Facebook fine-tuning app install ads, allowing better targeting by developers Not only does Facebook want to help businesses create ads, it is also offering to teach them about potential global customers. To this end, the company has produced a document known as the “Cross-Border Business Handbook,” which is available to download for free for business users. The publication includes data on markets including the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Brazil, Canada, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia, and anecdotal information on how businesses “are successfully using Facebook and Instagram to grow around the world.” The platform is also hosting online webinars that deal with business trends, ad analytics, and global audiences. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg shared a characteristically personal message about the new tools via her Facebook profile. Referring to her great-grandparents’ local paint store in New York, which relied on word-of-mouth marketing, she claimed that technology (like Facebook) can now power businesses to go global like never before. “Today we’re launching new solutions to make it even easier for businesses to reach the people who matter to them,” said Sandberg. “Instead of expanding country-by-country, businesses can use these tools to grow customer-by-customer – whether they’re around the block or across the globe.”   This article was originally posted on Digital Trends Content provided by INFORMATIONAL DISCLAIMER The information contained on or provided through this site is intended for general consumer understanding and education only and is not intended to be and is not a substitute for professional financial or accounting advice.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 9, 2016 at 8:15AM An Intel server processor. Image source: Intel. Earlier this year, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) launched Xeon E5 and Xeon E7 processors based on its Broadwell architecture, and built using the company's 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. These processors offered improved performance and power efficiency, and according to Intel CFO Stacy Smith, are expected to help drive up the company's server processor average selling prices during the second half of 2016. Although there's obviously reason to be enthusiastic about the ramp of the Broadwell server parts, I believe that next year's product line should be even more exciting. Here's why. New platforms, new cores, and enhanced manufacturing technology The Broadwell-based server chips that Intel recently launched don't bring with them a new platform. The chips themselves get faster, but they plug into the same motherboards as the prior-generation Haswell-EP parts. The next-generation server chips are expected to use an all-new platform, known as the Purley platform. By virtue of the new platform/motherboards, Intel will be able to offer up a wide range of enhancements, which you can read about here. However, while the new platform is nice, the enhanced performance that will come as a result of the combination of a new processor architecture, as well as an improved manufacturing technology, should prove quite attractive. The first processor that the Purley platform will support is known as Skylake-EP. Skylake-EP is expected to use a new processor core known as Skylake Xeon, which is a beefed-up version of the Skylake processor core found in the company's current personal-computer processors. The new architecture alone should bring performance and power efficiency benefits. However, there's another thing that should further bolster the value proposition of Skylake-EP: an improved manufacturing technology. At its developer conference last month, Intel disclosed that it had developed a new version of its 14-nanometer technology, which it markets as 14-nanometer+, that performs 12% better than the original 14-nanometer technology. It's a virtual certainty that the new Skylake server chips will be manufactured using 14-nanometer+, which should allow the chipmaker to wring out additional performance beyond what the new architectures alone can provide. New chips could drive volume, average selling-price growth The introduction of the new platform could drive, perhaps, more exciting unit growth than this year's new processor-on-an-existing platform will be able to. Additionally, I expect that Intel will continue its practice of introducing additional higher-end processor models in order to try to continue the trend of its customers buying an increasingly rich product mix -- which you can read about here. So, for 2017, I'm optimistic that Intel's data-center group will benefit from fairly robust unit demand for a new platform. I also think that the company's average selling-price growth should continue. When will these sales kick in? The most recent leaks suggest that Intel is planning to launch the Purley platform in the first half of 2017. An optimistic release date for these new processors would be exactly a year after the Broadwell-based server parts launched -- late March/early April of 2017 -- but I wouldn't be surprised if it took Intel a little longer to roll the platform out. From a timing perspective, I believe that investors will have to wait until the second half of 2017 for the revenue impact to be felt from the new product cycle. However, once it kicks in, I think Intel could be looking at a nice acceleration in revenue and unit growth. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

The Washington Post has more here: “North Korea defiantly celebrated its fifth nuclear test Friday, claiming that it can now make warheads small enough to fit onto a missile and warning its ‘enemies’ — specifically, the United States — that it has the ability to counter any attack. The test appeared to be much bigger than North Korea's previous detonations. … Friday's test underscored the fact that Kim Jong Un's regime was continuing to make progress on its nuclear and missile programs despite waves of international sanctions and condemnation.” Story Continued Below The test occurred just hours after President Barack Obama wrapped up his tour of Asia, The Wall Street Journal noted, underscoring the U.S. struggle to rein in the growing threat from Kim Jong Un. And the condemnation was swift from across the globe, as South Korea’s president called the detonation an act of "fanatic recklessness,” according to The Associated Press. COMING ATTRACTIONS — RYAN EYES ‘MINI-BUSES’ TO MOVE SPENDING BILLS, reports our colleagues Rachael Bade and Ben Weyl: “House Speaker Paul Ryan is putting out feelers on a possible strategy to fund the government next year: Think small. In private conversations with his members over the past few days, the Wisconsin Republican has emphasized his distaste for passing a massive trillion-dollar omnibus — and his preference for advancing smaller packages of spending measures if they can’t get one-off bills finished.” — NDAA NEGOTIATIONS YIELD PROGRESS, BUT STILL NO TIMELINE FOR THE END ZONE, we write with Connor O’Brien: “Following their first meeting since returning from the summer recess, the leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees see progress toward a compromise defense policy bill, but no timeline for a final resolution. The ‘Big Four,’ the chairmen and ranking committee members who met Thursday, have said they hope to finish the National Defense Authorization Act before the start of the new 2017 fiscal year on Oct. 1, but a slew of policy and funding issues still remain unresolved in reconciling the House and Senate bills.” “Negotiators are still wading through a morass of issues on the must-pass bill, including major overhauls of the Pentagon's acquisition system, command structure and military health system — all different in the House and Senate bills. … Lawmakers also haven't solved the most contentious issue — whether to tap the Pentagon's war account to fund base defense priorities.” — FLYNN TO THE HILL: Retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a top military adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, is coming to Capitol Hill this month to speak at a briefing for congressional staff, according to an invitation obtained by POLITICO. Flynn, the former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is speaking at an off-the-record gathering for congressional staff on Sept. 23, hosted by the Defense Forum Foundation. — NUNES EYEING PUBLIC INTEL HEARING: House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) says he wants to hold a hearing in the coming weeks to examine the relationship between the director of national intelligence and the Pentagon. After mentioning the idea at a panel discussion Thursday, Nunes told reporters he envisioned the session would explore the “role of DNI with DoD and some of the challenges they’ve been unable to deal with, whether it be CentCom or others,” referring to the allegations of cooked intelligence from Central Command. HAPPY FRIDAY AND WELCOME TO MORNING DEFENSE, where we’re noting the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks two days early. There will be remembrances today and into the weekend on Capitol Hill and at the Pentagon, as well as up in New York City (More on the president’s plans below.). Keep the tips, pitches and feedback coming at jherb@politico.com, and follow on Twitter @jeremyherb, @morningdefense and @politicopro. Pro subscribers: Are you getting all the content you want? Make sure your keywords are up to date and customized via your settings page at http://politico.pro/1iDALk9. HAPPENING TODAY — HOUSE TO VOTE ON SAUDI 9/11 BILL: The House is scheduled to vote today on a bill allowing the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia. As our colleagues noted earlier in the week, the controversial legislation is opposed by the White House, and the president is expected to veto the measure, known as "Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act," or JASTA. The Senate passed it unanimously in May. HAPPENING THIS WEEKEND — OBAMA TO SPEAK AT PENTAGON 9/11 CEREMONY: The president will speak at a memorial observance ceremony on Sunday at the Pentagon for the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, according to a White House official. Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford will also attend. UP NEXT WEEK — CARTER RETURNS TO SILICON VALLEY, AND SPEAKS AT THE PRESS CLUB: The defense secretary returns home from Norway today, but he’s got another busy week lined up beginning with a trip west on Monday to the Bay Area in California and Austin, Texas. In Silicon Valley, he’ll meet with leaders of the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, before he travels up the Peninsula to speak at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco. On Wednesday, he’s in Austin, where he’ll return to the Capital Factory technology incubator and “provide an update on DIUX,” according to the Pentagon. The Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer said this week that a new DIUX office was coming soon, and Austin is the likely spot after Silicon Valley and Boston. When he returns to Washington, Carter has a speech slated for Thursday at the National Press Club. The title? "Dulling the Edge: How Congress Risks Undermining the Finest Fighting Force the World Has Ever Known,” which a congressional source noted sounds like it’s following closely to the Pentagon’s internal strategy blueprint we reported on earlier this week. MORNING D TRIVIA: Today’s question comes from last month’s winner R.M. Beauchesne: In September 1862, President Abraham Lincoln conducted an “instant inquiry,” with witnesses and a transcript, that resulted in the dismissal of an officer. Who was this officer and why did Lincoln dismiss him? Bonus question: What famous person was this officer related to? 2016 WATCH — GARY JOHNSON HAS AN ALEPPO GAFFE, our colleagues Louis Nelson and Daniel Strauss have more here: “Asked what he would do about the Syrian city of Aleppo, the region at the center of that nation’s civil war and refugee crisis, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson responded by asking, ‘what is Aleppo?’ ‘What would you do if you were elected about Aleppo?’ MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ panelist Mike Barnicle asked the former New Mexico governor during an in-studio interview Thursday morning. “‘And what is Aleppo?’ Johnson responded. ‘You’re kidding,’ a stunned Barnicle replied, to which Johnson answered that he was not. Barnicle explained to the Libertarian candidate that Aleppo is ‘the epicenter of the refugee crisis’ in Syria, giving Johnson enough information to finally answer the question. … Johnson's campaign released a formal statement later Thursday morning where the Libertarian nominee said he ‘blanked.’” TRUMP AND THE GENERALS — SHOT AT TOP BRASS RANKLES MILITARY CIRCLES, reports our colleague Bryan Bender: “Donald Trump's broadside against the top military brass is drawing warnings of a crisis in civilian-military relations should he become commander in chief and begin bypassing generals and admirals now serving under President Barack Obama. ‘It would be unprecedented,’ said Mackubin Thomas Owens, a retired Marine colonel and former instructor at the Naval War College. ‘This would be making the military into a partisan prize.’” — INTEL OFFICIALS CONCERNS WITH TRUMP’S BRIEFING READOUT, TOO, writes POLITICO’s Sarah Wheaton: “Donald Trump’s decision to offer up a politicized readout of his confidential national security briefings has set off alarm bells in the intelligence community, with some high-profile former officials warning the Republican nominee crossed a ‘red line.’” — WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BRIEFINGS? NBC News reports that Flynn got heated with the briefers: “Four sources with knowledge of the briefing — including two intelligence officials who spoke to people in the room — said Flynn repeatedly interrupted the briefers until New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie intervened. Both Christie and Flynn denied the officials' version of events, with Flynn calling the report "total b__s___" and Christie calling it ‘a complete work of fiction.’” WAR REPORT — MOSUL OFFENSIVE TO BEGIN SOON, reports The Wall Street Journal: “The new commander of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State said he thinks the battle to retake Mosul, the jihadist group’s last major Iraqi stronghold, will begin in coming weeks. The commander, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, said late Wednesday, however, that the push to reclaim Raqqa, the Sunni extremist group’s self-declared capital in neighboring Syria, was on hold.” — POLITICO PRO Q&A: NAVY SECRETARY RAY MABUS: “Ray Mabus is nearing the end of the line as Navy secretary, a post he’s held since the start of the Obama administration in 2009. The former Democratic governor of Mississippi has navigated rough waters on Capitol Hill and several major military scandals — and emerged with a firm belief that he’ll leave the Navy in better shape than he found it. Its ship count is on the rise, jobs previously closed to women have been opened and it’s on track to get a large portion of its fuel from alternative sources. “And yet Mabus is still fighting internal battles, seeking to fend off attempts by Pentagon leaders to intervene in shipbuilding programs — including Defense Secretary Ash Carter’s order to scale back long-term procurement of the troubled Littoral Combat Ship. In an interview with POLITICO’s Austin Wright in his Pentagon office, Mabus discussed the LCS, his legacy and more.” The full Q&A is here, for Pros.

The advance purchase of construction materials will mean reduced construction costs and greater efficiency in construction.

A: You can buy a Yankee Stadium hot dog in October. Mets fans– I’m from Texas and we’re football not baseball– and I'm sure you guys tell a different version. But the logic behind the humor applies to a lot of technologies and tech companies in our industry– even if staying power is measured not in seasons but in years. Sports teams or tech teams– the best have to constantly reinvent their offerings if they don’t want to find themselves irrelevant in October, much less beyond. The weeks leading up to Labor Day are not exactly laden with new product introductions in this industry. (Are they, in any industry?) So it was refreshing to have a pretty heavy player in the digital signage industry weigh in last week, in personal press briefings– with an impressive revamp of pretty much their entire lineup of media players (and that from a company that was not behind in any technology race I know of). In fact BrightSign has been at the forefront for a while. If that sounds like press release-speak, apologies, but BrightSign did come out with the first real 4K digital signage media player (a few years back), and you’ll see there devices not just out in the field but in many of the big display manufacturer and display distributors’ booths at InfoComm and Digital Signage Expo. In a private briefing on the week before Labor Day, BrightSign’s CEO Jeff Hastings explained how his company has always tried to do things differently–not just take Intel mother boards and create PC-based media players for digital signage, but provide a more complete solution. When I asked Hastings how it today’s landscape were there are so many media players, and where so many now even claim to do 4K, how can the novice user tell them apart? “A lot of people claim a lot of things”, said Hasting. “But you need to test those devices– very few meet the specs they claim. For 4K for example, some do 4K with HDMI 1.4 not 2.0. And most are consumer class devices, not commercial grade. Remember, in the cost of ownership of a digital signage network, a lot of the cost is the ongoing maintenance including labor costs. So you really need to look at TCO, look at the failure rate of devices. Labor costs on replacing media players that fail will eat up budget very fast." Of course, robust build is not readily apparent in the specs of a product. That can only be discerned in the field or from reputation and word of mouth. But even beyond that kind of good reputation and track record, great specs stand out for some media player manufacturers, and BrightSign is up there. Without going over BrightSign’s milestones over the past few years, cut to the chase as we roll into falling leaves, the MLB playoffs, and (thank god) football season. BrightSign has some serious news on the product front, doing total solution– not just hardware, bare bones device, but some sophisticated processing like doing HTML rendering in the software. And now, HTML5 is supported by every player in their line. Also, H.265 decoding– necessary for 4K– but they are doing that in the other products as well. HDR ability now, not promises for the future, with 10bit color. All their players, less than an inch thick– tuck them right behind the screen (thin mounts for displays are all the rage, so you need thin media players). Here’s the Press Release from BrightSign: BrightSign Unveils Complete Product Refresh Including Major Advances in Digital Signage Technology LOS GATOS, CA – (September 7, 2016) – BrightSign, LLC announced the first major overhaul of the company’s players in nearly two years. BrightSign’s lineup of digital signage media players has been completely redesigned and will ship with a portfolio of technology updates including an M.2 interface for Wi-Fi antennae or a solid-state drive (M.2 SSD). BrightSign’s free BrightAuthor software and the BrightSign Network are also updated with advanced digital signage features for enterprise-level performance. “The digital signage marketplace is evolving rapidly. For that reason it’s important that our technology solutions not only support signage as it’s being used today, but that they also work flawlessly many years from now,” said Jeff Hastings, BrightSign’s CEO. “Customers can install our players today knowing that BrightSign software, hardware and networking solutions will serve them well in the future as they implement new and exciting digital signage features.” BrightAuthor software v4.5 will enable a new feature on the HD, XD and XT players called Mosaic Mode, which allows a multitude of lower-resolution videos to be played in multiple video zones that add up to the total resolution decoding power of the player’s video decoder. CEA HDR 10 is supported on all players delivering a much higher contrast ratio and much wider color palette, complementing the higher resolution of 4K displays. And the ability to real-time encode and stream content from the player to another end-point or device is now incorporated in XD and XT players. B-Deploy, a powerful new feature that allows customers to set up and deploy from tens to thousands of players all at once, can be used with the BrightSign Network, a BrightSign Partner CMS, or an on-premise secure corporate LAN with internet access. BrightSign Network, including the new B-Deploy feature, now supports media and player tagging for highly targeted content distribution to large networks of players. Each of the seven new players boasts a sleek new industrial design with a very slim profile under 1” in height that makes it possible to place the players virtually anywhere. All new players integrate H.265 (HEVC playback features) and HTML5. The top two product lines (XD and XT) offer a hardware-accelerated H.265 video decoding engine capable of 4K HDR 10-bit video playback. BrightSign’s portfolio of digital signage media players is now comprised of seven players spanning four product lines: BrightSign LS: Affordable, Compact and Fully Featured BrightSign’s LS423 ($250) is a fully featured, commercial-grade player offering a superior alternative to consumer devices often chosen for price-sensitive digital signage installations. Based on the award-winning BrightSign HD platform, BrightSign LS423 delivers signature reliability and affordability, with a robust feature set including H.265 Full HD video decoding, a basic HTML5 engine, USB 2.0 type C, and networking. BrightSign HD: Updated Classic with Mainstream Performance BrightSign’s new HD models are updated with advanced technology that delivers power and performance for mainstream applications at a very affordable cost. Both the HD223 ($350) and HD1023 ($450) offer hardware-accelerated HTML5 engine and 1080p60 decode, along with BrightSign’s highly reliable media-handling platform and signature ease of use. All HD models support Gigabit Ethernet, as well as robust interactive controls and dynamic live content features. BrightSign XD: True 4K Playback and Advanced Performance BrightSign’s two new XD players are capable of decoding either two 1080p60 videos or a single 4K video and a single 1080p60 video simultaneously. Both the XD233 ($450) and XD1033 ($550) have Gigabit Ethernet and offer an advanced hardware-accelerated HTML5 engine. BrightSign XT: State-of-the-Art Technology with Enterprise Performance The BrightSign XT243 ($550) and XT1143 ($650) offer unsurpassed performance with the company’s fastest HTML and graphics engine and the most powerful CPU. This state-of-the-art technology for enterprise level digital signage installations supports dual video decode of one 4K and one 1080p60 video simultaneously. The hardware-accelerated HTML5 engine enables flawless playback of multiple modular HTML5 assets including CSS animations, Web GL and swipe/gesture interactivity. Both XT models support PoE+ and Gigabit Ethernet, and the XT1143 offers HDMI-in for Live TV playback.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending MacBook Pro Nintendo Switch Google Pixel iOS 10.1 PS4 Pro Early Black Friday Deals Reviews Origin Millennium review Origin Millennium review By Kevin Lee PC & Mac desktops  Gloriously overpowered for modern gaming Shares Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict The Origin Millennium is built for maximum customization with a ton of space for high-end components, cooling and a flexible motherboard mounting system. For Immense power Customizable RGB lighting Supports many motherboard alignments Against Immense price Big for a mid-tower Rattly plastic shell There's been a perfect storm of new computing hardware, thanks to the introduction of Nvidia's Pascal graphics and a new series of Intel Broadwell-E processors. Even having just one of these parts in your PC would translate to exponentially greater performance and higher frames rates. Putting them together would spawn a beast powerful enough to take on the next generation of virtual reality and 4K games released over the next decade. Luckily for us, Origin is exactly the type of company to pull off this sort of madness, packing all of this power into its updated Millennium gaming desktop. Standing at nearly two feet tall, it's a literally tower of power inside and out. However, with a $6K price tag attached, it's a little hard to justify the price even for this much overindulgence in power. Design Although Origin classifies the Millennium as a mid-tower PC, it might be a half-size above its weight class. The case is absolutely massive, measuring in at 21.44 inches tall and 24.8-inches deep. This is something you'd best leave sitting on the ground, and even then you'll need a good chunk of floor space for it to actually fit. Once you get over the immense size of the case, you can't but help to admire the magnificence of this beast. The front of the case is shaped like the prow of some mighty spaceship, and Origin has developed a sleek enclosure with curves and angles in all the right places. The Millennium is also designed to be a showpiece with a large side window to display all of the components and a long strip of LEDs to light up the interior in almost any color. You can also pre-set patterns like strobing, color shifting and, our personal favorite, a flowing rainbow of colors that loops around the case and across the front logo. Origin even throws Millennium buyers a remote designed just for controlling the lights. On one hand, it's convenient if you want to throw on some mood lighting on a whim. But, the remote doesn't offer nearly the same level of customization as a dedicated software solution. More than meets the eye Beyond the lights and large window, the Millennium is a surprisingly understated gaming PC. The power buttons, fan controller and front I/O are all tucked away into a small nook at the top of the chassis. Meanwhile, the front of the case features a swing out door to reveal five 5.25-inch bays and an optional hard drive cage with six hot-swappable bays just waiting to be filled with terabytes of storage. The Origin Millennium has a stealthy design to be sure, but the Maingear Shift is still the slyest machine we've ever reviewed with an all-aluminum chassis to boot. By comparison, our blacked out PC tower features a plastic shell that feels a bit flimsier. Thankfully, though, it's underpinned by a sturdy metal frame. Origin's chassis also comes with variable mounting support, which basically means you can orient the motherboard however you want. It might sound like an excessive level of customization, but it adds nothing to the price and no other boutique PC maker offers the same service. Otherwise, only a few modular PC cases from Cooler Master and BeQuiet offer this same level of customization. And as for usefulness; an inverted configuration (like ours) gives you a right-side facing window as opposed to the traditional left hand window. Meanwhile, a 90-degree configuration helps the video cards exhaust heat through the top of the case – and there's the option of combining these two methods together. Spec Sheet Here is the Origin Millennium configuration sent to TechRadar for review: Case: Origin Millennium mid-tower CPU: 3.0GHz Intel Core i7-6950X (deca-core, 25MB cache, up to 3.5GHz with turbo boost) Graphics: 2 x EVGA GTX 1080 Founder Edition (8GB GDDR5X, SLI) RAM: 16GB Kingston HyperX DDR4 (4 x 4GB, 2,666MHz) Motherboard: ASUS X99 Deluxe II Power Supply: 850 Watt EVGA SuperNOVA G2 Storage: 256GB Samsung 950 PRO (NVMe M.2); 6TB Western Digital Red (5,400 RPM) Optical drive: 16X Blu-ray Burner Ports: 8 x USB 3.0, 3 x USB 3.1 Type-A, 1 USB-C, 4 x USB 2.0, 1 optical audio out, 5 x audio jacks, 1 headphone jack, 6 x DisplayPort, 2 x HDMI Connectivity: 802.11ac Asus Wi-Fi GO! module; Bluetooth 4.0 Operating system: Windows 10 Home (64-bit) Weight: 30 pounds (starting weight) Size: 9.75 x 24.8 x 21.44 inches (W x D x H) This fully-loaded configuration you see listed above goes for a heaping $6,168 (about £4,680, AU$8,020). But, keep in mind this is a monster machine that is ready to go out of the box and precisely overclocked to its limits – that is, if you went for the added service. From hard drives to liquid-cooling and wire work, you can pretty much configure the Origin Millennium anyway you'd like. And, if you want to do it yourself, there's also plenty of room to upgrade this machine. Only one of the six hard drive bays were occupied and above the hot-swap bay is another five 5.25-inch bays. Plus, if you really want to try your hand at water-cooling, you'll find the space you need and mounting points all over. Benchmarks Here's how the Origin Millennium performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 61,029; Sky Diver: 74,123; Fire Strike: 28,817 Cinebench CPU: 2,205 points; Graphics: 191 fps GeekBench: GeekBench: 4,299 (single-core); 39,423 (multi-core) PCMark 8 (Home Test): 4,142 points The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 143 fps; (1080p, Low): 264 fps GTA V: (1080p, Ultra): 100 fps; (1080p, Low): 185 fps Unsurprisingly, the Origin Millennium smashed records in our benchmark tests in spectacular fashion. We're used to seeing multi-core GeekBench scores of 16K to 18K, but the 3.0GHz Intel Core i7-6950X chip achieved a 39,423 point result. That's approaching double the 25,257-point performance of the Haswell-E chip we tested in the Maingear Shift. The top-of-the-line CPU is absolutely overkill for just gaming. So, on top of wrecking multiplayer matches, you'll be able stream and even render video at the same time, stressing the CPU a tiny bit. The twin Nvidia GTX 1080s also gave us the extra oomph we needed to play anything we wanted at 4K and on Ultra settings well above 60 frames per second (fps). Virtual reality gaming also went without a hitch, and we bet these GPUs would be powerful enough to drive the next generation of headsets, too. Final verdict The Origin Millennium is one of the most customizable PCs in the computing world. Beyond picking out the specs exactly as you want, the flexible motherboard mount makes it simple to setup the PC for your space with the option of top-down airflow or a right-side window. Other than it being an extra-large mid-tower and feeling a little chintzy, we have no qualms with Origin's mid-sized gaming monster. The Millennium is an attractive looking PC that gives you plenty of room for upgrades and puts all the controls within easy reach. And, if you've configured it for maximum power like us, it's gloriously overpowered for even the most demanding games today.

Reuters/Mike Segar If reports are to be believed, the delay in the release date of Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 is due to Microsoft’s decision to include the much-talked about Intel Kaby Lake processors. The phone did not make an appearance at the IFA 2016 event in Berlin, Germany. Now, it is rumoured to be released in 2017. There is a dearth of information from Microsoft. The company has not released any official statement regarding the Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 and why it has been delayed. However, as the Kaby Lake processor is expected to arrive by the end of 2016, the Surface Phone could well be made available by March 2017. The Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 may be launched along with other highly-anticipated devices, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2. The Surface Phone is expected to sport some pretty top-class specs and features. Tech enthusiasts believe that the phone will have a large display, huge storage space, big fat RAM and Carl Zeiss lens, reports Mobile & Apps. With a 5.7-inch screen and AMOLED display panel, the Microsoft Surface Phone will reportedly be launched in three variants depending on storage capacity, RAM and processor. The basic model will have a 3GB RAM and 32GB storage whereas another will come packed with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage. The third variant may have an 8GB RAM and 500GB internal storage. The rumoured Carl Zeiss lens in the Microsoft Surface Phone 2016's 21MP rear camera and a front camera of 8MP will include a triple-LED flash. There is also a possibility of a USB Type-C port for rapid charging and super-fast data transfers. The Microsoft Surface Phone 2016 is expected to run on Windows 10 codenamed Redstone 2. It will provide users with an amazing user interface. The base variant may be priced at US$700 (AU$916) whereas the premium variant could be purchased for US$1,099 (AU$1,440).

At an NBC commander in chief forum with the presidential candidates, Trump said that the intelligence briefers had indicated through “body language” that they were “not happy” because “our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.” In fact, he said, President Barack Obama and his former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, had done “exactly the opposite” of what the intelligence community recommended. The remarks left intelligence professionals scratching their heads and Republicans scrambling to interpret their candidate’s remarks — because if they’re true, they mark a radical departure from decades of standard practice. Since the intelligence community began briefing presidential candidates in the 1950s, a central pillar of their approach has been to focus on explaining global situations, not offering advice about them, according to David Priess, a former intelligence briefer for President George W. Bush. “Wildly unlikely, let me tell you,” Priess said of Trump’s description of his briefings. “Intel briefers do not make policy recommendations. Period.” A national security expert familiar with the process said Trump’s briefers would not have expressed displeasure in any way. That expert asked to speak anonymously because of political sensitivities. Intelligence analysts and briefers present assessments of global situations to try to reduce uncertainties for an administration making policy decisions, Priess and other former briefers said. They do not recommend a course of action. Doling out policy advice, Priess said, is “the third rail of intelligence — you don’t touch it.” The senior-level intelligence teams that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper set up to handle the candidates’ briefings are career military and intelligence officers, not political appointees, and wouldn’t make such a “rookie mistake,” he said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence refused to comment. In contrast, the picture Trump painted seemed quite different. In a commander in chief forum on NBC, Trump said he received briefings from experts on Iraq, Iran and Russia, and that one thing had “shocked” him. “It just seems to me that what they said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry — who is another total disaster — did exactly the opposite,” he said, mentioning the current secretary of state. He went on to say that he learned “that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts … said to do.” “I could tell,” Trump added. “I’m pretty good with the body language. I could tell they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.” Trump advisor Mike Flynn, who attended the briefings with the candidate, supported Trump’s comments in an interview with NBC. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said he also saw briefers convey displeasure with White House policy. “I sure did … in a very specific way,” said Flynn, who added that intelligence officers made distinctions between their briefing points and White House policy, according to NBC. Some Republicans asked about the comments made by their party’s presidential nominee took issue — if cautiously — with his characterization. “Typically, I will say, with intelligence briefings they really attempt not to give you a direction,” Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told CNN’s Jake Tapper. Corker complained that Tapper’s question put him in a “personality referee position, which is not a position that I should be in or want to be in.” He then echoed Priess’ point that intelligence briefers “try to keep it to the facts of the intelligence gathering they’ve put together.” Priess said it’s possible, given that Trump has no prior experience with intelligence briefings, that the officers describing global hotspots said “something that he interpreted as a policy recommendation.” The national security expert said it’s also possible that the analysis presented by the briefers didn’t align with the President’s narrative. The source offered as an example Obama’s 2014 reference to ISIS as a “JV team,” when many in the intelligence community regarded it as a strong and growing threat. The other interpretation, Priess said, was that Trump is “seeking to politicize intel briefings he’s received in a way that no other candidate has ever done.” Trump’s claims about his briefings weren’t his first apparent inconsistency on intelligence matters. At Wednesday night’s forum, Trump said he had “great respect for the people” who delivered his intel briefings. A day earlier, on FOX News’ “Fox and Friends,” Trump had been asked if he trusted intelligence. “Not so much from the people that have been doing it for our country,” Trump said. Referring to the previous decade as “catastrophic,” Trump said, “I won’t use them, because they’ve made such bad decisions.” Trump also took aim at the top tier of US military leaders Wednesday night, saying they’d been “reduced to rubble” by Obama. Asked about his plan to have generals submit a proposal to defeat ISIS when he’s declared he knows more about the terror group than they do, Trump said, “Well, they’ll probably be different generals, to be honest with you. I mean, I’m looking at the generals.” A President Trump could do that, according to retired Col. Cedric Leighton, a former intelligence officer in the Air Force. But he’d face some hurdles as president that wouldn’t exist for a CEO firing employees, he added. There are historical precedents for presidents handing their generals pink slips, but Trump wouldn’t be able to simply slot in replacements on his own: Generals have to be approved by the Senate. In an institution like the military where leaders pick their replacements, Leighton said that a new face could be “hard to sell to the rank and file — you have to consider morale and the ability of an organization like the Army or Air Force or Navy or Marine Corps to fall in line behind somebody who may not have the credentials they want.” Leighton added, “It could be potentially disruptive to the services.” On Russian TV, Trump says it's 'unlikely' Putin trying to sway election Democrats hit GOP candidate in Nevada over Trump support Related Posts Ted Cruz announces 2016 presidential bid House honors Selma marchers, stalled on Voting Rights Act Biden backs Clinton; VP and Warren call Trump ‘racist’ Donald Trump admits using aliases to Jimmy Kimmel, denies acting as publicist Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Slow Growth in Productivity: What Do We Know About "Why?" and "What Is To Be Done?"—Long J. Bradford DeLong :: U.C. Berkeley, NBER, and WCEG :: 2016-09-09 :: http://tinyurl.com/dl20160909b | https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-productivity-puzzle-how-can-we-speed-up-the-growth-of-the-economy/ The productivity puzzle: How can we speed up the growth of the economy? What Are We Talking About Here? Perceived poor performance of the American economy. Measurement issues are fascinating and important, but largely orthogonal to perceived poor performance. Slow growth in overall productivity only one and not the most important aspect of perceived poor performance: Inequality. Declining mobility. Millennials. And they have, of course, been offset by the enormous decline in what can only be called caste privilege. Eight Things Are Going On Always: the problems of measuring economic growth in productivity levels and living standards Since the 1920s: the problems of the shift to information goods—non-excludable and personalized And four more things: The post-1973 productivity slowdown The post-1995 productivity speedup The post-2004 second slowdown The post-2008 catastrophe of what we will soon be calling “the Longer Depression” Plus: reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible, and may not be the best policy even if it is possible Plus: what is it reasonable that we should expect out of the growth process? Problem: Simply Assessing Economic Growth Are we, notionally: Measuring growth by taking today's median income, and setting it equal to that multiple of median income in the past that would provide equivalent value? Measuring growth by taking that fraction of today's median income that is equal to median income in the past, in the sense of providing equivalent value? Year-to-year changes simply do not sum or multiply Additional inescapable questions of moral philosophy to which “shut up and calculate!” is not a proper answer Narrow utilitarianism questions: Productivity and opportunity—I’ve never been a believer in any sort of sharp distinction between “wealth” as some form of “positive liberty” and “freedom” as some form of “negative liberty”. If you’re in a locked cage and lack the money to buy a key, your freedom to buy a key is illusory Productivity and distribution: Are we average people (believers in Negishi prices: that your proper weight in the social welfare function is your lifetime wealth, or perhaps your lifetime wealth squared) Are we median people Or do we aspire to be among the Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas? Broader political economy and moral philosophy questions: Productivity and society—how much growth is needed and how much churn can be tolerated in order to avoid the disappointment of those reasonable expectations that keeps the altruistic-punishment mechanisms that maintain our sociability from going haywire? Productivity and humanity—what is the proper telos of the Sociable Language- and Tool-Using East African Plains Ape? Problem: Valuing Information Commodities When you sell a rival, excludable commodity, there is producer revenue and consumer surplus: The first—producer revenue—is what is counted in GDP The second—consumer surplus—is not counted in GDP. When you provide a non-excludable information commodity produced with enormous amounts of non-rivalry: You give away the commodity Thus all of the final value is consumer surplus: none is producer revenue. You then sell, as an ancillary service, the eyeballs and eardrums of users to advertisers: This a much smaller money flow, a much smaller share of consumer value then producer revenue is in the case of a Smithian commodity Moreover, advertising expenditures are not captured anywhere in real GDP They are an intermediate service, not a final good. How large is this? Well, how much of their recreational time are people spending engaged with such information age commodities? How much of the utility they accrue during that time is due to that engagement? There is also the "personalization" part of the information economy: getting you the information you need to purchase exactly that monopolistically competitive variant of the commodity that pleases you the most Problem: Valuing Information-Driven Personalization Henry Ford thought people got value—utility—from basic transportation: “Any color you want, as long as it is black…” Alfred P. Sloan disagreed GM and Chevy drank Ford’s milkshake Is there real value from getting people the exact monopoly-competitive variant they want? Or is it just a grift—selling people Chevy parts at 100% markup because they are under a Cadillac shell? I favor “grift”: I am more than half on Team Let’s-All-Dress-in-Identical-Blue-Overalls Myself But I do have three-touch smartphone advance ordering at the nearest Starbucks of a whole-milk triple-shot short latte with two pumps of sugarfree hazelnut syrup and extra cinnamon… The Four Trend Breaks: Magnitudes A U.S. population come 2025 of 350M… Before 1973: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $44T @2009 prices: $125K per capita Before 1995: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $28T: $80K per capita Before 2004: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $32T: $91K per capita Before 2008: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $26T: $75K per capita Now: expect real GDP come 2025 of $22T: $63K per capita Four Productivity Trend Breaks since 1973 Have Halved the Expected 2025 Productivity of the USA From $44T @2009 prices—$125K per capita—to $22T: $63K per capita That as, as Joe Biden would say, a BFD How are we to understand these four breaks in the trend of productivity growth we have seen since 1973? The First: The Drop Post-1973 The first of these trend breaks comes around 1973 It is the drop from $125K to $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices With Martin Neil Baily in the room, whatever summary I attempt to provide will be rightfully dismissed as cocksure and inadequate. So * I will just say: it’s complicated… The Second: The Jump Post-1995 * The second of these trend breaks comes in 1995 * It is the jump from $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices * Oliner and Sichel (and Fernald) and company have, I think, nailed this one to the floor… * A Fed committed to keeping deficit reduction from inducing a recession * 4% of GDP of financial flows diverted from buying government debt looking for a home * It finds a home in Silicon Valley * Just as infotech reaches a critical mass * And Intel ramps up its development pace The Third: The Drop Post-2004 The third of these trend breaks comes in 2004 It is the drop from $91K to $75K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices John Fernald and company have been working full time on trying to understand it… I would be rash and foolish to try to challenge John Fernald and company… But it’s a very big shift to happen in a very short time with no obvious system-wide shock… The Fourth: The Drop Post-2008 The fourth of these trend breaks comes in 2008 It is the drop from $75K to $63K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices It is a consequence of the Longer Depression Labor force attachment Worker skills Investment Experimentation with business models The Last of These Is Robert Barro’s “Non-Covery” We should have had substantial bounce-back to trend after September 2009. We didn’t. It’s not because the economy is incapable of reallocating resources. It reallocated resources fine away from housing and into exports and investment over 2004-2008 See? Over 2006-2008 We Reallocated Resources Out of Housing on a Huge Scale As financial markets changed their minds about risk and return in housing… We moved huge amounts of resources out of the housing-construction sector… And, smoothly, into business investment and exports. The Diagnoses of the Problem We Heard Here Yesterday… Seemed to me to focus around problems of “reallocation” and “dynamism”… Flawed in a relative neglect of the difference between a high-pressure and a low-pressure economic environment… Whether “Reallocation” Is into Unemployment or a Booming Sector Is Really Important Keynes (1936): “I defend [my policies] … as the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.... If effective demand is deficient... the individual enterpriser who seeks to bring... resources into action is operating with the odds loaded against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros.... The increment of the world’s wealth… [reduced] by the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune. But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough…" Davis and von Wächter (2011): U-3<6%, mass-layoff workers lose 1.5 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings. U-3>8%, mass-layoff workers lose 3 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings Chodorow-Reich and Wieland (2016): An area with reallocation +1SD -> employment 2% lower at the end of a national recession-recovery cycle. Reallocation has no effect if it occurs during an expansion. The Problem Comes After 2008 The financial-crisis freeze-up of the economy… As housing, exports, investment collapse… And the Recovery Act is undersized by, arithmetically, a factor of 6 And Then We Hit the Economy on the Head with the Austerity Brick, Over and Over Again We also fail to restructure housing finance to encourage construction to help all those people move out of their sisters’ basements. And, with interest rates at zero, the Fed finds no way to signal exports and business investment to take up even more of the slack than they do. Can We Still Recover from the Post-2008 Disaster? We now need to start calling it: “The Longer Depression”… Back in 2009 I said that we obviously will recover, easily. Back in 2012 I said that we could recover—DeLong and Summers—straightforwardly. Now? Gerry Friedman still thinks we could do so. I’m more pessimistic: but I’m not going to argue anything with Gerry until November 15 Nevertheless: worth trying. We should, right now, be desperately trying to generate a higher-pressure economy if only just to see how much low-hanging fruit can be picked via easy aggregate demand-boosting measures Greenspan did it in 1995, and we all were very pleased that he did so. Other Policies? Reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible Reversing the causes is unlikely to be the best policy, even if it is possible However, Low-hanging fruit: Generate a high pressure economy. It might work. And it will do good anyway What else? Aside from Strive for a High-Pressure Economy and Hope, What Can We Do? Where is there low-hanging fruit? What are our value-subtracting industries? Finance (we pay 8% of GDP for net services that used to cost 3%) Health care administration (we pay 5% of GDP for services other countries pay 1% for) Mass incarceration (another 2% other countries do not pay) NIMBYism Residential (but how mportant is it outside of SF, BOS, DC?) Occupational (perhaps? More Low-Hanging Fruit Truman started the process of turning the federal government into an entity with a permanently very large military (for good and sufficient reasons, but still). Johnson set in stone the process of turning the federal government into an insurance company too. “An insurance company with a military”—that’s where we are. Is that where we should be? All Growth Comes from “Investment” of Some Kind All growth comes from somewhere: it doesn’t just precipitate out of the air. Net private investment roughly 7% of net domestic product. Other net investment-like activities of equal magnitude—figure 15% of net product devoted to growth, 10% to per capita growth The average net rate of return on those expenditures is 20%/year. There are some investment and investment-like expenditures that offer very high returns indeed. The U.S. Government Could Do Much More In a world that is increasingly non-Smithian, confining government to military, insurance, property rights, and contract enforcement is just silly—even adding in standard infrastructure. Incentivize the private creation of public and information goods: Why is the government so good at committing itself to pay money in the event of failure—loan guarantees—but not success? Prizes—cf., Michael Kremer. Platforms: Why is it Google doing Google Books? Platforms: Isn’t relying on advertising to fund write-once run-everywhere value-in-scale profoundly silly? Let’s Take the Longest Possible View… Pre-1800 (upper left point is 1800-50) “data” Periods from 1000 years down to 50 Impressive, no? This is essentially Michael Kremer’s pre-job market paper from back when Almost all growth is useful ideas Useful ideas are non-excludable Thus two heads are better than one This is not economics: this is numerology… But the basic Michael Kremer two-heads-are-better-than-one model from 1992: Estimated over the pre-1800 period Admittedly with GDP rather than population on the left-hand side Fits our current 2000-2050 forecast Moreover: this is consistent with Gordon’s view that the Second Industrial Revolution was a really big deal 1.25%/year x 100 years of extra growth Exp(1.25) = 3.5 And now that extra 3.5-fold multiplication of global GDP is over But, still, going forward, after the exhaustion of the Second Industrial Revolution. It still looks as though two heads are better than one If world population tops out and stabilizes at 9B in 2050 Then will world real GDP growth stabilize at 6%/year? Thus we have powerful reasons to believe that economic growth is not over—that human brains will continue to be a very valuable idea-generating resource. Provided, of course, we do not blow up the planet. Or cook it. J.

Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Early Verdict Fujitsu has a winner on its hands, with the S936 offering excellent performance along with some stunning expansion capabilities and shockingly good battery life, all of which makes it a great candidate for demanding businesses. For Lengthy battery life Impressive performer Exceptional expansion capabilities Portability Against No need for a battery cover A bit pricey Launched at the beginning of 2016, the Lifebook S936 sits, together with the U904, in a category that Fujitsu describes as notebooks with "ultimate features and stylish design", destined for professionals on the move looking for products that combine looks with substance. Prosaically though, it's essentially a more refined version of the Lifebook E736 that we reviewed not so long ago. As expected from a laptop for which the cheapest version will set you back about £1,000 (around $1,340, AU$1,740), this is a model that looks and feels premium. Its main rivals include the ThinkPad T460s series, the Dell Latitude E7440 and the HP Elitebook 1040 G3. The S936 uses the same magnesium/aluminium combination for its chassis but manages to keep the weight down to only 1.19kg (our model weighed in at 1.42kg thanks to an optical drive and the touch display). What came as a surprise though was how chunky it is – at its thickest, this notebook is a whopping 26mm thick, which pushes it outside the minimum requirements to be called an Ultrabook. At last, a vendor that doesn't compromise! Another area where Fujitsu has trumped the competition is connectivity and expansion capabilities. Unlike many of its competitors and despite its weight, Fujitsu managed to include a free memory slot that allows the owner to upgrade the memory to 20GB of DDR4 RAM (4GB of memory is soldered on the motherboard) simply by removing one screw and one flap. This is still a far cry from the 32GB that the E736 could take thanks to two free slots, but it is the only major step down with this model. We're puzzled by the fact that engineers have managed to cram in a modular bay that allows you to shove in a secondary battery, a hard drive or an optical drive; an example of where modularity works in an enterprise setup. When it comes to ports, there's a GbE port, a legacy VGA one, and HDMI port, three USB 3.0, an audio connector and a card reader. It's a shame about the lack of a DisplayPort though which would have made this machine 4K friendly. Servicing the laptop is a fairly mundane operation. There are a dozen screws that need to be removed – some of which are well hidden – and all the important components are well in sight. Because Fujitsu placed manageability ahead of integration, servicing teams will be able to replace almost all components in the S936 far faster, in case of hardware issues, reducing downtime considerably. However, we did hit a snag when trying to take out the battery. For some reason, the S936 includes a snap-on cover, an odd option. When we tried to put the battery back, it just wouldn't fit in properly and got jammed. This meant that we couldn't put the cover back on. Speaking of the battery, the smaller one offered has a 51Whr capacity with a beefier 6-cell model boasting 77Whr and up to 15 hours of longevity. Slot in an optional secondary 28Whr battery and that adds another six hours to an already impressive battery life. The battery life tests were carried out by Fujitsu using the BAPco MobileMark 2014 office productivity test. A major reason why the S936 excels in mobility is because it uses a screen technology that draws less power. Our model came with a palm vein sensor, a Fujitsu exclusive and one that doesn't require you to touch the sensor in order to unlock your device. A more traditional fingerprint sensor is also available as an option. Other security features on the S936 include a smart card reader, encrypted disk and a TPM 2.0 module, all of which are staple offerings on high-end enterprise laptops. The relatively small footprint of the machine means that a 13.3-inch display was the only logical choice with a full HD model or a WQHD one, with touch and anti-glare offered as options. Our model came with an Intel Core i7-6600U CPU (2.6GHz, two cores, 4MB cache), 8GB of RAM, a 128GB M2 SSD, a 4G LTE modem, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1, NFC, Windows 10 Pro and a list price of £1,200 (around $1,600, AU$2,090) excluding VAT. As with other Fujitsu laptops, this one comes with a two-year warranty. There are also two front-facing speakers and a webcam. We tested the Fujitsu Lifebook S936 using Cinebench R15, CPU-Z and GeekBench 4. On the first benchmark, it reached 43.9 fps for the OpenGL test and 322 points for the CPU benchmark. CPU-Z yielded scores of 1,597 and 3,597 (Single and Multi-thread respectively) while on the newly introduced GeekBench 4, the notebook achieved 17,749 on its compute benchmark and 3,871/7,560 points on its single/multi-core test. All these numbers are on par with what one would expect from a Skylake-based Core i7 processor from Intel. The display, which uses Sharp's acclaimed IGZO technology, was exquisite, on par with the rest of the competition. It boasts great viewing angles, reasonably thin bezels and well balanced colours. The keyboard and the touchpad were equally good – the former offers a reasonable spring and feedback, with massive Enter, Shift and Backspace keys, and great travel. The touchpad has two physical mouse buttons and while it's not the biggest we've seen on a 13.3-inch laptop, it is accurate and responsive, although we have some reservations regarding its slightly high level of friction. An optional port replicator/docking station, costing £99, is also available and adds an extra USB 3.0 port, DVI and DisplayPort connectors. Early verdict The Lifebook S936 is one of the best designed laptops we've seen in recent years. Okay, so it's not perfect and is a tad thicker than we'd expect, but removing the artificial limit on thickness gave more leeway to engineers and frankly, the additional 10mm thickness meant more space to fiddle around and a level of expansion capabilities that we've never seen on any laptop of this weight. Perhaps the only reservation we have is about the battery and its cover; a minor point but one that caused us some problems.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Editorial: Microsoft should be putting Windows 10 on phones 3 by Greg Jordan  @solo_g06 Sep 10, 2016 at 20:59 GMT2 months ago While the title of this article may be misleading, as Microsoft already has a version of Windows 10 available for mobile devices in the form of Windows 10 mobile, we know that the future of that platform in itself is hazy; as market share has been on a rapid decline, the official Microsoft website has delisted the Lumia brand, and now reports are coming in from readers all over the country that Microsoft stores have removed all phones that were on display. Even the legendary “Surface Phone”, which has been rumored since last year, is now rumored to be hitting the market in the latter half of 2017, if the phone even comes to fruition at all. No, this article isn’t about any of that (except for the last one, but we’ll get to that later). Microsoft clearly has no strategy for performing in the mobile market; Project Astoria was canned, the Windows Insider program, though seemingly helpful, is limited upon official release (less than half of the Windows 8.1 phones received the official W10M update despite being able to run the technical preview version), and Microsoft seems content with getting to Windows 10 mobile whenever they feel ready, despite what the actual market says. Android and iOS are growing by leaps and bounds (well at least one of the two), and have set schedules, whether it be for new devices or new software. People know what they’re getting when they jump on the Google and Apple train, but no matter how often Microsoft tries to rebrand themselves, their actions speak completely different than their words. Windows 10 on phones As I stated earlier, Microsoft seems to have no other strategy for Windows 10 mobile other than the Windows Insider program. Since July 29 2015, Microsoft has rode behind Windows 10 like no other product in its history, but that’s Windows 10 for PCs/laptops. From the free upgrade offer, to the on time release of the Anniversary update, to the unwanted forced installation of Windows 10 on consumer devices, Microsoft has made sure to get its new baby into consumers hand. They even offered an incentive to come into the store to get the upgrade for free, giving a free laptop to those with capable devices that weren’t able to be upgraded. But where’s the incentive to get W10m devices into its consumers hands? Other than committed Windows fans, most phone users don’t even know that there’s a version of Windows 10 for phones. And when they find out that there is, they assume its the same edition that’s running on their computer at work. Well why not give them what they want? Why not put Windows 10 Home edition on mobile hardware? Microsoft has already lost the war for mobile marketshare, but holds steadfast to the lead in the PC division. This is what Microsoft needs to use to its advantage. Merging the Windows Store was the beginning. If market share was the problem, we should start seeing more UWP apps hit the Windows Store. By eliminating Windows 10 mobile and focusing on explicitly focusing on Windows 10 for PCs/laptops/phones, you shake the negative connotation that W10m has garnered over the past few years. UWP apps already run on all platforms, and features like continuum would really be useful, allowing you to dock your mobile device to any external screen, using Windows 10 on a larger screen, while having use of ALL of your apps and information. A landscape start screen would actually be an implemented feature instead of a suggestion on Windows Feedback. Windows as a platform would experience an increase in market share. And no matter what Microsoft wants to believe, mobile computing is the future, and Redmond needs to take advantage of its leading position while it still has one to claim. The mysterious Surface Phone And here’s where the Surface Phone comes into play. Microsoft needs a device to showcase Windows 10 on mobile devices, and what better than a device with a brand name that’s synonymous with style, functionality, and quality. More than that, the Surface should be everything that Lumia isn’t. If Lumia was supposed to be the flagship Windows 10 mobile device, the Surface Phone needs to be the best mobile device running Windows 10. This is where all of that Microsoft rebranding comes into play, its time for the software giant to reinvent the mobile market. After having a hold on the mobile market in the early part of the millennium ( along with Blackberry and Palm, neither of which had the money that Microsoft does to keep playing), Microsoft failed to innovate, which Apple did with the first iPhone. Apple made an all touchscreen device with no stylus, pinch to zoom functionality, and a dedicated app store. The phone was widely accepted, and as we know is one of the best selling phones in history. Google followed suit with Android a year later, with the same open functionality that Windows Mobile had when it was a major player. Windows Phone 7 series was way too little, and way too late, only becoming a viable option with Windows Phone 8.1 in 2014. But much like the wearable Microsoft Band, Microsoft shouldn’t be afraid to make a niche mobile product. Imagine a Surface Phone with a 6.0-6.5 inch display, 4GB of RAM, 128-256GB ROM, Intel processor, stylus, an optical trackpad akin to the Samsung Omnia, a full size ISB 3.0 port ( or maybe just USB OTG), and full blown Windows 10. None of these specifications are farfetched, as modern day flagships already have similar specs. But the niche feature for the Surface Phone would be the ability to run x86 programs, with the stylus and trackpad for assistance. And even a typecover like case could be implemented. Now before you get to complaining about x86 programs running on a 6.0 or 6.5 inch mobile device, remember that there are 7.0 inch tablets that run the full version of Windows 10. I’ve used these devices, and x86 program run and work just fine on touch, a stylus or trackpad would only make it more efficient if anything. There are already mobile devices that are attempting to do exactly what I’ve described above, but none have reached the market as far as I know (the device pictured at the beginning of the article is Gole 1, a mini PC, not a phone). However if you check on Kickstarter and Indiegogo, you’ll find multiple devices attempting to bring Windows 10 to mobile devices, they just lack one thing; the backing that a company like Microsoft has. So what say you readers? Do you think that Microsoft should do away with Windows 10 mobile for smartphones running Windows 10, or is the idea too farfetched?

The upcoming device may launch in fall 2017.  ( David Ramos | Getty Images ) Advertisement Rumors of Microsoft's Surface Phone have been circling the tech space not for months but for years now. But it seems that smartphone enthusiasts have to wait another year for the company to launch the Surface Phone. Given that Microsoft already has laptops and tablets under the Surface brand, it makes sense for the company to extend the brand name to mobile phones as well. Previous rumors have pointed that Microsoft is working on three Surface Phones, which will have different prices and specs to cater to all market segments. Speculations are rife that the company will hold an event sometime in October where it will showcase a number of products, such as the Surface all-in-one device. However, the Surface Phone is not likely to be launched at the event. A ZDNet report cites sources familiar with the matter and suggests that if the Surface Phone materializes, then customers should expect the handset to arrive "considerably later." Although the report does not state how long customers will have to wait for the Surface Phone, rumors suggest that Microsoft may launch its smartphone line in fall 2017. Microsoft planned to launch a Surface Phone in 2014 but due to component issues the company scrapped the plan. Microsoft is also said to have planned to launch the Surface Phone in fall 2016, but Intel shut down all its mobile developments, which is believed to have delayed the Surface Phone to 2017. The mobile OS market is dominated by bigwigs such as Android and iOS. According to an International Data Corporation (IDC) report, in 2016, the combined market share of iOS and Android was more than 99 percent. Windows Phone had a market share of 0.5 percent. IDC also predicts that the Windows Phone market share will decline further in the near term. "IDC anticipates further decline in Windows Phone's market share throughout the forecast. Although the platform recently saw a new device launch from one of the largest PC vendors, the device (like the OS) remains highly focused on the commercial market. Future device launches, whether from Microsoft or its partners, are expected to have a similar target market," says IDC. The disappointing market share of devices running on Windows Phone could be a reason that has made Microsoft shift its focus from the Surface Phone. The company has not confirmed any detail about the Surface Phone and customers will have to wait before it reveals more information on its smartphones. Till then, rumors regarding the Surface Phone should be treated with a pinch of salt. Photo: Mike Mozart | Flickr TAG Microsoft, Surface Phone, Windows Phone © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

A portfolio manager for the Voya Large Cap Growth Fund talks about investing strategies. Share story By SARAH SKIDMORE SELL The Associated Press The stock market is at record highs, and that is making it tougher for investors to find big gains. Voya Large Cap Growth Fund focuses on big companies. Its top 10 holdings are all household names like Apple, Home Depot, Facebook and Costco. The fund says it aims to find that “sweet spot where business momentum, valuation and market recognition intersect.” Michael Pytosh, head of equities at Voya Investment Management and one of the fund’s portfolio managers, spoke with The Associated Press about investing strategies for growth in a low-growth world. Answers have been edited for length and clarity. Q. Given the slow growth in both markets and the global economy right now, what do you see as the primary appeal of large cap funds?

A. Growth is harder to come by today than in many times in my career, and I’ve been doing this for 30 years. But there’s still good growth out there. There’s always changes in regulation, changes in market share and innovation. This environment is a little different than normal because, in part, investors are looking for yield. There’s a lot of room between the high growth and the yielding parts of the universe. For moderate-growth companies, they are trading at reasonable levels and there are opportunities there. It’s all relative gain at the end of the day. Q. Is growth overvalued right now? There seems to be a lot of demand chasing very little supply. A. In short, yes. Particularly at the very high end of the growth spectrum. There is a scarcity. And this is the slowest growth period I’ve lived through. There is a lot of money searching for growth, so when it happens, people pay for it. But growth is finite. There is the rare company that grows for 10 or 20 years. Most growth companies only have a growth period of three to five years. You have to be careful, you have to be nimble. The biggest problem you have as a growth investor is when you stay too long in a stock that grew fast and isn’t growing as fast. You can’t have a portfolio full of stocks that drop like that. There’s no way to counteract it. Q. A lot of growth has traditionally been in technology, and those companies are highly reliant on markets outside the U.S. What are you keeping your eye on globally? A. Technology is pretty representative of global markets. More than half of those sales come from outside the U.S. for the big companies. So we are always aware of the economic developments in Europe and China. But more important than that, for each individual company — if it’s Apple or Google or Facebook or Intel — it’s really what innovations do they have in the pipeline, what’s the available market. The tech market isn’t as vibrant as it was in the ’90s, when you were putting PCs on every desk or the 2000s, when cellphones were everywhere. But there are still opportunities with product cycle and innovation. Q. There are a lot of tech companies creating a lot of stuff out there. It seems tough to stay on top of what is going to be the next big thing. Is it? A. It’s challenging. You have to have analysts who are very experienced in understanding the evolution of technology and what are the available markets. There’s a lot of innovation out there, but about 98 percent of it is not material. It’s great innovation, but it’s not going to move the needle. We spend a lot of time dissecting that to see what is going to move the needle. SARAH SKIDMORE SELL Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Reinvents the Watch Band with Auto Adjustment+ | Main | Nissim, Contributor to the DVD Specification, Sues Apple for Patent Infringement » September 10, 2016 Apple Refocuses Project Titan towards Advanced System Software and away from a Dreamy iCar   In 2015 we were all subjected to Apple Van mania sweeping the web attributing the vans to a future autonomous Apple car. It was nuts and last June it was a relief to report that Apple finally set the story straight because the rumors were getting completely out of control about the vans being associated with an autonomous vehicle. In August of last year we posted two reports on the matter. The first was titled "Are the New Round of Car Rumors Believable?" and the second titled "Proof is Mounting that Apple's Project Titan is about the Development of an Advanced Driver Assistance System." There's no denying that Apple's engineers had been working on underlying technology related to future vehicles for years because they're on record with a series of patents that were presented in our noted report above.    Shortly thereafter the rumor mill went into high gear and all out for Project Titan being about an autonomous vehicle. We followed a few of the rumors that were from the top news sites like the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Reuters. Stories about Apple giving the green light to triple Project Titan's staff, that Apple ended talks with BWM and Daimler over new vehicle cooperation and that Apple had a secret Titan team in Germany.   Then in early 2016 the surprising news came to light that Steve Zadesky, head of Project Titan was leaving and speculation began that the project was in trouble. In July Apple appointed no-nonsense Bob Mansfield to head Project Titan who was reportedly taking the project in a new direction by prioritizing the development of an autonomous driving system, exactly what we reported on back in August 2015 as noted earlier. Of course the door was still open a crack for a future car, but Mansfield wanted the Project Titan team to first focus on the heart of the project which was towards an advanced driver assistance system.   Late yesterday the New York Times reported that three sources close to the matter confirmed to them that Apple was indeed rethinking Project Titan. "Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.   Apple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a 'reboot' of the car project, the people briefed on it said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment.   Apple started looking seriously into building an electric car about two years ago. It expanded the project quickly, poaching experts in battery technology and so-called machine vision, as well as veterans from the automobile industry.   The team also pulled in staff members from other divisions across Apple, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.   Apple has also made some headway in the space. The company has a number of fully autonomous vehicles in the middle of testing, using limited operating routes in a closed environment, according to people briefed on the company's plans. Like other companies in the space, that technology is likely a number of years away from seeing mainstream consumer use, they added." For more on this, see the full New York Times report here.   An interesting and random point in the NYTimes report was that "Tesla has a self-driving feature within its cars that has come under scrutiny in recent months after a fatal accident was connected to its use."   In July we posted a report titled "BMW, Intel, Mobileye Announcements Live," wherein we presented the live event about the 'iNext Car' and still have the video covering it. I also noted in that report that the Tesla tragedy was the elephant in the room that was a drag on the event because the Tesla incident happened the day before the big live event. One of the companies behind the Tesla system was also behind the new BMW autonomous vehicle initiative being announced. Tesla later ended the partnership with Mobileye over the deadly crash caused by a flaw in the autonomous system.   The Tesla tragedy really put a big question mark into the whole autonomous driving craze. I have to admit, the autonomous driving experience was never one that interested me in the least. It's a feature I'd only use lightly like I use cruise control. But any driver knows that at high highway speeds it only takes a second for something to go wrong and depending on any machine to make the right decision at the right time is something I'll never trust in my lifetime. Inner-city cab rides sounds like a real market but trusting a car to make lane changes and avoid accidents at high speed is, for many, not something of great interest.   With that said, Apple's big billion dollar investment in Didi Chuxing made sense for opening the door to Apple Pay because the service delivered 11 million rides a day – Ka-Ching! But it was also an open door to a mass market to test out various vehicle technologies. The President of Didi Chuxing stated on a conference call at the time that the deal would benefit each other "on product, technology, marketing, and many other levels."   This is one of the key markets where Apple's focus with Project Titan could still pay off. Taxi cabs, unlike consumer vehicles, have a high turnover. There's no doubt that Didi and Uber are thinking about moving into autonomous cabs as Uber's first self-driving fleet arrived in Pittsburgh in August.   For now, Apple's Project Titan is shifting gears away from making a vehicle to refocusing their energies on such things as an advanced driver assistance system and beyond. While the dream of the iCar was popcorn for our minds, perhaps reality is now setting in and refocusing on the possible is at hand.     About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

BioShock: The Collection - Upgrade-Infos, Systemanforderungen & Startzeit Nächste Woche kommt die BioShock: The Collection auch für PC. 2K Games hat jetzt die Hardware-Anforderungen und weitere Details zum kostenlosen Upgrade-Prozess veröffentlicht. Von Christian Fritz Schneider | Datum: 10.09.2016 ; 12:45 Uhr Kommentare (38) BioShock: The Collection - 14 Minuten Gameplay aus Bioshock 1 HD Zum Thema BioShock: The Collection für 44,99 € bei GamesPlanet.com Am 15. September 2016 wird BioShock: The Collection für PC, PS4 und Xbox One veröffentlicht. Bei uns in Deutschland wird es allerdings schon Punkt 0 Uhr am 16.9. sein, wenn sich die PC-Version auf Steam aktiviert. Die neuen Versionen von Bioshock und Bioshock 2 werden als neue Spiele in der Steam-Bibliothek auftauchen. Wer die beiden Spiele und den Story-DLC Minerva's Den bereits auf Steam hat, bekommt die grafisch verbesserten und um freischaltbare Audiokommentare verbesserten Versionen gratis. Dabei gilt: Man bekommt nur für die PC-Inhalte kostenlose Upgrades, die man besitzt. Wer den DLC also beispielsweise nicht hat, bekommt auch nicht die neue Version aus der Collection. Bioshock Infinite wird am PC übrigens nicht überarbeitet, da die neue Version für PS4 und Xbox One eigentlich nur ein Port der ursprünglichen PC-Fassung ist. Wer BioShock: The Collection kauft, bekommt aber alle Spiele inklusive aller Story-DLCs. Ansonsten kann man auch weiterhin alle Titel über Steam einzeln kaufen und bekommt dann beide Fassungen - soweit vorhanden. Upgrade für Boxed-Version und Games for Windows Während die Upgrades für Steam-Spieler automatisch laufen, ist die Sache bei Kunden von Retail-Versionen oder Bioshock 2 für Games for Windows schon etwas schwerer. 2K Games hat einen Blogeintrag veröffentlicht, der erklärt, das sich Käufer von Bioshock 1 mit einer Original-Rechnung und den Details zu ihrem Steam-Account bitte an das Support-Team wenden sollen. Wer seine Games-for-Windows-Version von Bioshock 2 auf Steam übertragen will, findet beim 2K-Support ebenfalls Unterstützung. Systemanforderungen für Bioshock: The Collection Minimale Hardware: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit.

So wie ich das verstanden habe, wohl nicht - man muss es zum Release der Remastered Edition bereits in seiner Bibliothek haben, dann erhält man den DLC auch für das HD Bioshock2. Kauft man es danach, erhält man den DLC nur für das normale BioShock2 und müsste ihn für HDBS2 erneut kaufen. Ich bin mal lieber auf Nummer Sicher gegangen und hab den DLC noch schnell nachgekauft ;)  (1)  |   (1) Kaimanic #9 | 10.

How to prevent .NET Garbage collections with the TryStartNoGCRegion API Pauses are a known problem in runtimes that have a Garbage Collector (GC), such as Java or .NET. GC Pauses can last several milliseconds, during which your application is blocked or suspended. One way you can alleviate the pauses is to modify your code so that it doesn’t allocate, i.e., so the GC has nothing to do. But this can require lots of work and you really have to understand the runtime as many allocations are hidden. Another technique is to temporarily suspend the GC, during a critical region of your code where you don’t want any pauses and then start it up again afterwards. This is exactly what the TryStartNoGCRegion API (added in .NET 4.6) allows you to do. From the MSDN docs: Attempts to disallow garbage collection during the execution of a critical path if a specified amount of memory is available. TryStartNoGCRegion in Action To see how the API works, I ran some simple tests using the .NET GC Workstation mode, on a 32-bit CPU. The tests simply call TryStartNoGCRegion and then verify how much memory can be allocated before a Collection happens. The code is available if you want to try it out for yourself. Test 1: Regular Allocation, TryStartNoGCRegion Not Called You can see that a garbage collection happens after the 2nd allocation (indicated by “**”): Prevent GC: False, Over Allocate: False
Allocated:   3.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   6.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1, **
Allocated:   9.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1,
Allocated:  12.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1,
Allocated:  15.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1, Test 2: TryStartNoGCRegion(..) with Size Set to 15MB Here, we see that despite allocating the same amount as in the first test, no garbage collections are triggered during the run. Prevent GC: True, Over Allocate: False
TryStartNoGCRegion: Size=15 MB (15,360 K or 15,728,640 bytes) SUCCEEDED
Allocated:   3.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   6.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   9.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  12.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  15.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0, Test 3: TryStartNoGCRegion(..) Size of 15MB, But Allocating More Than 15MB Finally, we see that once we’ve allocated more than the size we asked for, the mode switches from NoGCRegion to Interactive and garbage collections can now happen. Prevent GC: True, Over Allocate: True
TryStartNoGCRegion: Size=15 MB (15,360 K or 15,728,640 bytes) SUCCEEDED
Allocated:   3.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   6.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:   9.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  12.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  15.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  18.00 MB, Mode:   NoGCRegion, Gen0: 0, Gen1: 0, Gen2: 0,
Allocated:  21.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1, **
Allocated:  24.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 1, Gen1: 1, Gen2: 1,
Allocated:  27.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 2, Gen1: 2, Gen2: 2, **
Allocated:  30.00 MB, Mode:  Interactive, Gen0: 2, Gen1: 2, Gen2: 2, So this shows that at least in the simple test we’ve done, the API works as advertised. As long as you don’t subsequently allocate more memory than you asked for, no Garbage Collections will take place. Object Size However, there are a few caveats when using TryStartNoGCRegion, the first of which is that you are required to know up-front, the total size in bytes of the objects you will be allocating. As we’ve seen previously, if you allocate more than totalSize bytes, the No GC Region will no longer be active and it will then be possible for garbage collections to happen. It’s not straight forward to get the size of an object in .NET, it’s a managed-runtime and it tries its best to hide that sort of detail from you. To further complicate matters, it varies depending on the CPU architecture and even the version of the runtime. But you do have a few options: Guess?! Search on Stack Overflow Start-up WinDbg and use the !objsize command on a memory dump of your process Get a estimate using the technique that Jon Skeet proposes Use DotNetEx, which relies on inspecting the internal fields of the CLR object Personally, I would go with a variation of 3), use WinDbg, but automate it using the excellent CLRMD C# library. Segment Size Update: It turns out that I completely missed the section on segment sizes on the MSDN page, thanks to Maoni for pointing this out to me. In the section on “Generations”, there is the following chart (which fortunately correlates with my findings below): However even when you know how many bytes will be allocated within the No GC Region, you still need to ensure that it’s less that the maximum amount allowed, because if you specify a value too large an ArgumentOutOfRangeException exception is thrown. From the MSDN docs (emphasis mine): The amount of memory in bytes to allocate without triggering a garbage collection. It must be less than or equal to the size of an ephemeral segment. For information on the size of an ephemeral segment, see the “Ephemeral generations and segments” section in the Fundamentals of Garbage Collection article. However if you visit the linked article on GC Fundamentals, it has no exact figure for the size of an ephemeral segment, it does however have this stark warning: Important The size of segments allocated by the garbage collector is implementation-specific and is subject to change at any time, including in periodic updates. Your app should never make assumptions about or depend on a particular segment size, nor should it attempt to configure the amount of memory available for segment allocations. Excellent, that’s very helpful!? So let me get this straight, to prevent TryStartNoGCRegion from throwing an exception, we have to pass in a totalSize value that isn’t larger than the size of an ephemeral segment, but we’re not allowed to know the actual value of an ephemeral segment, in-case we assume too much!! So where does that leave us? Well fortunately, it’s possible to figure out the size of an ephemeral or Small Object Heap (SOH) segment using either VMMap, or the previously mentioned CLRMD library (code sample available). Here are the results I got with the .NET Framework 4.6.1, running on a 4 Core (HT) - Intel® Core™ i7-4800MQ, i.e., Environment.ProcessorCount = 8. If you click on the links for each row heading, you can see the full breakdown as reported by VMMap. GC Mode CPU Arch SOH Segment LOH Segment Initial GC Size Largest No GC Region totalSize value Workstation 32-bit 16 MB 16 MB 32 MB 16 MB Workstation 64-bit 256 MB 128 MB 384 MB 244 MB Server 32-bit 32 MB 16 MB 384 MB 256 MB Server 64-bit 2,048 MB 256 MB 18,423 MB 16,384 MB The final column is the largest totalSize value that can be passed into TryStartNoGCRegion(long totalSize), this was found by experimentation/trial-and-error. Note: The main difference between Server and Workstation is that in Workstation mode, there is only one heap, whereas in Server mode, there is one heap per logical CPU. TryStartNoGCRegion Under-the-hood What’s nice is that the entire feature is in a single Github commit, so it’s easy to see what code changes were made: Around half of the files modified (listed below) are the changes needed to set-up the plumbing and error handling involved in adding a API to the System.GC class, they also give an interesting overview of what’s involved in having the external C# code talk to the internal C++ code in the CLR (click on a link to go directly to the diff): src/mscorlib/src/System/GC.cs src/mscorlib/src/System/Runtime/GcSettings.cs src/vm/comutilnative.cpp src/vm/comutilnative.h src/vm/ecalllist.h The rest of the changes are where the actual work takes place, with all the significant heavy-lifting happening in gc.cpp: src/gc/gc.cpp src/gc/gc.h src/gc/gcimpl.h src/gc/gcpriv.h TryStartNoGCRegion Implementation When you call TryStartNoGCRegion, the following things happen: The maximum required heap sizes are calculated based on the totalSize parameter passed in. These calculations take place in gc_heap::prepare_for_no_gc_region If the current heaps aren’t large enough to accommodate the new value, they are re-sized. To achieve this, a full collection is triggered (see GCHeap::StartNoGCRegion) Note: Due to the way the GC uses segments, it won’t always allocate memory. It will however ensure that it reserves the maximum amount of memory required, so that it can be committed when actually needed. Then next time the GC wants to perform a collection, it checks: Is the current mode set to No GC Region By checking gc_heap::settings.pause_mode == pause_no_gc, relevant code here Can we stay in the No GC Region mode This is done by calling gc_heap::should_proceed_for_no_gc(), which performs a sanity-check to ensure that we haven’t allocated more than the # of bytes we asked for when TryStartNoGCRegion was set-up If 1) and 2) are both true, then a collection does not take place because the GC knows that it has already reserved enough memory to fulfil future allocations, so it doesn’t need to clean-up any existing garbage to make space. Further Reading You can now tell the .NET GC to stop collecting during critical code paths Prevent GC Collections In Certain Spots To Improve Performance So, what’s new in the CLR 2.0 GC? How does the GC work and what are the sizes of the different generations? .NET Memory usage – A restaurant analogy The post Preventing .NET Garbage Collections with the TryStartNoGCRegion API appeared first on my blog Performance is a Feature!

What Are We Talking About Here? Perceived poor performance of the American economy. Measurement issues are fascinating and important, but largely orthogonal to perceived poor performance. Slow growth in overall productivity only one and not the most important aspect of perceived poor performance: Inequality. Declining mobility. Millennials. And they have, of course, been offset by the enormous decline in what can only be called caste privilege. Eight Things Are Going On Always: the problems of measuring economic growth in productivity levels and living standards Since the 1920s: the problems of the shift to information goods—non-excludable and personalized And four more things: The post-1973 productivity slowdown The post-1995 productivity speedup The post-2004 second slowdown The post-2008 catastrophe of what we will soon be calling “the Longer Depression” Plus: reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible, and may not be the best policy even if it is possible Plus: what is it reasonable that we should expect out of the growth process? Problem: Simply Assessing Economic Growth Are we, notionally: Measuring growth by taking today's median income, and setting it equal to that multiple of median income in the past that would provide equivalent value? Measuring growth by taking that fraction of today's median income that is equal to median income in the past, in the sense of providing equivalent value? Year-to-year changes simply do not sum or multiply Additional inescapable questions of moral philosophy to which “shut up and calculate!” is not a proper answer Narrow utilitarianism questions: Productivity and opportunity—I’ve never been a believer in any sort of sharp distinction between “wealth” as some form of “positive liberty” and “freedom” as some form of “negative liberty”. If you’re in a locked cage and lack the money to buy a key, your freedom to buy a key is illusory Productivity and distribution: Are we average people (believers in Negishi prices: that your proper weight in the social welfare function is your lifetime wealth, or perhaps your lifetime wealth squared) Are we median people Or do we aspire to be among the Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas? Broader political economy and moral philosophy questions: Productivity and society—how much growth is needed and how much churn can be tolerated in order to avoid the disappointment of those reasonable expectations that keeps the altruistic-punishment mechanisms that maintain our sociability from going haywire? Productivity and humanity—what is the proper telos of the Sociable Language- and Tool-Using East African Plains Ape? Problem: Valuing Information Commodities When you sell a rival, excludable commodity, there is producer revenue and consumer surplus: The first—producer revenue—is what is counted in GDP The second—consumer surplus—is not counted in GDP. When you provide a non-excludable information commodity produced with enormous amounts of non-rivalry: You give away the commodity Thus all of the final value is consumer surplus: none is producer revenue. You then sell, as an ancillary service, the eyeballs and eardrums of users to advertisers: This a much smaller money flow, a much smaller share of consumer value then producer revenue is in the case of a Smithian commodity Moreover, advertising expenditures are not captured anywhere in real GDP They are an intermediate service, not a final good. How large is this? Well, how much of their recreational time are people spending engaged with such information age commodities? How much of the utility they accrue during that time is due to that engagement? There is also the "personalization" part of the information economy: getting you the information you need to purchase exactly that monopolistically competitive variant of the commodity that pleases you the most Problem: Valuing Information-Driven Personalization Henry Ford thought people got value—utility—from basic transportation: “Any color you want, as long as it is black…” Alfred P. Sloan disagreed GM and Chevy drank Ford’s milkshake Is there real value from getting people the exact monopoly-competitive variant they want? Or is it just a grift—selling people Chevy parts at 100% markup because they are under a Cadillac shell? I favor “grift”: I am more than half on Team Let’s-All-Dress-in-Identical-Blue-Overalls Myself But I do have three-touch smartphone advance ordering at the nearest Starbucks of a whole-milk triple-shot short latte with two pumps of sugarfree hazelnut syrup and extra cinnamon… The Four Trend Breaks: Magnitudes A U.S. population come 2025 of 350M… Before 1973: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $44T @2009 prices: $125K per capita Before 1995: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $28T: $80K per capita Before 2004: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $32T: $91K per capita Before 2008: could expect real GDP come 2025 of $26T: $75K per capita Now: expect real GDP come 2025 of $22T: $63K per capita Four Productivity Trend Breaks since 1973 Have Halved the Expected 2025 Productivity of the USA From $44T @2009 prices—$125K per capita—to $22T: $63K per capita That as, as Joe Biden would say, a BFD How are we to understand these four breaks in the trend of productivity growth we have seen since 1973? The First: The Drop Post-1973 The first of these trend breaks comes around 1973 It is the drop from $125K to $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices With Martin Neil Baily in the room, whatever summary I attempt to provide will be rightfully dismissed as cocksure and inadequate. So * I will just say: it’s complicated… The Second: The Jump Post-1995 * The second of these trend breaks comes in 1995 * It is the jump from $80K to of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices * Oliner and Sichel (and Fernald) and company have, I think, nailed this one to the floor… * A Fed committed to keeping deficit reduction from inducing a recession * 4% of GDP of financial flows diverted from buying government debt looking for a home * It finds a home in Silicon Valley * Just as infotech reaches a critical mass * And Intel ramps up its development pace The Third: The Drop Post-2004 The third of these trend breaks comes in 2004 It is the drop from $91K to $75K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices John Fernald and company have been working full time on trying to understand it… I would be rash and foolish to try to challenge John Fernald and company… But it’s a very big shift to happen in a very short time with no obvious system-wide shock… The Fourth: The Drop Post-2008 The fourth of these trend breaks comes in 2008 It is the drop from $75K to $63K of notional 2025 GDP per capita at 2009 prices It is a consequence of the Longer Depression Labor force attachment Worker skills Investment Experimentation with business models The Last of These Is Robert Barro’s “Non-Covery” We should have had substantial bounce-back to trend after September 2009. We didn’t. It’s not because the economy is incapable of reallocating resources. It reallocated resources fine away from housing and into exports and investment over 2004-2008 See? Over 2006-2008 We Reallocated Resources Out of Housing on a Huge Scale As financial markets changed their minds about risk and return in housing… We moved huge amounts of resources out of the housing-construction sector… And, smoothly, into business investment and exports. The Diagnoses of the Problem We Heard Here Yesterday… Seemed to me to focus around problems of “reallocation” and “dynamism”… Flawed in a relative neglect of the difference between a high-pressure and a low-pressure economic environment… Whether “Reallocation” Is into Unemployment or a Booming Sector Is Really Important Keynes (1936): “I defend [my policies] … as the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.... If effective demand is deficient... the individual enterpriser who seeks to bring... resources into action is operating with the odds loaded against him. The game of hazard which he plays is furnished with many zeros.... The increment of the world’s wealth… [reduced] by the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune. But if effective demand is adequate, average skill and average good fortune will be enough…" Davis and von Wächter (2011): U-3<6%, mass-layoff workers lose 1.5 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings. U-3>8%, mass-layoff workers lose 3 years' worth of pre-displacement earnings Chodorow-Reich and Wieland (2016): An area with reallocation +1SD -> employment 2% lower at the end of a national recession-recovery cycle. Reallocation has no effect if it occurs during an expansion. The Problem Comes After 2008 The financial-crisis freeze-up of the economy… As housing, exports, investment collapse… And the Recovery Act is undersized by, arithmetically, a factor of 6 And Then We Hit the Economy on the Head with the Austerity Brick, Over and Over Again We also fail to restructure housing finance to encourage construction to help all those people move out of their sisters’ basements. And, with interest rates at zero, the Fed finds no way to signal exports and business investment to take up even more of the slack than they do. Can We Still Recover from the Post-2008 Disaster? We now need to start calling it: “The Longer Depression”… Back in 2009 I said that we obviously will recover, easily. Back in 2012 I said that we could recover—DeLong and Summers—straightforwardly. Now? Gerry Friedman still thinks we could do so. I’m more pessimistic: but I’m not going to argue anything with Gerry until November 15 Nevertheless: worth trying. We should, right now, be desperately trying to generate a higher-pressure economy if only just to see how much low-hanging fruit can be picked via easy aggregate demand-boosting measures Greenspan did it in 1995, and we all were very pleased that he did so. Other Policies? Reversing the causes of the slowdown may not be possible Reversing the causes is unlikely to be the best policy, even if it is possible However, Low-hanging fruit: Generate a high pressure economy. It might work. And it will do good anyway What else? Aside from Strive for a High-Pressure Economy and Hope, What Can We Do? Where is there low-hanging fruit? What are our value-subtracting industries? Finance (we pay 8% of GDP for net services that used to cost 3%) Health care administration (we pay 5% of GDP for services other countries pay 1% for) Mass incarceration (another 2% other countries do not pay) NIMBYism Residential (but how mportant is it outside of SF, BOS, DC?) Occupational (perhaps? More Low-Hanging Fruit Truman started the process of turning the federal government into an entity with a permanently very large military (for good and sufficient reasons, but still). Johnson set in stone the process of turning the federal government into an insurance company too. “An insurance company with a military”—that’s where we are. Is that where we should be? All Growth Comes from “Investment” of Some Kind All growth comes from somewhere: it doesn’t just precipitate out of the air. Net private investment roughly 7% of net domestic product. Other net investment-like activities of equal magnitude—figure 15% of net product devoted to growth, 10% to per capita growth The average net rate of return on those expenditures is 20%/year. There are some investment and investment-like expenditures that offer very high returns indeed. The U.S. Government Could Do Much More In a world that is increasingly non-Smithian, confining government to military, insurance, property rights, and contract enforcement is just silly—even adding in standard infrastructure. Incentivize the private creation of public and information goods: Why is the government so good at committing itself to pay money in the event of failure—loan guarantees—but not success? Prizes—cf., Michael Kremer. Platforms: Why is it Google doing Google Books? Platforms: Isn’t relying on advertising to fund write-once run-everywhere value-in-scale profoundly silly? Let’s Take the Longest Possible View… Pre-1800 (upper left point is 1800-50) “data” Periods from 1000 years down to 50 Impressive, no? This is essentially Michael Kremer’s pre-job market paper from back when Almost all growth is useful ideas Useful ideas are non-excludable Thus two heads are better than one This is not economics: this is numerology… But the basic Michael Kremer two-heads-are-better-than-one model from 1992: Estimated over the pre-1800 period Admittedly with GDP rather than population on the left-hand side Fits our current 2000-2050 forecast Moreover: this is consistent with Gordon’s view that the Second Industrial Revolution was a really big deal 1.25%/year x 100 years of extra growth Exp(1.25) = 3.5 And now that extra 3.5-fold multiplication of global GDP is over But, still, going forward, after the exhaustion of the Second Industrial Revolution. It still looks as though two heads are better than one If world population tops out and stabilizes at 9B in 2050 Then will world real GDP growth stabilize at 6%/year? Thus we have powerful reasons to believe that economic growth is not over—that human brains will continue to be a very valuable idea-generating resource. Provided, of course, we do not blow up the planet. Or cook it. J.

Microsoft could soon add an all-in-one PC to its Surface lineup, filling a gap in the middle of a product range that spans from the svelte Surface Pro 4 tablet to the giant Surface Hub touch screen. That's according to a rumor reported by ZDNet, which says that the new device will be marketed as a consumer version of the business-friendly Hub. Apparently code-named "Cardinal," the new all-in-one could come in a range of screen sizes from 21 to 27 inches. Those sizes would position it well to compete with the Yoga Home 900, which currently dominates the niche market of large touch-enabled home PCs that are equally at home in the living room or kitchen as the office. //Related Articles The Best All-in-One Computers of 2016 Rumors of such a device gained steam earlier this summer, when several publications reported that the all-in-one would sport an Intel "Kaby Lake" processor and go on sale by the end of 2016. ZDNet says the Cardinal will be announced at a hardware event Microsoft has planned for October. The company will also likely refresh its current line of Surface tablets, too. One of the many unanswered questions about a potential Surface all-in-one is whether or not it would include a battery. The Yoga Home 900 does, though with around three hours of battery life, it can't stay unplugged for an extended game of chess or Monopoly. Family gaming is one area where large portable all-in-ones excel: the Yoga Home 900's kickstand collapses so it can be laid flat on a table to serve as a virtual game board. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on future plans for the Surface lineup. Back to top Previous : Saying Farewell to Tekserve and Paying Big Bucks for Tech Hi...

No doubt more and more things will be connected to the internet. However, as I discussed in a previous post, predictions about the scale and pace of growth are inflated. This is partly because the “Internet of Things” is a misnomer. Estimates of the number of things already connected to the internet (2016) are all over the map, ranging from around 6 billion to over 15 billion. The only possible explanation for such a large discrepancy is that forecasters don’t agree about the types of things that qualify. For instance, should a wearable device that uploads data to a smartphone once per day count? Similarly, forecasts for the number of things that will be connected to the internet by 2020 run from 26 billion all of the way up to 50 billion. Analysts become giddy when they realize that there are well over one trillion things that could potentially be connected to the Internet. Though the most optimistic forecasts assume that RFID or NFC tags will be attached to everyday items, and that somehow qualifies them for membership in the Internet of Things. Note that even the most conservative forecasts would require connecting at least 3 billion new things to the internet each year. That works out to more than 8 million things per day. Connecting that many things isn’t impossible -- consumers worldwide buy well over one million gadgets each day. However, it took the mobile phone industry more than 30 years to reach 6 billion total subscriptions. Remember also that forecasters were predicting tens of billions of things would be connected to the internet within five years back in 2004. Not surprising, there is a great deal of confusion about what is meant by the Internet of Things. Ten years ago, it was understood that the Internet of Things referred to machines as distinct from consumer devices. Since then, the dividing line between consumer devices and machines has blurred. Today, your phone is as adept at tracking your motion and location as it is at letting you make and receive calls. Consequently, the Internet of Things now includes not only sensors and actuators in oil pipelines, but components in smartphones and televisions that can be queried or instructed to execute commands. Perhaps that’s why companies such as Cisco, Intel, and Qualcomm talk about the “Internet of Everything.” The Internet of Things lumps together markets at different stages of development that really deserve to be examined separately. It doesn’t help to speak about opportunities in environmental monitoring, health care and transportation as if they are just different facets of one huge market. The buyers, motivations, and application requirements in each of these industries are very different. Understanding and addressing their specific needs is key to success. There are also some technical issues that challenge widespread assumptions about the Internet of Things. While many types of things can benefit from connectivity, they are not necessarily best served by being connected directly to the internet. Arguably, every human being should have internet access, because the internet is a fabulous resource for learning, communicating, and shopping. But not every sensor and actuator needs to be directly connected to the internet. Francis DaCosta, author of Rethinking the Internet of Things, uses the Mars Rover as an illustration. It makes more sense for the Mars Rover to analyze its own sensor data and make on-the-spot navigation decisions than to send the data all the way back to Earth and wait for commands. That doesn’t preclude Earth-based engineers intervening when the Mars Rover isn’t making sufficient progress. However, efficiency, privacy, and security are compelling reasons for keeping as much of the decision-making local as possible. Similarly, requiring every device to support the internet protocol (IP) is self-defeating. Sensors have come down in size, price and power consumption, enabling them to be used more widely. Insisting on IP support adds back cost and complexity. A better arrangement is to permit simple sensors and actuators to communicate with local hubs possessing the intelligence to filter, reformat and package data as needed. What’s driving the connection of things to the internet? Things are used to collect information in the field and apply it where it makes the most difference. It’s this rich flow of information that enables digital business models and digital user experiences. For instance, medical gadgets can be used by patients to detect health problems before hospitalization becomes necessary, to shorten hospital stays, and to reduce readmission rates. Dr. Eric Topol predicts that the continuing advance of medical technology will lead to a future with far fewer hospitals. Hospitals will be mainly for intensive care. There has been too much chatter about the fantastic number of things that will be connected to the internet. Instead, the focus should be on how individual industries can connect the right things to create unprecedented value for customers. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

(InHerSight) Sep 9, 2016 at 12:24PM Image source: Getty Images. Companies are beginning to notice the value in equipping employees with the resources they need to excel in their industries, and that the best way to do that is to offer compelling programs and initiatives to help drive that success. The 50 companies on Fortune's second annual "Change the World" list are doing just that. The lineup, published last week, was compiled based on three criteria: programs with measurable social impact, the business/financial results from the programs, and the degree of innovation the programs carry. These three companies particularly stood out to us for offering unique initiatives aimed at working women not just in the U.S., but worldwide. Gap InHerSight score: 3.3/5. More ratings. Gap (NYSE:GPS) boasts a longtime reputation for promoting gender inclusiveness and diversity. Its high scores on InHerSight reflect this. The company has a 3.9-star rating out of five in both categories of "management opportunities for women" and "equal opportunities for men and women." Gap's Women and Opportunity strategy launched in 2007 to advance gender inclusion, including components like recruitment and talent development programs, flexible working arrangements, and a Diversity and Inclusion Council to ensure the strategy's success. And it has so far. Between 2007 and 2015, women's representation at Gap increased from 44% to 49.7% at the vice president level (globally) and from 33% to 77% for senior leadership levels, and between 2010 and 2015, women working on the company's board of directors increased from 10% to 36%. An essential part of the strategy (and the one praised in Fortune's list) is a program called PACE, or Personal Advancement and Career Enhancement. Its weekly course curriculum provides life skills, education, and technical training for female supply chain workers. Learning opportunities like those offered through PACE are important to women. Seventy-three percent of the over 15,000 women in an InHerSight survey say access to these opportunities is a top benefit they want from employers. Maybe that's why Catalyst reports that more than 30,000 women have participated in the PACE program since 2007. Gap's program is currently expanding to other regions, in stride to reach a million women by 2020. The Coca-Cola Company InHerSight score: 3.2/5. More ratings. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is committed to offering programs and tools to help women succeed personally and professionally, as shown through its above average 3.2-star rating for learning opportunities on InHerSight. In 2010, Coca-Cola launched a program with a goal to help 5 million women entrepreneurs succeed in their businesses, all within 10 years. #5by20 connects local government organizations and multinational NGOs, like UNWomen and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to market-specific resource programs. The program addresses the barriers women face when striving for success in the marketplace. Coca-Cola states that it "offers women access to business skills, training courses, financial services, and connections with peers or mentors, along with the confidence that comes with building a successful business." So far, the program has reached 1.2 million women across 60 countries, Fortune reports. It especially saw success in 2015 and reached over 372,000 women, a 43% increase from the previous year. salesforce.com InHerSight score: 3.5. More ratings. salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) conducted an assessment of 17,000 global employees last year and found that 6.6% needed salary adjustments to more accurately reflect the work they contribute. Salesforce spent $3 million to close this gap, a move that affected some male workers as well. The company has earned a 3.5-star rating on InHerSight for salary satisfaction, higher in comparison to scores for other enterprise software companies like Oracle (2.1 stars), IBM (3.0 stars) and even Intel Corporation (3.4 stars), which made headlines in 2015 for closing its gender pay gap. Of course, fair and equal pay is of great importance to women. According to InHerSight data, 89% of women say that salary satisfaction is a factor they want most from their employers. Additionally, Salesforce launched a leadership initiative that Fortune says helps women "rise through the ranks." The company announced that the "High-Potential Leadership Program" led to a 33% increase in the number of women promoted in 2015. Salesforce also recently increased parental leave to 12 weeks off at 80% of total pay, including base and bonuses, along with a new program to offer new parents the flexibility to work reduced hours (at full pay) for the first four consecutive weeks of returning to work.

 US stocks move lower following a slide in European markets Alex Veiga, Associated Press Sep. 8, 2016, 10:32 AM 52 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE - This Monday, July 6, 2015, file photo shows a sign for Wall Street carved into the side of a building in New York. European stock markets dipped Thursday, Sept. 8, 2016, while the euro struck two-week highs against the dollar after the European Central Bank left its key interest rates unchanged and decided against extending the duration of its bond-buying stimulus program. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) syndication.ap.org U.S. stock indexes fell modestly in early trading Thursday as investors weighed the implications of a decision by the European Central Bank to leave its key interest rates unchanged and hold off on extending a stimulus program. Technology companies, retailers and other consumer-focused stocks were among the biggest decliners. Energy stocks were up the most as oil prices rose. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,467 as of 10:18 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,179. The Nasdaq composite index lost 26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,257. The tech-heavy index set all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. NO ACTION: The European Central Bank decided to leave its key interest rates unchanged. It also said it would not extend the duration of its bond-buying stimulus program. Investors were looking ahead to what ECB President Mario Draghi will say at an upcoming news conference. BAD OUTLOOK: Tractor Supply slumped 16.3 percent after the farm equipment retailer said its business is being hurt by cuts in oil, gas and coal production, declining outlays by farmers and weak spending on wood stoves and heating fuel for this fall and winter. The stock was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 index, shedding $13.57 to $69.69. ROUGH REPORT: Pier 1 Imports tumbled 15.7 percent after the home decor retailer gave weak quarterly guidance and said its president and CEO will be leaving the company at the end of the year by mutual agreement with the board. The stock slid 77 cents to $4.03. DEAL-MAKING: Investors got a dash of tech sector deal news. Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to spin off part of its business software unit to Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion. The pact calls for HP Enterprise to remain majority owner of the new company. Separately, Intel said it will spin its cybersecurity business into a new company called McAfee for $3.1 billion in cash. Private equity firm TPG will invest $1.1 billion in the new company and own a majority stake. Shares in HP Enterprise slid 48 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $21.61, while Intel shed 30 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $36.15. MARKETS OVERSEAS: News of the ECB's decisions weighed on most of major stock indexes in Europe. Germany's DAX was down 1.1 percent, while France's CAC-40 was down 0.8 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.2 percent. Earlier, a report showing that imports rose in China last month for the first time since late 2014, while a contraction in exports narrowed, helped lift some markets in Asia. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong gained 0.8 percent. Seoul's Kospi added 0.1 percent, while India's Sensex rose 0.3 percent to 29,006.18. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.3 percent. ENERGY: Crude oil prices were moving higher following a report indicating a big drop in fuel stockpiles. Benchmark U.S. crude was up 89 cents, or 2 percent, to $46.39 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $48.70 in London. BONDS AND CURRENCIES: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.56 percent from 1.54 percent late Wednesday. In currency markets, the dollar weakened to 101.70 yen from 101.75 on Wednesday. The euro strengthened to $1.1274 from $1.1245.

One of the things that piqued my interest upon entering the International Tent was a number of VR headsets. It could be argued that the headsets that require a smartphone are a dime a dozen, so I scouted around for the VR headsets that were designed to come contained as all-in-one units and offer an untethered experience. A couple of the big names are touting untethered VR, so I asked around at a number of booths to look into the cheaper side of VR. For $100, you don’t get a lot. For an all-in-one Virtual Reality headset, the core components include the screen resolution, screen size, screen quality, the SoC, the memory, the battery, the connectivity (wireless/LTE, USB etc.), the feel and the function of the headset are all key factors to get it right. In the myriad of six/seven headsets I was able to find in a morning at IDF, it was clear that almost all of these areas are gutted into the low-performance rung in order to meet very strict price points. If we nostalgically look back to when Oculus was just starting, there were some clear defined goals that had to be achieved. For the most part they revolved around being to use the headset, eliminate nausea, and provide an immersive user experience. Millions of dollars and several prototypes later gave us the Rift, along with the Vive and other head-mounted displays (HMDs) that rely on a super powerful system behind it. On the other side is Samsung Gear VR, leveraging an already owned premium smartphone with a reasonable element of a headset to house it – the smartphone is at a similar power budget to what you would expect to be the limit in front of the face. What these ‘bargain basement’ headsets try to do is try to provide all the hardware inside the headset, similar to the Gear VR, including SoC and battery and everything else, but for the same price as the Gear VR (minus smartphone). Of course, at the other end is Google Cardboard. The true comparison points to these all-in-one VR systems could be the backpack VR units that house a laptop-like device, but these still require cables. The better comparison is to Intel’s Project Alloy, announced at IDF, or Qualcomm’s new VR820 platform, however both use internal and external cameras as part of a mixed VR/AR concept called mixed reality. We’ve seen other things like the SulonQ, which uses older AMD embedded parts, to provide the horsepower for an untethered VR experience as well. But all three of these are premium devices still in development. The goal of these cheaper headsets is to be super low cost, which also means there’s lots of competition to shave tenths of a cent off of the production costs. As an additional caveat, the makers of these headsets I found on the show floor are the original design manufacturers, or ODMs. They are looking for bigger companies to order thousands of units and brand them under their own name, and subsequently deal with sales and distribution.     Bargain Basement, 1 + 2 + 3 Examining the Malaise of Bargain Basement Virtual Reality Bargain Basement, 1 + 2 + 3 Bargain Basement, 4 + 5 + 6 Going Above $100: The Skyworth AIO-VR, and how VR isn’t a Commodity Yet Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 58 Comments View All Comments nathanddrews - Friday, September 09, 2016 - link So if I had to summarize this article: At its best, VR is really expensive (headset/controller equipment + hardware to run it well) and mostly limited to rail-based shooter games, racing games, and flight sims... and anything less than that is basically not worth doing. I've always love the idea of VR, but it's still too niche for me to invest in right now. Reply BugblatterIII - Friday, September 09, 2016 - link That's not even close to the types of games and experiences that dominate the available content. VR's still finding its feet in terms of what genres port well and what new genres could be created, but the ones you've listed are perhaps the least suited to VR because they're mostly very nausea-inducing. I agree that it's worth going the whole hog though. I had the Gear VR for years and now have the Vive, which is so far above the Gear it's a different species. Reply Mr Perfect - Friday, September 09, 2016 - link It's the on-rails bit that kills it for me. Why can't they just have a thumstick on one of the hand held controllers to handle X Y movement? It's otherwise quite fun. Reply prisonerX - Friday, September 09, 2016 - link Because people don't want to throw up. Reply theduckofdeath - Monday, September 12, 2016 - link Yeah ,you need the movement sensors in the HMD or you shouldn't have any. Unless you have flawless hand to eye coordination that is, then a joystick can replace that. But, that person does not exist, I think. :D Reply mkozakewich - Monday, September 12, 2016 - link From my experience playing Minecraft on the Rift DK1, it's not really the character movement that causes motion sickness. For me, it was the jittering when I turned my head. I eventually adapted to keeping my head still and using only the mouse to "turn" my head. The abstraction worked for me, because I'm used to playing video games, but I suppose one of the main draws of VR is in having that kind of control. So movement is possible, but you do need high frame-rates if you want to let players look around with their head without causing nausea. Reply sonicmerlin - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link You really think your experience applies when you've only tried the very first prototype? Reply Flunk - Friday, September 09, 2016 - link I suspect these headsets aren't designed for the US market, but rather the Chinese market, where the vast majority of customers couldn't possibly afford a Rift or Vive and the $2000 PC to power it. Reply xype - Friday, September 09, 2016 - link To be fair, I don’t know many people (I’m living western Europe) who can afford a Rift or Vive and the $2000 PC to power it, either. Or, those I do know, aren’t interested in the least—even though they would all classify as geeks. Sure, they’ll try it out at a show/convention, exclaiming "Neat!", but once the headset is off, "Not $3k neat, though…". Reply sphigel - Friday, September 09, 2016 - link If these "geeks" don't already own at least a good portion of the $2000 computer required for VR then they really aren't geeks are they? Most people interested in VR already have powerful gaming rigs. Yes, you might need a video card upgrade but that's about it. It's a bit disingenuous to say that VR costs $3k to get into.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    With interest rates stuck near zero and a moribund central bank refusing to aggressively raise interest rates, stocks remain the best investment opportunity in town. But that’s no guarantee that the market will keep going up. Nothing moves in a straight line. Chances are good we’ll see another market selloff before the end of the year. Besides the usual annual seasonal volatility, there’s the election. If anything, this election looks like a referendum on 2008. It’s not just the Obama presidency, but all his policies from bailouts to overly dovish central bankers. So watch out. Be prepared for bigger swings in your portfolio. Even if we get another 10-percent decline in stocks, that’s still a lot to spook out investors and cause some headaches for leveraged traders. But it’s also an opportunity, and one that shouldn’t go to waste. I’ve been talking for weeks about creating a buy list for the next market decline. But let’s get specific. I’m looking for companies with strong moats. In investing, a moat is some kind of competitive advantage that one company has over all its competitors. Moats can be wide, like a software company with proprietary technology. Think Google’s dominance of search engines. A moat can be narrow, like Wal-Mart’s (WMT) cost advantage over other retailers. While the firm typically competes to win on price, it often loses out on quality or customer experience. As a result, their profit margins are narrow. Hence the small moat. Some moats allow companies to continue expanding at a rapid rate for years. Other moats simply allow companies to generate lots of cash that they can’t reinvest in their core business, leaving lots of capital to give back to shareholders. A company that can consistently generate substantial amounts of revenue above and beyond its costs has a moat. If that moat is something like a brand, where investors will pay up for the name versus a generic substitute, then the company can also keep hiking prices as the years roll by. That makes them insulated from inflation, since it’s consumers paying the higher costs instead. For instance, at the right price, investors can pay up for The Hershey Company (HSY). The company’s strong brand and position in the U.S. chocolate market give it a strong moat. That’s why shares are almost always conventionally expensive when using traditional investment metrics like the price to earnings ratio. Now is a time to think about companies with strong moats. Those that have the proven earnings power to get through tough times, ideally rewarding shareholders in the process. They should also have some kind of potential catalyst that can be a boost to earnings down the road as well. For instance, Hershey has very little exposure to the international chocolate market. A push there could give their sales a huge boost. With a rise in the global middle class, millions of people escaping poverty can enjoy little luxuries like chocolate bars on a regular basis. Just bear in mind, however, that there are times when shares will get even more expensive. That’s where a covered call writing strategy comes into play. Going back to the Hershey example, shares vaulted back in July when Mondelez Foods (MDZ) made an offer to buy out the company. The offer fell through in August, sending shares back down again. That round trip return in shares could have bene offset in a few ways. Those who took profits got cashed out, and can now buy back shares where they were trading just a few months ago. Those who took a buy and hold strategy ended up about the same as well. But investors who covered their position by writing a call option could have kept shares and gotten some extra income too. In today’s environment, it’s not a bad way to stay invested. Either markets will trend higher and you’ll get called away, or markets stay flat or go down and you raise some cash for the next opportunity. What does matter is using the power of these economic moats to your advantage. That means being willing to pay up going in. It also means keeping an eye for the right companies to hit the right price. There’s no right answer there, either. You could wait for a company to trade at the historically high-end of its dividend yield if you’re looking for an income play. A few opportunities emerged in that space back in February when markets sold off. For instance, investors could have bought a sector-dominating company like Intel (INTC) with a dividend yield of 3.7 percent. Today, Intel’s yield is 2.88 percent. That’s still better than the average S&P 500 stock, but not by much. It’s a company with a good moat, but you need more than that to get great returns. You need patience. Or you could wait for a company with a promising new product to fall out of favor first. Wireless chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has been out of favor since last year when it got hit with a $1 billion anti-trust claim by the Chinese government. But they paid the fine, are growing in China, and their latest Snapdragon chips are selling well. Shares also yielded almost 4 percent near the bottom earlier this year. But remember, a moat isn’t a financial metric per se. Yet evidence of a moat can show up on a company’s statistics in terms of high profit margins or return on invested capital (ROIC). But it’s also a subjective, intangible quality reflecting a company’s brand and earnings power. When looking for the next investment opportunity, look beyond the numbers and what a company does. Think about what it does differently than its competitors. Favorable differentiations play a huge role in long-term investment returns.   Andrew Packer is a Senior Financial Editor with Newsmax Media.

Amit Yoran Credit: RSA More like this Cisco CEO Robbins: Wait til you see what’s in our innovation pipeline VCE chief boasts of hyperconvergence superpower IBM cloud chief: The next phase of cloud is a race to add value Video Samsung Galaxy Note7 iris scanner review RSA Amit Yoran Enterprises should expect business as usual from RSA in the wake of its being swept up by Dell this week in the largest tech deal ever, with company executives saying it will retain a good deal of autonomy to carry out its strategic plans. Those plans call for further R&D into what the company regards as its three main building blocks: authentication and identity, analytics and putting security incidents into a business context, says RSA CEO Amit Yoran. RSA is focused and in control of its own destiny whose mission remains unchanged, he says, and has Michael Dell’s OK to develop both within the stable of Dell holdings but also with the strategic partners RSA has cultivated over the years. What will that mean for businesses? “What I think customers should expect to see is it’s businesses as usual, that we continue to execute and drive the strategy that we have been for the past couple of years around this notion of business-driven security,” says Grant Geyer, senior vice president of product for RSA. That strategy might not be apparent to customers, though, according to the company’s chief marketing officer Holly Rollo, who joined RSA this spring. “I think over the last handful of years [that] hasn’t really been happening. Great brand, innovative but unknown technology,” Rollo says. The executives made their remarks during a phone briefing with press an analysts the day after Dell finalized its $63 billion purchase of EMC, which includes RSA. “Dell has provided RSA and the other businesses the ability to maintain our own partner programs and partner ecosystems,” Geyer says. “This is all about ensuring our customers are getting what they need in terms of support.” One such area is looking at security from a business perspective. Yoran says CISOs are trying to demonstrate how security investments are paying off in helping organizations reach business goals, and that is something RSA is trying to do. CISOs need help translating increased security investment into its impact on corporate risk. In general, the Dell deal gives RSA access to a broad range of technologies now under the Dell umbrella, Yoran says, but he didn’t specify any. “I think there is the natural upside of having the broader ecosystem of Dell Technologies from a leverage and relationship standpoint. You never hear any large enterprise CIO or other executive say I’d prefer to work with more vendors on more siloed issues vs having a broader platform and more strategic partner at the table working with me on my key business drivers and issues. I think we’re extremely well positioned and situated and I think having that broader relationship in enterprises will be helpful.” Yoran commented on another big security shakeup this week, the spin out of Intel Security from Intel as an entity to be called McAfee. “I think this is a great move from an RSA-EMC-Dell perspective, and I won’t really speculate at this point on what the go-forward plans for Intel Security are. Leave it at that,” he says. But apparently he thinks McAfee lacks RSA's broader portfolio.“As I said earlier I don’t talk to I don’t think I’ve spoken to a single CIO, CEO or CISO that says I want to work with more vendors in more silos in a stove-pipe fashion.” He says he would be surprised if the private equity firm that will own 51 percent of the spin-out company, TPG, doesn’t cut costs at McAfee. He says he thinks highly of Chris Young, who is slated to become McAfee’s CEO. “I think it will be very interesting to see how this unfolds over the next couple of years,” he says.    This story, "RSA: Expect business as usual now that Dell owns it" was originally published by Network World.

In late October, Microsoft will reportedly be taking the wraps off a Surface Device that can turn your desk into a full-fledged 'studio'. The device is currently codenamed 'Cardinal' and will run Windows 10. It is alleged to be coming in three different screen sizes - 21-inch, 24-inch and 27-inch. This is probably the consumer version of the Surface Hub Microsoft demonstrated, the multi-touch collaborative device that uses Perceptive Pixel Screen Technology. Microsoft had submitted a patent for an all-in-one modular PC in 2015 and it is probably the manifestation of that very patent. The AIO Surface PC will run on the new Intel Kaby Lake processors and will be positioned for the living rooms. It will be combining a display with high-end hardware into one single device that will be designed to be as elegant as a premium appliance or furniture. In addition to this, Microsoft will also officially endorse a bunch of OEM devices at the event. However, the promised Surface Book 2 and Surface Pro 5 aren't going to be revealed until spring 2017. The Surface Phone too will be coming out much later. Last year, Microsoft used its October 6 event to unveil the Surface Book, Surface Pro 4, Microsoft Band 2.0 and the Lumia 950 and 950 XL smartphones. This year, the company might be announcing a refreshed Surface Tablet with newer, faster processors and some other minor feature updates.

The study, commissioned by Dell, has been conducted among over 2,500 respondents from 11 countries globally, Dell announced in a press statement. The study highlighted eight measurable business improvements as a result of future-ready IT adoption and it tracked over a three-year period from 2012 to 2015. Based on the ranking, IDC has classed 16 per cent of all companies as Current Focused; 32 percent are Future Aware; one-third are Future Focused, while 18 percent are Future Creators. Future Creators are the most future-ready enterprises who lead with agile platforms and big data, while Current Focused organizations are defined as those that are still focused on traditional IT or still at the beginning of their technology journey, the statement said.  “The Future Ready Enterprise Index has shown that the most future-ready organisations are able to successfully promote agility, scalability, and innovation in their business through the adoption of converged infrastructures, cloud, big data and analytics (BDA) solutions,” said Anothai Wetthayakorn, Managing Director, Dell Corporation (Thailand) and General Manager for Dell Indo-China. “Mapping out four different stages in the future-ready journey, the white paper clearly highlights that being a ‘Future Creator’ in Asia Pacific is a clear competitive advantage, while staying ‘Current Focused’ tends to be a competitive disadvantage. Businesses that pay attention to where they are on their journey and adapt suitable practices within their unique business context will make the most of their technology investment.”  The study suggested that organisations need real-time visibility to make effective decisions for successful business outcomes. As customer touch-points proliferate and new ways of capturing performance are introduced, organizations are looking for solutions that can cross and bridge multiple data types and sources so that they have the right data at their fingertips, at the right time to make the right decisions. Traditionally, such solutions do not exist off-the-shelf, and require specialized expertise to conceptualize and develop, according to the press statement. The Future Ready Enterprise Index has found that Current Focused organizations have little or no BDA strategy, and any BDA outputs typically have little or no influence on decision makers. In contrast, Future Creators have implemented enterprise-wide BDA strategy, with findings treated seriously by decision makers. Specifically in Asia Pacific, 98 percent of decision-makers from organizations which are “Future Creators” have access to BDA at the right time to a significant event compared to 58 percent of executives at a Current Focused organization. This has led to faster organizational reaction time to business events or changes, which has driven improved business outcomes throughout the company. Additionally, the white paper found that business units at Current Focused organizations do not execute IT-led cloud strategies, but instead use public Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) on an ad hoc basis. In contrast, Future Creators maintain cross-cloud catalogs, plus audit/security and data control. Specific to APJ, over 50 percent of “Future Creator” organizations noted that cloud adoption has enabled BDA within their business, and most have seen more effective use of infrastructure and data resources. These have allowed the respondents to track usage and performance, leading to greater productivity and optimized outputs across the organization. An example of a “Future Creator” organization that have successfully deployed cloud technologies to better utilize its IT and data resources is Samitivej Hospital in Bangkok. The leading private healthcare provider in Thailand operates a network of facilities and employs 3,000 healthcare professionals. Samitivej Hospital has embarked on the future-ready journey by upgrading its IT infrastructure, such as data centre storage, Cloud Computing and Data Recovery. This enabled the institution to deliver better, faster, and more cost-effective patient services. Heterogeneous IT infrastructures have become increasingly complex, leading to higher total cost of ownership, more time spent on management and maintenance, and slowdowns in service delivery. As organizations grow, new technology is often incompatible with the existing infrastructure, requiring rip-and-replace upgrades that come with steep learning curves and uncertain returns on investment (ROI). “Future Creator” respondents from Asia Pacific highlighted greater resource utilization, greater IT staff productivity, improved business agility and flexibility to adapt to changes in the market as the top four benefits of hyper-converged infrastructures within the organization. The results are clear: adopting advanced technologies which enable future readiness can benefit businesses, but organizations which are structured to be the most future ready, the Future Creators, benefit the most. By leveraging technologies such as cloud, converged infrastructure and BDA, organizations of any size can turn IT into a proactive business driver and achieve better business outcomes, Dell said in the statement. At the same time, Dell also revealed findings from the Future Workforce Study commissioned by Dell and Intel, which identifies the global technology trends shaping the modern workplace. The findings show that many employees believe their current workplace is not effectively making use of the latest technology advances, but expect them to do so as remote work is increasingly viewed as providing both quality of life and productivity benefits. Almost half of global employees believe their current workplace is not smart enough, while 42 percent of millennial employees say they are willing to quit their job if office technologies are not up to their standard. Therefore, the addition of collaborative tools and innovative technologies, such as internet of things (IoT) and Virtual Reality (VR), will soon become vital to the workplace of the near future. The 2016 Future Workforce Study, polled nearly 4,000 full-time employees from small, medium and large businesses in 10 countries, and exposed that over half (57 percent) of all employees believe they will be working in a smart office within the next five years, while 51 percent believe that better technologies will make face-to-face meetings redundant within the next five years. The research shows that the influx of new technology is having a significant impact on what workers expect from their employer, and that workplaces which don’t enact these new advances will be left behind. "The workplace is reaching a tipping point. Today’s workers have a growing expectation that their employers integrate the latest technologies seamlessly and securely into their working lives," said Anothai. "Employees have seen first-hand the ways new technologies can help them do their jobs better, and are hungry to use the latest advancements to be more productive. While this may seem daunting, it’s a business-critical opportunity for companies to be at the forefront of the future workplace and enable the future workforce."   Tags future-ready Dell Most Viewed TODAY LAST 7 Days LAST 30 Days In meeting with Prajin, Facebook reiterates firm stand on users’ pri...

Join For Free Start coding today to experience the powerful engine that drives data application’s development, brought to you in partnership with Qlik. The Need for Speed in Web Applications Often, web applications are slower than we would like them to be. Companies like Google and Facebook have in-house solutions for speeding up their applications. There is a need for a third-party tool that we developers can use to achieve something similar, without needing to spend hours to optimize the code and the database. The last couple of months, I have been busy contributing to a project that speeds up the response times and also makes it much easier to develop the back end parts of web applications. The project is named Ext Speeder and was developed together with Sencha, the company behind Ext JS. It allows Ext JS developers to speed up their data grids more than 10 times. Automatically Generated Back End  All back end developers know that there is a lot of work to connect a front end application to the back end. Some of the tasks are to model the database, secure connections, parse HTTP command, deserialize parameters, manage database connections, convert into SQL, optimize queries, parse database response, format into JSON, write XML config, deploy in Java EE, and finally verify all the code. Depending on the project, this may take a couple of days or even several weeks We have created a tool that connects to an existing database and extracts the schema model so that back-end code can be generated automatically. Indeed, there is no need for writing a single line of back-end code in most situations. If we have special requirements (like adding our own models to the existing data), it is easy to add or modify the code that was generated by the Ext Speeder tool. Check out this 1.5-minute video by a guy that holds the current world record in developing and deploying a Sencha Ext JS application with the tool (he does it in less than 1.5 minutes). Can it be done faster? How Much Faster Does It Get? When an Ext Speeder application is started, it can pull in data we have selected into an in-JVM-memory store so that data can be accessed and processed much faster. Data is also organized in a column-oriented way. Thanks to that, sorting and filtering on a column can be done in nanoseconds rather than in seconds. Because Ext Speeder can use an off-heap storage engine, we can pull in an almost unlimited amount of data. An Ext Speeder application can easily handle one hundred million elements. Ext Speeder can also refresh the in-memory data periodically in the background, so that we will see the latest data in the database. Giving fair benchmark figures is always hard. To give you an idea, we took an existing public database containing a large number of medical doctors in the US with over 40 million elements and stored them in a standard MySQL server (version 5.6.29) with indexes added to the relevant columns. We then compared typical web access patterns containing sorting, filtering and paging with Ext Speeder versus using the MySQL database directly. On average, Ext Speeder was more than 100 times faster. Figure 1, Latency, Ext Speeder vs MySQL standard (less is better) for one of the sub-test We used the following setup for the tests: PropertyValue Computer Lenovo CPU Intel i7-4720HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz RAM 16 GB OS Windows 10 Database MySQL Version 5.6.29 std. install Test Tool Apache JMeter What is the real-life gain with such speed improvements, in reality? Well, imagine a web user that is used to waiting some seconds between each interaction. Now that person could suddenly get immediate feedback and the site would feel much more responsive. Check out this 1-minute video to see the difference. The REST API Request The tool is using a standard REST API for querying. If we have a database table named 'doctor', then we can query it like this: http://localhost:4567/MyProject/doctor?
    callback=cb&
    start=10&
    limit=100&
    sort=[{"property":"last_name","direction":"ASC"}]&
    filter=[{"property":"graduation_year","operator":"lt","value":"1970"}] This will retrieve doctors that graduated before 1970 sorted by last name starting at the 10:th such doctors and limiting the result to at most 100 physicians. On my laptop, the round trip REST call was completed in less than 0.04 seconds (A human would not notice that kind of delay). The "sort" attribute can contain several columns so that sorting can be done in many levels. The 'filter' attribute can be composed of several filters so that several conditions can be applied. We can use the operators Equals ("eq"), Not Equals ("ne"), Less Than ("lt"), Less or Equal ("le"), Greater Than ("gt"), Greater or Equals ("ge"), and Contains ("like"). Response The response to the request above is a JSON string that contains all the matching doctors in the given order. This also makes it very easy to interface with other languages like JavaScript, PHP, or C#. This is an example of how a response might look like (with limit=2 to reduce size): cb({

  ]
}); The 'total' property in the response indicates how many of the rows actually matched the filter (in total) so that data grids can set the appropriate scroll bar location and size. How Does It Look? This is how an Ext JS data grid application might look like with an Ext Speeder back end: Deployment Deployment is easy. Either deploy an Ext Speeder application as a stand-alone application (just run its main Java method) or deploy it as a Java EE application (upload the self-contained WAR file to the server). Any Java EE server would do. For example Tomcat, Glassfish or Oracle WebLogic. This way, the application can automatically benefit from features such as company security policies, authentication, encryption, load balancing etc. Try It for Free!

For many of us whose computer coming-of-age story spanned across the 80s and 90s, we remember it, fondly or not, as the gateway into our computers. But somewhere along the way, DOS gave way to graphical environments, and some of us opted to move to open source alternatives. But in the free software world, DOS is still alive and well in the form of FreeDOS, an open source operating system maintained by Jim Hall and a team of dedicated developers who are keeping the DOS legacy alive well into the twenty-first century. And more than simply an existing code base, FreeDOS is still being actively developed and is approaching a new release in the near future ("When it's ready," according to Jim). FreeDOS has proved to be an important tool to numerous legacy applications powering critical systems which were never migrated to a more modern operating system. I caught up with Jim to learn more about the FreeDOS project and where it's headed in this interview. It's 2016. Who's still using DOS? We did a survey a few years ago, and found there are three types of people who use FreeDOS today: People who play classic DOS games. Sure, you can play DOS games in something like DOSBox, and some classic games have been ported to Linux (for example, DOOM) but there are a large number of us who still like to play DOS games on a DOS system. That's often how I play some of the old DOS games I loved.   People who run legacy business applications. There may not be as many of these people in 2016, but they're still there! We don't know if these are FreeDOS or some other DOS, but there's the car company that uses an old Compaq laptop running DOS software to service luxury McLaren F1 cars and the South Australian Government is still running their electronic health records on a DOS-based system. Probably my favorite example is author George R.R. Martin (author of the 'Game of Thrones' series) writes all his books and manuscripts on a DOS computer, running the WordStar word processor. Over the years, I've heard from a few other individuals who say they used FreeDOS at work to bring up an old DOS program so they could grab data from an old data file. Actually, we did that at my previous job, at the University of Minnesota Morris. One of our faculty had a 3.5-inch floppy that had some old research data on it, and the modern Windows programs couldn't read it. We installed FreeDOS on a computer and downloaded a 1990s DOS shareware program that could read that kind of file, and were able to export the data into a text file.   People who develop embedded systems. DOS used to be a very popular platform to run embedded systems. So if you support an older embedded system, you might be running DOS. And FreeDOS can fit in very well. At least one developer contacted me a few years ago to say the embedded system he writes for is running on FreeDOS. I thought that was great! How does FreeDOS fit into the ecosystem of other projects enabling users to run legacy programs, like DOSBox and Wine? There are certainly a number of people who choose to use DOSBox to play classic DOS games. And that's fine. But DOSBox is really geared for playing games; it doesn't do as well with many business applications. For these, you'll need an actual DOS system, either running inside a virtual machine like DOSEmu, QEMU, VMWare, and others, or running on actual hardware. It depends on what you need. DOSBox has been making great progress in supporting DOS games, but there are still a few that don't run well or at all (yet) on DOSBox. If you aren't able to play the game in DOSBox, you might try it on FreeDOS. Wine is a different thing, of course. Wine allows you to run Windows programs on Linux (and other Unix, like BSD) by translating the Windows calls to Unix calls. They don't aim to run DOS programs on Linux, for example. You've been working on this project for over two decades. How do you avoid burnout and attract new contributors to the project? Someone pointed out to me that I have been working on FreeDOS for longer than MS-DOS was a thing. That was probably the first time I'd realized how long we've been working on FreeDOS. A lot of us are just really into programming, and we like working on DOS because it's a great little system that people still use for things. Personally, I need to take breaks from the project every once in a while so I don't get burned out. You need a vacation from anything, really. But for me, "taking a break" is really not paying attention to email for a week, then I usually get right back into things. My hands-on work in FreeDOS has changed over the years, too. In the beginning, I wrote a lot of code. I wrote most of the original FreeDOS file utilities. For the other utilities, if I didn't write the first version, I probably contributed to the code in some way. I wrote a lot of libraries, like the Cats library (now called "Kitten") which is a DOS version of the Unix catgets (catalog get string) function family. This is what allows FreeDOS to support multiple languages, just by changing a DOS environment variable. And I wrote the first FreeDOS installer, which we used (with updates from others) through the FreeDOS 1.1 distribution. These days, I do very little coding. I manage the website, take care of the wiki, respond to emails, do our social media, that sort of thing. I may not be writing DOS code, but I'm writing PHP or Bash or other scripting languages to keep things running behind the scenes. I'm doing all the other things that need doing in an open source software project to keep things moving. So I guess the answer to your first question is: I avoid burnout by going where my interests decide to take me. For attracting new developers, it's basically the same today that it was in 1994. I talk about FreeDOS whenever I get the chance, I showcase what our developers are doing, I highlight the cool things that people are doing with FreeDOS. People will only become interested in open source software projects that are being maintained, where people are active, and where contributors are recognized. And you don't have to be a developer to contribute to FreeDOS (but these days, most contributors are developers). What can people expect from FreeDOS 1.2 compared to its predecessor? We had a series of discussions about what the next version after "FreeDOS 1.1" should look like. For a while there, I thought the next version should be "2.0" and that we should change a bunch of things, think about what DOS should look like in 2016. I thought FreeDOS should become more "modern" and include more Unix-like functionality. I thought that kind of crossover would be interesting to new developers, and make FreeDOS something new. But after a while, others convinced me that this was taking FreeDOS too far. The beauty of FreeDOS is that it's just DOS, and DOS isn't meant to be that complicated. DOS should be simple. DOS is and was always meant to be a simple operating system. DOS isn't that complicated. That's what makes DOS so appealing; the overhead is small, it's easy to figure out, and it's quick to set up and get running. So other FreeDOS developers convinced me to drop the "modern DOS" idea. And they were right. The next FreeDOS needed to be simple, and it needed to remain "DOS." We decided that the next version should be "1.2" and include mostly updates. Calling this version "1.2" meant we were just making an updated version of FreeDOS. No big changes. Nothing dramatic. We dropped or added packages where that makes sense, but mostly you'll see the same kind of things in FreeDOS 1.2 that you saw in FreeDOS 1.1. However, one new thing you'll see in FreeDOS 1.2 is the updated installer. I wrote the original FreeDOS install program back in 1997 and 1998, to create the FreeDOS Beta 1 distribution (called "0.1" on Wikipedia, but really this is more properly called the FreeDOS Beta 1 "Orlando" distribution). The original FreeDOS installer was pretty straightforward, a way to select packages (like CHOICE, PAUSE, etc) and package "sets" (like BASE for just the packages that provide the same functionality as MS-DOS, EDIT for the extra editors, DEVEL for the development kits, and so on). Over time, we've updated the FreeDOS installer to provide different options or to make it more flexible. But the core of the installer hasn't changed that much. When we started work on FreeDOS 1.2, I was very insistent that we update the installer. I realized the old installer had become too complicated. But DOS isn't that complicated; the installer should be very straightforward. I wanted the new installer to provide only a few prompts, like if you want to install everything or just the basic "DOS" parts, or if you wanted to install source code, and the installer would take things from there. And to do this, we didn't need a compiled installer. We could easily script it by using a few clever DOS power tools, like utilities to prompt the user for input, etc. Jerome Shidel volunteered to write the updated FreeDOS installer, and he did a great job with it! The new installer is very simple, for both new and old users. If you've used DOS for a long time, the installer will feel very familiar. If this is your first time installing FreeDOS, you'll have an easy time, just answer a few prompts. What will the next version beyond FreeDOS 1.2 look like? We haven't decided if the next version after 1.2 will be 1.3 or 2.0. I think if we continue to include the utilities that we include today, and in the same package sets (BASE, EDIT, etc) the next version will be 1.3. If we decide to change how we organize things, or change what kinds of utilities we include, then maybe the next version will be 2.0. But future FreeDOS versions will still be for Intel or Intel-compatible PCs. We aren't planning to add multitasking or 32-bit support or anything like that. FreeDOS is just DOS, and will remain that way. How has running FreeDOS impacted your career? How does working on an open source "side project" for so many years differ from being able to work on open source fulltime? Working on open source software projects has intersected in interesting ways with my day job. I've been using and contributing to open source software since about 1993, so for the last 23 years. A few years ago, I decided to get a master's degree. As part of that program, I studied usability testing. I made "open source software" the focus of my usability project, specifically looking at Firefox, Nautilus, and Gedit. Studying the usability of open source software sparked a new interest in me, and I focused my master's capstone on the usability of open source software. My capstone project included a usability test of several GNOME applications: Gedit, Web, Nautilus, Software, and Notes. Today, I have turned that interest into a blog about open source software and usability. I mentored interns doing usability testing in GNOME for a few cycles of Outreachy (formerly GNOME Outreach Program for Women). Then the university where I worked asked me to teach a class on usability. And I did! (CSCI 4609 Processes, Programming, and Languages: Usability of Open Source Software at the University of Minnesota Morris.) So I finally got to make part of my day job working in open source software. Even though I've moved on to a new role in government, the university recently asked me to teach the class again. I would love to teach the class again. My regular day job is leading IT (today I'm a CIO), and I would say my background in open source software has made me more receptive to open source software in the enterprise. This goes way back in my career, even when I was a young Unix systems administrator in my first job.I've implemented open source software at every organization I've worked for. Most significantly, I once migrated a web registration system supporting over 65,000 students from a three-node IBM supercomputer to a ten-node cluster of Linux servers. We had better system reliability and performance, and we saved almost a million dollars! Today's IT leaders need to embrace open source software. You can't say no to open source software just because you've had a comfortable time with Windows your whole career. The future is open source, and IT leaders need to go there. I assume you don't run FreeDOS as your primary operating system fulltime. What modern tools do you use, and how has this influenced your work on FreeDOS? No, I don't run FreeDOS as my primary system. That would really be impressive! I run Linux at home. My laptop is a Lenovo X1 Carbon (first gen) running Fedora 24 with GNOME 3. The tools I use every day include: Google Chrome, Firefox, and GNOMEWeb to browse the web; Gedit to edit text or simple code (such as Bash); GNU Emacs to edit program code (I prefer C); GNOME Terminal to SSH to my personal server and to the FreeDOS website; RhythmBox to listen to music. I run FreeDOS in a virtual machine. I use DOSEmu if I'm writingFreeDOS code, so I can use GNU Emacs on Linux to write code and immediately compile it in FreeDOS via DOSEmu. That's really convenient because DOSEmu maps a folder in your home directory as the C: drive. If I need to run FreeDOS as though it's running on hardware, such as testing the upcoming FreeDOS 1.2 release, I use qemu.

I tried to throw together a freedos modified rescue disc w spinrite and such(I had all my pascal tools on an image) but I cant throw himem or cdrom access into working. so as a rescue disc, or a bios update disc, its almost useless. you can boot a virtualized floppy. and as per the dev: qemu is nice but doesnt mimic the real hardware like you think it does, especially newer hardware. with qemu vs vbox you can simluate your real hardware--even dedicate it to qemu but, the ther system hardware components just dont mesh. You are using dated specs, as if using freedos on dated hardware. --which is fine. but it does squat for people with newer, recent hardware, which as you said-- runs fedora most likely. also: (although its an extention) we need support for dpmi and 32 bit but if the core doesnt want to develop for it, fine. my x86 assembler is rusty when it comes to dpmi and such.

And as actual RAM amount is very big, and, especially gamers, had a lot of trouble maximizing what we had with programs like QEMM, with RAM maximized as default to be able to run any old DOS game without any RAM amount problem. And as Dosbox has front end databases a good front end for games in order to let young people to enjoy those old but still good enough games. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Askfor on 12 Sep 2016 Permalink DR DOS was supposed to be the future of DOS, but Microsoft illegally prevented it from happening. It was, sort of, natural course of DOS evolution with multitasking and high memory access. Perhaps FreeDOS people should reconsider it. I have been using Novell DOS for a while, which was DR DOS re-branded. Its multitasking capability helped me solve some problems back then. Digital Research also created a desktop environment called GEM which influenced Atari, Apple and Windows 3.1. GEM was very easy to learn and use. I wish there is a similar software for Linux today, to help inexperienced users. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Eric Paul Goldie on 22 Sep 2016 Permalink Thank you, great read.

Hardware makers have stopped making DOS audio drivers and refuse to now even though it would be very simple. They obey microsloth and likely only offer the specs to linux developers because it's so widely used. I would love to have a DOS-only computer for certain things, but the lack of audio makes that infeasible. Yes, one can scour used hardware shops for Soundblaster cards or buy cheap SB16 compatibles from China, but those require a tower to stick it in. For those who have to live with laptops with sound chips for various reasons (i.e. portability, space, etc.), that's not an option. reply Vote up! 0 Vote down! 0 Comment now Login or Register to earn points for your comments.

A slide in technology and consumer-focused companies helped pull U.S. stock indexes modestly lower Thursday, offsetting strong energy sector gains. A broad swath of retailers, from department stores to fast-food chains, also notched losses, while most of the big gainers were oil production and drilling companies. They got a boost from a report indicating fuel stockpiles fell precipitously last week. The price of U.S. crude also jumped on the report, and closed nearly 5 percent higher. U.S. bond yields surged, as traders reacted to the European Central Bank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged and hold off on extending a stimulus program. Still, in the absence of any major new economic data, the stock indexes continued a recent pattern of mostly sluggish trading. “It's been many, many days since we've had a substantive move either to the upside or the downside in the market,” said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. “It still feels like a holiday week.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 46.23 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,479.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 4.86 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,181.30. The sell-off in technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 24.44 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,259.48. The tech-heavy index set all-time highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. Apple slid 2.6 percent a day after the consumer electronics giant introduced its newest slate of products, including a new iPhone that doesn't come with an analog headphone jack. The stock shed $2.84 to $105.52. Investors also got a dash of tech sector deal news. Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to spin off part of its business software unit to Micro Focus in a deal valued at $8.8 billion. The pact calls for HP Enterprise to remain majority owner of the new company. Shares in HP Enterprise slid 71 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $21.38. Separately, Intel said it will spin its cybersecurity business into a new company called McAfee for $3.1 billion in cash. Private equity firm TPG will invest $1.1 billion in the new company and own a majority stake. Intel slipped 2 cents to $36.44. All told, technology stocks were the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, shedding 0.9 percent. The sector is up 9.1 percent this year. “The tech sector has been strong and outside of today continues to be strong,” said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. Several oil drilling and production companies rose on the oil stockpiles figures, pushing the S&P 500's energy sector 1.7 percent higher. The sector is up 17.4 percent this year. Chesapeake Energy rose 93 cents, or 13.7 percent, to $7.74, the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 index. Diamond Offshore Drilling gained $1.43, or 9 percent, to $17.40. Murphy Oil climbed $1.90, or 6.8 percent, to $29.75. The news out of the European Central Bank helped ease demand for U.S. bonds, driving their prices lower and pushing yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.60 percent from 1.54 percent late Wednesday. More Business Cozy retirement?

Stick It In (or On) Your Ear Analyst Says iPhone SE Was a One-Off for Apple View All Editorials → iPhones Are Now Faster than Macs John Kheit Sep 8th, 2016 7:55 PM EST | Devil's Advocate It’s official—well at least according to reported Geekbench scores spotted in the wild! iPhones are now faster than Macs! The latest, and most recently updated, 2016 12” MacBook is slower than the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 Plus’s A10 processor scored impressively: Geekbench Test for iPhone 7 Plus Whereas the fastest listed 2016 Apple 12” MacBook 1.1GHz model scored: Geekbench Test for 2016 MacBook The iPhone 7 Plus even bests the fastest top-of-the-line 2016 MacBook 1.3GHz model in single core performance: Geekbench Test for 2016 MacBook Somewhat less surprising, the iPhone’s A10 processor also bests the iPad Pro’s very fast A9X chip. Will Apple Move Mac to ARM? This should ignite speculation about the future of the Mac and whether Apple should start using its A10 chip in Macs. One could imagine a Mac with an A10 processor, not only performing faster than with its current Intel processor, but having a significantly longer battery life as well. Imagine the iPhone’s power efficient processor hooked up to a giant MacBook battery. You could conceivably have laptops with 24hr battery capacities. Maybe longer. This would also dramatically lower Apple’s costs, as the company would no longer have to pay Intel for its x86 processors. This is a somewhat historic and interesting watershed moment for the iPhone and the Mac. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 9 Comments Add a comment geoduck September 8, 2016 Perhaps this says as much about the MacBook and its capabilities as it does the iPhone7…? September 8, 2016 at 8:40 EST PM John Kheit September 8, 2016 True and good point geoduck. That said. the 1.3ghz macbook model is slightly faster to about even on speed for multicore, and about 18% slower on single core than the iPhone 7 plus…but I’ve been eyeing the 1.3ghz model because it’s basically around the speed of my old macbook air 1.7ghz 11″ Macbook (which was 2 models back the top of the line model), and a “good enough” performer. So while the 1.3ghz processor label looks downright anemic, that it’s about on part with the former top of the line 1.7ghz macbook air makes it, in my mind, a reasonable machine. My biggest problem with the 12″ macbook is I need a least 1TB of storage and it still doesn’t offer that. Anyway, it’s just an interesting stat, during interesting mac times. September 8, 2016 at 9:12 EST PM palmac September 8, 2016 Could this be why it’s taken so long to update the Mac and MacBook line? September 8, 2016 at 9:38 EST PM MarcusNewton September 9, 2016 This sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy in the making. First, Apple slows down upgrades to the Macs to a crawl while it boosts performance to iOS devices. Second, points to the fact that iOS devices are now faster then Macs as justification to switch to ARM processors. Personally, I am hoping Apple will experiment with AMD’s Zen processor but putting it into an upgraded Mac mini. I would also like to see the new Mac Pro updated and simply called the Mac; while they also bring back a 12 to 24 core tower and call that the Mac Enterprise. Did anyone else look at the new iPhone 7 Jet Black and think that is what Johnny Ive originally wanted for the Mac Pro (cylinder model)? All of the product photos for the Mac Pro made it look like it was this new Jet Black finish on the iPhone 7, but in person the Mac Pro is more of a dark gray. September 9, 2016 at 12:05 EST AM svanthem September 9, 2016 Shouldn’t the turtle be carrying the MacBook? September 9, 2016 at 7:44 EST AM Jamie September 9, 2016 If the past is any indication, they are probably already testing Macs running on ARM. It’s also worth noting though, that there isn’t necessarily parity between iPhone/Mac for every task that at present time would be in question. Still, very interesting. As an aside, it would be great to one day be able to have every one of our technological fantasies fulfilled, but it’s incremental, the laws of physics (and at times biology) don’t care about our whimsy. Sometimes I feel that Silicon Valley far too often focuses on the future at the expense of the present, and over the past number of years, their crystal ball seems to be a little cracked. September 9, 2016 at 10:30 EST AM JBSlough September 9, 2016 Biggest problem is on ARM Macs won’t be able to boot into Windows. Plus macOS would have to have some new version of Rosetta (like Snow Leopard did) to run older software until all the developers get on board. Last time, PCC to Intel, for some people this was a long process. Plus how well would Photoshop or any other process intensive software run on an ARM? September 9, 2016 at 11:08 EST AM bdkennedy1 September 9, 2016 Another thing to note is that the A10 is underclocked. We don’t know how fast it could get in a Mac. September 9, 2016 at 3:17 EST PM Hagen September 9, 2016 Keep in mind that this is the highest-end phone going against the lowest-end Mac. For the amount of effort that it would take to write a new “Rosetta” layer, I suspect there would need to be much more crossover of processing power — say, an ARM that could match a MacBook Pro or an iMac — before Apple would deem it worthwhile. Otherwise you’d end up with Apple’s own equivalent to the Surface RT. September 9, 2016 at 8:09 EST PM Add a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

Blog Support Store Developer Get Involved Archive Loki 0.4 Stable Release! After a little over a year of development, elementary is proud to announce the stable release of elementary OS Loki! Loki is the newest version of elementary OS, a design-oriented and open source Linux-based operating system for desktops and laptops. It succeeds Freya which was released in April of 2015. The previous release of elementary OS was downloaded about 1.2 million times, with 73% of those downloads coming from closed source OSes. elementary founder, Daniel Foré reports, Rather than competing directly with existing open source projects, elementary seeks to grow the market share for open source software in general. And as we’ve seen with previous releases, that’s exactly what we’re doing. We’ve closed about 1,000 issue reports and implemented over 20 blueprints. Altogether, these represent stability and security improvements, better internationalization, new features and options, and much more. We’ve also made progress on our mission to create Open Source jobs. We’ve paid out about $8,700 in bounties during the Loki development cycle, bringing our total to $17,521. We’ve also added a new part time employee to our payroll, Blake Kostner, which you can hear more about on the simply elementary podcast. New Indicators The system indicators have been revamped for Loki. You’ll see redesigned indicators across the board, plus icons and text change to be dark or light depending on your wallpaper. Audio The Audio indicator features a redesigned, more compact set of controls for music apps and larger icons for output volume with a convenient mute switch. Now you can also control microphone levels from the same spot when the microphone is in use. Network Quickly enable and disable wired and wireless networking with the new Network indicator. For wireless devices you’ll see a clear, scrollable list of all networks in range instead of clumsy submenus. Bluetooth The super simple Bluetooth indicator shows bluetooth status, what devices you’re connected to, and lets you connect to or disconnect from known devices with a single click. Power On laptops and other systems with batteries, the Power indicator shows the charging status and remaining battery life. We also now show battery status for a large number of peripherals like wireless mice and keyboards, plus a handy list of apps currently using a lot of power. Notification Center The brand new Notification Center catches notifications from apps and lets you see and act on them later. It also provides a handy system-wide Do Not Disturb toggle. By default, all apps show in the Notification Center, but you can disable noisy apps in the Notifications section of System Settings. The Notification Center is powered by the FreeDesktop notifications specification, so any apps following this open standard will work automatically. And More Our Date & Time indicator has been redesigned with better at-a-glance legibility and subtle animations. The Session indicator has been redesigned with nice big avatar images. And other indicators like Keyboard Input have seen touch ups as well. Applications Menu Improvements The Applications menu on the top panel now displays notification badges from apps, just like the dock, and searches apps’ keywords in addition to their names. And, as a small bonus, you can now quickly open a website in the web browser by typing its address. New & Redesigned System Settings The System Settings app now supports keyword search, so you can search for things like “dock” or “text size” and find the settings you’re looking for. Desktop We’ve added a Display setting for the dock, meaning you can now choose to display it on your primary display or pick another display manually. Notifications Our Notifications settings now automatically show all apps that support notifications as soon as they’re installed and automatically clears them when removed. Plus, configure whether or not each app shows in the Notification Center. Mouse & Touchpad We’ve simplified the layout of the Mouse & Touchpad settings while adding a new “Physical clicking” setting for touchpad users: Choose between your hardware’s default setting, multitouch secondary clicking (two- and three-finger right- and middle-click), area-based clicking (bottom-right to right-click), or no secondary clicking. You can also now choose to enable or disable Natural scrolling for mice. Power A new lid close setting and related behavior means using a laptop as a desktop computer is easier than ever. Close the lid and keep working when connected to external displays, but ensure your laptop still sleeps when you unplug it. There’s now also a setting to enable ambient light sensing if supported by your hardware. Network Network settings have been completely redesigned to be more straightforward and informative while retaining functionality. Wired and wireless connections, Hotspots, Proxies, and VPNs are all available out of the box. Online Accounts The preliminary version of Online Accounts is finally landing in Loki. At the moment, Fastmail and IMAP email accounts are available with more services under development. Sharing The brand new Sharing settings bring Bluetooth and DLNA sharing into one easy spot. Configuring your computer to share music, videos, and photos to your smart TV is as simple as flicking a switch. About A new Restore Default Settings button lets you set desktop settings back to how they were out of the box. Personal data and app settings are retained. Parental Controls The new Parental Controls settings introduce several restrictions that administrator accounts can place on standard users. Time Limits make sure kids can only use the computer at certain times, Website Blacklisting blocks web addresses for any browser, and Application Blacklisting ensures kids aren’t able to use unapproved apps. Universal Access We’ve revamped Universal Access settings to feature easier navigation with recognizable iconography. Plus we now include an option to disable animations as well as a larger text size option. Internationalization Improvements A heavy emphasis was placed on internationalization this cycle, with translation team leaders coming together to design new features for Loki. “We need to bring elementary OS to a great range of people,” said Leonardo Lemos, Internationalization Developer. “That’s why Loki includes several enhancements for languages and layouts. This work helps to include people from different countries.” “I think the biggest improvement is the Keyboard Layout refactoring,” Leonardo continued. “The developers have put a lot of effort into this. Trying to understand the behavior of foreign layouts and peoples’ requirements for keyboard layouts has made the entire OS easier to use.” With Loki, more apps better support right-to-left layouts: Mail’s conversation view and the pathbar in Files have been reworked to ensure the best layout when used in both left-to-right and right-to-left languages. We’ve also added easy access to special keyboard layout options in System Settings > Keyboard, and have much greater translation coverage overall across the desktop and all apps. Improvements to Default Apps Along with updates to the core OS, Loki also brings several improvements to the apps we ship out of the box. Screenshot A brand new Screenshot app keeps the familiar whole screen, area, and current window modes, but adds a few new features. Current Window mode takes screenshots of apps with transparent backgrounds; this is great for developers or anyone who wants to show off an app window without grabbing their wallpaper or bits of other windows. We’ve also added an awesome new Conceal Text option that obscures text in native apps using an illegible scribble font, perfect for taking screenshots of apps where the text is irrelevant or sensitive. New Browser Loki ships with Epiphany, a fast and lightweight browser using the same WebKit core as Apple’s Safari and many other open source browsers. WebKit2 brings improved performance, far better website compatibility, per-tab processes, improved SSL support, security and stability enhancements, and an all-new web inspector to elementary OS. It also utilizes the OS keychain for saved passwords, meaning your private data is encrypted and safe. Mail Earlier this year we announced our continuation of Geary, simply called Mail. Loki is the first release of elementary OS to ship Mail, and we’re excited to show you all of the improvements we’ve made over the past several months. Mail more intelligently parses NoReply mails, displaying the website name in the message list. We’ve also added a new Always Show Images setting, a redesigned toolbar, and better iconography throughout the app. We’ve also introduced a native message view, meaning new slick animations and better keyboard navigation. Lastly, Mail now integrates with Online Accounts. Files We’ve made several stability and feature improvements to Files. It now better supports various network folders, SMB shares, etc. We’ve improved keyboard navigation, added transfer completion notifications, and improved properties dialogs for files and folders with more information and a better representation of disk usage. Scratch Our text/code editor Scratch has received several bug fixes, plus a brand new Mini Map feature. Terminal The Terminal in Loki now sports case-insensitive tab completion and a slick new color-coded prompt. Videos We’ve made some performance improvements in the Videos app specifically for high-res videos and remote sources. We’ve also improved the behavior of playlists. Music We’ve fixed several bugs and added features in Music related to performance, Last.FM, shuffle mode, sorting, drag and drop, and more. Calendar Calendar in Loki introduces natural language creation for events. For example, type “Meeting with Dan tomorrow at 8 at Starbucks” and Calendar will pre-fill the event title, participant, date, time, and location tabs with the relevant information. New App Store With elementary OS Loki, we’re introducing AppCenter. AppCenter is where you get all your apps for elementary OS. It’s fast, smooth, and handles installing both apps and updates. Look & Feel As with each release, we’ve refined the look and feel of elementary OS Loki. One area we took a close look at was typefaces and font rendering. Across the system Open Sans replaces Droid Sans to provide more font weights, more supported characters, and improved rendering. Similarly, Roboto Mono is our new monospace font for apps like Terminal and Scratch. We’ve also created a ton of new icons and improved iconography throughout the OS, especially for file types. The system stylesheet has been improved; for example, switches are now both simpler and more crisp, slider handles are more compact, and dark apps are much improved. Lastly, the platform toolkit has been greatly improved with new widgets, more and better animations, and overlay scrollbars built into every app. Hardware Support Loki comes with Linux Kernel 4.4, which means improved hardware support across the board including 6th-gen Intel Skylake processors and graphics. And as previously mentioned, Loki now supports ambient light sensors. Loki also includes LibInput: a new input stack that delivers smoother scrolling, better multitouch and touch screen support, palm rejection, and more. Privacy & Security We always strive to provide the utmost level of privacy and security to users of elementary OS, and Loki is no different. We’ve made improvements to Privacy Mode, which is like “Incognito” for the entire OS. For example, now when you’re using Privacy Mode, the Videos and Music apps won’t remember what you last played the next time you open them. You can also now enable Do-Not-Track in the web browser, and the Captive Network Assistant displays SSL certificates so you can be extra certain you’re connecting to the right network. And as always: elementary OS comes with no tracking, no ads, and no data shared with third parties. We support the OS solely through paid downloads and never with data collection. Download It Already! elementary OS Loki is available to download from our homepage at a pay-what-you-want price. Supporting elementary financially currently pays for developer time, hosting and distribution costs, attendance to events where we can learn from and collaborate with other open source software developers, and much more. If you’d like to get involved with developing elementary OS or supporting its development, please see our Get Involved page. Lastly, we’d like to take a moment to say thank you to all of our supporters for helping us make this release possible! elementary OS Linux Open Source Loki 114 notes codygarver Sep 9th, 2016 Open in app Facebook Tweet Mail Permalink g-xela liked this g-xela reblogged this from elementaryos akzel liked this vivirenelbosquejo liked this hamacaweb liked this nicowernli liked this benandrandomstuff liked this awesomekalphill liked this et0101 liked this dyegolara liked this nxover liked this alperslog reblogged this from elementaryos ostoh liked this fensficeriontost liked this theearthhawk liked this sparksammy reblogged this from linuxscoop sparksammy liked this traduce-mi-sonrisa liked this cesar-chen reblogged this from elementaryos vantischen liked this convolucion liked this computersciencestudyblog liked this megatuxii liked this neonoafs liked this fukuo liked this alley-cat-october liked this alola-vulnona reblogged this from elementaryos and added: okay I’m actually really excited about elementary os for the first time in awhile!! superxie liked this doubledensity reblogged this from elementaryos and added: elementary OS has been the best ‘desktop’ Linux distro I’ve ever used in over twenty years.
