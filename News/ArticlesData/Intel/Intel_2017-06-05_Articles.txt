The new Core i9 processor series appears to be a big change from the status quo, an attempt to put insanely powerful processors within the reach of home PC builders. By and large, the PC community had the exact reaction you’d expect: excitement, followed by frantic checking of bank accounts. But for Linus Sebastian, the brains behind Linus Tech Tips and YouTube’s most famous PC nerd, the reality of Intel’s new product lineup doesn’t match the hype. Don't Miss: Google Home outage hits users, ‘100 percent failure rate’ reported In a fifteen-minute rant, Sebastian explains what he thinks are Intel’s less-than-honest motives behind the new i9 and X-series processors and motherboards. You should watch the video to get an understanding of the technical details he’s picking on, but the bottom line is that he thinks Intel cooked up the i9 platform as a response to AMD’s new Threadripper series, not as an honest attempt to push home computing forwards. There’s a number of little details that do point that way. Intel has hinted that a lot of the top-end performance of its new chips will be handicapped if you don’t also buy Intel motherboards and Intel SSDs, which is quite blatantly not in the best interests of high-end PC builders. And then there’s the problem of vaporware. Most of the really exciting stuff that Intel announced last week won’t be ready until the end of the year, which is a much longer wait-for-availability than Intel usually has after the announcement of a new product. It reeks of the fact that this is a reactionary move to steal the spotlight from AMD, rather than a long-planned rollout of a new product line. Ultimately, it’s the messenger that makes the message in this case. Sebastian’s YouTube channel, Linus Tech Tips, is known for a fairly heavy level of commercialization and collaboration with big tech companies, including Intel. You’re much more likely to see a video sponsored by Intel than one tearing Intel apart, which makes this particular rant all the more real. For such a big player to break from the script and annoy the biggest processor company on earth isn’t a common occurrence, so more than ever it’s worth taking note.

These parts will arrive with a new LGA 1151 V2 socket making the new Coffee Lake CPUs not compatible with current LGA 1151 motherboards, which will not have current LGA 1151 owners happy at all. We should expect a Kaby Lake refresh in the coming months, with Coffee Lake pushed into 2018. >> NEXT STORY: Pokemon Direct announced for tomorrow << PREVIOUS STORY: PlayStation VR tops 1 million sales Related Tags Intel Intel Coffee Lake Coffee Lake Intel next-gen Intel 2018 CPU AMD Got an opinion on this news?

In addition to iOS, macOS, watchOS, app and API updates, we got new iMacs and iPads, MacBook upgrades and the HomePod speaker (covered here). Here are some key takeaways on what was announced: The High-End PC Market Still Matters a Lot to Apple For a while, it looked like Apple was treating the Mac as a legacy business, reducing the attention it was given as it directed more resources towards its mobile hardware and pitched the iPad Pro as a notebook alternative. But with PC sales and usage stabilizing even as tablet sales continue to fall, and the high-end PC market looking especially healthy, the company made it clear at WWDC that the Mac remains a priority. The new 27-inch iMac Pro is getting a lot of attention thanks to its eye-popping specs. The workstation, which starts at a steep $4,999, supports 8-to-18 core Intel (INTC)  Xeon CPUs, will feature a high-end AMD (AMD)  GPU based on the company's next-gen Vega architecture and supports up to 128GB of RAM and 4TB of flash storage. Just as notable as the specs, though, is the fact that Apple is unveiling the iMac Pro 6 months before it ships, lest customers frustrated over the fact that its predecessor (the second-gen Mac Pro) hadn't been updated since 2013. The new standard iMacs -- available in 21.5-inch and 27-inch models, and priced from $1,099 to $2,299 -- are also worthy of attention: They feature improved displays, along with CPU, GPU, memory, storage and connectivity improvements. And a 4K 21.5-inch iMac can now be had for $1,299, $200 less than before. Along the same lines, Apple is now selling a 13-inch MacBook Pro that lacks an OLED Touch Bar for $1,299, after previously setting a $1,499 start price. Both 13-inch and 15-inch Pro models were refreshed to feature CPUs based on Intel's Kaby Lake architecture, which launched last fall, as was the 12-inch MacBook. The fact Apple delivered a hardware update for MacBook Pros only launched 7 months ago says something about how much the business still matters to the company. Mac sales rose 14% annually in the March quarter, and accounted for 11% of total revenue. On the other hand, it looks like Apple is slowly killing off its relatively cheap MacBook Air, which hadn't been refreshed since March 2015. The Air, now only available in a 13-inch model, did get a minor CPU update. However, the new CPU isn't a Kaby Lake part, but based on Intel's Broadwell architecture, which launched in 2014. Apple's Strategy For Stabilizing iPad Sales Revolves Around the iPad Pro The iPad Pro has been a relative strong point for Apple as iPad sales have joined the broader tablet market's in slumping. The iPad hardware and software just shown off, together with a continued lack of updates for the 7.9-inch iPad Mini (last updated in 2015), show how much Apple's tablet business is now focused on appealing to enthusiasts, creative professionals and potential notebook switchers. As rumored, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro featuring thinner bezels (and the same form factor) than its 9.7-inch predecessor was announced, as was a refreshed 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The devices feature much-improved displays and processors (a technology called ProMotion improves the display refresh rate to 120Hz, and automatically adjusts it based on content), and double storage capacities across price tiers. The 10.5-inch model has a $649 start price, $50 more than what Apple used to charge for the 9.7-inch model. On the software side, Apple announced iPads running iOS 11 would feature an app dock that can be pulled up from any app by swiping up, and let users launch apps in standalone or split-view mode. Users can also drag and drop content between apps shown in split-view mode, and scan launched apps in a manner similar to macOS' Mission Control mode. It's all very PC-like, as is the new iOS file-browsing app Apple just announced. Convincing consumers to ditch their notebooks for iPad Pros will still often be a challenge, but Apple's sales pitch is now a little stronger. Apple is Getting Serious About Augmented Reality ARKit, a set of developer programming interfaces (APIs) arriving with iOS 11, is Apple's entry into the rapidly-expanding field of software platforms that make it possible to place (with the help of AI) relevant digital content on top of a real-world camera view. Examples shown at WWDC include throwing a ball down a street in Pokemon Go, and taking apart and assembling a Lego Batmobile. Developers will no doubt think of plenty of others. ARKit competes to a degree with Facebook's  (FB) recently-launched Camera Effects AR platform. And perhaps also the World Lenses feature recently built into Snapchat. But those platforms are respectively tied to Facebook and Snap's apps. If they succeed, that wouldn't necessarily prevent ARKit from being widely used by other developers. The ARKit launch, which comes amid reports Apple is working on AR glasses that could launch next year and plans to include a 3D-sensing front camera on the iPhone 8, might motivate Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) to rethink its Android AR strategy. The company has a powerful AR/indoor mapping platform called Tango that developers can write apps for, along with a new home-grown service called Google Lens that adds useful information and content to a camera view. But Tango requires phones with specialized hardware to work, and is thus available on only one Android phone (Lenovo's bulky Phab 2 Pro) to date. To keep pace with Apple, Google needs much broader hardware support. Though It's Not Easy, Apple is Trying Hard to Keep Pace With Google In AI As expected, Apple frequently talked up its machine learning investments during its WWDC keynote. The company discussed its use of AI to do everything from having Siri surface content and make typing suggestions based on a user's past activity, to automatically grouping photos taken at the same event, improving battery life by understanding user activity, and automatically translating voice commands. The company also unveiled Core ML, a set of APIs that will let developers use machine learning models Apple has created for tasks such as speech, vision and text analysis. It arrives less than a month after Google announced TensorFlow Lite, an open-source AI software library that can be run on mobile devices. It complements several machine learning APIs provided via the Google Cloud Platform. As the abilities of services such as Google Assistant, Lens, Translate and Photos show, Google still arguably has an AI lead against Apple and other consumer tech giants. And Apple's strategy of only running machine learning algorithms against its users' data on their devices (done for privacy reasons) could prove a handicap when it comes to optimizing its algorithms. But like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, it has clearly made AI a priority. Keeping Software and User Interfaces Simple is Still an Apple Obsession Many of iOS 11's new features are focused on making the OS more intuitive, and/or integrating different parts of it. These include the new app dock, easier iPad app switching, better integration between the notification and lock screen and the consolidation of Control Center icons (previously found on three pages) onto one page. Likewise, Apple is rolling out a Files app that provides an integrated view of a user's local and cloud-hosted files, overhauling its Photos app to automatically group images and cleaning up its App Store interface. And a new "Do Not Disturb While Driving" feature is effective at doing what its name implies. Android has made big strides in recent years in terms of becoming simpler and more intuitive, and the next version (code named Android O) should yield additional gains. But as Monday's announcements show, iOS is still unmatched in this respect. Apple's Hardware and Chip Engineering Remain Core Competitive Advantages Examples of this abounded during the WWDC keynote. They include the A10X Fusion processor powering the new iPad Pros -- they pair 3 high-performance CPU cores with 3 low-power cores and a 12-core GPU -- and the audio technologies built into the HomePod that allow it to simulate surround sound. They also include the new iPad Pros' ProMotion display tech, and the tremendous amount of processing power built into the iMac Pro's sleek form factor. Apple is still very good at using hardware and chip engineering to differentiate its products, both in terms of their practical features and raw specs. Not much more needs to be said here. AMD is Clearly in Apple's Good Graces Some of the MacBook Pro models announced last October supported AMD's mid-range Polaris GPUs. At WWDC, Apple followed that up by announcing all of its 4K and 5K iMacs will feature AMD GPUs. In addition, an AMD GPU will now come standard on the 15-inch MacBook Pro; it previously cost extra. AMD shares rose 3.1% on Monday amid the news. They're roughly flat in 2017, after having skyrocketed in 2016. Considering the extent to which Nvidia (NVDA)  has dominated the high-end GPU market, Apple's support for AMD makes for a nice vote of confidence.

Every last laptop, from the mighty MacBook Pro to the humble MacBook Air is getting some sort of CPU or platform update. As a result, Apple has a full family of refreshed laptops for the summer, all of which improve on their predecessor in one or more ways. We’ll start with the MacBook Pro and MacBook, Apple’s two modern laptop families. Both of these laptops have received their long-awaited update to Intel’s 7th generation Kaby Lake platform. Kaby Lake, for a quick refresher, uses the same Skylake CPU core as Intel’s 6th gen Skylake platform, but enjoys a modest frequency boost due to Intel's 14nm+ manufacturing process. Meanwhile on the graphics side of matters, all of these CPUs come with a newer media block that offers full hardware encode and decode of 10-bit HEVC. This is an important distinction since Apple will be supporting HEVC on macOS 10.13 High Sierra. There are no other major changes to the underlying Kaby Lake platform, so other than the clockspeed boost and improved media decoder, Kaby Lake is a conceptually simple update from Skylake. 2017 MacBook Lineup Model 2016 (Base) 2017 (Base) Dimensions 0.35 - 1.31 cm x 28.05 cm x 19.65 cm Weight 2.03 lbs (0.92 kg) CPU Intel Core m3-6Y30 (Skylake), cTDP Up Base: 1.1GHz Boost: 2.2GHz Intel Core m3-7Y32 (Kaby Lake), cTDP Up Base: 1.2GHz Boost: 3.0GHz GPU Intel HD Graphics 515 Intel HD Graphics 615 Display 12-inch 2304x1440 IPS LCD sRGB Gamut Memory 8GB LPDDR3-1866 8GB LPDDR3-2133 SSD 256GB PCIe SSD 256GB PCIe SSD (Newer Generation) I/O 1 x USB 3.1 (Gen 1) Type-C 3.5mm combo jack Battery Capacity 41.4 Wh Battery Life 10 Hours Price $1299 $1299 Accordingly, Apple has only made minimal other internal changes to these laptops. The MacBook does get a newer SSD – presumably the latest Apple design to replace its existing Apple SSD – which Apple states is up to 50% faster than the previous SSD. Surprisingly, the company is now also offering a 16GB memory option on the laptop, an interesting development since they were already using a full suite of chips to get to 8GB; so a teardown will be necessary to see how they’re getting to 16GB. 2017 MacBook Pro Lineup Model 2016 13" (non-touch) 2017 13" (non-touch) 2016 15" 2017 15" Dimensions 1.49 cm x 30.41 cm x 21.24 cm 1.55 cm x 34.93 cm x 24.07 cm Weight 3.02 lbs (1.37 kg) 4.02 lbs (1.83 kg) CPU 2.0GHz Core i5-6360U (Skylake) 2.3GHz i5-7360U (Kaby Lake) 2.6GHz Core i7-6700HQ (Skylake) 2.8GHz Core i7-7700HQ (Kaby Lake) GPU Intel Iris Graphics 540 Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 Intel HD Graphics 530 + AMD Radeon Pro 450 (2GB) Intel HD Graphics 630 + AMD Radeon Pro 555 (2GB) Display 13" 2560 x 1600 IPS LCD DCI-P3 Gamut 15" 2880 x 1800 IPS LCD DCI-P3 Gamut Memory 8GB LPDDR3-1866 8GB LPDDR3-2133 16GB LPDDR3-2133 SSD 256GB PCIe SSD 128GB PCIe SSD 256GB PCIe SSD Touch Bar No Yes I/O 2x Thunderbolt 3 (supports DP1.2 & USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes), 3.5mm Audio 4x Thunderbolt 3 (supports DP1.2 & USB 3.1 Gen 2 modes), 3.5mm Audio Battery Capacity 54.5 Wh 76 Wh Battery Life 10 Hours 10 Hours Price $1499 $1299 $2399 $2399 Meanwhile the 15” MacBook Pro is receiving a dGPU update. Apple has replaced the AMD Radeon Pro 400 series options with the Radeon Pro 500 series, which is comprised of the Radeon Pro 555 and Radeon Pro 560, Like the previous 400 series, both 500 series parts are based on AMD’s Polaris 11 GPU. Otherwise, Apple hasn’t made any internal or external changes to these laptops. They all have the same screens, same ports, same finishes, etc, as the 2016. And the Touch Bar is still present on all of the 15” SKUs and the higher-end 13” SKUs. So if you want a Touch Bar, you need to buy a more expensive SKU (or alternatively, a lower-end 13” if you don’t want the Touch Bar).  Finally, Apple has added a second low-end MBP 13” SKU with a smaller 128GB SSD, which has pushed the price of the cheapest model down from $1499 to $1299 as of the refreshed laptops. All of these updated laptops should be available from Apple on June 7th. MacBook Air Meanwhile in a surprising turn of events, Apple has given the 13” MacBook Air a minor speed boost. The laptop has languished without a real update for a couple of years now, still using Intel’s 5th generation Broadwell CPUs and a now dated low-DPI TN screen. Nonetheless, it’s still one of Apple’s more popular laptops due to its sub-$1000 starting price, which seems to be disrupting any plans to actually discontinue the laptop. As a result, Apple has given it a minor, late-lifetime speed boost. 2017 MacBook Air Lineup Model 2016 (Base) 2017 (Base) Dimensions 0.30 - 1.70 cm x 32.5 cm x 22.7 cm Weight 2.96 lbs (1.35 kg) CPU 1.6GHz Core i5-5250U 1.8GHz Core i5-5350U GPU Intel HD Graphics 6000 @ 950MHz Intel HD Graphics 6000 @ 1000MHz Display 13-inch 1440x900 TN LCD Memory 8GB LPDDR3-1600 SSD 128GB PCIe SSD I/O 2x USB 3.0 Type-A 1x Thunderbolt 2 SDXC Card Reader 3.5mm Audio Battery Capacity 54 Wh Battery Life 12 Hours Price $999 $999 The updated laptop retains the use of Intel’s Broadwell processor, but the base configurations now uses a faster chip, Intel’s Core i5-5350U, instead of the slower i5-5250U. As hinted at by the minor model number change, this is not a massive difference – both the base and the boost clock are 200MHz faster, for 1.8GHz base and 2.9GHz boost – but it is none the less a tangible performance improvement for Apple’s entry-level laptop. Otherwise, Apple has not made any other changes. It’s still the same size with the same panel and the same I/O, including the now dated Thunderbolt 2 port. Still, it buys the laptop a bit more time, at least until Apple can figure out what the future of their entry-level laptop model should be.

POST A COMMENT 43 Comments View All Comments ltcommanderdata - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link Is HEVC support in High Sierra going to be Kaby Lake exclusive and require full hardware encoders and decoders or will the partial/hybrid acceleration in Skylake and Broadwell be supported as well? Back when H.264 acceleration was added to OS X, Apple did not support partial hardware acceleration for the GeForce 7xxx or Radeon X1xxx series, although this was so long ago it probably isn't a good comparison. Reply mdriftmeyer - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link If you watch the keynote it's software for non-HEVC hardware enabled and hardware based for systems that have that on-board. Reply ThreeDee912 - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link http://www.anandtech.com/show/9483/intel-skylake-r... Anandtech previously reported that Skylake apparently does have a full HEVC encode/decode support. A footnote on Apple's High Sierra page says that "The playback of 4K HEVC content requires a Mac with a sixth‑generation Intel Core processor or newer", so I guess older systems will use software decode instead and might have issues with 4K. Reply ThreeDee912 - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link 6th gen being Skylake, of course. Reply Penti - Tuesday, June 06, 2017 - link Full 10-bit support requires Kaby Lake. Reply Santoval - Tuesday, June 06, 2017 - link It depends on how you define "full". If you define it by 8 bit HEVC encode/decode but no 10 bit then you are technically right. Reply Morawka - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link i dont understand why apple is using broadwell CPU's in the new Macbook Air. The only reasons i can think of are anti-consumer/anti-cannibalism practices. Reply DanNeely - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link Because a newer CPU would require designing a new mobo to support it; and the MBA is on life support at the moment; and will presumably be killed off whenever they're willing/able to drop the price of the 1port macbook by a hundred dollars or two. Reply Dug - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link Does seem odd. People like the form factor, although the weight is the basically same as MacBook Pro. I would question the low res screen. Why even bother.

BUSINESS Apple goes wild, releases tons of new gear and moves on AR/VR 6 Jun, 2017 1:10pm 5 minutes to read × The new iMac packs a punch, but it doesn't come cheap. Photo / Juha Saarinen NZ Herald Share via email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Show more Bookmark this article Share on Facebook facebook Share on Twitter twitter Share via email email Share on LinkedIn linkedin Share on Google Plus google-plus Share on Whatsapp whatsapp Share on Pinterest pinterest Share on Reddit reddit × After turning a deaf ear for too long, Apple has heard power users who want computers that can keep up with new applications, and released new iMacs, MacBooks and iPad Pros. It's quite the ketchup bottle effect: with nothing arriving for a long while, the amount of new hardware suddenly released in front of 5300 conference goers at Apple's annual Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose was a surprise. Then again, Apple could hardly sit idle while other vendors released gear that's powerful enough to for professionals to work with virtual and augmented reality applications, so there was definitely a sense of urgency around the new hardware. iMacs, which hadn't been updated for two years, leading people to think the desktop computer is dead for Apple, were refreshed with better displays (10-bit colour), the latest Intel processors and the ability to take larger amounts of memory: up to 32 gigabytes for the 21.5-inch model, and 64 gigabytes for the 27-inch ones. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Faster AMD Radeon Pro graphics cards are also available for the iMacs, and the hybrid solid-state/spinning disk Fusion drives are now standard. It looks like the new iMacs will provide decent performance, but won't come cheap. A 27-inch Retina 5K iMac specced up with 32GB of 2400MHz DDR4 and a 2TB Fusion drive memory costs $4709 for instance. Apple also put faster components into the MacBook Pro laptops. Now there are Kaby Lake processors from Intel, better AMD Radeon Pro graphics, faster solid state storage but oddly enough, you still can't go higher than 16GB of system memory. Intel's 7th-gen processors are now also in the lightweight MacBook, ditto quicker SSD storage, making them up to a fifth faster. The 12-inch MacBook is a great portable, but I had hoped the new processors would make it last longer than the specified 10 hours on battery. As expected, the A10 Fusion chip set from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus found its way into new iPad Pros, in the A10X guise. There's now a 10.5-inch screen model, with the 9.7-inch one being discontinued. Why the slightly larger screen? Well, Apple said the bigger screen makes a full-sized onscreen keyboard fit. The Smart Keyboard accessory for the 10.5-inch is also full size, making it more comfortable to type on with large hands. The 120 Hertz refresh rate for the screen promises better responsiveness with the Apple Pencil. Not that it felt laggy before. Also, the screens are brighter at 600 nits, and use the P3 wide-colour gamut and are even less reflective than before. Both the 10.5-inch and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro have USB 3 circuits for quicker file transfers, whereas the 9.7-incher anomalously had the slower and older USB 2 in a device aimed at graphics, photo and video work. You can order the iPad Pros with up to 512GB of storage, and they should be plenty fast: Alasdair Coull, the creative director from Peter Jackson's Wingnut AR offshoot, demoed an augmented reality game on stage at WWDC 2017 that ran very smoothly despite requiring the sort of processing power that meant having a large desktop tower not so long ago. Apple hops aboard the VR and AR bandwagons Speaking of virtual and augmented realities, WWDC 2017 provided yet another opportunity for yours truly to don a pair of VR goggles to look silly in. Here I am, checking out a Final Cut Pro setup with an external Thunderbolt 3 storage array, running on one of the new Macs: The scenery that I saw was a walkthrough of Hawaii, and it was fairly realistic with positional audio enhancing the effect. I didn't dare to move around much, and was disappointed that there was no Apple VR gear... the goggles work, but I'd prefer lighter ones with nicer design, and higher resolution display and some sort of warning system for when you're about to bump into people and things. That's me being a bit claustro, so maybe I'll just stick to AR games for now. Not ready yet: the iMac Pro and Siri Speak... sorry, HomePod The iMacs above will no doubt be really quick and perfectly usable computers, but Apple teased the new Pro version which makes them seem a bit meh, really. I mean, who wouldn't want an iMac that can have up to 18 cores of Intel Xeon processor goodness, and 128GB of memory, not to mention AMD Pro Vega graphics? If that doesn't make you drool, you can stop reading this bit now, but the long and short of it is that the iMac Pro looks set to be an extremely quick machine, and work great for demanding graphics, video, yes VR/AR, and that somewhat scary application, machine learning. We'll see how the iMac Pro performs (and how much it'll cost in New Zealand) by December, which is a long time to wait. Also, I imagine this means that's that for an updated Mac Pro. The iMac Pro will be a niche machine, but the HomePod (shouldn't it have been Siri Speaker?) is definitely mass-market and should've been ready by now and not December. Apart from being able to go "Hey Siri" to the HomePod, which will be aimed at devices like Amazon's Echo when it comes out and have the speaker look things up for you - Apple has had to expand Siri's capabilities for this, and work out a way to keep your queries and orders safe for privacy reasons - the thing promises great sound with a 4-inch bass element and separate tweeters, and easy multi-room setup. There's an Apple A8 chip inside the HomePod to handle all the audio processing and privacy protection that Siri is vaunted for. Again, we'll see how the US$349 (NZ$489) Mac Pro cylinder-like HomePod works in practice in a few months' time - and if it will scare other vendors into action to come up with something as advanced. There was a colossal amount of new things announced at the WWDC 2017. This includes the MacOS High Sierra desktop/laptop and iOS 11 operating systems, which will be in beta soon and which deserve separate looks.

Blog :  Businesses Must Prepare as the Quantum Computing Era Approaches Article :  What Does VMware's Stock Price Say About the Company's Future? HPE Advances Server Security and Automation Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 05 Jun, 2017          |         |     Share At a Discover 2017 conference today, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) made a bevy of additions to its server lineup, including what it describes as the first server to embed security functions into the silicon of forthcoming Proliant Gen 10 series servers based on Intel x86 processors. Mark Potter, senior vice president and CTO for HPE, says that HPE working in collaboration with Intel has been able develop a “silicon root of trust” that makes use of HPE Integrated Light Out firmware running on a chip developed by HPE that ensures servers do not execute any compromised code. In addition, Potter notes that encryption and breach detection technologies are now built into servers configured with the HPE security chip as well. Given the level of sophistication of recent IT security attacks, Potter says, it’s apparent new approaches to IT security are now required. “We have to think differently about security,” says Potter. Along with improving the overall security of its servers, HPE today also says customers will be given access to tuning tools that will allow them to adjust processor clocks to meet the needs of various types of workloads, while also unveiling a Project New Stack, an approach to managing IT across hybrid cloud computing environments that will leverage embedded analytics to help IT organizations significantly increase utilization rates of both on-premises servers and cloud infrastructure services. Those capabilities are intended to extend the reach of HPE’s overall HPE Synergy software-defined infrastructure initiative that it refers to as Composable Infrastructure. New updates to HPE Synergy announced today include compute modules that support 25/50 and 100G Ethernet links, faster storage provisioning, and an update to HPE OneView that further automates the management of firmware updates, while at the same time tightening integration with Cisco, Red Hat, Mesosphere and ServiceNow. HPE also announced it intends to develop a toolkit for HPE OneView that will enable customers to take automations developed using the Redfish application programming interfaces (APIs) and apply them via the HPE OneView framework. HPE is also making available an HPE Persistent Scalable Storage Module that provides access to terabytes of memory that can be used as persistent storage. In addition, HPE announced it will bundle ClearOS, a distribution of Linux specifically designed for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) on low-end servers, in recognition of the fact that interest in Linux in that segment of the IT market is growing. Finally, HPE announced extensions to its pay-as-you-go licensing models designed to improve utilization rates and more closely align spending with actual consumption. Clearly, HPE is making a series of investments designed to differentiate its servers on multiple levels. The issue now will be getting IT organizations to appreciate those investments before rivals figure out how to catch up.

Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Apple updated its MacBook Pro laptops with Intel Kaby Lake processors today, and it also announced changes coming in the next version of the macOS: High Sierra. The company shared the news at its Worldwide Developer Conference in San Jose, California. We were on site to get a look at what Apple showed onstage. We saw demos of the laptops working with HTC Vive virtual reality headsets, including with support for external graphics cards. Here’s a demo of the new MacBook Pro 13-inch model. It has a touch bar that you can use to modify the size of a paintbrush you are using to shade an image on the screen. The change in the effects is instant. It features an Intel Kaby Lake processor, dubbed the Core i7, running at 3.5 gigahertz with turbo boost up to 4.0 GHz. The 15-inch model goes up to 4.1 GHz with turbo boost. The base MacBook Pro 13-inch model has Intel Iris Plus 650 graphics, while the 15-inch model uses the more powerful AMD Radeon Pro 555 discrete graphics chip or a Radeon Pro 560 as an option. The 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,300 with function keys, or $1800 with the touch bar. The machines are available to order today and will be in Apple Stores on Wednesday. Photos are another area where you can see the difference in the graphics horsepower. You can change a photo so that it uses long exposure settings. That makes the mist around a waterfall come to life, for example. Apple also showed features in High Sierra that make changes to its Safari browser. And you can take advantage of privacy features, such as preventing advertisements you don’t want to see from initializing. The new macOS also shows how you can offload video graphics processing to the graphics chip. You can also copy files quickly in the new macOS, as the processor can hand off the task to the graphics chip. This comes from bringing the Apple File System to Macs, after the technology was added to iOS in March.   VB Recommendations Powering Twitch and Medium, search startup Algolia raises $53 million Automat raises $8.3 million to make marketing bots How Volvo’s using self-steering trucks to help sugarcane farmers improve crop yield

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware YouTube’s most famous PC builder isn’t happy about Intel’s Core i9 Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 5th, 2017 at 9:01 PM Share Tweet Last week, Intel dropped the biggest PC news of the last year. The new Core i9 processor series appears to be a big change from the status quo, an attempt to put insanely powerful processors within the reach of home PC builders. By and large, the PC community had the exact reaction you’d expect: excitement, followed by frantic checking of bank accounts. But for Linus Sebastian, the brains behind Linus Tech Tips and YouTube’s most famous PC nerd, the reality of Intel’s new product lineup doesn’t match the hype. Don't Miss: Google Home outage hits users, ‘100 percent failure rate’ reported In a fifteen-minute rant, Sebastian explains what he thinks are Intel’s less-than-honest motives behind the new i9 and X-series processors and motherboards. You should watch the video to get an understanding of the technical details he’s picking on, but the bottom line is that he thinks Intel cooked up the i9 platform as a response to AMD’s new Threadripper series, not as an honest attempt to push home computing forwards. There’s a number of little details that do point that way. Intel has hinted that a lot of the top-end performance of its new chips will be handicapped if you don’t also buy Intel motherboards and Intel SSDs, which is quite blatantly not in the best interests of high-end PC builders. And then there’s the problem of vaporware. Most of the really exciting stuff that Intel announced last week won’t be ready until the end of the year, which is a much longer wait-for-availability than Intel usually has after the announcement of a new product. It reeks of the fact that this is a reactionary move to steal the spotlight from AMD, rather than a long-planned rollout of a new product line. Ultimately, it’s the messenger that makes the message in this case. Sebastian’s YouTube channel, Linus Tech Tips, is known for a fairly heavy level of commercialization and collaboration with big tech companies, including Intel. You’re much more likely to see a video sponsored by Intel than one tearing Intel apart, which makes this particular rant all the more real. For such a big player to break from the script and annoy the biggest processor company on earth isn’t a common occurrence, so more than ever it’s worth taking note.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The 6 Biggest Announcements From Apple WWDC 2017 Everything you need to know from the opening keynote. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) Jun 5, 2017 at 7:33PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just kicked off its WWDC 2017 developer conference, and as usual there were a few product announcements during the opening keynote. Being a developer conference, updates to Apple's major software platforms were table stakes as the company outlined the next iterations of macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. There were also a handful of notable hardware announcements, the details of which had mostly leaked ahead of time. Here are the six biggest announcements from this morning. The new space gray iMac Pro. Image source: Apple. Mac refreshes In terms of spec bumps, Apple refreshed the iMac, MacBook Pro, and 12-inch MacBook. All of these Macs are getting bumped up to the latest seventh-generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core chips. The iMac got more than just processor updates though, receiving better displays. The 21.5-inch 4K model is also getting discrete AMD graphics instead of integrated Intel graphics. Apple is now adding USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3 to the 27-inch iMac. The new iMac Pro A couple months back, Apple made a rare admission that the Mac Pro suffered from some design flaws, specifically around the thermal management system. At the time, Apple suggested that it would create a much more powerful version of the iMac, since many creative professionals were increasingly turning to high-end iMacs. Perfect for Space Gray enthusiasts. Image source: Apple. Apple provided a sneak peek of the forthcoming iMac Pro, which will ship in Space Gray alongside a new set of accessories bearing the same color. In line with prior reports, the new iMac Pro uses a powerful Intel Xeon processor, and comes in eight-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Despite using the same overall design, the new iMac Pro will use a new thermal architecture that can handle an 80% increase in cooling capacity. These desktops use AMD Radeon Pro Vega graphics, and also have four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports to connect professional peripherals. iMac Pro will set you back quite a bit, as it starts at $4,999 and ships in December. 10.5-inch iPad Pro The company updated the iPad Pro lineup, which now includes a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro. By slimming down the bezels, Apple is squeezing a larger display into a chassis comparable to the outgoing 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The new model is modestly taller and thicker, but still weighs just 1 pound. Both the 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch model are getting upgraded displays that are brighter, featuring a wider color gamut and a higher refresh rate (120 Hz) that can dynamically adjust based on the task at hand in order to improve energy efficiency and battery life. Inside, you'll find a new A10X Fusion chip that includes a six-core CPU (three high-power and three high-efficiency) and a 12-core GPU. The 10.5-inch iPad Pro starts at $649 (compared to the $599 that the outgoing 9.7-inch iPad Pro started at) and ships immediately. Peer-to-peer Apple Pay Apple has been reportedly working on a version of Apple Pay that would allow you to pay your friends. The company had initially skipped peer-to-peer (P2P) payments due to regulatory considerations, but it was an obvious opportunity for expansion. Apple Pay is getting a P2P option in iOS 11, which will be integrated into Messages. That's pretty similar to the approach that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has taken with P2P payments, integrating the service into Messenger. In line with rumors, the new P2P version will come with a type of digital debit card that stores funds, which Apple calls an Apple Pay cash card. Users can store funds in the Apple Pay cash card, send and receive funds, pay for purchases, or transfer funds to external bank accounts. Of course, all payments must be securely authenticated with Touch ID. Jumping into P2P payments is a pretty clear shot at Facebook, as well as PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo. Building a foundation for augmented reality Augmented reality (AR) is here to stay, and Apple has now officially unveiled its developer tools to build an AR platform. Apple's new ARKit is similar to what Microsoft is doing with HoloLens, starting with the ability to project virtual objects onto real environments using the camera. In April, Facebook said it was "making the camera the first augmented reality platform" at its own F8 developer conference. That title is arguable, but Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that once iOS 11 is released later this year onto hundreds of millions of iOS devices, Apple will have the largest AR platform following a simple software update. Cook has been talking up AR for over a year, so this should come as no surprise. Importantly, this can give Apple a content foundation for its inevitable introduction of an AR headset or AR glasses. The Siri-powered speaker is called HomePod Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo has been a huge hit, and the e-commerce giant continues to enjoy a first-mover advantage in virtual-assistant-powered stationary speakers. That success naturally provokes a competitive response, and Apple's answer is the awkwardly named HomePod, which it hopes will "reinvent" home audio. The overall design is fairly uninspiring -- it looks like a nondescript marshmallow: HomePod looks like a generic speaker. Image source: Apple. The HomePod is powered by an Apple A8 chip and uses a seven-tweeter array and six-microphone array. It expectedly integrates with Apple Music, which is an advantage since Apple has a stronger position than Amazon in music streaming. Siri is the main voice-driven interface, and can do pretty much all the basic tasks you expect. What HomePod lacks are meaningful third-party integrations, which is largely what Echo has to thank for its success; Alexa now has over 10,000 third-party Skills. HomePod will support HomeKit-enabled devices, but Apple's smart home ecosystem is a bit lacking at the moment overall. HomePod will start at $349 (a notable premium compared to Amazon) and also ship in December. That's it for now There was plenty of other news, too. watchOS 4 will include a few new watch faces, included a predictive one powered by Siri. tvOS is finally getting Amazon Prime video after a yearslong standoff between the companies. iOS 11 focuses very heavily on improving productivity on the iPad, including new ways to multitask and a new file management system. The Mac maker continues to push forward with its Metal graphics technology, adding features specifically targeting virtual reality (VR) capabilities. Overall, there were a slew of announcements to hold consumers and investors over until the iPhone event later this year.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 6 June 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM Intel has seven trillion reasons why it wants autonomous cars to become the norm Autonomous vehicles could create a new US$7tril (RM29.8tril) economy by 2050. — AFP Relaxnews According to a new study commissioned by Intel and conducted by Strategy Analytics, as consumers transition from driving their cars to being driven by them, it will create something the firms are calling the "passenger economy."  And it could be worth over US$7tril (RM29.8tril) by 2050. That's a very long way off, but even if autonomous driving technological developments continue at their current pace, by 2035, 15 years after the first self-driving cars from mainstream manufacturers are expected to make their production debut, the passenger economy will be a huge US$800bil (RM3.4tril) income stream. "Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. "Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding." As for how the two firms have arrived at the huge financial figures the economy will represent, they estimate that mobility-as-a-service, be it ride hailing, ride sharing or car sharing, will generate US$3.7tril (RM15.7tril) in revenues within the next 30 years, solely among consumers. And when people who would have traditionally had their hands on the wheel have their hands on a mobile device, instead, Intel believes that new apps and services aimed at riders will generate upwards of US$200bil (RM853bil) a year. The report paints a picture of a future utopia where in the US alone, consumers will be US$900bil (RM3.8tril) better off because they no longer need to buy, insure or maintain their own car. Local government will save a combined US$234bil (RM996.6bil) that would have had to be invested in public safety initiatives and systems aimed at curbing traffic accidents. What's more, with no need to park a car, new spaces for commerce, entertainment and relaxation can be built instead, reshaping the urban landscape forever. "Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector," said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. "The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues." It will also cut congestion and pollution on many major routes, giving back time lost to commuting to many around the world. And, once the technology becomes both proven and affordable to all, Intel expects to see mobile restaurants, clinics and beauty salons spring up that come to the customer's door. But that's just the start, and part of the point of the study is to fire up people's imaginations in order to truly seize a moment that is as significant as the space race in terms of our modern history. "[It] is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge," said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. "The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue." — AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats EU seeks to expedite police requests for data from tech firms Sony's PlayStation VR headset sales top one million units China closes 60 celebrity gossip social media accounts 5 superpowers that makes mum a hero 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Most sticking with London travel plans French federation president hits out at French men Make a stopover for sotong kangkung advertisement Latest News Digi offers a new fleet management solution Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats Amazon error sends some shoppers to dog photo, not product page Super glitch strikes Philippine bank again Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Most Viewed in Tech Digi offers a new fleet management solution Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with borderless display could land by September Super glitch strikes Philippine bank again Ikea to try selling through third party websites Apple’s two futures: VR is for desktop, AR is for mobile Amazon error sends some shoppers to dog photo, not product page Chinese Apple staff suspected of selling private data Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Google introduces a new image-based shopping ad format Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Those machines relied on Intel's Skylake processors instead of the higher-boosting, more-responsive Kaby Lake mobile chips that launched about two months later. Subsequent complaints about performance, limited memory capacity, and battery life from MacBook Pros may have been related to that choice of CPU. Today, Apple is harmonizing MacBooks and iMacs with Intel's latest CPUs by replacing Skylake with Kaby Lake. iMacs now come with Kaby Lake quad-core CPUs ranging up to 4.2 GHz base and 4.5 GHz Turbo Boost clocks. Apple is also taking this opportunity to add its Fusion Drive hybrid storage system to all 27-inch iMacs, and the highest-end 21.5" iMac will also benefit from that upgrade. New iMacs will come with two Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of Thunderbolt 2, and Apple further claims the SSDs in these machines will be 50% faster than those in its outgoing all-in-ones. 21.5" models will top out at 32GB of RAM, and 27" models can take up to 64GB. The latest iMacs will also feature optional Radeon RX 500-series graphics chips. The entry-level 21.5" iMac will rely on its Kaby Lake CPU's Iris Plus graphics, while 4K versions of the 21.5" machine will offer Radeon Pro 555 and Radeon Pro 560 pixel-pushers with up to 4GB of RAM. The 27" iMac will give buyers a choice of the Radeon Pro 570, Radeon Pro 575, and Radeon Pro 580 graphics processors with up to 8GB of RAM. Apple announced that it's partnering with Valve to bring the SteamVR SDK to the Mac, and the new graphics options for the 27" version offer the hardware foundation required to power VR headsets for folks who prefer to create VR experiences in macOS. Other improvements to the iMac line include displays with 10-bit color support (through dithering) and 500-nit maximum brightness ratings. The 21.5" 4K iMac now starts at $1299, as well. On the mobile Mac side of the aisle, the MacBook's infusion of Kaby Lake lets Apple's thinnest and lightest laptop hold low-power CPUs up to a Core i7 with 1.3 GHz base and 3.6 GHz boost speeds. Apple also says the CPU upgrade allows the MacBook to address twice the maximum amount of memory compared to older models. MacBook SSDs should run up to 50% faster than their predecessors, as well. The 13" MacBook Pros get (presumably dual-core) Kaby Lake Core i7s running at up to 3.5 GHz base and 4.0 GHz Turbo speeds, while the 15" models will get quad-core Core i7s running at up to 3.1 GHz base and 4.1 GHz boost speeds. 15" MacBook Pros will also get more powerful discrete graphics chips at the base of the lineup. The 13" MacBook Pro is now more attainable with prices starting at $1299. All of these machines will be available to order today from Apple's online store.

Even if you're not gaming, you should probably update to the new 15.45.19.4670 driver thanks to "important security enhancements" when using the IGPs in Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. Intel is pretty vague about what those enhancements may be. It does go on to say that this driver supports the newly-released Tekken 7 and the upcoming Dirt 4, as well as the aforementioned games. This driver also improves performance in The Division and For Honor, and resolves a bug that was causing extremely long load times in Star Wars: Battlefront, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Battlefield 1. Further bugs bashed in the updated driver include video stuttering in Battlefield 1, audio cut-outs in Skyrim Special Edition, audio issues when using a single display over USB Type-C, and "stability improvements" when using Miracast. Intel also says that Netflix playback should be improved, and that overclocked IGPs should be a little more stable. Finally, the DX9 driver for Windows 10 got some love and should no longer cause artifacting in Unigine benchmarks or apps with D3D9 overlays. As with any driver, there are still a few creepy crawlies hanging around. Intel notes that Euro Truck Simulator 2, Fallout 4, Guild Wars 2, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Guilty Gear Xrd, Titanfall 2, and "some DX9 games" might still show artifacts or incorrect graphics. The Division and Batman: The Telltale Series may crash or hang, while PowerDVD on Windows 10 may not show 3D video correctly. HDCP may not work properly after video standby when using a Type-C to HDMI adapter. You can pick up the new driver at Intel's download site, or from a link in the forum post announcing the release. If you go to the download site, Intel cautions users to ignore the notice that "a newer version of this software is available." Folks actively gaming on Intel hardware should check out Intel's gaming site for tweaks and hints on getting games running smoothly on the integrated adapters.

The company's new datacenter-oriented SSD DC P4501s utilize Intel's next-generation NVMe controller in conjunction with 3D TLC flash to reach smaller form factors and power envelopes compared to most many server SSDs. The DC P4501s are available in 500 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB and 4 TB capacities. As is often the case, performance varies with the amount of storage on hand. The smallest model's peak sequential read speed is 2500 MB/s, while its bigger brothers reach peaks of 3200 MB/s. Sequential writes vary substantially, ranging from 300 MB/s for the 500 GB drive all the way up to 900 MB/s for the 4 TB model. Random read IOPS range from 146,000 to 362,000 depending on capacity, and random write IOPS go from 16,200 on the smallest drive to 46,700 on the largest. Endurance ratings range from 650 TB written on the entry-level 500 GB units up to 5000 TB on the 4 TB version.  Intel offers nearly all the DC P4501 drives in both the 2.5" U.2 and M.2 form factors, though the largest variant is only available as a U.2 drive. According to Anandtech, this is Intel's first NVMe datacenter SSD to fit into these formats. The site also says that the new drives perform better than Intel's older DC P4500 and DC P4600 drives models, despite using just 12 channels of 3D TLC NAND instead of the old drives' 18 channels of planar MLC flash. Power consumption is listed as under 5W when idle, and up to 12.5W under load. Intel did not provide pricing or availability information for the SSD DC P4501 drives, but gerbils in the market for these probably don't get them through retail channels anyway. All the drives are covered by a five-year warranty. Tags: Servers Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The clock frequency has been increased to 1.3 GHz, but Intel’s Turbo Boost technology can temporarily increase the CPU clock speed to up to 3.6 GHz during heavy workloads. Flash storage is now up to fifty percent faster and the notebooks now support up to twice the RAM than before, for up to 16GB of RAM. Configure-to-order options available via Apple’s online store allow you to outfit your new 12-inch MacBook with up to a 1.4 GHz Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6 GHz. The following stock configurations are available: $1,299 MacBook 12-inch 2304-by-1440 LED-backlit display with IPS technology and 16:10 aspect ratio 1.2GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.0GHz 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 615 Built-in keyboard with second-generation butterfly mechanism $1,599 MacBook 12-inch 2304-by-1440 LED-backlit display with IPS technology and 16:10 aspect ratio 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory 512GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 615 Built-in keyboard with second-generation butterfly mechanism “Weighing just two pounds and measuring 13.1mm thin, MacBook is our thinnest and lightest notebook for all-day, on-the-go computing,” says the company. The refreshed MacBooks continue to be available in Apple’s standard Gold, Rose Gold, Silver and Space Gray color finishes. The updated MacBook models—along with improved iMacs, specc’d up MacBook Pros and a slightly updated 13-inch MacBook Air with a faster 1.8GHz processor—are available to order today on Apple.com. You can buy them in Apple Stores starting on Wednesday, June 7. For other tech specs, configure-to-order options and accessories, visit apple.com/mac.

Iliyan They are still fanless. Intel just renamed the “m” CPUs to “i” with Kaby Lake. Windham Cato Still can’t play good games on a Mac though. Leopoldo Pereira But you can install windows on a Mac. Mallouk Malek Surface pro, cheaper same tech specs. I think now I have finally made my choice to buy the surface pro 😀 Donato Bearint Yea like a surface pro compares to a MacBook. Not even in the same solar system. It’s a laptop, you not suppose to write or touch the screen. If someone wants that that’s why there is tablets. Any PC compared at an apple never compares. Plus when is the last time you ever got a PC to last longer than even three years when a Mac will last five no problem at all. Mallouk Malek Maybe not the same solar system, but if it does exactly what I want then it is the right choice for me no? It is neither a tablet or a computer. “Maybe” if apple actually changed the OS of the iPad I would have got an iPad Pro, but this is not happening any time soon. I did not say that the new MacBooks are not good tho! God, whenever someone says windows here every one get so mad relax guys it’s a persons opinion that’s have no intention to fight here 😀 ! And by the way I’m still using a 2012 windows pc, but all tablets and phones are from apple. Anonymouse I’ve had my Fujitsu S6410 for about ten years now with Windows 7. Only update in 10 years was up to 4gb ram and 512gb ssd. Do you think if I buy the latest Macbook Pro/Air, will it still run in ten years and allow some upgrades? Donato Bearint Yup without a doubt. Especially if you double the strage and update to the latest hardware. EimaiNintzas you do understand that surface pro runs windows right? Mallouk Malek I can’t be that blind right 😀 !? EimaiNintzas no you can’t! just read between the lines.

All MacBook Pro models now include enhanced SSDs, up to 50 percent faster than before. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $1,799. If you need a notebook with a 15-inch display and Touch Bar, that’ll be a cool $2,399, at least. The 13-inchers have Intel CPUs up to 3.5 GHz Core i7 with Turbo Boost up to 4.0 GHz while their 15-inch counterparts include up to 3.1 GHz Core i7 chips with Turbo Boost up to 4.1 GHz. In terms of graphics, the baseline non-Touch Bar model uses Intel’s Iris Plus Graphics 640. The more powerful Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 is powering other 13-inchers without Touch Bar. All models of the 15-inch MacBook Pro have been upgraded to Radeon Pro 555 discrete graphics with 2GB video memory. A Radeon Pro 560 GPU with 4GB memory is available as a build-to-order option on Apple’s web store. Here are the stock MacBook Pro configurations: $1,299 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,499 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,799 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID $1,999 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 512GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID $2,399 13-inch MaBook Pro 15-inch LED-backlit 2880-by-1800 display with IPS technology at 220PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.8GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Discrete Radeon Pro 555 graphics with 2GB video memory 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID $2,799 13-inch MaBook Pro 15-inch LED-backlit 2880-by-1800 display with IPS technology at 220PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 512GB SSD storage Discrete Radeon Pro 560 graphics with 4GB video memory 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID The updated machines are available with 1-day shipping, in Silver or Space Gray. It’s worth reiterating that the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro model without Touch Bar now costs $1,299 instead of $1,499. Being a cool $200 cheaper actually makes in comparison MacBook Air a tougher sell as it’s only gotten a faster 1.8GHz Intel chip today. Apple also continues to offer the previous-generation MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen, Intel’s 2.2GHz quad-core Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.4GHz, 16GB 1600MHz memory, 256GB SSD storage, Intel Iris Pro Graphics and two Thunderbolt 2 ports. It’s available in Silver finish only and costs $1,999 a pop. These updated MacBook Pro models, plus improved iMacs and the 13-inch MacBook Air models with a faster 1.8GHz CPU, are all available to order today on Apple.com.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apple updates iMac lineup with Kaby Lake chips, better graphics, improved screens 06/05/2017 at 2:00 PM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Apple is updating its iMac line of all-in-one desktops with new models sporting Intel Kaby Lake chips, improved displays, and support for faster graphics, more memory, and speedier storage, among other things. The new models continue to come in 21.5 inch and 27 inch varieties, but the smaller model now supports up to 32GB of RAM and Intel Iris Pls 640 graphics for entry-level models or AMD Radeon Pro 555 or Pro 560 graphics on higher-end configurations. Apple’s new 27 inch iMac supports up to 64GB of RAM, comes with up to 2TB of solid state storage and a Fusion Drive that’s 50 percent faster than other SSDs (according to Apple), and each version supports 10-bit HEVC/H.265 video decoding. The 5K 27-inch iMac is available with Radeon Pro 570, 575, and 580 graphics options, and every new model has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The new models also have displays that are 43 percent brighter than their predecessors, and which support 1-bit dithering and a billion colors. Among other things, the new iMacs support Apple’s new Metal 2 graphics technology with support for external graphics, Steam VR, and the Unity and Unreal engines. Prices for the new iMac start at $1099. The announcement came during today’s WWDC keynote, where Apple also introduced watchOS 4, Mac OS X High Sierra, and teased an update for Apple TV: Amazon Prime Video support is coming to the TV app later this year. There’s also a new iMac Pro that offers up to an 18-core Intel Xeon processor, and Apple’s MacBook laptop lineup is also getting a spec bump.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 4 Comments on "Apple updates iMac lineup with Kaby Lake chips, better graphics, improved screens" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Max L L Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And while Apple continues to update MacBook Air with faster Intel chips and graphics, the latest hardware refresh to the popular notebook leaves a a lot to be desired. The notebook now ships with a faster 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor from Intel—a step up from the previous 1.3 GHz one—but that’s about it in terms of hardware upgrades. It didn’t even get Intel’s Kaby Lake chips, introduced in March. The tech giant briefly mentioned the update during the keynote and made only a passing one-sentence mention in the press released announcing other Mac updates. “Apple today also updated the 13-inch MacBook Air with a 1.8 GHz processor,” reads the release. Here’s the updated MacBook Air lineup. $999 MacBook Air 13-inch non-IPS LCD 1,440-by-900 display 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 6000 $1,199 MacBook Air 13-inch non-IPS LCD 1,440-by-900 display 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 6000 Apple hasn’t given the notebook faster SSD storage, nor has it updated built-in graphics, like with today’s updates to other Mac notebooks. It still ships with the pixelated non-Retina display and does not include support for the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 standard. The 11-inch MacBook Air models were discontinued last October. I love all Mac notebooks, but that MacBook Air has a special place in my heart and I’m saddened that Apple has decided to phase it out, slowly but surely. Until that slim 12-inch MacBook Air gets a decent CPU, I’ll be sticking with my Air. How about you?

So it’s TN? kohyuta Sadly, yes. burge The MacBook is a poor machine compared with the Air ok it’s got a Retina screen but that’s all it has over the Air I’ll be sticking with my Air for at least another year then. And the Pro is over priced for what it brings. Vince Reedy Makes sense to just go with the non touch bar 13″ pro at this point which I don’t think is a bad deal at all. Especially after the price drop and spec bump. Can’t see why anyone would want the 12″ or the air now. cdlenfert Does the 12 inch not have a “decent CPU” now? I’m curious, not being sassy. kohyuta The $1299 MacBook uses an Intel Core m3 CPU which emphasizes power efficiency over performance. Good enough for email and web browsing. It benchmarks slower than the i5 & i7 CPUs in the MacBook Pros, and is roughly equivalent to the i3. You can spend more money for an i5 ($100) or i7 ($250). For my $1299, I’d rather get a MacBook Pro with a 2.3GHz i5 than a MacBook with a 1.2GHz m3.

Apple has major updates in store for the All-in-One computer, including a new iMac Pro, which will become Apples most powerful Mac. But thats coming later, lets start with the new iMacs and also cover the MacBook refresh. iMacs An eye-catching feature - literally - are Apples best displays, ever! They are 43% brighter than the previous generation (up to 500 nits) and feature 10-bit dithering (so 8-bit panels simulating 1 billion colors). These iMacs will be much faster than the previous generation. They use Intels new Kaby Lake processors (which offer higher frequencies and HEVC decoding). Also, you can spec the 21.5 iMac with up to 32GB RAM, the bigger 27 model can go up to 64GB. For storage, you get up to 2TB fusion drives (i.e. HDD+SSD) with SSDs that are up to 50% faster. Graphics got a big boost too. You start of with Intels Iris iGPU, which still offers up to 80% increased performance over the previous generation. For serious work, Apple turned to AMD Radeon Pro 5xx series. The big 27 iMac gets Radeon Pro 570/ 575 or 580 with up to 8GB of VRAM. The top-specced version offers up to 5.5 TFLOPS of computing power, great for VR. The smaller 21.5 iMac gets Radeon Pro 555 or 560 with up to 4GB VRAM. Now for the price. The base 21.5 model starts at $1,100 and if you want a 4K screen, then its $1,300. The 5K iMac Retina starts at $1,800. MacBooks Nothing much to see other than Intel Kaby Lake processors and lower prices. The base MacBook starts at $1,300 (and has up to 50% faster SSD), the base MacBook Pro 13 also stats at $1,300. The big dog, the 15 MacBook Pro, gets faster graphics options and a base price of $2,400. These Macs are up on Apple.com today. iMac Pro Who needs a Mac Pro when an iMac offers better performance and an amazing screen? Note that this is just a sneak peek, the real deal will not be available until December. But heres what you have to look forward to. It shares its outer body and 5K display with the 27 iMac (but comes in an exclusive Space Grey color). However, the internal cooling is much improved thanks to the dual centrifugal fan setup. You can spec the Pro with an Intel Xeon with up to 18 cores! More affordable 8 and 10 core options are available as well. Also, you can stick as much as 128GB ECC RAM and 4TB SSD (3GB/s). The graphics are workstation-grade - the upcoming Radeon Vega with up to 16GB VRAM. It offers 11 TFLOPS in single precision and 22 TFLOPS in half precision - a boon for machine learning. The connectivity on the iMac Pro is as great as you'd expect. Its the first Mac ever to feature built-in 10Gb Ethernet and with 4x Thunderbolt ports, you can feed two external 5K displays and connect two two RAID arrays. Oh, and theres a 1080p FaceTime camera and a UHS-II port. Scared to look at the price? Dont be - the iMac Pro (8-core Xeon, Vega GPU, 1TB SSD) starts at $5,000. Again, this will come out just in time for the holidays at the end of the year.

The 5K models of new iMacs sport the same 5,120‑by‑2,880 pixel resolution and wide color gamut (P3) support like the models they’re replacing. In fact, the previous-generation iMac lineup is no longer sold on Apple Online Store. The new desktops with Retina 4K and 5K displays are available to order today on Apple.com, and available to buy in Apple Stores starting on Wednesday, June 7, with one-day shipping. Using Intel’s seventh-generation Core processors, code-named “Kaby Lake” that were introduced in March 2017, the new iMacs have the clock frequency of up to 4.2 GHz with Intel’s Turbo Boost technology increasing the CPU speed to up to 4.5 GHz during heavy workloads. In the graphics department, the updated iMacs feature the new Radeon Pro 500-series graphics with up to 8GB of dedicated video memory. The 21.5-inch iMac model delivers up to three times faster graphics performance, with the 27-inch models being up to fifty percent faster in terms of graphics than the current generation. The new lineup supports up to twice the memory as the previous generation and SSD storage options are now up to 50 percent faster as well, Apple has said. Speaking of which, Apple’s made its Fusion Drive (a hybrid SSD/HDD drive) standard across all 27-inch iMac configurations and it’s now included by default on the top-end 21.5-inch iMac model, too. The $1,299 21.5-inch iMac model now features a brighter Retina 4K display, an upgrade over the previous 1080p screen, and discrete rather than integrated graphics. And with the macOS High Sierra update due this fall, the new iMacs will deliver even faster graphics performance via Apple’s updated Metal graphics framework for 3D graphics, video editing and gaming. The following models are available: $1,099 21.5-inch iMac 21.5-inch 1,920-by-1,080 sRGB display 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 1TB storage 8GB 2133MHz memory, configurable to 16GB 1TB hard drive Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,299 21.5-inch iMac 21.5-inch Retina 4K 4,096-by-2,304 display with wide color (P3) support 3.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz 8GB 2400MHz memory, configurable to 16GB 1TB hard drive Radeon Pro 555 graphics with 2GB video memory 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,499 21.5-inch iMac 21.5-inch Retina 4K 4,096-by-2,304 display with wide color (P3) support 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz 8GB 2400MHz memory, configurable up to 32GB 1TB Fusion Drive Radeon Pro 560 graphics with 4GB video memory 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,799 27-inch iMac 27-inch Retina 5K 5,120-by-2,880 display with wide color (P3) support 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz 8GB 2400MHz memory, configurable up to 32GB 1TB Fusion Drive Radeon Pro 570 graphics with 4GB video memory 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,999 27-inch iMac 27-inch Retina 5K 5,120-by-2,880 display with wide color (P3) support 3.5GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 4.1GHz 8GB 2400MHz memory, configurable up to 64GB 1TB Fusion Drive Radeon Pro 575 graphics with 4GB video memory 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $2,299 27-inch iMac 27-inch Retina 5K 5,120-by-2,880 display with wide color (P3) support 3.8GHz quad-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 4.2GHz 8GB 2400MHz memory, configurable up to 64GB 2TB Fusion Drive Radeon Pro 580 graphics with 8GB video memory 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports macOS High Sierra will turn your iMac “into a great platform” for VR content creation. Last but not least, the Cupertino giant has previewed an all-new iMac Pro model. Engineered to please creative pros until a next-generation Mac Pro with a modular design is ready, the new iMac Pro is the “most powerful Mac we’ve ever made”. It will be available in December, starting at $4,999.

The company said at its annual WWDC keynote on Monday that it is refreshing the ultra-thin notebook with Intel’s latest “Kaby Lake” processors, which should bring slight boosts to speed and battery life. Along with that, Apple also mentioned the notebook will now get up to a 50% bump in performance to its solid-state drive storage.  If you can afford it, you can also upgrade the boost the MacBook's performance by doubling the amount of memory to 16 GB — previously, you were maxed out at 8 GB.  Finally, Apple also said the MacBook's keyboard has been updated to be more like its equivalent in the MacBook Pro. That means it should feel a bit clickier and more responsive than before. On the whole, though, the pitch here remains the same. You’re still getting a very slim, nicely-built chassis with a high-resolution “Retina” display and a lone USB-C port. Apple still positions the MacBook for people who are okay with good enough performance in a package that’s easy to take on the go. If you want an Apple laptop that’s powerful enough to do heavier work, you’ll have to look to the MacBook Pro. View photos Tim Cook macbook (smaller)More (Apple CEO Tim Cook.Getty) More specifically, the new MacBooks use Intel’s lower-power “Y-series” chips. Those aren’t as strong as the more traditional "U-series" Intel Core chips you’d see in a MacBook Pro — or some Windows laptops around the MacBook’s size — but they've generally improved to the point of respectability over the past couple of years. Kaby Lake is a relatively small upgrade over Intel’s previous generation of chips. It brings minor gains in overall performance and power efficiency, so it's an improvement, but not the most visible one. It works more smoothly with 4K video, too, but since the MacBook’s display isn't that sharp, those increases will likely go unnoticed by the majority of buyers. One pain point critics have had with the MacBook is its webcam, which shoots at a grainy 480p resolution. Unfortunately, that hasn't changed here. Another thing that's stayed the same is price: The MacBook will still start at $1,299 — which will get you a model with a entry-level Core m3 chip and 256 GB of storage — and reach up to $1,949 as you go up the specs ladder. Either way, the notebook is still expensive for the relatively limited power and ports it’s packing; comparable Windows laptops typically go for less. But it is well-made, and with the Mac becoming less and less relevant to Apple’s bottom line, the company's laptop business seems to be focusing exclusively on the high-end. The new MacBook models are available to order through Apple's store now, with retail availability starting on June 7.

X Apple unveils number of upgrades to Mac computers Tech giant also pushes Siri to the fore at annual developer conference Mon, Jun 5, 2017, 20:36 Updated: Mon, Jun 5, 2017, 20:37 Craig Federighi, senior vice-president of software engineering at Apple, during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, on Monday. Photograph: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg         Technology giant Apple upgraded most of its Mac computers on Monday, including a powerful new offering for professional users, showing renewed commitment to a product line that critics say it neglected amid lackluster growth. At its developer conference in San Jose, California, Apple unveiled new iMac desktop computers with brighter displays and faster Kaby Lake chips from Intel Corp and more powerful graphics processing for virtual reality applications. Updates to the 12-inch MacBook and flagship 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros also included Intel’s Kaby Lake processors to make the laptops more efficient, and could result in improved battery life. These computers cost $1,299 to $2,399, the company said. The 13-inch MacBook Air also got a faster processor in a rare update. The iPhone remains Apple’s most important product by far, but the company needs a range of devices to keep consumers locked into its profitable and growing ecosystem of services and apps. That means updating products for some markets that aren’t growing as fast as they once did. The PC market, where Apple is fourth, grew less than 1 percent in the first quarter, compared to a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. Criticised The company’s Mac revenue fell last year, and while well received by many consumers, recent MacBook Pros have been criticised by some longtime Mac loyalists and creative professionals for not meeting some of their needs. Apple has acknowledged that it needs to do better and addressed some of these concerns by unveiling a new iMac Pro with super-fast Intel Xeon chips, Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s Radeon Vega graphics processor, and up to 128 GB of pre-installed RAM. Starting at $4,999, it’s the most expensive and powerful computer Apple has made. The Mac upgrades are Apple’s first to the MacBook Pro since the computer was revamped last fall with a slimmer design and the Touch Bar touchscreen strip on the keyboard. The 12-inch MacBook was last updated earlier last year with faster chips and a rose gold colour option. Alongside the Mac hardware upgrades, Apple also is discussing software updates to both at its conference this week. The new operating systems are expected to be released in the autumn. Apple chief executive Tim Cook also announced that content from Amazon Prime Video, long absent from the Apple TV product, would come to Apple devices such as the TV, iPhones and iPad later this year. ‘Siri face’ Apple kicked off its conference by unveiling a “Siri face” for the Apple Watch that will enable the voice-activated assistant to provide users with information such as commute times for upcoming appointments. Apple was expected to unveil improvements to Siri, its digital voice assistant that competes with Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant helper. The Siri face for the Apple Watch was the first step in that direction, blending users’ calendar information with other useful details, like airline tickets they may have booked. While Siri was previously available on the Apple Watch, the assistant’s ability to automatically show information was limited.

Here's everything you need to know including release dates, prices and specs. Apple refreshed its iMac range at WWDC and introduced a new Pro model By Chris Martin | 05 Jun 2017 Now that Intel has launched its Kaby Lake processors, it's no surprise that Apple has updated its hardware range with the new chips and much more. Here we look at the iMac 2017 range including release date, prices and specs. "With major updates to iMac, and a refresh of our MacBook and MacBook Pro lines, the Mac is stronger than ever," said John Ternus, Apple's vice president of Hardware Engineering. When is the 2017 iMac release date? New iMac 2017 release date: 5 June Instead of launching new iMac models towards the end of the year around September or October, the firm refreshed the range at WWDC on 5 June. Apple made them available straight away so you can order one now from the Apple store online and in physical stores from 7 June. An iMac Pro was also unveiled but it has a release date of December 2017. How much will the 2017 iMac cost in the UK?  There are multiple models to choose from as you'd expect with various specs and sizes. Here are the starting prices for the iMac 2017 range. iMac 21.5in - $1,099 iMac Retina 4K 21.5in - $1,299/£1,249 iMac Retina 5K 27in - $1,799 iMac Pro - $4,999 You might also like: Best Mac deals. What are the iMac 2017 specifications?  Apple has updated the whole iMac 2017 range with new displays which it says are the best ever. They include 500 nits of brightness, 10-bit dithering and one billion colours. They also, as mentioned, have Intel's latest processor so you get a 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPU as standard. These chips have higher base and turbo frequencies for improved performance. You'll get up to Core i7, of course. iMacs for 2017 also get up to 50 percent faster SSDs which can be up to 2TB and other features such as two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3.  The 27in iMac models get Fusion drives as standard and up to 64GB of RAM. iMac 21.5in For the smallest iMac, you'll now get up to 32GB of RAM and a nice bump on the graphics side of things. Intel Iris Graphics 640 means 80 percent better performance compared to the previous generation. iMac 21.5in 4K As well as the above, the 4K iMac get a graphics boost to either an AMD Radeon 555 or Radeon 560 providing up to 4GB of VRAM. Apple says this means three times the performance of the previous generation. iMac 27in 5K The larger iMac with that 5K display will come with a choice of AMD Radeon Pro 570, 575 or 580 graphics cards with up to 8GB of VRAM. You'll be able to take advantage of up to 5.5 Teraflops of power. iMac Pro You'll have to wait until the end of the year for it but Apple has given us a sneak previous of the first iMac Pro which it calls 'the most powerful Mac ever made'. The device comes in Space Grey and has a 5K display as standard. As standard, the iMac Pro will have an 8-core Xeon processor but will also be available in 10- and 18-core options. The iMac Pro will have 128GB of ECC memory, up to 4TB 3Gbps SSD, 4x Thunderbolt ports and 10Gb Ethernet. Other specs include a 1080p FaceTime camera, Bluetooth 4.2, 11ac Wi-Fi, four beamforming mics, louder audio and an SDXC card slot. Furthermore is Radeon Vega graphics with up to 22 Teraflops of power and the ability to drive up to 44 million pixels.Apple promises things like real-time 3D rendering, high framerate VR, faster code compiling, real-time 4K video, machine learning development and more. The cheapest model, $4,999, will come with an 8-core Xeon CPU, Radeon Vega graphics, 32GB ECC memory and a 1TB SSD. For more new iMac rumours see our sister site Macworld.

Apple seems to be trying to show they are listening to users, as their updates to the Mac line address many things professionals have been complaining was missing from the line for quite some time.  More details will likely be available soon, but this is a quick summary of the most pertinent topics we think you'll want to focus on. iMac Updates The new iMacs are much improved, with better monitors, faster processors and SSDs, and higher memory capacity. The display has been improved to 500 nits brighter which is 43% better than the current versions. They also have 10 bit dithering (a billion color reproduction). The entire line of iMacs is moving to Kaby Lake, the 7th generation Intel processor. They support 10-bit HEVC decode (better for HQ video) and can be configured to 32GB of RAM on the 21.5-inch and 64GB RAM on the 27-inch machines. Apple also announced that Fusion drives on their machines will now be standard. For those that prefer SSD, their SSD options are 50% faster and available in up to 2 TB. The new machines will include two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 connectors in addition to (and not singularly replacing) the traditional USB connections.  Every configuration in new iMacs gets a big bump in performance. They now include integrated GPU Iris Plus Graphics from Intel for 64MB of eDRAM. This makes them up to 80% faster than the previous generation. The iMac 21.5-inch is getting Radeon Pro 555 & 560 for up to 4GB VRAM. This new system is up to 3x faster than previous gen for graphics. The 27-inch version gets 570, 575 & 580 Radeon processors with up to 8GB of VRAM. New iMac Features: Best displays faster processors higher memory capacity Faster storage Better graphics performance Pricing is also improving, with a new model designed to be more affordable to get their high resolution monitor. The base model 21.5 inch starts at $1099, with the 4K monitor add available for $1499. The 27-inch model starts at $1799. MacBook Pro There aren't newly-designed MacBook Pros, but they are getting updated. New MacBook Pros (available today) also now feature Kaby Lake processores, faster SSDs (50%), and a new model that is more affordable:     iMac Pro Reveal Apple showed an upcoming professional computing machine. It's called the iMac Pro and it uses the same design as the iMac but with a “space grey” finish. It’s going to be by far the most powerful iMac... actually it will be the most powerful Mac ever, besting even the Mac Pro which saw a minor spec upgrade in April and has not seen any major upgrade since the line moved to a cylindrical design in December 2013. Apple are going to put workstation-class performance in the iMac design, which required a better cooling system (see below). It’s still very quiet, but way more powerful.     The iMac Pro will ship with an 8-Core Xeon Processor, but it will also come with 10-Core Xeon Processor option. However, you can ALSO can get up to an 18 Core Xeon Processor. It will feature a Radeon Vega Graphics from AMD, which is a totally new GPU core. It will be available with 16GB of VRAM, and this implementation will offer 11 teraflops of single precision computation and 22 teraflops of half precision computation. You can configure with up to 128GB of ECC memory (insane) and up to 4TB of 3GB/S SSD. It will feature four thunderbolt 3 ports, four USB-3.0 ports, and built-in 10 GB ethernet. With the kind of computing power in the iMac Pro, you can hook up two more 5K displays and 2 high performance raid arrays. This means that the iMac Pro can drive up to 44 million pixels.     Apple says it will be available in December starting at $5000. MacOS High Sierra Apple claims that Safari is “the world’s fastest desktop browser with High Sierra.” It delivers 80% faster performance than Chrome. In addition to speed, they also instituted autoplay blocking, allowing you to avoid annoying videos that play when you load a page and let you decide when/if a video plays. Safari also has Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which uses machine learning to identify tracking of any kind, and protects privacy. It's not just about ads, but any of your browsing habits. On the surface, this looks like it could be as effective at blocking browsing history as a VPN.  Apple also made Photos on the Mac better, by letting you filter by keywords, favorites, media types, etc. They improved facial recognition in images, and when you put effort into categorization and naming, that syncs across devices. They also made enhancements to editing photos: They added curves, selective color (cool I guess), and any edits you make in Photoshop sync with the Photos app. Printing services like Animoto, Wix and Shutterfly are now partnered with Apple Photos for printing services. The Mac file system, HFS, is over 30 years old. Apple is changing to a new file system, Apple File System or APFS, to Mac. It’s 64 bit top to bottom, with safe and secure build. It’s ultra responsive and fast. With the new system, files duplicate and transfer MUCH faster than before. In video, Apple is supporting H.265 which will save 40% better compression. All apps will support the new format. High Sierra is on developer beta today, there is a public beta at the end of June, and a free update this fall to everyone. iOS 11 There are a lot of changes to iOS 11, but here are some of the things we thought would interest you. Messages has a redesigned app drawer, for faster and easier access to stickers and interactive messages. Messages are now stored in iCloud, and all conversations automatically synchronize (finally) across devices. With Messages in the cloud, only the most recent messages are cached on the device with the rest are stored in the cloud, reducing storage on your device. By EOY, more than 50% of retailers will support Apple Pay. To make it even beter, Apple is introducing person-to-person payments. It will be integrated into Messages, so you can send and receive money via the messages app. Authenticated via touch ID, money sent to you goes into an Apple Pay cash card in your Wallet, you can make purchases with it, pay others with it or you can transfer to a bank. Siri has a much more human voice, which includes better inflection and a more "human" sound. One word can be said multiple ways, as you probably know, and now Siri has the ability to know when to say something a certain way. She has a new visual interface, and can provide multiple results to queries you pose to her. You can now use her to translate as well. Ask her anything, and she will repeat it in the correct language. At launch, it will support English to Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish, with more languages coming soon. Siri will understand your voice, and context. Interests, usage of your device, etc. can be used to better understand what you’re asking for. She uses on-device learning to better understand topics of interest to each user. Additionally, Siri is synced across devices now. Control center is being redesigned: it’s now a single page with all the features that used to be spread across two. 3D touch gives you more controls on each of the buttons, which let them compress the view and only show you more when you need it.     Lock screen and notification center are now one item. Swiping down now shows the lock screen and older notifications can be accessed as well. Camera Improvements: With the newest update, Apple is introducing HEVC compression for up to 2x better compression with high resolution video. The video quality won't suffer, but it will take up considerably less space on your phone. They are also replacing JPEG capture with a file type called HEIF, which maintains quality at half the size (2x better compression). All this said, Apple promises that their phone is still compatible across all devices, Apple or not. With the camera specifically, Apple says they improved image quality and low light performance. Optical image stabilizer is better, too. Developers can now have access to the Depth API.     Live photos are improved, and editing of the live photo is now enabled. Sometimes the best photo isn’t the still, but something inside the live photo. Now you can edit it so that the key photo is whatever was captured in the live photo. They also added looping of live photos, edited to your liking. You can also loop in reverse, which is popular on gifs these days. You can also add long exposure looks with your phone without a tripod, it can do it all in the camera. It’s just an editing option now. Apple says that in Photos, Memories is better thanks to the use of machine learning to identify events like weddings, anniversaries, sporting events, etc. You can view movies it makes in portrait as well as landscape mode.  iPad Pro Apple also announced a new size to its high-end iPad Pro lineup, a 10.5-inch model, which replaces the smaller 9.7-inch "Pro" tablet. Sitting below the larger 12.9-inch model, the new 10.5" iPad Pro offers an increased screen real size thanks to its thinner, narrower bezels. The larger screen offers a full-sized on-screen keyboard. It, along with the 12.9-inch model, gains a processor speed bump, going to an A10X Fusion chip. The displays on both iPad Pro models get upgraded display technologies, as well, with 50% brighter True Tone displays and "Pro Motion" technologys that offers up to 120Hz refresh rates. Storage capacity for both new iPad Pro models begins at 64GB. Prices start at $649 for the 10.5-inch model, and $799 for the 12.9-inch one.

Dell, HP and Lenovo showed off new designs that were both attractive and compelling. Mixed-reality headsets hit; based on Intel and Microsoft technology, they were far more affordable than the strong virtual reality stuff already in market (and some aren't bad looking). New core wars broke out, as AMD's 16 Core Threadripper was challenged by Intel's 18 core i9. It seems that gaming was huge at Computex this year. The product -- or the concept really -- that stood out most to me was Nvidia's Max-Q gaming laptop concept, which promises a gaming laptop with dimensions that would rival a MacBook Air. I'll focus on that this week and close with my product of the week: the new smartphone that Apple is working furiously to kill before it can be launched (which is why I immediately ordered one). The Historic Gaming Laptop Problem Here is the deal -- I love to play games both at home and when I travel, and I tend to lock in on one game and play it to death. I'd rather do that than watch TV -- yes, I'm a tad addicted. Currently my game of choice is Ashes of the Singularity, which has as a core plot element the birth of a true artificial intelligence that identifies as female. We try and fail to kill her -- which, as you might expect, pisses her off and results in some epic battles. You get to play both sides, and the combination of story and gameplay creates what is an interesting combination of energetic place, strategic thinking and story ideas. (I'm trying to write my first science fiction book.) The problem is, this game needs a decent graphics processing unit, and that means it won't work on most lightweight laptops using Intel's graphics solution. The game won't even load. However, gaming laptops tend to have two problems: They are heavier, and you pay a huge penalty in battery life. The latter is the bigger problem, because I'm expected to work when I travel, and it is damned hard to work with a dead battery. Recently I've started using the Microsoft Surface Book with the second-generation base, which has both a GPU and decent battery life (10-plus hours), but it is a middleweight, and it barely has enough power to run the game. What I wanted seemed impossible: something that was very light, had decent battery life, and enough power to really enjoy a game like Ashes of the Singularity. Enter the Max-Q. Nvidia's Max-Q I really didn't see this coming, but Nvidia announced its prototype Max-Q, a design for a gaming laptop that is as thin as a MacBook Air, in the ultra-light class of notebooks. It sports 1080-level graphics, which is the baseline for gaming that's more typical on a desktop computer. If you are like me, you likely are wondering about how this thing will be cooled -- largely because if you combine a thin laptop with lots of performance, the little fans that have to keep the thing cool start sounding like jet engine. That doesn't bode well for meetings or using in the same room with your spouse. Nvidia's WisperMode technology keeps that fan noise down to a minimum, unless you are really stressing the system. Overall, there has been a ton of effort on fan acoustics for both laptops and desktop computers. While not totally eliminating the sound, these advances certainly have reduced it to far more acceptable levels (and you really shouldn't be gaming in meetings, or with your spouse in the room anyway). Battery Life One thing we don't know about yet is battery life, and that likely won't be something I can chat about until the manufacturers start sharing what they are building. Lenovo is one of them, and it typically places battery life very high on its list of requirements. If anyone produces a perfect laptop with all of this and 10-plus hours of battery life, my early bet is that it is likely to be Lenovo. Keep your eyes on Alienware, though, as the most powerful gaming computer company in the segment. It's also on the list of firms building Max-Q solutions. I'll touch on this once I'm released from related NDAs or at product launch in a few weeks. (Actual products launch on June 27, which, coincidently, is exactly a month to the day before my birthday. Hint, hint...) Wrapping Up While I'm sure I'll still want the performance of a desktop computer when I'm at home, being able to play games while on the road and having a laptop that is light and easy to carry used to seem as impossible as having a car that could drive itself. Apparently, we are in an age when doing the impossible is becoming an almost everyday occurrence. I mean, self-driving cars, flying cars, people-carrying drones, hoverboards that actually hover, and now a gaming notebook that is also ultra-light. Now we just need antigravity -- oh wait... Remember the scene in Jerry Maguire when he goes back to his wife to make up with her and offers a lengthy explanation about why he is an assh*le in an effort to get her back? She responds with "You had me at hello." Well before I knew anything more than it was coming, I planned to order this phone, because of the huge effort Apple went to in order to try to make sure it never shipped. I've only ever seen Apple this worried twice before and both were during the days of the iPod and Steve Jobs. First, it was because Apple found out about an MP3 player from HP. The second time was when it learned of one coming from Dell. Apple aggressively worked to kill both products before they even launched -- and succeeded. I never even saw the HP product. Given that very little actually seems to scare Apple, short of a U.S. president, I had to have the phone that did. The Essential Phone was designed from the ground up to be an iPhone killer by Andy Rubin, the guy who was at the heart of Android's success. Essential Phone If you go down a list of things that seem to target the iPhone directly, the first is the Qualcomm 835 chipset, the most advanced currently in market. This gives the Essential Phone unmatched connectivity at a time when Apple is being accused of crippling its own phone's connectivity solution. iPhones use aluminum and glass, making the glass the most rigid part of the phone and resulting in lots of breakage. The Essential Phone uses titanium, ceramic and glass, making it far harder to break the phone's screen. Instead of a plug-in connector that lets water into the phone and creates a hazard if you trip over the wire, the Essential Phone uses magnetic connectors reminiscent of what Apple used to use in it portable PC products. These connectors allow the phone to be upgraded with accessories. Yes, Motorola did this first, but Apple didn't do it at all. Oh, and the fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone, where it always should have been, along with a camera that is designed -- hold your breath -- to work well in low light! In the end, the Essential Phone is very much what you'd get if you went down a list of things you didn't like about the iPhone and created the anti-iPhone. That alone is enough to make it my product of the week. You can pre-order it unlocked for US$699. Don't let Apple tell you what you can and can't buy.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Computers Apple announces upgrades across all its Macs at WWDC 2017 David Nield June 5, 2017 Apple's MacBooks and iMacs are getting performance boosts View gallery - 4 images Apple has announced hardware upgrades across its entire Mac line, including spec boosts for the iMac, the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. The company also unveiled what it's calling its most powerful computer ever, a brand new iMac Pro. Mentioned as part of the keynote at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, the most notable upgrade is the arrival of Intel's latest seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors across all of Apple's MacBook Pros and iMacs. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW That should mean better performance with less power across the board, as well as more capable graphics. iMacs were the first group of computers mentioned by Apple. The display resolutions on the all-in-ones are staying the same, but the underlying technology is getting a boost to provide 500 nits of brightness, which should lead to a 43 percent increase in brightness over the older models. The 21.5-inch models can now fit up to 32 GB of RAM, with up to 64 GB available on the 27-inch models. Combined with the Kaby Lake upgrades, users should see significant performance improvements, though Apple didn't quantify the speed boosts. Graphics are also getting an upgrade on all iMac models: The top-end 27-inch 5K edition can now fit the Radeon Pro 570, 575 and 580 graphics cards, for example. Judging by the demos we saw at WWDC, part of the thinking behind these upgrades is to finally get Apple a seat at the table in the realm of virtual reality. With the new hardware and new software partnerships announced by Apple, it's now possible to develop VR games and apps straight from an iMac. Prices are sticking at US$1,099 for the entry level 21.5-inch iMac, while the top-end 27-inch 5K model stays at $1,799. There is a drop for the 21.5-inch 4K iMac though, which is going down to $1,499 for the cheapest configuration. As for the MacBook and MacBook Pros, the new Kaby Lake processors make them a more compelling proposition. The basic MacBook is also in line for a faster SSD, Apple says, while the long-neglected MacBook Air will be getting a processor upgrade to an as-yet-unspecified Intel model. Prices remain largely unchanged despite the specs bump: the MacBook starts at $1,299, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $1,799 and the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch bar is $2,399 and up. The one difference is a drop to $1,299 for the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro. In short, the machines you can now buy from Apple are faster and more capable than the ones you could buy yesterday, with improvements in display technology, graphics power, and processing speed. The new models all go on sale today. Apple also had time to show off a brand new iMac Pro coming to its range soon: fitted with a Xeon processor with up to 18 cores, Radeon Vega graphics, a maximum of 128GB of RAM, up to 4 TB of SSD drive storage and four Thunderbolt ports, this is a serious machine for serious users. Apple is calling it the most powerful Mac it's ever made, and you'll need to pay for the privilege of using it – prices start at $4,999, with no release date yet announced. As for the software running on all these machines, WWDC also saw Apple announce macOS High Sierra, the successor to last year's Sierra. The operating system, available as a free upgrade later this year, brings with it a smarter Safari, a revamped file system, and better graphics processing, including (surprise surprise) native VR support.Product page: Apple View gallery - 4 images Apple announces upgrades across all its Macs at WWDC 2017 1 / 4 Apple's MacBooks and iMacs are getting performance boosts Upgrades include brighter screens, faster processors and more capable graphics for the iMacs All of Apple's MacBooks and MacBook Pros now use Intel's Kaby Lake processors As for the upcoming iMac Pro, improved ventilation and air flow means Apple can pack in more powerful components Tags #Apple #iMac #MacBook #MacBook Pro Share this article Post a comment Top stories Apple's answer to Amazon Echo is the $349 HomePod Review: Panasonic's DC-FZ80 superzoom is more than a one-trick pony The Workhorse Surefly could become a two-seat sportscar of the skies Streamlined pickup camper features lightweight composite design Sponsored Content Recommended for you Sponsored Content Latest in Computers Apple announces upgrades across all its Macs at WWDC 2017 IBM's new 5nm architecture crams 30 billion transistors onto fingernail-sized chip Voice-imitation advance means we can't trust what we see or hear anymore Adobe Scan puts a document scanner with text recognition on your phone Shadow Brokers hacking group reveals bizarre data dump subscription plan Acer announces new laptops for work and play Google's AI beats world's top-ranking Go player NEC earbuds showcase hands-free biometric verification Rise of the mind-reading machines HP unleashes "The Machine" memory-centric supercomputer prototype Ransomware, Windows XP and the NSA leak that started it all Microsoft unveils Story Remix, a multifaceted video creation app Editors Choice In photos: Big rigs, 4x4 retromods and other earth-eaters of Overland Expo 2017 Compare the latest tech gear World's most beautiful car up for sale The revolutionary redox system that produces and stores energy in the home Rise of the mind-reading machines Masterclass: 25 legendary cars that prove beauty is more than skin deep 2017 Smartwatch Comparison Guide Fast Radio Bursts: How close are we to decoding these strange space signals?

Andrew Cunningham - Jun 5, 2017 6:08 pm UTC Enlarge / The one-ported MacBook. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 124 Share this story SAN JOSE, Calif.—Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is usually all about software, but every once in a while it brings some hardware along with it, too. Today, Apple provided a minor but wide-ranging refresh to its modern MacBooks and MacBook Pros by adding new processors from Intel and making a handful of other tweaks. Further ReadingIntel unveils Kaby Lake, its first post-“tick-tock” CPU architecture The new processors are from Intel’s “Kaby Lake” family, and some of them have been available for the better part of a year. Compared to the outgoing Skylake architecture, Kaby Lake introduces a gently tweaked version of Intel’s 14nm manufacturing process, provides small boosts to CPU clock speeds, and supports native acceleration for decoding and encoding some kinds of 4K video streams. The 12-inch MacBook, last updated in April of 2016, stands to benefit the most. The low-power Y-series chips the MacBook uses see the biggest performance boost from the Kaby Lake upgrade, and Apple has also added the refined butterfly switch keyboard introduced in the MacBook Pros last year. The keyboards both have the same layout and offer the same amount of key travel, but the newer version of the keyboard has a slightly more satisfying feel. The new MacBook will also get a faster SSD. The Kaby Lake chips make less of a difference in the new MacBook Pro, which was updated just eight months ago after a year-and-a-half or so of neglect. It’s a fast turnaround, which means there are few differences between the new 2017 versions and their predecessors. As before, the 13-inch models use dual-core CPUs and integrated GPUs across the lineup, while the 15-inch versions include quad-core CPUs and dedicated AMD GPUs that can be used to push multiple 5K displays at once. The new 15-inch models will have faster GPUs. The 13-inch versions come with Intel’s “Iris Plus” GPUs, which are pretty similar to Skylake’s Iris GPUs, aside from the new “Plus” branding. They still include a performance-boosting 64MB of eDRAM, which gives them a big leg up compared to MacBook Pros from 2015 and earlier. MacBook prices start at $1,299 while the non-Touch Bar version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro will also start at $1,299. The MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop with a Touch Bar will start at $1,799, while the 15-inch version will start at $2,399.

Apple is bringing Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors to the new iMac, along with what Apple calls “the best Mac display ever,” offering 500 nits of brightness, or 43 percent brighter than the previous generation. The 21.5-inch model now can be configured up to 32GB of RAM, while the 27-inch goes up to 64GB, twice what had previously been offered. The new iMacs also are getting two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, making it Apple’s first desktop computer to embrace the port standard. The new iMacs will support VR Graphics cards are getting a spec boost in the updated iMacs, too. The entry-level 21.5-inch model will have an Intel Iris Plus 640 GPU, while the 4K 21.5-inch models will get Radeon Pro 555 and 560 graphics cards. Meanwhile, the 27-inch 5K model will have a choice of Radeon Pro 570, 575, and 580 graphics cards, topping out at 8GB of VRAM. (The top model Radeon Pro 580 is roughly equivalent to an Nvidia 1060.) Those new GPUs, along with updates in macOS High Sierra, also means that the new iMacs will support VR. While the design of the iMac is mostly unchanged from the outside, it’s still a significant update, given that it’s been almost almost two years since Apple last updated the desktop line in October 2015. And it’s especially important, given that these new iMacs are pulling double duty as Apple’s primary desktop computer until it sorts out the situation with the Mac Pro sometime next year, although the newly announced iMac Pro slated for later this year should help with that. The 21.5-inch iMac will start at $1,099 and the 4K 21.5-inch model at $1,299. The updated iMacs will be available later today.

As had been previously rumored, last year’s MacBook Pros are getting Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, as is Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, which is also getting faster SSDs. Additionally, there’s a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299, while the 15-inch model now has discrete graphics included standard. Otherwise, the MacBook remains unchanged, with the same screen, design, and ports. Diving into the hardware specs, the MacBook now maxes out at up to a 1.3GHz Core i7 processor, the 13-inch MacBook Pro has up to a 3.5GHz Core i7, and the 15-inch MacBook Pro goes up to a 3.1GHz Core i7 processor. Finally, the long-languishing MacBook Air is getting an update, albeit a minor one — Apple is giving the Air a desperately needed speed boost, now offering a faster 1.8GHz Intel processor — the company has yet to offer more details, aside from the speed boost — but that’s about it. The screen is still the same 1440 x 900 panel, the design remains unchanged, and there are no USB-C ports. It seems that the Air is sticking around as an entry-level budget model, even as Apple looks to push users to the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Overall, the updates across the MacBook line show that Apple is committed to staying competitive in the laptop space, even if the spec boost fails to address larger problems with the products like Apple’s unwavering commitment to USB-C or the gimmicky Touch Bar. Still, given the huge amount of time that has historically gone between even spec boosts for some Apple products, like the iMac or Mac Pro, it’s nice to see that the company seems to be trying harder to keep things updated going forward. The newly updated MacBook laptops will be available today.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Makes Subtle Change to High-End Desktop Platform Intel's high-end desktop platform diverges from its datacenter heritage in one interesting way. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 5, 2017 at 12:15PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced its next-generation high-end desktop processor family, known as the Core X-series of chips. This product family is aimed at gamers, content creators, and other users that demand more computing power than typical personal computer users need to perform their tasks. Intel's high-end desktop processors have historically been derived from the chips that the company builds for the server/workstation market, and the Core X-based processors are no different in this regard. Image source: Intel. Where Intel has made a change in this generation -- and it is a subtle one, to be sure -- is in the platform controller hub, or PCH, that powers the motherboards the new Core X chips plug into. In this column, I'd like to go over that change and what it could mean for the company's high-end desktop platform business now and in the future. How things were Prior high-end desktop platforms used the same PCH chip that was used in the company's high-end datacenter platforms. The datacenter PCH chips generally pack a lot more "stuff" than their mainstream desktop computer-oriented PCH counterparts. It's worth noting, though, that Intel has traditionally updated its datacenter PCH chips at a slower pace than it has its personal computer-specific PCH chips. This meant that at launch, the high-end desktop platforms were often more feature-rich than their mainstream desktop counterparts, but the mainstream desktop platforms would enjoy quicker PCH updates. What this ultimately resulted in is that in the middle of and toward the end of an Intel high-end desktop platform's life, the cheaper mainstream Intel desktop platforms were often simply more robust and, therefore, more desirable. Mainstream and high-end desktop now share common PCH Intel launched its latest high-end desktop platform a few days ago, and the PCH that pairs with it -- known as X299 -- isn't the same PCH that will be part of the company's upcoming Purley server platform. Instead, based on the published specifications of the X299 PCH, it appears to be nearly identical to the mainstream desktop Z270 PCH that Intel released earlier this year in capabilities; the only difference is that the X299 PCH supports a maximum of 8 SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports, while the Z270 supports just six. I suspect that Z270 and X299 are the same chip, with a couple of SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports disabled on the PCH chips sold as Z270s. What this means for Intel's high-end desktop business The potential downside is that, at launch, a "new" high-end desktop platform going forward won't be as feature-rich as "new" high-end desktop platforms were in the past. However, there are numerous positives that I think will ultimately outweigh that negative. Indeed, Intel should be able to update its high-end desktop PCH chips on an annual basis (in line with the mainstream desktop platform) now, rather than once every two to three years, as was the case when the high-end desktop PCH chips were the same ones as those used in the datacenter platforms. This should allow Intel's high-end desktop platform to feel "fresher," and it could also make life better for Intel's motherboard partners. In the past, the motherboard makers would try to build a second wave of motherboards based on the same chipset (usually by revamping the look of the board, adding auxiliary chips to enable new features, and so on). That worked, but it's obviously a costly, inelegant, and frankly less marketable solution. It's better and cheaper for motherboard makers to be able to avail themselves of a new, more feature-rich/integrated platform controller hub to release refreshed high-end desktop motherboards. And, to the extent that Intel can get paid a premium for the features that it integrates into future PCH chips (since motherboard makers would no longer need to buy third-party chips for said features), the better it is for the company's platform average selling prices, revenues, and profits. Finally, the mainstream desktop PCH chips are likely more cost-optimized than their datacenter counterparts, which should lead to lower high-end desktop PCH manufacturing costs. Intel may choose to pass some, or all, of those cost savings onto its motherboard partners. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews Reviews  The Best GPU For Ethereum Mining – NVIDIA and AMD Tested The Best GPU For Ethereum Mining – NVIDIA and AMD Tested Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Mon, Jun 05, 2017 - 10:28 AM We’ve never done an article on GPU mining on Legit Reviews before, but continued interest in the ethereum project has caused Ether (the name of the cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain app) to skyrocket in price by more than 2,800% this year alone. On Sunday, ethereum traded at an all-time high of $250.41, according to data from industry website CoinDesk. With increases and coin prices like that it has spiked the demand for discrete graphics cards in order to do GPU mining. Ethereum discourages the use of custom ASICs and FPGAs when it comes to mining, so this is something you could do if you wanted to on a PC with a powerful discrete graphics card. When you dive into the world of GPU mining you’ll quickly find that to make any serious money that you’ll need to invest in a fair bit of hardware. Let’s go trough the hardware that one would likely need if they wanted to build a 6  or 7 GPU ethereum mining machine. Over at the Ethereum Community Forums you’ll find hundreds of threads about building a 6-7 GPU mining machine and you can make some pretty good money off a system like that. With 7 AMD Radeon RX 480 video cards that have been optimized for mining you should be able to get around 200 MH/s when mining etherum, so if you plug that into a profit calculator you are looking at making a profit of $12,870 per year at the current ETH price of $245. That’s guessing the rig uses around 1,000 Watts 24/7 and electric costs $0.1265 KW/h. (Please keep in mind the price of etherum could always drop to zero or skyrocket, so think long and hard before you buy hardware to do this.) Custom Mining Rig Build By mininghardware (MHW) on ECF So, you want to building a mining PC? This is a quick summary of what you’ll need to get going. Motherboard:  You’ll need a little luck and possibly some magic or a custom UEFI to find a motherboard that supports six to seven video cards. The Intel Z87 and Z97 chipsets for LGA1150 processors offer a pretty good bang for the buck as they are being cleared out to make room for the newer Intel Z170 and Z270 motherboards for the LGA1151 processors. Our favorite board right for GPU mining is the MSI Z170A GAMING PRO CARBON as it has the ability to run SEVEN GPU’s at a time when using the latest UEFI for $129.99 on Amazon. That board is starting to get hard to find, so grab one sooner rather than later! Processor: If you go with an LGA1150 motherboard the Intel Celeron G1840 Processor is often used as it a TDP of just 53 Watts and costs $55.99 shipped.  If you opted for the newer Intel LGA1151 platform something like the Intel Celeron Processor G3930 at $51.00 shipped would be a bad choice and has a TDP of 51 Watts. Since the CPU load is minimal (usually under 15% for pooled mining) you can get away with a low-cost processor and they both come with a heatsink fan (HSF) that you can use. Power Supply: Your system is going to be running 24/7 and using close to 1000 Watts of power non-stop,  so you’ll want to drop some coin on a good model. We highly suggest an 80 PLUS Platinum rated power supply that is 1200W or greater. We’ve used the Enermax Platimax 1350W ($239.99 shipped) with good success. If you plan on undervolting the GPU and reducing the power consumption you should be able to get away with a 1,000 Watt power supply. The EVGA SuperNOVA 1000 is solid 80 PLUS platinum model for $213.72 shipped or you can go with a lower cost Corsair RM1000x that is 80 PLUS gold certified for $179.99 shipped. Depending on the model you get and the model of video card that you are running you might need to get some SATA to 8-pin PCIe power adapters. Memory: Depending on what motherboard you got you’ll need DDR3 or DDR4 memory. Chances are you’ll need DDR4 memory and we suggest using an 8GB of memory. Some people say you can get away with single channel memory, but we’ve always run dual-channel in our mining rigs. A typical DDR4 2133 MHz 8GB (2x4GB) memory kit will run you about $59.99 from a big name brand. Storage Drive: Small and inexpensive is again the name of the game here. You likely don’t want to use a M.2 PCIe graphics card as some boards will disable PCIe slots when a M.2 PCIe SSD is inserted into the board. For that reason we suggest going with something like a low-cost 120GB SATA III SSD. The Kingston A400 120GB SATA III SSD at $47.99  or PNY CS1311 120GB SSD at $52.99 are hard to beat. Riser Cards: Most go with USB powered 1x to 16x riser cards. These sell out often and they are mostly all made by companies that no one has heard of. The reviews on most are mixed, so you’ll just need to pick some and roll the dice. You’ll likely be paying around $8 each. Case: Get creative and make your own! Our favorite GPU mining builds are done using milk crates, some PVC pipes and zip ties. The might not look fancy, but they cost under $15 to make. Mouse/Monitor/Keyboard: Whatever is cheap! OS: Windows 10 works, but ethOS Mining OS is a 64-bit linux OS that was designed just for ethereum mining and runs $39. Video Cards: AMD Radeon RX 470/480 and Radeon RX 570/580 video cards are all the rage right now when it comes to ethereum mining, but they are extremely tough to find since they are all being bought to mine.   Since we couldn’t find any Radeon RX 580 video cards to purchase at Amazon, Newegg, Micro Center or Best Buy we figured we’d try mining on some of the cards we had laying around to see how they perform. Let’s take a look at the results on our system running Claymore’s Dual Ethereum GPU Miner v9.4 and Windows 10 v1703. Best Performance:  AMD Radeon R9 295X2 The AMD Radeon R9 295X2 came out in April 2014 and is over two years old, but this Dual-GPU card is able to be at the top of the performance chart with 57.6 MH/s of performance. We’ve seen these selling for as low as $500 on eBay, but the TDP on this card is an awe-inspiring 500W, so packing 7 of these into a single system would be more than what any one power supply could handle. The thought of a single system pulling  3,500+ Watts is pretty crazy! Best Value Performer:  The AMD Radeon RX 480 and Radeon RX 580 are solid performing cards.When the AMD Radeon RX 480 first came out it the prices started at $199 and for that you get around 24 MH/s of performance ether mining in stock form, but you can easily get that up to 25-27 MH/s if you wanted to mod the BIOS and dial the cards in. You can reduce the power usage in AMD Wattman to get the power draw on these cards well below the 150W TDP rating. The new AMD Radeon RX 580 uses more power and costs more than the Radeon RX 480, but it gets higher performance and many are able to get 29 MH/s per card at around 135 Watts of power when you do all the widely known power adjustments. No wonder the AMD Radeon RX 580/570 cards are all sold out. Biggest Upset:  When we saw the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 getting 27.4 MH/s in stock form we were impressed, but then the faster clocked NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with more CUDA cores only got 20 MH/s. We talked to NVIDIA about this and they said it’s because the Ethereum base code fits the GDDR5 latency characteristics better than GDDR5X. So, when it comes to Ethereum mining a GeForce GTX 1070 is better to have than the GeForce GTX 1080. That said the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti uses GDDR5X memory and is getting 32 MH/s. Looks Good On Paper:  The AMD Radeon R9 NANO gets an impressive 27 MH/s, but that’s all you can really get on that model as AMD doesn’t allow you to overclock the HBM memory and if you reduce the power usage at all the hashrate drops as well. This 175W TDP card has good performance, but at $515 it will take a longer time to recoup your money. You can actually buy two Radeon RX 480/580 cards for this price and overclock them to get up to 27 MH/s and reduce the power usage/voltage to get about 40-50W lower power use per card. The AMD Radeon R9 390 gets an impressive 30 MH/s in stock form, but the cards 275W TDP makes is less desirable. Worst Performer: The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 900 series cards don’t mine well on Windows 10 and use a fair bit of power, so if you have one of these cards you’ll want to run Windows 7 or EthOS where you can get around 10 MH/s.   Final Thoughts:  We could have talked about mining for days, but it really depends on what hardware you get and how you configure all your software. The AMD Radeon RX 580 and Radeon RX 480 are the cards to get right now, but it’s tough to find them. You can build up a rig like this for $2,500 or less and make an extra $1,000 a month at the current rates. We highly suggest looking at Ethereum profit calculatorsEthereum profit calculators and factor in the build cost and electricity to see if mining is right for you! Let us know if you have any questions in the comments below! Angel Cota Why recommend 480/580 when you can get a GTX1070 for less at current prices? the gtx does about the same MH at much less power draw so it should be a better choice. Am I missing something? sukstobeu I’ve seen some BIOS modded 480/580’s can get 29 to 31MH/s and that’s with lower stock voltages. iq100 You wrote>”… If you opted for the newer Intel LGA1151 platform something like the Intel Celeron Processor G3930 at $51.00 shipped would be a bad choice and has a TDP of 51 Watts.

If so, please correct, and try put in place procedure that do NOT make major errors, like I believe you did here. Thanks! John Hopkins How did you connect 7 graphics card to one PSU? They look like they only have 6 8 pin connectors on the PSU. Nathan Kirsch As mentioned in the PSU section: “Depending on the model you get and the model of video card that you are running you might need to get some SATA to 8-pin PCIe power adapters.” You’ll need something like this: http://amzn.to/2r57XW0 Anthony Vitale Total System power use would have gone a long way to help further differentiate these results. Performance per watt is an important factor if electricity isn’t free. Nathan Kirsch I made the decision to skip that since most miners don’t run the cards at stock settings. They flash the card with a custom BIOS, underclock the voltage on the GPU/Memory, Overclock the memory, and reduce the cards overall power usage. With a dozen of the same model card that isn’t hard to dial in, but on this many cards that is very time consuming. Paul Henta I am surprised when you say that GTX 900 are bad miner. I can get 42mh/s using two gtx 970 in sli which mean 21 for a single one. it is documented that soem nvidia drivers are better than others. if you mine ether with a gtx 900 series you must use the 347.88 drivers and fiddle a bit with the nevidia settings. as always google is your friends. consumption is the issue but its not that bad. Nathan Kirsch Thanks for the additional info and hopefully that will help folks. I admit that I only tried GeForce 382.33 and then the GeForce 368.81 drivers recommended in Claymore’s utility. Both performed under 3 MH/s on this Windows 10 build, so I called it a day as I had a stack of cards to test. You can dive deep into optimizations on each card, but I was trying to show what you get with the latest drivers with stock settings (with the exception on a couple cards)! Rolling back to a driver that old isn’t a big deal on a dedicated mining rig, but might be a tough sell to gamers that are looking to make some spare cash when they aren’t gaming or using their PC. Coach I fiddled with ethereum mining a bit. My antivirus and malware software fights it constantly. I had disabled them but upon a reboot, my mining program was quarantined and deleted due to a known trojan that was in it. Do I trust the mining program or not? I found my Ryzen 1800x seems to mine as well, I doubt as well as my gpu but it was scrolling along pretty good. Nathan Kirsch What mining program did you try? Claymore’s Dual Ethereum GPU miner is one of the more easy utilities to use and it’s multi-GPU friendly. I’ve even had it running on an AMD/NVIDIA system running Windows 10 with no issues. There is a 1% fee to use his utility, but considering how easy it is to use many aren’t bothered by it. Some go to great lengths to negate his fee by being creative and others have released utilities with bad stuff in them to reduce the developer fee. Sound I just had the same problem last night. I tried a modded Claymore’s Dual Ethereum miner from BuriedONE and my Kaspersky virus scanner called it a Trojan. Not sure if it is actually a trojan, or if its just the scanner. Going to try the non-modded Claymore tonight. Sound Update – tried Claymore not modded.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search Is Now a Good Time to Buy an Intel CPU or Motherboard? By Michael Crider on June 5th, 2017 When you’re assembling a new computer (or upgrading an old one), the motherboard and CPU have a few extra considerations that you need to keep in mind. First, they’re the most restrictive parts to pair: only a relative few processors will fit with your motherboard’s specific socket type. And second, the motherboard selection itself is going to determine a lot of the core capability and direction of your PC build. You definitely need both of these components to build anything that broadly counts as a PC. But is now a good time in terms of economy and tech to invest in some new Intel-branded parts? Short answer: No. Intel’s current crop of “Kaby Lake” processors has met with disappointing reactions due to modest bumps. The next generation is going to be only slightly optimized, and it hasn’t been confirmed that the much faster “Cannonlake” processors in late 2017 will use the same LGA 1151 motherboard socket. If you have the option, you should wait on a purchase. 14nm Processors Are On Their Way Out CPU manufacturing generations can generally be split up into years (Intel releases a new model for each price/performance point almost every year), but you can also group them by semiconductor size. The second one is crucial, and at the current level of fabrication it’s measured in nanometers—the smaller the better, since smaller semiconductors can be crammed into a CPU more densely. It’s a lot more complicated than that, of course, but “fewer nm = faster processor” is a decent rule of thumb. Right now, Intel is selling the third iteration of its 14nm CPU designs: “Broadwell” began in 2015 (model numbers 5xxx), followed by “Skylake” (6xxx) and now “Kaby Lake” (7xxx). All of the consumer versions of these chips use the LGA 1151 CPU socket, so named because (wait for it) it has 1,151 contact pins connecting the processor to the motherboard. Intel is definitely planning at least one more 14nm processor generation, “Coffee Lake” (model numbers 8xxx), with a release scheduled for sometime in the second half of this year. It’s confirmed that Coffee Lake will once again use the LGA 1151 processor socket, making it compatible with all of the consumer-class motherboards now on the market. That said, as an iteration of the current fabrication design, Coffee Lake is expected to come with a relatively modest fifteen percent bump in performance levels. Kaby Lake was already pretty shallow in terms of performance gains at each level of Intel’s processor hierarchy, and it’s likely that the company’s dominant position over AMD is allowing it a bit of wiggle room in the market. With Ryzen CPUs making notable improvements, at generally better prices to boot, all eyes are on the 10-nanometer chip designs expected to be available starting at the end of 2017. …and 10nm CPUs Might Come With A New Socket Cannonlake is adding a bit of ambiguity to Intel’s immediate future. At this point it’s been proposed, but not proven, that the big shift for CPUs will use the LGA 1151 socket—the same one in use on most Intel-compatible motherboards since 2015. With new chipsets on LGA 1151 motherboards as recent as the first quarter of 2017, it seems at least possible that Intel would want to preserve compatibility, making a new motherboard (if not CPU) purchase at least somewhat viable at the moment. The LGA 1151 will stick around for one more Intel CPU revision—after that, its future is unclear. But Intel has yet to formally confirm that Cannonlake-class CPUs will be available in LGA 1151 configurations, as they’ve done with Coffee Lake. Since the older LGA 1150 socket and several before it lasted for two processor generations—about two years—we’re due for a new one. A dramatically smaller fabrication process with the expected performance gains therein would be an apposite time to introduce a new socket with more capable chipsets. There’s also a new RAM standard, DDR5, expected to hit the wider market in early 2018 (LGA 1151 motherboards support DDR3/4). It’s possible (though less likely) that Intel will release a few Cannonlake CPUs that work with LGA 1151 before transitioning to a new socket. Either way, the uncertainty of Intel’s socket intentions should be enough to make spec-hungry buyers wait to see if the current standard holds or if the market will transition to new hardware at the usual time. Even if Cannonlake keeps to the LGA 1151 format, it’s likely to be the last generation of Intel processors that does. Intel’s Market Position Means Deals Are Thin on the Ground Even if Intel’s current lineup of chips isn’t setting the world on fire with performance gains, the company still has a staggering lead over its only competition in the desktop space, AMD. Though the latter’s excellent Ryzen designs have given it a slight sales bump, Intel still sells four out of every five chips. As the direct supplier of its CPUs to retailers like Newegg and TigerDirect, that doesn’t give the company much incentive to discount its current production hardware. Let’s take a look at the Core i5 6600K, a popular mid-range Skylake-class processor for gamers and overclockers. According to the Amazon price tracker CamelCamelCamel, it spiked in price after its initial availability, then settled into the $220-250 range for over a year, and dropped below $200 only when its Kaby Lake replacement came out in early 2017. You can see that Intel processors tend to hold their price fairly steadily, unless driven up by scarcity, which only tends to happen at the start of production. You might be able to find better deals on motherboards, since the socket and chipset specifications are licensed by Intel to third parties. With vendors like Asus, Gigabyte, Asrock, MSI, and EVGA competing amongst themselves to give enthusiasts the most features at the best price, there’s definitely a lot of room to save some money. But since a mid-range CPU will usually cost as much as the motherboard itself, your overall savings are always going to be limited. Motherboards are more likely than CPUs to fluctuate in price. Even if you’re not interested in a Coffee Lake or Cannonlake-class processor, it would be wise to wait until they start to hit the market if you want to save money on a CPU. With newer units on shelves (especially with Coffee Lake confirmed as LGA 1151 compatible), older processors and overstocked items will be discounted at specialty retailers to move them out of inventory. If you can, hold off on a new Intel CPU or motherboard purchase, at least until Coffee Lake and preferably until Cannonlake. Your new build will be faster or cheaper…though probably not both.

Late last week Intel announced graphics driver version 15.45.19.4678, delivered for Intel 6th and 7th generation CPUs, and for Windows 7/8.1/10 PC systems. The headlining changes in Intel's latest Skylake and Kaby Lake integrated graphics driver seem to revolve around games performance and game loading times. With the latest driver release Intel is boasting that it is game ready for both DiRT 4 and Tekken 7 (as long as your CPU has Intel HD Graphics 620 or better). Other recent big name titles such as Prey, and Rising Storm 2: Vietnam are supported by systems packing Intel Iris Pro Graphics. Less GPU-specific are the following game title load-time reductions thanks to the update. Star Wars Battlefront, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Battlefield 1 are all said to start with "significantly reduced load-times". Intel hints that other unnamed titles benefit from similar load-time optimisations. Last but not least for the gamers, Intel says that World of Warcraft: Legion, Tom Clancy’s The Division, and For Honor players will all see performance improvements and smoother gameplay using Intel iGPUs from the Skylake or Kaby Lake families. A driver update wouldn't be complete without a raft of bug fixes and Intel has fixed numerous issues in driver 15.45.19.4678. As well as a few gaming issue fixes the driver removes annoying audio issues with USB Type-C display second screens, patches rotating screen view mode problems, adds Netflix optimisations, implements OC stability improvements and fixes some graphics anomalies in DX9 apps.

Blog Intels Passenger Economy: Whats the Point? Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 6/5/2017 09:21 AM EDT  3 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Intel Corp. last week issued a report predicting that the future of fully automated vehicles would unleash a $7 trillion 'Passenger Economy' in 2050. It sounds far-fetched? Yes. But it's worth reading, and here are five reasons why. Intel Corp. last week issued a report predicting that the future of fully automated vehicles would unleash a $7 trillion "Passenger Economy" in 2050. Passenger Economy Report To mark the occasion, Intel hired Strategy Analytics, a market research firm, to examine the concept and write a report.   Any forecast designed not only to predict the long-term future of a commercial product, but also to cover a broad swath of social and economic impacts, faces a few accountability issues. For one thing, how many of us who read the report today will be around in 2050 to check the results?   Moreover, a big number like $7 trillion, which the report describes is “more than the projected 2017 GDPs of Japan and Brazil combined,” catches the eye, but it also renders the report somewhat suspect. One can’t help but wonder if the report is a little self-serving to the company who paid for the research.     Given such caveats, it’s easy to dismiss this report. But as I read through, I found that, wittingly or unwittingly, it explains fully automated cars more effectively than most other market forecasts I’ve seen.    The report does not provide sales forecasts for fully autonomous cars over the next 20 years, profiles of potential buyers, or penetration rates for autonomous vehicles per household. I suspect such omissions are by design.    The report’s key takeaway is that the future -- to be created by fully automated cars and autonomous technologies -- is neither about vehicles nor the automotive business. It’s about the world beyond transportation affected by fully automated technologies.       Let me explain what led me to this conclusion, and why I think the report is worth reading.   1. Why does Intel care? First, the report offers a rare look into the corporate mind at places like Intel, who are heavily invested in driverless cars. It illustrates their need to identify – if not justify – the opportunity for a pilotless vehicle future.   During the press briefing on the report, when asked why Intel cares enough to commission this costly forecast, Intel's vice president and general manager of Automated Driving Solutions Group, Doug Davis, explained that knowing the future is essential to anticipating the challenges ahead.   “Evident from other technologies we’ve lived through,” Davis said, “The more we understand the future, the better positioned we will be to adapt to it.” Next page: Shift from manufacturers to service providers   Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author stock stock stock alex_m1   6/5/2017 4:09:51 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate The point is simple:"Level 4 model – not Level 5, though – is expected to reach the market in 2021. "  Since this is implied by Intel, this opens a lot of growth potential for Intel/MobileEye in a few years, and this could affect Intel's stock - in a much bigger way than the cost of this report.  Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Freelancer 2050 AD?

Businesses need efficiency and will be mostly for deliveries not travel. Consumer (that includes commute) will have much higher ASPs per mile. You start with how low must the price be to capture 100% of a person's needs in a certain market but soon enough the thinking transitions to how to increase ARPU. If you have 2 billion users at $150 ASP per month, that's already 3.6 trillions per year. By the time you get to 3 billion, ASPs are lower but once you add deliveries you somewhat get to 7 trillion. And don't forget that this includes buses but mostly in rural and developing. The ARPU in developed markets will matter a lot and we'll see a luxury and marketing escalation as such services try to convince consumers to pay more. Not knowing Japan at all, i can safely say )LOL) that Japan will likely have some of the craziest offerings. If folks want cars with hotubs, that's what folks will get but i wonder how far things might go. Take an 18-wheeler, turn it into a club or a condo and off one goes for some price they can actually afford. It is replacing car sales, maintenance, the fuel supply chain, insurance and so on - the sum of those is much larger. On top of that it is creating new opportunities and greatly expanding the global miles traveled. The shift is cost driven, you either pay a lot less or you get a lot more for the same money. It's also more convenient not to deal with maintenance, refueling, parking .. or owning a garage. And more flexibility as you can ride in different types of vehicles, according to one's needs at a given time. Nothing really there to stop consumers from a very fast transition once safety concerns are gone There are plenty of skeptics but on gut feeling and no arguments. PS: how long before CaaS prices on a per mile basis are lower than subway tickets in the most developed nations? With a note here that taxes are hard to predictt and might be a killer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman 4 Companies Embracing, and Finding Value In, the Circular Economy SOURCE: USCCF Corporate Citizenship Center DESCRIPTION: The circular economy – an economic model focused on designing and manufacturing products, components and materials for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling – promises big opportunities for the private sector to drive new and better growth and accelerate innovation. Shifting to the circular economy could release $4.5 trillion in new economic potential by 2030, according to Accenture. But how do we take that vision of a circular economy – which imagines a world without waste – and translate that into profitable and scalable action? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Corporate Citizenship Center, a nonprofit organization driving the circular economy agenda in the US, is releasing a new report featuring case studies that illustrate how companies are translating their circular economy aspirations into action – and how that in turn drives greater resource productivity improvements, eliminates waste and inefficiency, and contributes to a stronger and more competitive economy. Let’s take a look at some of the companies featured in the report. Aramark: Reducing food waste Food services provider Aramark has set a goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 from its 2015 baseline, such as by setting standards for ordering, receiving, preparing, serving and tracking food production. Through its partnership with food waste reduction experts LeanPath, Aramark is accelerating its waste prevention and minimization efforts by integrating LeanPath’s tracking and analytics technology platform into its largest 500 accounts. Since 2016, Aramark has rolled out LeanPath’s platform across 161 sites, slashing its food waste on average by 44% and reducing the amount sent to landfill by 479 tonnes. In instances of overproduction, Aramark donates unserved food to local food relief agencies or for composting. EILEEN FISHER: The path to 100% circularity EILEEN FISHER’s take-back programme, in which employees and customers can bring back unwanted EILEEN FISHER clothing for $5 store credit per piece, started in 2009 under the name Green Eileen. Funds raised from the programme are donated to organizations that support women, girls, and the environment. In 2017 Fisher Found was launched as the next iteration of Green Eileen, a circular take-back programme that focuses on reselling, renewing (repairing slightly flawed pieces, for example), and remaking EILEEN FISHER garments. Since 2009, EILEEN FISHER has taken back over 800,000 garments and donated $2 million to its chosen causes. EILEEN FISHER currently takes back 3% of the products it creates each year, and is working towards a goal to take back 100% of its output. Intel: Finding value in waste material Computer chip manufacturer Intel has set a goal to recycle 90% of its non-hazardous waste and divert 100% of its hazardous waste from landfills by 2020. Since 2008, Intel has recycled 75% of the total waste generated from its operations, such as through upcycling, recycling, recovery, and reuse. For example, Intel developed an onsite electrowinning system to recover solid copper for reuse from an aqueous waste stream generated by semiconductor manufacturing. The recovered copper can enter the metals market supply chain for reuse in other industrial or commercial applications. The copper recovery process has been replicated at Intel’s microprocessor manufacturing sites and more than two-thirds of the waste was recovered in 2016. Additionally, over the past 10 years Intel has donated more than 1,000 pounds of copper to Arizona State University for use in the creation of works of art. Johnson Controls: Closing the automotive batteries loop Johnson Controls has designed its conventional automotive batteries so that 99% of the materials can be reused. Customers can return old batteries that are collected by Johnson Controls and turned into new batteries. The company’s circular supply chain has pushed recycling rates for conventional batteries to 99% in North America, Brazil, and Europe in 2015, enabling Johnson Controls to produce batteries containing more than 80% recycled material. In partnership with suppliers, customers, and logistics partners, Johnson Controls has enabled hundreds of millions of batteries to be properly recycled and recovered into new batteries. The benefits include a more resilient raw material supply, job creation and economic development for local communities and suppliers, and a 90% reduction in energy by using recycled plastics instead of virgin plastic. The case study report will be released at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Circular Economy and Sustainability Summit, From Aspiration to Implementation, on June 26-28 in Washington DC. In partnership with The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and with support from the World Economic Forum’s Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, this event will explore the ideas, innovations, technologies, and partnerships needed to leverage winning circular economy strategies that enable growth and well-being.

Intel's first NVMe controller—introduced with the SSD DC P3700—had a great run, but it's been showing its age for a while now. The new controller used on the P4500 and P4600 enables higher performance despite the new drives using 3D TLC NAND compared to the P3700's 20nm planar MLC, and despite the newer controller having only 12 flash channels instead of 18. More significantly, Intel's second-generation NVMe controller is much smaller and more power-efficient, allowing it to be used in product segments that Intel's first generation controller literally couldn't fit in. Intel's new SSD DC P4501 is a lower-power take on their new generation of NVMe technology, putting Intel controllers into M.2 and 2.5" 7mm U.2 SSDs for the first time. With capacities from 500GB to 4TB, the P4501 delivers somewhat lower performance than the P4500 and P4600, but with reduced power consumption and substantially higher density. Intel has previously shipped the SSD DC P3100 M.2 SSD, but despite using the same 3D TLC, it was not at all in the same league as the P4501. The P3100 is based on the same platform as the consumer Intel SSD 600p, with a Silicon Motion controller, poor sustained write speeds and no power loss protection. The P3100 was pitched as a boot drive for servers, but the P4501 can be a serious workhorse. The P4501 supports the same advanced feature set of its bigger siblings, including full power loss protection, NVMe Management Interface, and support for up to 128 queues for optimal performance even in systems with the highest CPU core counts. The P4501 even comes with a slightly higher endurance rating than the P4500. Intel NVMe Datacenter SSD Comparison   P4500 P4600 P4501 Form Factor PCIe HHHL or 2.5" 15mm U.2 M.2 22110 or 2.5" 7mm U.2 Interface PCIe 3.1 x4 NVMe 1.2 Memory Intel 384Gb 32-layer 3D TLC Capacities (TB) 1, 2, 4 TB 1.6, 2, 3.2 TB (U.2) 2, 4 TB (HHHL) 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB (U.2 only) Sequential Read (64kB) (up to) 3290 MB/s 3280 MB/s 3200 MB/s Sequential Write (64kB) (up to) 1890 MB/s 2100 MB/s 900 MB/s Random Read (4kB) (up to) 710k IOPS 702.5k IOPS 360k IOPS Random Write (4kB) (up to) 68k IOPS 257k IOPS 46k IOPS Maximum Power Read 10.9 W 9.9 W 8–12.5W (U.2) 6–8.25W (M.2) Write 18.3 W 20.7 W Write Endurance Random workload 0.7 DWPD 2.9 DWPD 1 DWPD Sequential workload 4.62 DWPD 4 DWPD 3 DWPD Warranty 5 years 5 years The M.2 version of the P4501 will provide capacities up to 2TB on a 110mm long card, larger than normal for consumer M.2 SSDs but typical for enterprise SSDs that include power loss protection capacitors. The 2.5" U.2 version uses the same 7mm thickness as consumer SSDs and many of the more value-oriented enterprise SSDs, compared to the 15mm thick form factor that Intel's previous enterprise SSDs have used for thermal dissipation reasons even when the extra volume was not necessary for higher storage capacity. The U.2 version of the P4501 will provide capacities up to 4TB. The P4501 will support tunable power limits: the U.2 version can be capped at 8W, 10W or 12.5W while the M.2 version will support limits of 6W or 8.25W. Idle power is not a priority for datacenter SSDs, but the U.2 version is specified for less than 5W at idle and the M.2 version is specified for less than 3W. Intel's first-generation NVMe controller came to the consumer market in the SSD 750, the first consumer NVMe SSD. It raised the bar for consumer SSD performance, but as soon as truly client-oriented solutions like the Samsung 950 Pro hit the market, the SSD 750's inconveniently large form factors, high power consumption and lower peak performance started to erode its cachet. The new Intel SSD DC P4501 shows that Intel is in a position to offer a new generation of high-end client NVMe SSDs that will be much better fit for today's market. With new firmware optimized for client workloads and possibly with cost savings from dropping the power loss protection or using Intel's upcoming 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, Intel could have a serious contender for the consumer market in the near future.

The power consumtion of these fast m-type ssd has been way above sata based siblins. How Many kidneys we need to sell to het these? Enterprice wording is always a warning sign, but Hopefully customer products Also get these upgrades Sooner or later. Reply SharpEars - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link You do realize that heat is an issue for SSDs? Reply edzieba - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link A massively, hilariously overblown issue. Unless you are running SSD benchmarks 24/7, no consumer workload will ever see and SSD controller start to throttle. It's a total nonissue for enterprise, where sinking <10W of heat from forced airflow alone is a "what, but we were already doing that anyway" non-problem. Reply FwFred - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link Despite the M.2 form factor, these are enterprise drive meant for server workloads. Reply vladx - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link Lol the P4501 is an enterprise drive which usually needs to run 24/7 in most cases. Reply Morawka - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link Actually M.2's used as cache drive overheat frequently, especially in Qnap NAS units. Reply woggs - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link Bingo. These aren't for your laptop. The top side can have heat management solutions in servers the bottom side can't. This is critical because the expectation is 24/7 full speed operation in the smallest possible form factor. Reply Bullwinkle J Moose - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link "Bingo. These aren't for your laptop." ------------------------------------------------- Do I need to build a thunderzolt to U.2 breakout box to prove you wrong? Are you referring to "MY" laptop specifically or the current crop of laptops in general? I actually prefer insane speeds in a removable (easily swappable) drive Reply woggs - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link I was talking about the thermal and capacity reasons the server market uses M.2 22110 the jamb a ton of these into a single server.

The big news on Capitol Hill this week is former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday. Comey hasn’t spoken publicly since he was abruptly fired by President Donald Trump on May 9. The former FBI chief is expected to be peppered with questions from both Democrats and Republicans about his conversations with Trump, including reports that the president pressured him to shut down a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. “We’ve known since Watergate rules of the road that the president shouldn’t intervene in an ongoing investigation. It would be unthinkable if the president actually did what was reported,” Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Intel Committee, said Sunday on CBS’ "Face the Nation.” That’s not all folks: Comey’s testimony may be the main attraction but he won’t be the only newsmaker on Capitol Hill this week. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers are all slated to testify before the Intel panel Wednesday. The hearing will be Rosenstein’s first public testimony since he appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to take over the FBI’s Russia probe. Kyle and Austin preview the week: http://politi.co/2rskgzo Playbook tidbit: Press gallery staff are scheduled to meet with aides on the Intel panel today to discuss the specifics of how many reporters will be allowed in the hearing room Thursday, Anna, Jake and Daniel report this morning. Usually about 120 reporters, not including photographers, are allowed to sit in the press section. I HEAR THE TRAIN A COMIN’… With Republicans in total control of Washington since January and little to show for it, concerns are mounting that Congress is heading for disaster come September, with a debt default and government shutdown both looming possibilities. Democratic leaders are already signaling they won’t back down from a debt limit fight. And while GOP leaders insist their big plans (repealing Obamacare, overhauling the tax code) are still on track, the chamber has done little lately other than process delayed nominations, Burgess and Seung Min report. ‘Give me a break’: “There have been zero amendment votes on regular legislation, with only a non-binding budget vote-a-rama in January. …It’s the fewest such votes in a new Congress since 1981," Burgess and SMK report. “I’m very frustrated,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “We’re going to do all these things by Sept. 30? Give me a break. We’re going to cut taxes, pass health care, set aside sequestration?” Much more on what’s to come this summer, described as a “train wreck” by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.): http://politi.co/2qX9Ns5 Reality check, via the AP’s Erica Werner: “Seven legislative weeks are left before Congress scatters for a five-week August recess, a period when lawmakers are likely to lose momentum if they have failed to act on health care or taxes, and face GOP voters frustrated that they haven’t delivered.” More: http://apne.ws/2rspj2J AND WE’RE BACK! Welcome to Monday, June 5 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. Your Huddle host is happy to be back at the helm after a little time away getting married and hanging out with the wild roosters in Key West. REPUBLICANS TAMP DOWN REPEAL EXPECTATIONS — Senate Republicans are growing increasingly pessimistic that an Obamacare repeal will happen this year, publicly airing their concerns over the Memorial Day recess. “I don’t see a comprehensive health care plan this year,” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told a local news station late last week. And Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said over the weekend “tax reform is an easier lift,” reiterating his idea to shift to a two-prong plan to dismantle Obamacare. On the flip side, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said he thinks the Senate will vote to repeal Obamacare “by the end of July at the latest.” Elana and Madeline Conway with more: http://politi.co/2qXeNwK Dems weigh in: “Make no mistake, Senate Republican leaders are working as hard as they can to get to 50 votes and jam their version of Trumpcare through the Senate—and the minute they do, this bill is going to move fast,” Senate HELP Committee ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) told Huddle. “That’s why we’re going to keep the pressure on.” Risky premium pledge: Even if Senate Republicans can agree to an Obamacare repeal plan, they are in danger of overpromising and underdelivering on their pledge to reduce insurance premiums. Jen Haberkorn explains: http://politi.co/2rscLZg. And Jen teamed up with Burgess to profile Bill Cassidy, the gastroenterologist turned Republican senator who is determined to bridge his party’s Obamacare repeal divide. From Covington, La.: http://politi.co/2rshmdP ** A message from Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America: It is imperative that state laws concerning sales and delivery of wine, beer and spirits be respected. WSWA is opposed to permitting direct shipment of beverage alcohol via the U.S. Postal Service. ** DISPATCH FROM THE BEST COAST — GOP Rep. Darrell Issa won reelection by less than 2,000 votes in November, struggling to hold onto his seat in a southern California district that’s turning more blue with every election. Rachael went to San Juan Capistrano to see how he’s doing back home: “Anger from the left — and more than a little from his own party — has dogged Issa here in a Republican-leaning part of his increasingly Democratic district. Every seat in a nearly 500-person auditorium at the San Juan Hills High School was filled, and hundreds of constituents protested outside, irate that they couldn’t get in.” Much more: http://politi.co/2rswPdV SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO BE A WRITER — Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) pocketed a $332,750 advance for his latest book, “Giant of the Senate,” according to personal financial disclosure records filed in May. HuffPost reported in 2015 that Franken’s memoir would garner him at least $1 million. His office didn’t comment Friday on whether the total listed in Franken’s financial disclosures is the full amount or part of a larger advance. Seung Min with the deets: http://politi.co/2rsiX3q THINGS ARE LOOKING UP FOR TESTER — Montana Attorney General Tim Fox has decided against challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018, becoming the second high-profile Republican to pass on jumping in the race in recent months. “Fox is also known to be interested in running for governor, and Montana Republicans said that became more likely after Rep.-elect Greg Gianforte was charged with assaulting a reporter shortly before his election victory last month. Gianforte, a wealthy tech executive, had been the Montana GOP's gubernatorial candidate in 2016. ‘This all changed post-bodyslam,’ said a D.C. Republican.” Kevin Robillard and Elena Schneider report: http://politi.co/2rspb3r NOT SO FAST — As President Donald Trump renewed his travel ban push over the weekend (and this morning), lawmakers on both sides of the aisle came out against the idea on Sunday. Several lawmakers making the Sunday show rounds said the ban “is no longer necessary since the administration has had the time it claimed it needed to develop beefed-up vetting procedures,” Paige Winfield Cunningham reports for the Washington Post. “It’s been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News. “I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.” More: http://wapo.st/2rsfodj GOV WATCH: WHO’S IN, WHO’S OUT — Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) is quietly exploring a bid for Florida governor, Marc Caputo reports this morning. “DeSantis today is in Tallahassee to meet with potential donors and supporters as he weighs a bid for governor or, possibly, attorney general.

Thanks to a big part to a household name in the world of tech, who's been pushing for tech applications in India’s biggest pastime.  Intel has been chosen as the Innovation Partner for the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy by the International Cricket Council, and the effects are showing in how the matches are being broadcast. Here are the three coolest things you can see in action at the Champions Trophy right now. Drones Intel’s new Falcon 8 drone is flying the field in the UK, bringing us the best in pitch analysis ever. Equipped with high-definition and infrared cameras, these little helpers capture images to give us data on the grass cover and health, topology , and can even generate daily pitch reports to help commentators during a broadcast, so they don’t need to resort to poking something into the soil. Bat sensors Anuj Dua, director of marketing for Intel’s New Technology Group, introduced a new bat sensor during a recent presentation, currently being implemented for the trophy. The bats in play have embedded Speculr BatSense sensors in the handle, using Intel’s Curie technology, which capture data with every stroke the batsman makes. The sensors are capable of measuring parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through, and can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen are using these bat sensors in the current games enabling new insights and analysis during broadcasts. “Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman’s technique ultimately helping him perform better,” said Speculur Managing Director, Atul Srivastava. In addition, the technology will also be available to consumers later this year, so hundreds of thousands of aspiring young cricketers can make use of it to improve their skills in preparation for the big leagues. Speculur plans to make BatSense with Intel Inside available in Australia, India, the United States and the UK in the second half of 2017. Virtual Reality Aside from technology applications to help the players and broadcasters, Intel has also provided a way for fans to be more engaged, using special VR zones at The Oval and Edgbaston stadiums. A wearable VR headset allows fans to face off against a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment and test their batting skills. As they play, fans will also be able to see real-time data from their swing, as well as a score from their session.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Intel Corporation's Cascade Lake Is So Important It's about the memory opportunity. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 5, 2017 at 7:45AM On May 16, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) put out a press release titled "Intel Shows 1.59X Performance Improvement in Upcoming Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family." In the press release, Intel talked up the performance benefits of its upcoming data center chips relative to its prior-generation chips. The most interesting bit of this press release, though, was the company's disclosures around its upcoming 3D XPoint-based memory modules for data center applications. Image source: Intel. Investors may recall that at Intel's analyst day back in February, the company said that it believes that the total addressable market for such 3D XPoint-based memory modules could be worth approximately $8 billion by 2021. Those memory modules were supposed to ship this year alongside the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family mentioned above, but the technology was delayed. In that same press release, Intel says that a refreshed version of its Xeon Processor Scalable family, known as Cascade Lake, will support this technology. Of course, the fact that Intel intends to refresh its server platform in 2018 is encouraging. But the real story here is that we now know approximately when Intel still start enjoying revenue from 3D XPoint-based memory modules -- something that could help the company reaccelerate growth in its data center group (DCG). Two ways it can help reaccelerate DCG growth Intel previously aspired to a 15% compounded annual revenue growth rate for DCG, but it has had a rough time achieving that goal in recent years. The company has indicated that growth in some of the markets that DCG serves, like cloud computing and networking, continues to be robust, but sales of platforms into traditional enterprise servers have slumped. With the introduction of Cascade Lake and the 3D XPoint memory modules, there are two obvious ways that Intel's DCG could benefit. The first is that Intel will go from generating no revenue from sales of memory modules into the server market, to generating some positive amount of revenue once it starts shipping those 3D XPoint modules. At this point, the amount of revenue Intel will be able to rake in from these memory modules is unclear, as Intel hasn't guided such a figure, and any estimate on my part wouldn't be particularly valuable. However, Intel did indicate at its most recent analyst day that it expects DCG revenue to return to double-digit growth in 2018 and beyond. That acceleration, Intel indicated, will be driven in part by an expectation of a 30% compounded annual revenue growth rate in its non-processor products from 2017 through 2021. I suspect that a large part of Intel's expected non-processor revenue growth will come from the 3D XPoint memory module opportunity. There's another thing that could help accelerate Intel's DCG revenue growth. If Intel's 3D XPoint memory modules are as big a deal as Intel claims they will be -- and only the new Cascade Lake platform (and beyond) will support those modules -- Intel could see an uptick in processor/platform upgrade activity among some customers for 3D XPoint.

Coffee Lake will be the successor to Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors and is expected to use the LGA 1151 socket – the socket used by Intel’s 6th-gen and 7th-gen chips. Intel has not revealed detailed specifications of its upcoming processors, but has shown off performance figures and surface details about the new platform. Architecture Intel’s 8th-gen desktop processors will be based on its Coffee Lake architecture, which is manufactured on the 14nm process node. This is the same manufacturing process used for the chipmaker’s Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, which confirms that Intel has dropped its “tick-tock” architecture design model as it approaches smaller process nodes. As Kaby Lake was a refinement of Intel’s Skylake architecture, Coffee Lake will be a further refinement of Kaby Lake chips – offering improved power efficiency and performance. The integrated graphics on Intel’s 8th-gen processors will include support for HDMI 2.2 and DP 1.2 connectivity. 8th-gen processors will also use a new 300 Series Chipset manufactured by Intel. According to KitGuru, the 300 Series chipset will add support for integrated USB 3.1 ports and Intel Wireless A-C Gigabit Wi-Fi. A variety of motherboard models will be available for Intel’s Coffee Lake processors, while previous-generation motherboards – such as the Z170 and B250 – are expected to support Coffee Lake CPUs via a BIOS update. With Intel’s 200 Series chipsets featuring support for the company’s Optane storage technology, the 300 Series is also expected to support Optane drives. Performance Intels 8th-gen processors will be available in Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 models, in addition to lower-end and mobile products. The chips will support dual-channel DDR4 memory and boast a marginal performance improvement over Kaby Lake. Intel said its Coffee Lake processors would boast up to a 30% increase in performance over Kaby Lake in certain benchmarks. While Intel’s 8th-gen chips are set to remain on the 14nm process node, the company plans to launch its 10nm Cannonlake processors following the roll-out of Coffee Lake chips. These chips will coexist until 10nm becomes adopted for use in mainstream desktop processors. Leaked SiSoftware data shows the 8th-gen Core i5 and Core i7 processors will both feature six physical cores, although only the Core i7 model will include hyper-threading. The data also pointed to increased clock speeds across the board, along with a 50% increase in L3 cache.

After this disclosure, Imagination's shares lost over half of their value -- an appropriate reaction, considering that Imagination relies on Apple for roughly half of its net revenue. The iPhone fueled Imagination's rise, and now it could bring about its downfall. Image source: Apple.  Following this disaster, Imagination announced to investors that it plans to sell its MIPS and Ensigma businesses in a bid to "concentrate its resources on PowerVR and strengthen Imagination's balance sheet." Once Imagination unloads these businesses, it'll still have to face the grim reality that its anchor customer for its only remaining business is gone and probably isn't ever coming back. Imagination will also have to face the bitter truth that only a relatively small portion of the smartphone applications processor total addressable market is open -- and that competition is still quite fierce. I suspect, then, that once the company has rid itself of MIPS and Ensigma, it could be attractive to potential customers who might want to use Imagination Technologies' intellectual property and whatever talent hasn't jumped ship by then. Here are two potential suitors that come to mind. The chip giant Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) could potentially make use of Imagination's technology. Intel has its own in-house graphics efforts, and its graphics technology is found in many, if not most, personal computers that are sold today. However, Intel's graphics technology, though it has gotten better with time, still isn't great. When Intel tried its hand in the smartphone and tablet applications processor markets, it only used its own graphics technology in higher-power tablet chips. Even in tablets, Intel's graphics performance was mediocre at best. Indeed, Intel's internal graphics technology was so woefully inadequate that it used Imagination's graphics technology in almost all the smartphone processors that it brought to market -- with ARM Holdings' Mali graphics intellectual property being used in the ill-fated SoFIA chips. I don't think Intel would buy Imagination with the intention of swapping out its own graphics technology for Imagination's, but I wouldn't be too surprised to see Intel pick up Imagination for its patents, technology, and talent to bolster its own efforts. In other words, it would be like Intel's acquisition of processor maker Soft Machines. Fellow IP vendor Another potential buyer could be fellow semiconductor intellectual property vendor CEVA (NASDAQ:CEVA). On CEVA's homepage, the company says that it develops "ultra-low power [intellectual property] for vision, deep learning, audio, communication, and connectivity." It's not a stretch, then, to see CEVA buy Imagination Technologies to add graphics to its portfolio. Graphics processors could complement CEVA's imaging and computer vision offerings, as well as its deep learning offerings, especially since graphics processor technology is proving to be quite popular in deep learning/artificial intelligence. What's even more interesting is that CEVA once tried to buy MIPS Technology, but it was outbid by Imagination Technologies. Perhaps CEVA might be interested in the entirety of Imagination Technologies -- or at least the PowerVR graphics and MIPS processor businesses. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

It is perhaps the most anticipated phone since the original iPhone in 2007. Consequently, leaks about this extensive redesign have been unparalleled, but now they have reached a new high. Much of the tech news for months now have been covering rumours of the said phone ranging from assembly issues to component specifications. There were new reports from last week that might shed some light on Apple’s upcoming flagship phone. There reports pertain to issues like the phone’s wireless modem, its size, and the vertical dual camera on its back. Intel wireless modems Apple has been known to use Qualcomm-made wireless modems on the iPhone. In fact, back in 2016, 70 percent of the iPhones sold used a chip that was manufactured by Qualcomm. However, it seems like this year Apple will be favoring Intel-made wireless modems more and more. According to a report, Apple has increased the order volume for Intel wireless modems to 50 percent. This is a considerable increase since last year, only 30 percent of the iPhones sold contain wireless chips from Intel. Also Read: Much awaited iPhone 8 will feature wireless charging iPhone 8 size On a slightly more interesting topic, last week, the guys at iDrop News were kind enough to share what they think the iPhone 8 would look like when released. Furthermore, the website also shared additional images of the iPhone 8 renders showing how big it will be compared to other Smartphones. In one of the images, it can be seen that the new phone is only slightly taller than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Vertical dual camera Apart from the mockup units shared by Geskin, Slashleaks also leaked the CAD drawing that has been the basis of the renders done by iDrop News. It can be seen that dual camera setup for the iPhone 8 is in vertical position. This new leak strengthens the earlier rumors about the said camera setup. Furthermore, one can see from the image that the cameras are separated by the LED flash. Another interesting bit about this leak is the circular outline near the rear cameras. Experts also speculated that this might be the Touch ID sensor for the iPhone 8.

Taking into its fold cutting-edge innovations like autonomous cars, smart cities and machine-to-machine communications, it will make the world more interconnected. It’s going to be so transformational that every technology company is gearing up to ensure they are fully equipped for the data-rich, ‘new world order’. One of the companies that is leading research on this front is Intel. It recently announced the Xeon Processor Scalable family, which the company said represented the biggest platform advancement in this decade. The new product has the design flexibility to take on common applications and mission-critical operations, and also to harness actionable insights from areas like advanced real-time analytics and Artificial Intelligence. In January, Intel unveiled a 5G modem, with the aim of augmenting computing power and access to cloud resources. The device, with speed exceeding 5Gbps, hundreds of MHz of aggregated bandwidth and ultra-low latency, would lead to significant improvement in the efficiency of self-driving cars, drones, smart-city facilities etc. Venkata Murthy Renduchintala, President, Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group, Intel Corporation, who was in Bengaluru recently, spoke to The Hindu on how 5G would pan out, its challenges and opportunities. Edited excerpts: In the context of the huge data explosion, how can we get to the most relevant data quickly? That will happen in two ways. With large amounts of data, you aren’t going to transport that across your network to data centres for aggregation. You need to have data aggregation at the edge of the network. And that will be a fundamental transformation as we move towards 5G. You’d see functions that exist in data centres distributed into the very fabric of the networks. So it’s compute and storage within the fabric of the network to deal with data explosion at the edge of the network, instead of overburdening the network infrastructure. The other will be Deep Learning, where you have greater context and search precision around the information you are looking for. Essentially, the context of search will be rapidly residualised into data-retrieval criteria, which will quicken the access to the information that you need. How different will the transition to 5G be? The move from 4G to 5G will be as profound as the move from analogue to digital. It will be more than merely supporting mobile devices. It will support vehicles, drones, robots, aeroplanes, connected factories and connected cities. 5G is going to be as much about the transformation of the network and the services offered over the network, as it is going to be about the mobile environment. So the infrastructure is going to be tremendously evolved to support the explosive changes in the user environment. What would the challenges be? Most of us are familiar with megabytes per day of usage and gigabytes per month. But an autonomous vehicle, for instance, will generate through its sensors and navigational capabilities gigabytes per hour, and terabytes per day and perhaps petabytes per month. You can’t transport that amount of data, from say 150,000 cars, simultaneously. Your network infrastructure will grind to a halt. How will the network of the future be? With 5G, you will move from the network being a dimension for Internet telephony and mobile broadband, to the interconnectedness of everything. Smartphone and PC traffic, thought of as the burden of the network, will represent a small proportion of the network bandwidth and traffic. So what Intel is doing is really reinventing the fabric of network architecture to be able to embed the compute and storage capabilities in the network elements themselves. The network of the future will have more capability to adapt and evolve as the load and nature of the traffic changes. So concepts such as network function virtualisation and software-defined network would become very important. 5G will offer capabilities like network slicing. An operator can basically say my network is no longer a monolith. A part of the network capacity can be sliced and offered to a customer over here and create a virtual private network for that person. We hear a lot about the way Artificial Intelligence will change our world. How much is hype and how much is reality? There is a difference between setting a vision and practical implementation of that vision. I am sure when Orville and Wilbur Wright were going to emulate a bird and fly in the sky, a lot of people probably thought it is just as aspirational as having an automated car. Maybe having cars driving around without drivers is utopian. But in an urban situation, if you move into autonomous control of the car, and you plug in a route, your route could be centrally planned. Traffic is distributed more optimally around various roads, so that everybody has a predictable way of getting to a certain location, as opposed to everybody thinking they know the fastest route and everyone taking that route. Just as flight safety has been helped by the autopilot technology, it could be applicable to a vehicle as well. We have in many countries fairly advanced forms of automated driving, like for example, lane deviation, and we are very close to a point where you can go into a semi-automated driving mode. It is more of a legislative environment rather than the technology setting the timeline. In the context of rapid digitisation in the country, are you partnering with projects? The Indian government has made some very bold visions of the future through its Digital India initiatives, and a lot of the visions of the Prime Minister and the government in that regard are aligned closely with Intel’s view of the world. There are a lot of opportunities for us, and one of the things we are trying to figure out is what is the right constellation of partnerships and key activities. Anything specific you are looking at? When the time is appropriate, we will be able to say more. But certainly for us, India represents a tremendous opportunity, because our general strategic thinking is very much aligned with the whole Digital India programme, and there are a number of key players within India that have aligned thinking with Intel’s.

It is so popular, that there have been a lack of reports for Apple’s other iPhone models, the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Much of the tech news for months now have been coverings rumors of the said phone ranging from assembly issues to component specifications. That said, there were new reports from last week that might shed some light on Apple’s upcoming flagship phone. There reports pertain to issues like the phone’s wireless modem, its size, and the vertical dual camera on its back. More Intel wireless modems on the iPhone 8 Apple has been known to use Qualcomm-made wireless modems on the iPhone. In fact, back in 2016, 70 percent of the iPhones sold used a chip that was manufactured by Qualcomm. However, it seems like this year and the years to come, Apple will be favoring Intel-made wireless modems more and more. According to a report from Digitimes last week, Apple has increased the order volume for Intel wireless modems to 50 percent. This is a considerable increase since last year, only 30 percent of the iPhones sold contain wireless chips from Intel. Alleged iPhone 8 mockups (by Benjamin Geskin) The fallout between Apple and Qualcomm is said to be due to the ongoing legal battle between the two companies. To those unaware, Apple withheld around $1 billion of royalty to Qualcomm on the count of “unfair monopoly” on its mobile wireless technology. Qualcomm then retaliated by asking the US Trade Commission to ban the import of iPhone devices to the United States. To make matters worse, some of Apple’s suppliers have also follow suit in not paying the chip maker of its royalties. iPhone 8 size On a slightly more interesting topic, last week, the guys at iDrop News were kind enough to share what they think the iPhone 8 would look like when released. Furthermore, the website also shared additional images of the iPhone 8 renders showing how big it will be compared to other smartphones. In one of the images, it can be seen that the new phone is only slightly taller than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Meanwhile, compared to the Samsung Galaxy S8, the iPhone 8 is a bit wider as well as shorter. iPhone 8 size comparison with Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ (via idropnews.com) On other notes, these renders are based on the leaks that were shared online a few weeks ago.

Various companies including Apple, Google, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft are among the hundreds of businesses that declared their intention to continue working toward reducing carbon emissions. The firms who were noticeably absent were Oracle, IBM, and all the major telecommunications providers. “In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the US economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the US remains a global leader in reducing emissions,” the coalition, which now consists of more than 1,000 entities, said in a statement yesterday. The US joined the Paris agreement in 2015. Nearly 200 countries are part of the accord and have agreed to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Scientists anticipate climate change could push the Earth to dangerous temperatures much sooner with US retreat from the pledge because the country burns so much energy. The coalition, calling itself “We are still in,” includes leaders from nine states, 125 cities, 902 businesses and investors, and 183 colleges and universities. The effort is led by philanthropist and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. “In the absence of a supportive federal coordinating role, these actors will more closely coordinate their own recarbonisation actions,” Bloomberg wrote in a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General. “Collectively, they will redouble their efforts to ensure that the US achieves the carbon emissions reductions it pledged under the Paris Agreement.” Trump’s withdrawal from the pact drew swift condemnation from several tech giants last week, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, who said he spoke with Trump earlier in the week in an effort to persuade him not to withdraw from the pact. In addition to Cook, the CEOs of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, HP, Intel and Tesla also asked Trump to stay in the agreement. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, made good on his threat to leave several of the president’s advisory councils if the president pulled the US out of the climate deal. Cities and states across the US, governors and over 200 mayors have vowed to keep fighting climate change and adopt clean energy technologies, despite President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the country from the Paris Climate Agreement. “We Are Still In” represents the most serious attempt yet by local officials, business executives, and private-sector leaders to buck the Trump administration’s decision, which sent political shockwaves around the world. Participants vowed to meet the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial levels by 2100. They also pledged to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. “In the US, it is local and state governments, along with businesses, that are primarily responsible for the dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years,” the group wrote in an open letter to the international community. “Actions by each group will multiply and accelerate in the years ahead, no matter what policies Washington may adopt,” they wrote. The new coalition includes dozens of university and college leaders, including the chancellors of six University of California campuses, the president of New York University, plus schools from many states in between the coasts. Nineteen attorneys general joined the group, including New York AG Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts AG Maura Healy, both of whom are investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly deceiving investors on the company’s climate risks The coalition intends to submit a “Societal Nationally Determined Contribution” to the UN, which will be called “America’s Pledge” and account for the climate-fighting efforts of US cities, states, businesses, and other subnational actors. It would be rare, if not unprecedented, for a coalition like this to formally join a UN treaty meant for nations to sign.

The new beefed-up iMac is intended to address the concerns of professional creatives, who until now have been limited to either the consumer 27in 5K iMac or the older Mac Pro, which hasn’t been updated since 2013. The new iMac Pro starts with an 8-core Intel Xeon processor, but can be configured with an 18-core processor variant, as well as up to 128GB of EEC RAM, 4TB of SSD storage and Radeon Vega discrete graphics cards with up to 16GB of memory.The 27in machine has the 5K display from the existing 5K iMac, but has four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and is capable of pushing up to 44m pixels across three screens. Apple will hope that the iMac Pro will address the concerns of video editors looking to work with 4K or 8K video that need workstation-level power – a market that the company has failed to serve for the last couple of years forcing once Apple-only outfits to switch to alternative operating systems and machines. The iMac Pro will start at $4,999 in the US and will be available in December. Apple also updated the standard iMac line with new 7th generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, up to 64GB of RAM and Apple’s Fusion drives as standard. The 21.5in iMac will come in a standard and 4K screen variant, with Iris Plus 620 graphics and a choice of Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs. The 27in 5K variant will come with Radeon Pro 570, 575 or 580 graphics cards, and were demoed producing live VR content - a new area of exploration for Apple, which has joined with Valve to bring its Steam VR platform for the Mac as well as Unity and Unreal engines.The 21.5in and the 5k iMac hadn’t been updated since late 2015 with the Skylake, 6th generation Intel processors – the same as those used in the MacBook Pro when it launched in 2016. Advertisement Finally, Apple also updated its MacBook and MacBook Pro line with 7th generation Intel processors, and gave the MacBook Air a specification bump in response to its sustained popularity. When the redesigned MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was launched in October 2016, one of the criticisms of the design was that it used older 6th generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors rather than the latest 7th generation versions, which were more powerful and more thermally efficient. By updating to the 7th generation “Kaby Lake” Core i5 and i7 processors, Apple has brought the MacBook Pro line up to pair with rivals from Dell, Razer and HP. But Apple will also hope that the more efficient, newer processors will help it live up to its promises of a 10-hour battery life, of which the 13in MacBook Pro fell well short. iMac Pro: Apple launches powerful new desktop Apple hopes its pro-level all-in-one computer helps maintain its hold on the creative industry and also updates MacBook, MacBook Pro and iMac lines Independent Online/The Guardian Apple has announced a brand new computer in the form of a $4,999 iMac Pro at its developer conference in San Jose, making the companys all-in-one computer the most powerful Mac available.

REUTERS US tech giants, government leaders, investors, universities, and companies have agreed to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions and honour the Paris Agreement on climate change, days after President Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the landmark deal. Various companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Intel and Microsoft are among the hundreds of businesses that declared their intention to continue working toward reducing carbon emissions. The firms who were noticeably absent were Oracle, IBM, and all the major telecommunications providers. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the US economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the US remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the coalition, which now consists of more than 1,000 entities, said in a statement yesterday. The US joined the Paris agreement in 2015. Nearly 200 countries are part of the accord and have agreed to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Scientists anticipate climate change could push the Earth to dangerous temperatures much sooner with US retreat from the pledge because the country burns so much energy. The coalition, calling itself "We are still in," includes leaders from nine states, 125 cities, 902 businesses and investors, and 183 colleges and universities. The effort is led by philanthropist and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. "In the absence of a supportive federal coordinating role, these actors will more closely coordinate their own recarbonisation actions," Bloomberg wrote in a letter to the United Nations secretary-general. "Collectively, they will redouble their efforts to ensure that the US achieves the carbon emissions reductions it pledged under the Paris Agreement." Trump's withdrawal from the pact drew swift condemnation from several tech giants last week, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, who said he spoke with Trump earlier in the week in an effort to persuade him not to withdraw from the pact. In addition to Cook, the CEOs of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, HP, Intel and Tesla also asked Trump to stay in the agreement. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, made good on his threat to leave several of the president's advisory councils if the president pulled the US out of the climate deal. Cities and states across the US, governors and over 200 mayors have vowed to keep fighting climate change and adopt clean energy technologies, despite President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the country from the Paris Climate Agreement. "We Are Still In" represents the most serious attempt yet by local officials, business executives, and private-sector leaders to buck the Trump administration's decision, which sent political shockwaves around the world. Participants vowed to meet the Paris agreement's target of limiting global warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels by 2100. They also pledged to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. "In the US, it is local and state governments, along with businesses, that are primarily responsible for the dramatic decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in recent years," the group wrote in an open letter to the international community. "Actions by each group will multiply and accelerate in the years ahead, no matter what policies Washington may adopt," they wrote. The new coalition includes dozens of university and college leaders, including the chancellors of six University of California campuses, the president of New York University, plus schools from many states in between the coasts. Nineteen attorneys general joined the group, including New York AG Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts AG Maura Healy, both of whom are investigating Exxon Mobil for allegedly deceiving investors on the company's climate risks. The coalition intends to submit a "Societal Nationally Determined Contribution" to the UN, which will be called "America's Pledge" and account for the climate-fighting efforts of US cities, states, businesses, and other subnational actors. It would be rare, if not unprecedented, for a coalition like this to formally join a UN treaty meant for nations to sign.

There was a lot discussed on stage, far more than just six items, but they boil down to a few key topics. Here's what you might have missed if you didn't tune in. 1. watchOS 4 Apple unveiled watchOS 4 on Monday, the newest version of the operating system for the Apple Watch. It features a couple of new watch faces, the most important of which puts Siri cards front and center. They can tell you things like when to leave for work, the music you're playing, how your workout is going and more. WatchOS 4 has a new workout UI, support for two-way data exchange with workout machines and more. 2. macOS High Sierra macOS High Sierra is the successor to Sierra, announced last year. It supports virtual reality headsets, something Apple hasn't ever offered before, security improvements to Safari that help further protect your privacy, new photo search features and a new Apple File System by default, which should mean more secure storage. High Sierra will be available in the coming months. 3. New iMacs and MacBook Air / MacBook Pro refreshes Apple finally refreshed the iMac after more than 600 days without doing so, adding a sharper and brighter display and new Intel processors. It also brought those seventh-generation Intel processors over to the MacBook Pro, which is otherwise unchanged, and boosted the speed of the chip in the MacBook Air. The biggest announcement was the iMac Pro, however, which will start at $4,999 and includes beefy new processors, a 5K display and a sharp design. Apple said it's "the most powerful Mac we have ever made." 4. iOS 11 Apple's iOS 11 will launch in September and includes new features for the iPhone and iPad. The big takeaway here is improvements to Siri, which Apple says will make it easier to synchronize your various iOS devices, like iPhones and iPads. It also said it'll keep messages in the cloud, helping to save valuable hard drive storage space. Another big change is peer-to-peer payments, which will allow Apple to compete with Paypal, Square Cash, Venmo and others by allowing iOS users to easily send money to one another. On the iPad, users will find drag and drop, more room for icons in the bottom dock of the screen and more. Oh, and we'll bundle this here since it was huge: Apple unveiled ARKit, which will allow developers to easily create augmented reality apps for iOS devices. 5. iPad Pro 10.5 Apple showed a new iPad Pro 10.5 during the event. It features a brighter display with a faster refresh rate, which is important which watching things like movies or playing games. It also sports a new A10X processor that should improve gaming and overall app performance. That chip and the new screen were also added to Apple's iPad Pro 12.9. Apple did not refresh the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. 6. Apple HomePod speaker The only brand new product announced was the HomePod speaker. It's a Siri-powered smart speaker that allows you to play music, check the traffic, control you smart lights, query sports scores and more. Sound familiar? That's because it's very much like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple says its product is better, though, thanks to advanced speakers that will fill your room with music. It'll cost $349 when it launches in December.

Chipzilla could soon start feeling the heat from AMD's new products. Harsh Chauhan (TechJunk13) Jun 5, 2017 at 9:47PM Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have been clobbered since the company dropped its first-quarter earnings report on May 1. Wall Street took issue with AMD's muted gross margin forecast, and analysts seem to be concerned with the company's ability to compete against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the server and the central processing unit (CPU) market. But AMD isn't going to lay low after its latest setback. The semiconductor specialist has clearly spelled out its intention of going after Intel's stronghold at its 2017 analyst day, targeting premium PCs and X86 server processors with new products. AMD wants to take a bite out of server processors Back in March, AMD had announced that it is working on a new two-socket server processor architecture known as Naples, touting its superior specs as compared to Intel's flagship server offering. AMD has now provided more details regarding this new chip, which has been rebranded as Epyc. Currently, Intel has a near-monopoly in x86 server chips, as it commands over 90% of this market. So, AMD had to bring a cutting-edge product to make its presence felt in this space, and it looks like Epyc is just what it needed. Image source: AMD.  AMD claims that its Epyc server chip will break the constraints of Intel's Moore's Law by improving product yields and reducing manufacturing costs, while its scalable nature will help deliver a substantial boost in performance as compared to its rival. In fact, AMD has packed the Epyc chip with 45% more cores than Intel's competing chip, 60% more input/output capacity, and 122% more bandwidth memory. Image source: AMD.  AMD's internal tests establish Epyc's dominance over a typical Intel server chip, thanks to its superior configuration as it packs more power in a smaller form factor. In fact, AMD claims that the single-socket performance of Epyc is 50% more powerful than Intel's two-socket chips, while also providing the benefit of lower power consumption, which should lead to lower operating expenses. More specifically, AMD believes that Epyc's performance advantage could help it reduce the total cost of ownership of data center servers by up to 30%. This could help the company disrupt the market for two-socket server chips, which accounts for 80% of the overall x86 server market. Investors should probably take AMD's performance comparisons against Intel's server chips with a grain of salt, as these tests aren't independent. But if AMD indeed manages to deliver real-world performance gains against Intel, and prices Epyc right, it can make a dent in the global data-center server market that's expected to grow at almost 5% a year until 2021. AMD is also targeting high-end PCs AMD has started to aggressively target a $39 billion opportunity in client computing and discrete graphics processing units by going against Intel in the high-end PC CPU market with its latest offerings. AMD's computing revenue growth is already outpacing the overall market. It won't be a big surprise if the trend continues, as AMD is trying to reenter the premium end of the market, which should lead to higher average selling prices and better margins. AMD has already increased its total addressable market by $9 billion thanks to the launch of the Ryzen 7 and Ryzen 5 series of central processing units (CPUs) in the first half of 2017, which are aimed at premium desktop customers. As it turns out, the current Ryzen lineup is already in strong demand by PC builders, with more Ryzen-based desktops on the way this quarter. The good news for AMD investors is that the new CPU lineup is winning back market share. In fact, during the first quarter, the Ryzen CPUs led to a 2% increase in AMD's CPU market share. The company finally made a dent in Intel's stronghold for the first time in a decade. AMD will continue to launch more Ryzen CPUs aimed at the commercial market for workstations and laptops, along with consumer laptops, through the first half of the next year to boost its total addressable market by another $10 billion. It won't be surprising if it continues to take more market share away from Intel once its full range of Ryzen CPUs hit the market. The Foolish bottom line AMD stock had a tough time after the company's latest results, but investors shouldn't worry, as its new CPUs have started gaining traction, allowing it to break into Intel's market. The launch of the Epyc server chips will give AMD's top line another boost as it takes on Intel, setting the stage for stronger long-term growth.

GettyEric Thayer By Eric Limer Jun 6, 2017 Apple kicks off WWDC conference with Monday keynote. HomePod is Apple's new $350 smart speaker. MacOS High Sierra coming free this fall with under-the-hood tweaks for faster performance. An iMac Pro is coming in December for $5,000. IOS 11 gives Siri a voice update and translation powers, and comes with a redesigned App Store. There's a new iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch screen. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Apple just finished the keynote for its Worldwide Developer's Conference (WWDC). The presentation covered all the WWDC mainstays — a new version of macOS and a new version of iOS, both arriving in the fall — as well as a handful of hardware odds and ends, and the long-rumored Siri-powered speaker. HomePod The biggest announcement of WWDC this year is Apple's long-rumored smart speaker, officially dubbed the "HomePod": At just under 7 inches high and powered by Apple's A8 chip that you will also find in iPhones, HomePod is a speaker that uses sensing technology in an attempt to offer fuller, spacious sound. Multiple HomePods can also be networked together for especially large rooms. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As expected, the HomePod can react to voice commands with the help of Siri, much like competing smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Although while the Echo and the Home bill themselves as voice assistants first and speakers second, it looks like Apple is positioning HomePod as a speaker first, with assistant features as an added bonus. Through voice commands, the HomePod looks to be able to handle general question answering, calendar adjustment, and timer setting just like a Google Home or regular old Siri can. The details of how far it can go are still fuzzy for the time being. The HomePad can also interact with smart appliances that work with HomeKit. Example commands include: The HomePod comes in white and gray, and starts shipping this December for $350. By comparison, you can buy a Google Home for $110 or an Amazon Echo for $180. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below macOS The newest version of macOS, dubbed High Sierra, is what Apple is billing as a refined version of regular old Sierra, which came before. The new version of Safari included in High Sierra can automatically block auto-playing video and will also use machine learning in an attempt to minimize the amount of ad-tracking information shared between sites. The Photos app in High Sierra also packs a few new tricks, including machine-learning-powered facial recognition, much like what Google announced in Google Photos two years ago. High Sierra will also introduce a new, default file system. It's an under-the-hood tweak, but one that Apple promises will be able to speed up processes like moving or duplicating files even with the same computing horsepower. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below High Sierra will be out as a free update this fall. New Macs The newest line of iMacs come with the latest Intel Kaby Lake chips, which will give them a boost in both compute power and graphics capability. They also come with Thunderbolt-capable USB Type-C ports, which brings us one step closer to using the same type of cable for pretty much anything, though Apple's iPhones still use the proprietary Lightning Port. Apple also teased a new "iMac Pro" that will release in December with up to an 18-core Xeon Processor, AMD's new Radeon Vega graphics, and up to 16 gigabytes of video RAM. Oh yeah, and it comes in Space Grey. This kind of power isn't aimed at the average Joe, but instead aimed directly at professionals that do a lot of video editing or other horsepower heavy jobs, so all that will cost you a hefty $5,000 on the low end. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Apple's MacBooks are also being updated with Intel's new chips but no other design modifications. You'll notice that the MacBook Air is pointedly absent: iOS 11 In iOS 11, Apple Pay will be able let you send or receive money to and from people, effectively putting a built-in version of Venmo right inside iOS. So long as the people you hang with are all on iPhones. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Siri is also getting some updates. Thanks to machine learning, she'll now have a more natural-sounding voice with more options for emphasis than before. Siri will also be able to give you translation if you ask her how to say something in say, Chinese, although this will only be a beta feature in iOS 11. The control panel is also getting a brand new look that packs a bunch more functionality into a small space: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below IOS 11 also includes a suite of features aimed mostly at iPad Pro users. The new "Files" app functions basically as a traditional computer file system for the iPad Pro but also includes files from third-party cloud storage services like Dropbox. IOS 11 on the iPad Pro also supports drag and drop, which lets you drag apps around your screen much the same way you can have multiple windows open on the same desktop. Apple is clearly making a push to use iOS 11 to make the iPad Pro a more suitable replacement for your average laptop. The new iOS 11 is available as a beta for developers now, an open beta later this summer, and a free update this fall. A New iPad Pro There's a new version of the smaller iPad Pro, with its screen scaled up to 10.5 inches from 9.7 thanks in large part to some shrinking down around the bezels. This modest bump in size is just enough for the new iPad Pro to be able to have a full-size on-screen keyboard and use a full-size keyboard cover. Apple also doubled the refresh rate of the screen on the iPad Pro, effectively increasing the speed at which the screen can update itself. That'll make motion on it look extra smooth (if the app can support it and your eyes can tell the difference) and also let it work with the Apple Pencil without as much update lag. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The new iPad Pro is available now and starts shipping next week: Other Odds and Ends Amazon is coming to Apple TV with Amazon Prime video. The streaming juggernaut has been a hold-out when it comes to streaming devices made by its tech-space competitors. You still can't stream Amazon Prime to a Google Chromecast, but coming to Apple TV means that either Amazon is coming out of its shell or Apple made a heck of a deal to get the important streaming service on its box. Apple isn't rolling out any crazy augmented reality glasses yet, but with the new "ARKit," Apple is takings its first earnest steps into the space. The developer kit demonstrated on stage was able to pull off the the same sort of tricks the Facebook and Snapchat have been able to with a similar "look through your phone" approach, nothing particularly groundbreaking. But since there are so many iPhones out in the wild, Apple's shot at this tech doesn't have to be especially good — it has a huge leg up by virtue of existing at all.

Related Samantha Bee: 'Fox & Friends' Serves Trump Daily Breakfast of "Scrambled Islamophobia" After the White House announced at Monday’s press briefing President Donald Trump would not invoke executive privilege in an effort to block Comey from testifying, the most anticipated Congressional testimony in many viewers’ lifetime was a go;  ABC and CBS and C-Span announced their intention to get in on the action, along with the cable news networks; pundits have their money on NBC following suit. Comey, the reigning king of bombshell news conferences, will be making his first public remarks since Trump sacked him on May 9. Which means it’s the first chance he’s had to talk about that news report he made a memo detailing a conversation in which Trump allegedly asked him to drop his investigation of since-sacked National Security advisor Michael Flynn. Trump has, since he booted Comey, called him a “showboat” and “grandstander” who needed to go.  In a doozy of an interview in May, Donald Trump told Lester Holt he’d asked Comey more than once, when Comey still was FBI director, whether he was under investigation, and had been assured he was not. Once it was over dinner – which Trump said Comey asked for because he wanted to keep his job, though Trump almost immediately walked that claim back. Trump brushed aside Holt’s question about the timing of the firing, which raised eyebrows, coming as it did while Comey was overseeing an investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with Russians who meddled in the election. Trump was ready for that one, answering “this Russia Thing , with Trump and Russia, is a made-up story. It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost and election. They should have won, and the reason they should have won it is, the electoral college is almost impossible for a Republican to win. Very hard. Because you start off at such a disadvantage. So everybody thinks they should have won the election.” “When I did this now I said I probably, maybe, will confuse people, maybe I’ll lengthen the time [of the FBI investigation]. In my opinion it should have been over a long time ago, because it’s an excuse.” Under the circumstances, you can see why TV networks are treating Comey’s Thursday testimony as Must See TV. CBS News, as a for instance, announced Monday its CBS This Morning co-hosts Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell will anchor live coverage of the testimony, expected to begin at 10 AM ET. They’ll be joined in New York by Face the Nation anchor John Dickerson, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, White House correspondent Margaret Brennan,  chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes, justice and homeland security correspondent Jeff Pegues, and national correspondent Chip Reid.

Rod Steele • on Jun 5, 2017 6:19 pm If you can’t prove any Trump campaign Russia evil-doing, J.C., at least declare Trump a reckless, clueless, totally out of his league and mind buffoon who won the election illegitimately. Most of the country would forgive your incompetence and inappropriateness over the nonsensical Clinton email probe which was always much ado about nothing. Reply joe ryan • on Jun 5, 2017 8:54 pm if there is a hell, the networks are going there. children telling other children children’s stories. “Full of sound and fury…Signifying nothing” Pray this stays up 10 minutes so i can forward and boast. Reply Jose Paterno • on Jun 5, 2017 10:12 pm Comey doesn’t want forgiveness, he wants his legacy of being nonpartisan and putting country before party staying intact. It might not be so much for many people on the left or right but for Comey that doesn’t matter either. Personally, I hope his testimony is fatal to Team Trump’s ability to legislate. It’d also be nice to see the House get flipped too. Reply Andrew • on Jun 5, 2017 6:51 pm ABC & CBS? i already made my popcorn Reply Matt • on Jun 6, 2017 8:51 am Meanwhile, Fox will be airing an encore of the Clinton impeachment trial Reply typegiwoqac • on Jun 7, 2017 7:32 am Nikki Haley had said of Comey’s termination that Trump is the CEO of his country, and he can hire or fire as he pleases. Wrong, Ms. Haley. Trump is not the CEO, he is a public servant working for us. Moreover, he must work with our other branches and only within his own power limits. Trump’s own authority ended where Comey’s began. Trump supporters think he will kick out immigrants and re-establish the patriarchy. They think he will get rid of Obamacare, which, ironically, will hurt most of his supporters. Under Obamacare, my previously unaffordable premium is now down to $85/month. My auto insurance is down to $25/month (from Insurance Panda). My homeowners is $25/month too. Under Trump, expect inflation and massive price increases across the board. This administration can lie otherwise, but our democracy is not Trump’s personal enterprise. Reply Billy Bob Johnson • on Jun 7, 2017 8:20 am I’ll be very surprised if he says anything earth-shattering in public.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apple MacBook laptops go Kaby Lake 06/05/2017 at 2:36 PM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Apple is updating its MacBook line of laptops with new models sporting Intel Kaby Lake processors, solid state drives that are up to 50 percent faster than their predecessors, and higher-performance graphics for the new 15 inch MacBook Pro. Prices start at $1299 for the new MacBook models. That’s the price for either an entry-level MacBook or a 13 inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. Apple’s latest MacBook supports up to a 1.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, measures about half an inch thick, and weighs about 2 pounds. Apple says it now supports up to twice as much memory as earlier models. The new 13 inch MacBook Pro is available with up to a 3.5 GHz Core i7 processor, and the 15 inch models now come with discrete graphics on all models. The new MacBook Pro 13 inch laptop with Touch Bar starts at $1799, while the new 15 inch MacBook Pro starts at $2399. Apple is also updating the MacBook Air with a more modest spec bump: the company says it’s giving it a CPU “megahertz” bump to bring it a bit more in line with the company’s other laptops. The new Apple laptops should be available starting today, and they’ll all support the new features in Mac OS X High Sierra that Apple’s introducing at WWDC today, including a speeider version of the Safari web browser (with automatic blocking of auto-playing videos), improved Mail and Photos apps, and more. Apple is also updating its iMac line of all-in-one desktops.

(Apple) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn & Mike Murphy June 05, 2017 Apple’s annual developer conference felt especially like a show for consumers this year, with announcements of seven laptop updates, a new iMac Pro desktop computer, a new iPad, and a new home smart speaker called the HomePod. But Apple also had something for developers: new versions of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Apple computers, which will be available to consumers this Fall. Augmented reality, a theme of recent Google I/O and Facebook F8 developer conferences, also made an appearance on the San Jose stage. Apple spent significant time talking and demoing its ARKit, a set of tools for developers to use the iPhone and iPad camera lenses to overlay digital objects on the world, like in the popular mobile game Pokémon Go. However, the coming changes announced today that might be most important to users are things Apple didn’t talk talk about. Based on a presentation slide shown onstage but not discussed by company reps, the new iOS 11 will bring a slew of little changes meant to make life easier, like a one-handed keyboard for little thumbs reaching across gargantuan screens, and easier wi-fi sharing. Here’s a rundown of all the news. HomePod The HomePod, with Siri. (Apple) Apple unveiled its answer to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home: a squat, 7-inch speaker called the HomePod. The fabric-covered smart speaker can do pretty much everything an Echo or Home can do, from controlling internet-of-things devices, to playing music, providing updates on your calendar, and answering general questions. You control it by talking to Siri, Apple’s digital assistant (who isn’t known for consistently providing the most reliable of responses). The HomePod features seven tweeters and a 4-inch woofer that Apple suggests will provide sound that will “rock the house.” The device comes in black or white, and will be available in December for $349—or about $200 more than Amazon and Google’s costliest speaker models, for roughly the same functionality. New iPads For a while now, Apple has been trying to convince us that, for the average person, the iPad is a worthy replacement for a laptop. After today’s announcements, that may finally be true. Apple debuted a new version of its massive 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new 10.5-inch model with smaller bezels. Both feature brighter screens and faster processors. But what really sets them apart is the new software they’ll come with: iOS 11, the next iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system, expected to launch in the autumn. Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro running the forthcoming iOS 11 software. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) A new app called Files gives iPad users access to all the files on their device in one place, so you can actually find photos to attach to a tweet, or a spreadsheet to add to an email. You can even drag and drop files right from one window to another, just like you would on a computer. You can float apps as windows from the iPad’s dock, or have them in split-screen, giving the iPad the feel of something you might actually be able to put into a bag and feel confident taking with you instead of a laptop—assuming you purchase an Apple Pencil and keyboard case to go with it, of course. The new iPads start at $649 (for the 10.5-inch) and $799 (for the 12.9-inch), and are available today. Apple expects them to start shipping next week. iMac Pro There’s a new Mac in town. Apple previewed the iMac Pro, a new version of its iMac desktop that only comes in its “space grey” color. Other than its more aggressive coloring, it also features some powerful innards: It can hold up to a 4 TB solid-state hard drive, 128 GB of memory, as well as run two 5K monitors and two RAID data storage arrays at once. The iMac has its own 27-inch 5K screen and a new cooling system that Apple says can run 80% cooler than its other iMacs, allowing it to run far more efficiently. The super-powered iMac Pro starts at $4,999, and will be available in December. Making sure the iMac Pro looks just right. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) New Macs and MacBooks On top of the new iMac Pro, Apple refreshed just about its entire line of Macs today. The MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops received new processors, featuring Intel’s new “Kaby Lake” processors, with speeds up to 3.5 GHz. Its non-Pro iMacs also got some upgrades: New iMacs will also feature Intel’s new processors, as well as faster hard drives, new graphics cards, brighter screens, and a new Thunderbolt 3 port. Both the iMacs, the new MacBook, and MacBook Pros will all start at $1,299, and are available today. Apple also revived its long-sidelined MacBook Air, upgrading it to a slightly more powerful 1.8 GHz processor. But the Air still doesn’t have a HD Retina display—like every other Mac computer. VR on Macs One of the more surprising announcements at the convention was that Apple is now working to support virtual reality systems on its computers. Onstage, a team from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the special-effects arm of Lucasfilm (the company behind Star Wars), showed a demonstration of Darth Vader roving around a lava planet breathing dramatically while surveying some destroyed starships, running on an iMac through an HTC Vive VR headset connect. A video showed an ILM employee walking through the Star Wars planet as Darth Vader walked by her. After the keynote, journalists could try out the Vader demo, as well as a few games from the HTC Vive library. The experience felt no different than it did playing on a Windows computer. Apple even had VR headsets connected up to MacBook Pro laptops, which however did require an external graphics card to power the VR experience. There's actual demos of the HTC Vive running on Macs and I thought it was as neat as the Windows experience is #WWDC2017 pic.twitter.com/KqIyWv4qIu — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) June 5, 2017 While these demonstrations were just proofs of concept of what Apple systems could do with VR, they do suggest Apple is taking the medium more seriously and that more could be in store—especially when one considers that the primary audience of today’s keynote was the myriad developers who build games and apps for the company’s existing platforms. iOS The annual iOS update is here. (Apple) Perhaps the most impactful announcements Apple made today concerned iOS, its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads. Rather than redesigning the entire experience, Apple decided to change specific pieces of the software and add new features into existing platforms like iMessage and Siri. iPhone owners will now be able to use Apple Pay to transfer money between each other, much like the popular Venmo app. Of course, because Apple Pay requires a phone made by Apple, you won’t be able to easily send money to your friends who have a Google Pixel, which might still give Venmo an edge. Swiping up from the bottom of the iPhone screen will reveal a new Control Center, the bevy of buttons used to manipulate things like wireless connectivity, screen brightness, and music. The new Control Center is all on one screen, rather than a series of pages that the user swipes through. There is also a dedicated button for turning cellular signal on and off, great for the times when you don’t want to lose signal to Bluetooth headphones, like on an airplane. Best of all, it’s finally customizable, so you can create your shortcuts in your own image. Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, wasn’t neglected either. Apple says Siri will be in even more places on the phone, reading iMessages and browsing history to help predict when you want to see information, create events, or even type certain words. Siri can also now translate English to Chinese, French, German, and a few other languages. You’ll also be able to type messages to Siri—instead of just talking to it—making it so much more than just a voice assistant. On the iPad, iOS 11 will bring an entirely new app switcher and bottom dock (like the one on traditional Mac laptops), as well as a new file explorer app. Called Files (nice), the app attempts to turn the iPad into a viable work machine; trying to put files in a folder or work with a few files at once on an iPad was previously a Sisyphean task. It’s not really a iOS feature per se, but Apple is also redesigning its entire App Store for the first time since its creation. A new “Today” tab will emphasize recently released apps, and there’s a dedicated section for games. Then, as mentioned earlier, the final iOS 11 presentation slide revealed a slew of other features not discussed by Apple execs onstage—but that will significantly change the iPhone and iPad experience for most users. To name a few: There’s now one-handed typing, where holding down the emoji key on the virtual keyboard brings all the keys closer to your preferred thumb, making it easier to tap out messages while holding a coffee or crying baby. There’s also a new way to set up your iOS device: Just hold it near one of your old ones, and a new setup process will automatically import data from that device’s iCloud. macOS High Sierra MacOS has a new name: High Sierra. Apple made a significant tweak under the hood, changing the way files are constructed and stored into a different proprietary format. This will likely speed up some operations like copying files, but doesn’t really mean much for the average user. It will probably still be a nightmare to transfer large files between Mac and Windows environments. Other than the new file system, nothing groundbreaking is happening on MacOS. watchOS 4 Smarter notifications. (Apple) Is the fourth time the charm for the Apple Watch? Since the device launched in April 2015, Apple’s premiere wearable has had three complete iterations on its operating system. They just can’t seem to get it right. But that’s okay, because nobody really has—smartwatch software is generally terrible. Apple is trying a slightly different approach this time, with a Siri-backed watch face. Based on a variety of factors, like the time of day, amount exercised, and location, Siri will suggest information that you might want to see. Given Apple’s past problems with slow load times on the Watch, we’ll have to see whether this feature is quick enough to be actually useful. Other faces added include a kaleidoscope and Toy Story characters for some reason. The Workouts app is being overhauled for easier use, and Apple has partnered with gym equipment manufacturers so Watches can sync with them for better health data. But unless your gym changes its equipment every year on an Apple hardware cycle, you probably shouldn’t get too hyped about using this feature in coming months. Apple TV Amazon Prime Video is coming to Apple TV, and that’s about all Apple had to say about its streaming device. AR Kit Augmented reality is Silicon Valley’s buzzword du jour, dragged into the public eye by the insane popularity of Pokemon Go last year. If you’re not familiar, here’s the basic idea: you use your phone (or tablet) camera as an oracle to glimpse into a world where digital objects are laid over reality. A digital dog pees on your rug, but there is no stain afterwards. A cup of tea sits on your table but you cannot drink it. The idea is interesting, but in practice it feels silly to move around a tiny glass window in order to peek into a massive digital world that doesn’t do all that much. Following the trend— at Google’s I/O keynote the company also gave developers a group of augmented reality tools—Apple released AR Kit, tools for developers to build AR experiences for iOS devices. Where will iOS developers decide to put place digital teacups? That’s for us to find out, and personally we cannot wait.

Previously, the Air started with a 1.6 GHz processor. So it should be a little bit faster. Apple did not say the processor boost includes a jump to Intel's latest "Kaby Lake" generation of processors, however, as it did with the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook on Monday. Instead, the MacBook Air will stick with Intel's years-old "Broadwell" chips, which are well behind the latest generation in terms of overall performance and battery efficiency.  Beyond that, Apple did not announce any changes to the new MacBook Air’s display or general design, so the rest of the laptop is about the same. View photos macbook airMore (Flickr/Matthew Pearce) That's not ideal: While the Air’s keyboard, trackpad, battery life, and general build quality are still above-average, the display is less vivid and substantially less sharp than competing laptops these days. Other devices have also managed to pack more power in designs that are slimmer, have smaller borders around the display, and support the newer USB-C standard. At its core, the Air is still a laptop from 2015.  Nevertheless, compared to other Apple laptops, the MacBook Air remains the most affordable of the bunch. It still starts at $999 — which gets you the older Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage — and goes up to $1,549 as you max out the specs. But with the MacBook providing a more svelte design, and with Apple slashing the entry price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar) to $1,299 on Monday, it seems clearer that the company is ready to phase out its long-popular notebook — regardless of how popular it may continue to be. The updated MacBook Air is available to order through Apple's online store now. Apple says retail availbility will begin on June 7.

There was a lot discussed on stage, far more than just six items, but they boil down to a few key topics. Here's what you might have missed if you didn't tune in. 1. watchOS 4 show chapters Apple unveils new operating system for the Apple Watch    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 4:14 PM ET | 03:45 Apple unveiled watchOS 4 on Monday, the newest version of the operating system for the Apple Watch. It features a couple of new watch faces, the most important of which puts Siri cards front and center. They can tell you things like when to leave for work, the music you're playing, how your workout is going and more. WatchOS 4 has a new workout UI, support for two-way data exchange with workout machines and more. 2. macOS High Sierra show chapters Apple announces new MacOS at Worldwide Developers Conference    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 1:28 PM ET | 05:10 macOS High Sierra is the successor to Sierra, announced last year. It supports virtual reality headsets, something Apple hasn't ever offered before, security improvements to Safari that help further protect your privacy, new photo search features and a new Apple File System by default, which should mean more secure storage. High Sierra will be available in the coming months. 3. New iMacs and MacBook Air / MacBook Pro refreshes show chapters Apple unveils revamped iMac Pro desktop computers at WWDC    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 3:57 PM ET | 05:26 Apple finally refreshed the iMac after more than 600 days without doing so, adding a sharper and brighter display and new Intel processors. It also brought those seventh-generation Intel processors over to the MacBook Pro, which is otherwise unchanged, and boosted the speed of the chip in the MacBook Air. The biggest announcement was the iMac Pro, however, which will start at $4,999 and includes beefy new processors, a 5K display and a sharp design. Apple said it's "the most powerful Mac we have ever made." 4. iOS 11 show chapters Apple details upgrades to iOS    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 4:20 PM ET | 06:00 Apple's iOS 11 will launch in September and includes new features for the iPhone and iPad. The big takeaway here is improvements to Siri, which Apple says will make it easier to synchronize your various iOS devices, like iPhones and iPads. It also said it'll keep messages in the cloud, helping to save valuable hard drive storage space. Another big change is peer-to-peer payments, which will allow Apple to compete with Paypal, Square Cash, Venmo and others by allowing iOS users to easily send money to one another. On the iPad, users will find drag and drop, more room for icons in the bottom dock of the screen and more. Oh, and we'll bundle this here since it was huge: Apple unveiled ARKit, which will allow developers to easily create augmented reality apps for iOS devices. 5. iPad Pro 10.5 show chapters Apple just announced a medium-sized iPad Pro    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 3:02 PM ET | 04:48 Apple showed a new iPad Pro 10.5 during the event. It features a brighter display with a faster refresh rate, which is important which watching things like movies or playing games. It also sports a new A10X processor that should improve gaming and overall app performance. That chip and the new screen were also added to Apple's iPad Pro 12.9. Apple did not refresh the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. 6. Apple HomePod speaker show chapters A first look at Apple's HomePod, an Amazon Echo competitor    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 6:09 PM ET | 00:56 The only brand new product announced was the HomePod speaker. It's a Siri-powered smart speaker that allows you to play music, check the traffic, control you smart lights, query sports scores and more. Sound familiar? That's because it's very much like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple says its product is better, though, thanks to advanced speakers that will fill your room with music. It'll cost $349 when it launches in December.

Related Stephen Colbert Shares James Comey's Testimony About Donald Trump Meetings Sanders made the major announcement when she got asked if President Donald Trump intended to invoke executive privilege to block Comey’s appearance before the committee. Comey is is expected to be asked about reports he wrote a memo saying Trump tried to pressure him into dropping the FBI’s probe of former NSA Mike Flynn and its Russia probe. “The president’s power to exert exec privilege is very well established,” Sanders began. “However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not exert executive privilege regarding James Comey’s scheduled testimony.” In a raucous press briefing Sanders made another banner headline when she called Trump’s Twitter remarks “extremely important,” Sanders said. This, in marked contrast to POTUS surrogates’ talking points just a couple hours earlier. Twitter, Sanders said, “gives him the ability to speak directly to the people without the bias of the media filtering those types of communications. He has, at this point, over 100-plus million contacts through social media and those platforms,” she said, adding, “I think it’s a very important tool for him to be able to utilize.” Reporters in the briefing room seemed stunned by her response. That’s because, Team Trump, having failed entirely to control POTUS’s Twitter tirades, on Monday morning had unveiled a new campaign, in which they blast reporters for paying attention to tweets coming from the President of the United States. Kellyanne Conway, for instance, visited NBC’s Today show to excoriate the press for covering Trump’ explosive weekend and Monday morning tweets, mocking “this obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.” MSNBC anchor Craig Melvin, who was on Today, noted it is Trump’s “preferred method of communication with the American people.” “Not true,” Conway shot back, though Trump’s Twitter activity indicated otherwise. Joining Conway in launching this new campaign, Trump surrogate Sebastian Gorka scolded CNN’s Chris Cuomo for bringing up Trump’s recent tweetpocalypse. Gorka called it “really disappointing” Cuomo was bringing up Trump’s tweets, saying “let’s talk about policy.” “His tweets are the policy,” Cuomo noted. “It’s not policy. It’s social media,” Gorka responded dismissively. In case you missed it, Trump went after the mayor of London hours after seven were killed on the London Bridge and in a pub stabbing.  Trump misquoted London Mayor, who had told citizens not long after the attack that  they should not be alarmed if they saw an increased presence of armed police in the area. Trump misquoted the mayor thusly: At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017 Later, when the mayor addressed Trump’s mis-characterization of his remarks, Trump, in character, punched back: Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 Asked why Trump is “picking a fight with the mayor of London in the aftermath of the horrific attack, Sanders insisted, “I don’t see president picking a fight with the mayor of London at all. I think the president’s point  is something he said almost two year ago…about how we have to be more committed to national security.”   Trump also went after his own Department of Justice in his Twitter tirade, and unraveled their best effort to convince people to stop saying that what Trump is proposing is a “travel ban”: The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court – & seek much tougher version! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 “I don’t think the president cares what you call it,” Sanders spun. “He cares that you call it national security. ..The bottom line is he’s trying to protect citizens of this country.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 13 13 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Trump has already talked about his conversation with Comey in public, so his “executive privilege” likely will not stand in the way of the testimony, but he can drag things out this way. Never thought I’d ever say this, but longing for the days of the second George Bush. Reply Billy Bob Johnson • on Jun 6, 2017 6:06 am He can’t keep his big mouth shut or his fingers still on Twitter.

The company also unveiled new iMac computers, MacBook laptops, new iPads, and updates to its MacOS, iOS, and WatchOS. By Tiernan Ray Updated June 5, 2017 3:41 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple unveiled is long-awaited competitor to Amazon's "Echo" home appliance, called "HomePod," which features newly engineered audio systems, such as an array of "directional" tweeters, and Apple's "A8" custom processor. Apple (AAPL) executives today hosted software developers in San Jose for the company’s annual conference, this time in San Jose, where it unveiled new iMac desktop computers, new MacBook Pro laptop computers, new iPads, and updates to its desktop and mobile operating systems, and new features for its Apple Watch wearable, including watch faces. Chief executive Tim Cook, adding “One last thing,” invited marketing veep Phil Schiller to the stage to unveil the long-awaited home appliance, under the banner of “reinventing music." Schiller teased a “breakthrough home speaker,” called “HomePod.” The mesh-covered canister has features such as 7-beam forming speakers and a 4-inch woofer. The device uses Apple’s own “A8” chip, which Schiller referred to as the “biggest brain ever in a speaker." Schiller said the HomePod will use spatial awareness to create a better sound depending on where the speaker is placed. The HomePod is plugged into the Apple Music service, to pull up one’s existing music catalog, he said. An array of six microphones will respond to the phrase “Hey, Siri." The speaker can also be a “great home assistant,” said Schiller, responding to requests for news and weather, information (“When do the Red Sox play next?) HomePod can also control “Smart Home” devices that utilize Apple’s “HomeKit” programming tools. HomePod ships in December for $349. The new Macs start at $1,099 for a 21.5-inch model, on up to $1,799 for a 27-inch display with “5K” display. The machines use Intel’s (INTC) “Kaby Lake” processors, and “Radeon” graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Another model, iMac Pro, uses an 18-core Intel processor with up to 128 gigabytes of DRAM, for $4,999; that one is not expected to ship until December. Those graphics chips from AMD are also the first time the "500 series" graphics chips have been unveiled. AMD got a little bump from that today, its shares closing up 34 cents, or 3%, at $11.24. The new Intel processors are also coming to a new bunch of MacBook Pro laptops, starting with a 13-inch model at $1,299 with the “Touch Bar” slider strip in place of function keys, going up to the 15-inch model starting at $2,399. (The non-touch-bar model at 11 inches is also available at $1,299.) The company updated its iPad line, changing the 9.7-inch iPad into a 10.5-inch display, by incorporating thinner bezels, as expected. No word on the fate of the iPad Mini. In the coming update to iOS, one can now use drag-and-drop. “It’s a drag fest!” said Apple's head of software, Craig Federighi, demonstrating how one can drag a picture from a message in the iMessage app into the body of an email. Dragging supports multiple gestures at one time, so one can drag multiple items at a single pass. Apple added a function for access to files on the device that’s similar to the Macintosh Finder file browser, with nested folders, plug-ins for third-party file applications such as Dropbox, and other features. Enhancements to the iPad’s productivity features allow one to scan a document into the Notes application and add markup. The iPad camera takes a picture and then the image is corrected for perspective, etc., to make a proper-looking page. Notes using hand-written text, using the “Apple Pencil” stylus, can now allow you to search that text. Apple shares are down $1.66, or 1%, at $153.79.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Using Mindfulness to Create a Safe and Healthy Workplace SOURCE: National Association for Environmental Management (NAEM) DESCRIPTION: This article originally appeared on NAEM’s Green Tie blog.  By Kate Kerr If you’d walked into a corporation ten years ago to discuss the benefits of mindfulness and meditation for organizational effectiveness, leadership and bottom line results, security might have discreetly ushered you out of the building.  During my own 20-year corporate career, I certainly couldn’t have imagined taking a float plane to a hunting lodge in Northern Quebec to lead a mindfulness retreat for some of North America’s top Founders and CEOs. But this is the type of work we are constantly engaged in and hired to do now. Indeed, well-known organizations, such as General Mills, Aetna, Intel and Google, have long recognized the benefits of mindfulness meditation. Many have their own in-house meditation programs, and conduct in-house research to demonstrate it’s effectiveness. Google trains 2000 engineers each year in mindfulness and meditation, one of their most popular programs, ‚Search Inside Yourself’ has a wait list stretching 6 months. Intel started their ‚Awake@Intel’ mindfulness program in 2012 and at least 2000 employees have gone through training. Why are these household names investing in these types of programs?  In today’s 24/7 always-on work environment, many business leaders are dealing with increased levels of executive function burnout, leading to poor resiliency to work-related stress and shrinking attention spans. Among employees, workplace stress creates high turnover and retention issues. Mindfulness is a potential antidote.  While mindfulness has been around for thousands of years, its emergence as a practice in the West dates back to the 1979, when Jon Kabat-Zinn combined Buddhist teachings with scientific findings for the purposes of treating stress. His work at the helm of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School has helped demonstrate that what some might have once considered mystical „woo woo” is, in fact, a medically effective technique for managing stress, pain and illness.    At its core, mindfulness is a discipline that helps us retrain our attention and boost concentration power. This helps us focus on tasks requiring sustained attention and in stressful tasks performed under time constraints. The obvious benefit is increased productivity but this is only scratching the surface. Why mindfulness is relevant to EHS&S Where it gets interesting for EHS&S is the way it teaches us to control our attention, which increases focus and reduces mistakes caused by distraction. A 2010 study by the University of California Irvine, for example, revealed that a whopping 73 percent of trips and falls are caused by inattentiveness and distraction. It’s easy to see, therefore, how evidenced-based mindfulness training may be a highly-effective solution for high-risk work environments, as well as for helping EHS&S leaders remain focused. So what does a mindfulness practice look like?  The first thing you should know about mindfulness is that you don’t need a yoga mat, a candle or a darkened room to create a practice. Mindfulness can be done anytime and anyplace, and for any length of time. The beauty is that it’s highly adaptable to workplace environments and can be implemented in short bursts throughout your day. It’s not about to-dos. Next, it’s helpful to notice any resistance you might be feeling about it. It’s normal to feel that practicing mindfulness sounds adding yet another thing to your to-do list, but it’s not actually a task to be accomplished. You can practice mindfulness while you’re walking to a meeting, sitting down to do some work at your desk or listening to a colleague. What better time to take a conscious breath than during an intense discussion? It’s an invitation to let go of goals and achieve more. One of the paradoxes of mindfulness is that taking a few minutes or more to „pay attention on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally” as Kabat-Zinn puts it, may create a sense of spaciousness in our day, which can actually help us get more done on our to-do list. Another paradox? Mindfulness is an invitation to let go of any goals and lean into our moment-to-moment experiences. Over time our busy minds begin to settle, enabling us to be more present and see more clearly. So ultimately we’re more likely to achieve our goals. So why not take a moment right now to check in on yourself, listen to your thoughts, notice how you’re feeling and just breathe? Kate Kerr is Chief Attention Officer & Founder of Wake Up Kate Inc., a consultancy dedicated to delivering mindfulness-based skills to the corporate, education and healthcare sectors.

Mac users have had to make the switch if they wanted to access the metaverse through HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. But that’s changing now because Apple is expanding its VR efforts behind the iPhone and iOS. Mac is getting SteamVR, according to Apple at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference event in San Jose today. SteamVR is Valve’s open platform for enabling VR headsets to work with games on the Steam PC gaming store. With this software, the HTC Vive will work on Macs, but so should Oculus Rift, OSVR’s HDK 2.0, and most other PC-based VR headsets. This will also enable developers to port a huge number of VR experiences to the Mac when SteamVR launches on the platform at some undetermined point in the future. If you’re wondering how the hell you’re going to run VR games on your Mac computer, Apple made several other announcements that will make that easier for consumers and developers. Apple is adding support for external graphics cards. It introduced a unit with an AMD Radeon RX580 that plugs into a Mac’s Thurderbolt port to add enough extra power for VR. For now, the eGPU (external graphics processing unit) is only for developers, but Apple said it plans to make it available to all of its customers later this year. Apple is also rolling out support for Unity and Unreal, two important game-making tools, as part of its Metal graphics API (the Mac equivalent to DirectX), which will make it easier for developers to port their games to that platform. All of these announcements reveal an Apple that is potentially embracing video games like it never has before. Unreal and Unity are two of the most important game-development engines in the world. SteamVR is just as crucial to VR. Adding all of this functionality and official support to Mac probably won’t get enthusiasts to flip over to Apple’s ecosystem overnight, but it could at least provide some interesting competition to Windows.

 Apple is updating the MacBook Air for the first time in years, but it's a very minor boost Jeff Dunn Jun. 5, 2017, 2:46 PM 6,634 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Apple MacBook Air.Flickr/Tim Trueman Apple announced an updated version of its MacBook Air laptop on Monday, the first update to the popular-yet-aging device in more than 800 days.  However, the upgrade is extremely minor: Apple only says that the 13-inch MacBook Air now starts with a 1.8 GHz processor. Previously, the Air started with a 1.6 GHz processor. So it should be a little bit faster. Apple did not say the processor boost includes a jump to Intel's latest "Kaby Lake" generation of processors, however, as it did with the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook on Monday. Instead, the MacBook Air will stick with Intel's years-old "Broadwell" chips, which are well behind the latest generation in terms of overall performance and battery efficiency.  Beyond that, Apple did not announce any changes to the new MacBook Air’s display or general design, so the rest of the laptop is about the same. Flickr/Matthew Pearce That's not ideal: While the Air’s keyboard, trackpad, battery life, and general build quality are still above-average, the display is less vivid and substantially less sharp than competing laptops these days. Other devices have also managed to pack more power in designs that are slimmer, have smaller borders around the display, and support the newer USB-C standard. At its core, the Air is still a laptop from 2015.  Nevertheless, compared to other Apple laptops, the MacBook Air remains the most affordable of the bunch. It still starts at $999 — which gets you the older Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage — and goes up to $1,549 as you max out the specs. But with the MacBook providing a more svelte design, and with Apple slashing the entry price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar) to $1,299 on Monday, it seems clearer that the company is ready to phase out its long-popular notebook — regardless of how popular it may continue to be. The updated MacBook Air is available to order through Apple's online store now. Apple says retail availbility will begin on June 7.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Apple Unveils Kaby Lake-Equipped iMacs, $5K iMac Pro at WWDC Apple Unveils Kaby Lake-Equipped iMacs, $5K iMac Pro at WWDC By Jamie Lendino on June 5, 2017 at 2:16 pm Comment At WWDC today, Apple has finally unveiled its new iMacs. All models receive upgrades to Intel’s 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors. They also get two Thunderbolt 3 controllers, brighter displays, much faster Radeon graphics, and USB-C ports for the first time. The new iMac displays feature 500 nits, are 43 percent brighter, and include 10-bit dithering (8-bit panels) and support for one billion colors. All 27-inch iMacs come with Fusion drives standard, and SSDs are of course optional; we would have preferred to see SSDs standard across the board, though we can see why some not-as-demanding customers would want more internal storage (up to 2TB) over sheer speed. Apple also said its SSDs are now 50 percent faster than before. Apple is framing its 27-inch iMacs with discrete graphics as a way to power the company’s first-ever push into VR experience. Also: not an Nvidia chip in sight. It’s AMD all the way. You can now get up to 32GB RAM on 21.5-inch models and 64GB on 27-inch models, though be prepared to pay through the nose for the experience. Pricing has come down a bit. The 21.5-inch model starts at $1,099, but you can get a 4K Retina model for $1,299 for the first time. The 5K Retina 27-inch iMac starts at $1,799. In a surprise move, Apple also took the wraps off what it’s calling the iMac Pro, the first-ever iMac to bear that moniker. The monster machine will have an eight-core Xeon processor, an AMD Radeon Vega GPU with 16GB RAM, 10-gigabit Ethernet, up to 128GB ECC memory and 4TB 3Gbps SSDs, and a 5K Retina Display, with options for 10- and 18-core (!) Xeon processors as well. Apple is pitching this machine for real-time 3D rendering and 4K video effects, immersive VR at high frame rates, machine learning development, and faster code compiling. The iMac Pro will be available this coming December starting at a whopping $4,999. In introducing the iMac Pro and with a straight face, Apple said the 27-inch iMac is currently its most popular desktop for its pro customers. It’s obvious by this point that few people have opted for the expensive, severely outdated Mac Pro when they could get a fully equipped, quad-core 27-inch iMac with a built-in 5K display for the same price. I’d say Apple announcing the iMac Pro is pretty much the nail in the coffin for the little black can design. On the developer front, Apple also unveiled a new Developer Kit that’s a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with an AMD Radeon RX 580 and a USB-Hub, designed for use with the company’s MacBook Pros. The MacBook Pros all get minor speed bumps as well, thanks to Kaby Lake, with the base 13-inch MacBook Pro model falling to $1,299 (from $1,499). The company also announced macOS 10.13 High Sierra and iOS 11; we’ll have more on those shortly. Updated 3:51pm: All the new machines are now on Apple’s site and listed as in stock at the time of this writing. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, none have SSDs or even 16GB RAM standard, though almost all of them are now Retina-class and quad-core except for the least expensive model (often intended for education markets).

The new beefed-up iMac is intended to address the concerns of professional creatives, who until now have been limited to either the consumer 27in 5K iMac or the older Mac Pro, which hasn’t been updated since 2013. The new iMac Pro starts with an 8-core Intel Xeon processor, but can be configured with an 18-core processor variant, as well as up to 128GB of EEC RAM, 4TB of SSD storage and Radeon Vega discrete graphics cards with up to 16GB of memory. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple’s John Ternus speaks about the new iMac Pro. Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP The 27in machine has the 5K display from the existing 5K iMac, but has four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and is capable of pushing up to 44m pixels across three screens. Apple will hope that the iMac Pro will address the concerns of video editors looking to work with 4K or 8K video that need workstation-level power – a market that the company has failed to serve for the last couple of years forcing once Apple-only outfits to switch to alternative operating systems and machines. The iMac Pro will start at $4,999 in the US and will be available in December. Apple also updated the standard iMac line with new 7th generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, up to 64GB of RAM and Apple’s Fusion drives as standard. The 21.5in iMac will come in a standard and 4K screen variant, with Iris Plus 620 graphics and a choice of Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs. The 27in 5K variant will come with Radeon Pro 570, 575 or 580 graphics cards, and were demoed producing live VR content - a new area of exploration for Apple, which has joined with Valve to bring its Steam VR platform for the Mac as well as Unity and Unreal engines. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple’s new iMacs have improved screens. Photograph: Apple The 21.5in and the 5k iMac hadn’t been updated since late 2015 with the Skylake, 6th generation Intel processors – the same as those used in the MacBook Pro when it launched in 2016. Finally, Apple also updated its MacBook and MacBook Pro line with 7th generation Intel processors, and gave the MacBook Air a specification bump in response to its sustained popularity. When the redesigned MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was launched in October 2016, one of the criticisms of the design was that it used older 6th generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors rather than the latest 7th generation versions, which were more powerful and more thermally efficient. By updating to the 7th generation “Kaby Lake” Core i5 and i7 processors, Apple has brought the MacBook Pro line up to pair with rivals from Dell, Razer and HP. But Apple will also hope that the more efficient, newer processors will help it live up to its promises of a 10-hour battery life, of which the 13in MacBook Pro fell well short.

Swaraj Singh Dhanjal Eight firms have raised Rs6,335.83 crore through IPOs so far this year. Photo: Reuters Mumbai: At least four companies are ready to sell their shares to the public for the first time in June, aiming to raise a total of at least Rs 5,000 crore, four people familiar with the moves said. The firms are telecom equipment maker Tejas Networks Ltd, depository services firm Central Depository Services Ltd, pharma company Eris Lifesciences Ltd and small finance bank Au Small Finance Bank Ltd. Bengaluru-based Tejas Networks, which is backed by private equity investors such as Goldman Sachs, Intel Capital, Frontline Strategy and Mayfield, is looking to launch its approximately Rs800 crore initial public offering (IPO) in the third week of June, one of the persons cited above said. “Road shows were completed last month, a final assessment of the institutional demand has been done and the IPO is set for launch, which is targeted for the week of 12 June,” he said. The IPO will raise Rs450 crore in primary capital for capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Several shareholders—including Cascade Capital Management Mauritius, Intel Capital, Frontline and the company’s chief executive officer Sanjay Nayak—will also sell some of the shares they hold through an offer for sale. Au Small Finance Bank Ltd, one of the 10 entities who were granted a small finance bank licence in 2015 by the Reserve Bank of India, is planning to launch its almost Rs2,000 crore IPO, said another person cited above, also requesting anonymity. “The plan is to launch the IPO towards the end of the month. The company is currently on investor roadshows, which are expected to be concluded soon,” he said. Among small finance banks, it will be the third to be listed. Equitas Small Finance Bank got listed in April 2016 and in the next month, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank got listed too. Au’s IPO is a pure offer for sale. Existing investors partially selling their shares include International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group), Warburg Pincus, ChrysCapital and Kedaara Capital. “As you are aware, Au Small Finance Bank Ltd had filed a draft red herring prospectus with capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for its IPO on 1st February 2017. The company received the SEBI comments in March 2017. The timing of opening the IPO will be decided in due course by company and selling shareholders in consultation with BRLMs (book running lead managers),” said a spokesperson for the company in an email. Last week, Mint reported that Ahmedabad-based pharmaceuticals company Eris Lifesciences Pvt. Ltd plans to launch a Rs2,000 crore IPO in June. The fourth company is depository services firm CDSL, which plans to raise Rs400 crore. According to the draft red herring prospectus filed by the company, the IPO will be a pure offer for sale by existing shareholders BSE Ltd, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and The Calcutta Stock Exchange. BSE, SBI, Bank of Baroda and The Calcutta Stock Exchange together hold 65.65% stake in CDSL, with BSE alone holding 50%. Emails sent to Tejas Networks and CDSL on Thursday evening were not answered. So far this year, eight companies have raised Rs6,335.83 crore through IPOs, while last year 26 companies raised Rs26,493.84 crore through this route.

Credit: Intel Free Press A consortium of international chambers of commerce has advised the Vietnamese government that its draft solar PPA template is “non-bankable” and cannot attract financing for PV in Vietnam, particularly for medium and utility-scale projects, according to documents seen by PV Tech. Vietnam Business Forum (VBF), an umbrella group for all international Chambers of Commerce, which facilitates dialogue between the business community and the Vietnamese leadership, submitted its response on the draft solar PPA to Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) last week. The repsonse stated: “If the Draft Circular and the Draft PPA are not improved and the PPA template of the MOIT remains to be non-bankable, actual development and investment in solar power projects may be [more] limited than expected or planned under the amended Power Development Plan VII, even though Vietnam remains to have a high potential for solar power investment.” Back in April, Vietnam confirmed a long-awaited feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme for utility-scale solar projects, with a net metering scheme for rooftop PV, along with standardized PPAs. However, shortly afterwards multinational law firm Baker McKenzie said MOIT’s solar guidelines failed to address a range of issues that could impact large-scale project bankability, issuing a warning about the ‘non-negotiable’ template drafted for all grid-connected solar PPAs. No foreign bank will touch this PPA The VBF consortium, which includes Amcham (USA), Japan Banker's Association, Eurocham, Kocham, the Nordics and Vietnam Chamber of Commerce International (VCCI) among its members, has now added to the backlash. Following their response, a member of the finance industry, who preferred not to be named, also told PV Tech that “no foreign bank will touch this PPA”. VBF has now put forward various recommendations to MOIT including adopting an international standard bankable PPA template, localized under Vietnamese law. This is particularly important for large-scale projects but relevant to all segments. The Forum also said that if MOIT retains its PPA template then it “must be significantly improved” and the VBF response goes on to detail a lengthy number of issues with the current design. Echoing the issues raised by Baker McKenzie regarding monopoly utility EVN being the sole off-taker for all solar projects, VBF said that EVN’s payments obligations should be supported by a Government guarantee or another mechanism to resolve the related payment risks. VBF also found a lack of protection against retroactive changes in policy that could effect existing projects. The PPA was also found to lack clauses on project insurance, anti-corruption measures and a waiver of sovereign immunity. Meanwhile, no offshore dispute resolution in a neutral location is provided. VBF claimed: “This will be a serious concern to investors and creditors." Given that the FiT would be subject to fluctuations in the VND/USD exchange rate, VBF also warned: “No escalation clause is provided in the Draft PPA. The Draft PPA does not include any indexation of the FiT by way of escalation in accordance with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or any other provision to address inflation risks.” These were just a few of the major issues highlighted by the consortium. Ultimately, VBF said: “without a bankable PPA, it will be impossible or very difficult for developers/investors to be able to get or convince financing from international or foreign lenders on a 'project finance' basis.” The response will cause serious concern among players hoping to enter the Vietnamese market, especially given that the country appeared to have gained momentum in project announcements. On the other hand, EVN is set to go ahead with its own large-scale PV plans, with subsidiary Power Generation Corp 3 working on 350MW across two projects in Phuoc Minh Thuan Nam district.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why You Won't Be Able to Buy Intel Corporation's 18-Core Beast Right Away This Fool explores the technical and business reasons Intel's recently announced 18-core chip will be a little later than its less flashy counterparts. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 5, 2017 at 10:30AM On May 30, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its new Core X-series of processors aimed at the enthusiast desktop personal computer market. These chips come in configurations with as few as four cores and scale to as many as 18 cores. This represents a significant improvement over the company's prior high-end desktop processors, which only came in six, eight, and 10-core variants. Per an Intel fact sheet, the Core X chips with between 4 and 10 cores "are available at launch via online retail and through channel partners in all geographies," while the 12-18-core models are simply "coming soon." Image source: Intel. Additionally, over on the ASUS Republic of Gamers forums (ASUS is a major vendor of computer motherboards and personal computers), the employee who goes by the handle "Raja@ASUS" said that the "18-core CPUs are not scheduled until later this year" and that (presumably gamers) "won't have them for a while." In this column, I'd like to explain why it'll be a while before the 18-core Core X chip (branded the Core i9-7980XE) is available. Getting this product right will be tough In a previous column, I went over what I'd like to see Intel do to make the 7980XE attractive to the enthusiast/gaming market. In my view, Intel needs to be sure it isn't just selling gamers and enthusiasts chips with a lot of cores on them (that's trivial -- Intel can rebrand datacenter-oriented chips and be done with it), but that it's selling chips with lots of cores on them that can also run at high speeds in workloads that can't use all of those cores. Intel processors have a feature that is known as Turbo Boost 2.0. The idea behind Turbo Boost -- a feature introduced years ago -- is that a chip with lots of cores on it shouldn't offer compromised performance to a chip with fewer cores on it in workloads that can only use a handful of cores. So, in those scenarios where only a few cores are used, the few cores that get used can run at much higher speeds than they can when more (or all) of the cores on the chip are being used. This is a good feature, but for Intel to advertise a given Turbo Boost 2.0 speed, the company needs to be sure that each core on the chip can run at that advertised speed since programs can conceivably be run on any subset of the cores on the chip. So, for the Core i9-7980XE to not be a "compromised" product relative to the $999 Core i9-7900X (which has just 10 cores on it), it should offer a Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 4.3GHz -- quite a high frequency. I can't imagine that finding chips with this capability will be easy, so Intel may need some extra time to find, validate, and ship such parts. The Xeon factor It's also important to note that Intel's high-end desktop processors aren't based on chips that were purpose-built for the high-end desktop computer market. These are chips that were initially designed for the datacenter market that are tweaked and sold as ultra-high-end consumer products. The market for datacenter processors is much larger than the market for high-end desktop processors, and based on everything Intel has said, it views itself as a "datacenter first" company. This means Intel's priority will be to make sure that its datacenter customers get the chips they want, so the high-end desktop customers may have to wait a bit, especially since the 18-core high-end desktop chip will need to represent, arguably, the "best of the best" of the 18-core chips that Intel produces. Business impact? The reality is that the market for processors like Intel's 18-core Core i9-7980XE is rather minuscule, even within the hardcore enthusiast gamer/prosumer market (a relatively small but fast-growing portion of the overall personal computer market). There will certainly be buyers for this chip, and Intel is certain to make a nice chunk of profit per unit sold, but in the scheme of Intel's overall business performance, rolling out the 18-core Core i9-7980XE later than it will the lower core-count models isn't going to have much of an effect.

The X299GT9 is a monster motherboard that comes in the E-ATX form factor, which allows for a significantly wider PCB. The motherboard features multiple PCI-E x16 slots, two U.2 ports, an M.2 slot, many USB 3.0 internal headers, and a hefty VRM.     Hidden under a metal veil is an Intel 1Gbit NIC as well as an Intel 10Gbit NIC. Intel's X550AT is employed to drive the higher networking speeds. The PCI-E layout is x16/x16/x8/x4/x4/x4/x4 and there are four SATA6Gb/s ports on the right of the motherboard. The motherboard does support USB 3.1 and carries a 14-phase VRM. We don't know much more about the motherboard, but its size is impressive, and hopefully we will get one in for review. >> NEXT STORY: PlayStation VR tops 1 million sales << PREVIOUS STORY: ASUS's first motherboards with wireless AD tech Related Tags Computex 2017 Biostar Biostar X299GT9 Biostar motherboard Intel Got an opinion on this news?

The €69 (£60) computer can run Windows, Android or Ubuntu, making it much more flexible than the open source computer, although it's more than double the price compared to the $35 Pi 3 Model B. The UP Core does have an extremely top-end spec for such a tiny computer though, including an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 CPU with a 2MB Cache, up to 1.84 GHz, Intel HD 400 Graphics and either 2GB or 4GB RAM. It will be available in either the 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB versions, utilising eMMC as its preferred storage option. With one HDMI port, one full eDP, Audi via HDMI and Docking's i2S, it supports a decent range of video and audio formats, while a USB 3.0 host and two USB 2.0 pin headers ensure you can plug in enough peripheries for a keyboard, mouse and a camera, for example. Also packed inside include Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n to connect to the internet and Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) for other wireless networking needs. UP Core's makers claim it has attracted a selection of launch developers who are busy creating third party hardware and software for those who have bought a microcomputer. Although it won't have the same support as Raspberry Pi at launch - mostly because the open source microcomputer has more than five years on the UP Core, it's a positive step towards making microcomputers more accessible to a wider group of people. So far, UP has managed to treble its Kickstarter goal of €10,000 (£8,750), with almost a month still to run on its campaign. Those who opt to support the company can pick up a UP Core for the discounted price of €69 for the 1GB RAM/16GB eMMC version.

Traditional SIM Card Replacement Explained By Rishabh Jain On 06/05/17 AT 6:55 AM SIM cards are reflected on a monitor showing binary digits in this picture taken, Feb. 23, 2015. Photo: Reuters/Dado Ruvic SIM cards might be the biggest hangover from early smartphone days, which is still present in today’s most advanced phones.  We might have changed its size to MicroSIMs and NanoSIMs, but the basic technology and hardware structure remains the same. SIM cards however, might soon be history and get replaced by embedded SIMs or eSIMs, according to a report released Monday. So what are eSIMs? eSIMs are SIMs that would be woven into the silicon fabric of a device’s modem, and would be programmable to access different networks. Read: 750 Million Cell Phones At Risk Of Remote Hacking Due To SIM Card Security Flaw They are not a new thing — smartwatches such as the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier already use them for SIM connectivity. But, according to Engadget, eSIMs might soon become commonplace in smartphones. Chipmaker Intel is working on mobile modems compatible with eSIMs — the company has already successfully embedded an eSIM in one of its devices. While most Android devices use either Qualcomm or Mediatek processors, chances are Apple, which uses Intel processors for its devices, might feature an eSIM in its iPhone next year. An advantage that eSIMs might have over traditional mobile SIMs, would be that they would be able to support higher data speeds of more 1 GB per second over mobile data networks. According to research firm IHS Markit, eSIM shipments are expected to grow from 108.9 million shipments in 2016 to 986 million shipments by 2021. It might seem like a tall order, but chances are instead of just being fitted in wearables, eSIMs could be fitted in smartphones, PCs and even the larger internet-of-things (IoT) networks.  According to IHS Markit, smartphones would spur the growth of eSIMs. eSIMs could also lower the prices of devices since the embedded SIM slot would come pre-fitted into a device, meaning a device maker will not have to design one, which in turn would save valuable surface area on a smartphone along with designing costs.  Also, the SIM would be soldered into a device and programmed remotely which would mean less frequency loss, unlike plastic SIMs, which tend to lose signal very often. This will help create a better customer experience. It will also allow network providers to interface better with smartphone manufacturers. Additionally, more opportunities are expected for SIM providers, who will now be able to diversify into the IoT and connected cars market. Conversely, these technologies will also benefit, since they will no longer be dependent on Wi-Fi for data and will be able to integrate with other smart devices. The GSM Alliance (GSMA) has already backed eSIMs and the technology could become mainstream by next year. Read: Samsung Gear Solo: Smartwatch With SIM Card Could Make And Receive Calls According to IHS Markit, the technology is expected to be adopted by budget devices and trickle on to premium devices in 2019. Samsung and Huawei are expected to be the first smartphone makers to adopt the technology. While the decline of traditional SIMs might not be as fast as some hope, they are still believed to be steadily on their way out with an expected decline of 0.3 billion between 2016-2021.

It's been tearing its way through smartphones, looking to move itself from budget brand to a mainstream premium player with its P-series devices. And it's been doing a pretty good job, too. While Android phones are why Huawei is best known in the consumer sector, the company is a telecommunications powerhouse, underpinning the infrastructure of many 4G networks, as well as being a white label manufacturer for a lot of set-top boxes and connected dongles. With such expertise it's little surprise that the Huawei brand is expanding into laptops. While the company's first tablet, the MateBook, wasn't the best attempt, it's first Ultrabook, the MateBook X, is much better. Be warned Dell and Apple - because Huawei is coming for your customers with a MacBook beater of its own. Huawei Mate X review: Design 286 x 211 x 12.5mm; 1.05kg Premium metal designs in gold, rose gold, grey The MateBook X is all about portable, lightweight design. As Huawei boasts, the X is slimmer than the 12-inch MacBook and it adopts premium techniques that you'll find on Huawei's phones, like the diamond cut precise chamfer to the very edge of the display. It's not a total Apple-a-like, though, as this finish has a hint of Asus ZenBook 3 about it. Pocket-lint The MateBook X is a 13-inch device - although it doesn't look like it. With bezels around the display measuring a mere 4.2mm, there's only a hint at a black border, with the metal of the lid framing the edges neatly. What this means is a lot of display in not a lot of space: the MateBook X is light enough to tote around, without leaving you with a display that isn't really big enough to work on all day. The other big point of note is the MateBook X's fanless design - and we're talking fanless Intel Core i processor, not less-powerful Core m. Huawei announced this with some fanfare at the launch of this device, but as there's now a new fanless Surface Pro that offers similar hardware, it's not the unique proposition it once was and likely to be commonplace in the future.  This processor choice no doubt aids the skinny build, but also means the MateBook X is a quiet runner. However, as the design has cooling section in the chassis, used to trap heat and draw it away from hardware, the downside is that the base heats up when under load. When working in 26 degree ambient temperatures on a balmy day, you'll start to feel that heat in your lap. The MateBook X's parallels with the MacBook can't be ignored, from the styling of the rubber feet on the bottom to the look of the keyboard and the trackpad. Not that it's a negative, because the design is rather good. We've been carrying one around for a couple of weeks, and have found the size, lightness and the compact power pack all appeal. The footprint itself is smaller than a piece of A4 paper, so slipping it into any bag is a breeze. Pocket-lint For the most part the MateBook X feels solid too. We like the cool touch of the metal and the matching keyboard colour is nicely done, but there's a surprisingly spongey section of the speaker grille above the keyboard. The keyboard action doesn't seem to be affected, however, and we were happy to clatter out words, with good travel from those chiclet keys. This is a fast keyboard and despite some flex in the deck to the top, that doesn't affect the real-world usage. The keyboard is backlit and the illumination can be adjusted, but we've found it's not the best backlighting in a laptop: from a lap position we've found the illumination almost totally vanishes when looking from a given angle. This all depends on viewpoint, but we did find ourselves leaning in a little in darker conditions on occasion to ensure we were about to hit the right key. The touchpad is large and clicky and feels natural to use, but this is one area where the MacBook perhaps does a little better, as the Huawei isn't as smooth and precise as you'll get from Apple. It's still very usable and we like that it's free from the clutter of a fingerprint sensors (which is cleverly placed within the power button). When it comes to connectivity, the MateBook X also adopts some of Apple's approach, although there's two USB Type-C connections rather than just one, plus a 3.5mm headphone socket. The left-hand socket is for power and you're prompted to switch devices around if you plug them into the wrong place. Pocket-lint Such connectivity is a fusion of conventionality with the adoption of new standards, but there's also a dock/dongle that comes in the box. This will expand connections to USB, HDMI and VGA, so it's more of a desk dock than on-the-go connector for your other devices. The only thing we're left smarting about is the lack of an SD card slot. In regard to connections, therefore, the skinny MateBook X loses out to the Dell XPS 13 which is all the more conventional. Huawei MateBook X review: Hardware and display 13-inch IPS, 2160 x 1440 pixels, 200ppi, 350 nits Intel Core i5-7200U or Core i7-7500U; 4/8GB DDR3 RAM 256/512GB SSD Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 2x2 MiMo To the meat of the MateBook sandwich: its display is a 13-inch fully laminated touchless panel with a resolution of 2160 x 1440 pixels over its 3:2 aspect ratio. That results in a little more height than some rivals, meaning a little more working space on that document you might be tapping away on, but obviously it's less well suited to wider content like video. We've already mentioned that we love the narrow bezels, with Huawei taking a similar approach to the Dell XPS 13's infinity display. There's no touch, however, which is where Dell might be seen to offer a little more on its top-end models. Whether this is a problem or not depends on what you're using at the moment. If you've become a touch and type person, it's a bane, if you're moving from a MacBook, it's no problem at all. Pocket-lint There's ample brightness from the MateBook X's display, although the auto-brightness is a little odd, sometimes limiting the range it will offer based on the ambient conditions (a trait exhibited by Huawei's phones). To get access to the absolute brightest conditions you'll need to switch this off, rather than just using the keys to turn it all the way up. However, using the MateBook X out in sunny conditions and we've had no problems: it's bright enough to cut through the glare when working next to the window on the train and so on. On top of that, it's rich with colour and detail, so content looks good. Like many skinny ultra-portables there's the choice of i7-7500U or i5-7200U processors, with integrated Intel HD Graphics 620. We've been using the i7 version and have found it to be plenty powerful, but the load-out you choose will make quite a difference to the price. Our review unit is loaded with the high-end processor, 8GB RAM and 512GB storage - so it's very much the top of the range and rather pricey as a result. It matches the top tier Dell XPS 13 in this regard. At the moment Huawei hasn't confirmed what other/regional configurations will be available or how much more they will cost. For those watching the specs there's been no mention of 16GB RAM that the new Surface Pro will offer at the top end. Pocket-lint The MateBook X also houses a fingerprint scanner, placed within the power button, meaning you can trigger Windows Hello pretty much instantly. It's as good an implementation as we've seen from Huawei on its smartphones, meaning fast unlocking that feels natural to use. It's a really great fingerprint scanner that's been put in absolutely the right place. Huawei MateBook X review: Battery life 41.4Wh battery 8.5 hours of real world usage For portability purposes, battery life is key. It's also the downfall of some slimmer machines as the physical battery size is limited. Huawei claims 10 hours of video playback from the MateBook X, which we think is ambitious.  In real-world use, we've found the MateBook X averages around eight and a half hours of use, for average browser-based working on office tasks. We've seen it drop a little lower to under seven hours when this was slightly more intense - and that's a pretty good, showing that it's a laptop that can suit most use cases, rather than dying in minutes when the processor is called upon for beefier tasks. The upside is USB C charging, which takes about three hours to pump the MateBook X back up to full power. So while the MateBook X might not be the best battery performer - and, again, the MacBook or Dell XPS will deliver a more reliable 10 hours - we've seen worse and the MateBook X doesn't ring huge alarm bells. Huawei MateBook X review: Unique audio power Dolby Atmos Sound System One of the aces in Huawei's desk is its collaboration with Dolby. The MateBook X is the first laptop to come with a Dolby Atmos Sound System. In the increasingly muddied waters of what Dolby Atmos means (it's now in cinemas, home movie setups, smartphones, tablets and laptops), here it means that you're getting a greater separation and a degree of object placement compared to normal stereo, as long as you have the content to support it. We've experienced some demo clips and the effect is surprisingly good, so while the definition of what Dolby Atmos means might be changing, it's certainly a boost to the normal flat acoustics you might expect from a skinny laptop. Dolby says this is a result of working with Huawei from early on in the design process: Dolby wasn't handed a laptop carcass and told it make it sound good, the company was able to have an input on hardware and software design to make sure it could get the desired result. Pocket-lint However, the Atmos effect that the MateBook X speakers can create isn't universal and doesn't apply to all content, so you're not always getting the best in that regard, but there's still some impressive performance on offer. The system also offers a software controller with a number of different modes, so you can easily switch from music to movie, for example, and generally these do lead to optimised performance for different content types. For straight music, which is what we've used the audio for the most, the important thing is that you can get distortion-free music at high volumes from the MateBook X. It struggles with some heavier basslines, of course, but on the whole it's an audio big hitter. Verdict The real winner in the MateBook X is its design. This laptop fires itself right into the centre of the Ultrabook pack, likely to cause the go-to MacBook and Dell XPS some disruption thanks to its slim and light design, very usable keyboard and trackpad, plenty of power from Intel Core i processors and silent operation. There's also a great display as standard with minimal bezel that looks great. While Dell offers much the same - and arguably better battery life and a touchscreen in the XPS 13 - the MateBook X does have the X factor: it's a laptop we want to use.  The only hurdles are few and far between: photographers will be annoyed by the lack of SD card slot, and then there's the price, which is likely to be higher than its rivals. We're still waiting for confirmation of exactly how much this will cost in pounds and pence, though. Overall, the MateBook X is a compelling option and a wonderful debut from a company that you won't associate with laptops just yet - but will in the future, if this is anything to go by. Bravo Huawei, the MateBook X is great. Alternatives to consider Pocket-lint Apple MacBook from £1,049 The original ultra-slim and almost port-free laptop, if you're a Mac OS fan then it's the only option. But the MateBook X offers a compelling Windows rival with more power and features.

Apple's first big event of the year, the World Wide Developer's Conference is upon us. Apple usually announces new software at WWDC and this year nothing has changed - a new version of iOS, a new edition of Mac OS and updates to Watch OS and TV OS are expected. However, there are rumours swirling around the internet that this year Apple will also announce new hardware at WWDC - new MacBook Pros with Intel's 7th generation 'Kaby Lake' Core processors, new iPads and even possibly a Siri Speaker to take on the likes of the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Many rumors point towards this year's WWDC being more consumer focused than before. There is some evidence to back this claim. Ahead of WWDC 2017, many Developer focused announcements have been pre-announced by Apple. For example, the company released a press release a few days ago which highlighted how Swift Playgrounds has been used by developers to work with Parrot drones and Lego Mindstorms as well as the fact that Apple has paid 70 billion dollars to developers. The event will be held in San Jose, California and will start at 10 AM Pacific Standard Time (10:30PM I.S.T). Apple will be livestreaming the event and you can watch it by heading onto Apple's official website. We are all excited to see what Apple has to offer at WWDC 2017 and here is what all to expect from Apple's big event: iOS 11The next version of iOS, which will be seen in the iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and the iPhone 8 this fall is expected to bring in quite a few updates and enhancements. On cards in a dark mode toggle in the UI aimed at improving battery life, new features, tweaks and enhancements for Siri, updates to iMessage and Facetime as well as updates to Apple's digital payment system Apple Pay. Apple is also expected to announce new content for Apple Music such as their new show CarPool Karaoke, better integration of the Apple Pencil throughout the OS and new multitasking features for the iPad. The introduction of the dark mode in iOS 11 is a response to the OLED screens expected in the next generation iPhones as the new display technology uses much less power to display black content than white. MacOS 10.13There is very little known about what Apple's next version of Mac OS will bring to the table. It is expected to be a very incremental update unless Apple surprises us all with a complete overhaul. The next version of MacOS is expected to come with  better Siri integration throughout the OS, internal updates to accommodate Intel's new 7th generation chips, better integration with the cloud and maybe third-party app support for Siri. Watch OS 4/TVOS 11Updates to both Watch OS - Apple's operating system for the Apple Watch and TV OS - the software that powers Apple's streaming box Apple TV are expected. Watch OS 4 is expected to feature an en even tighter focus on digital health with support for accessories such as external sleep trackers and glucose monitors. Apple might also finally introduce a store for watch faces and allow third-party developers to make watch faces for the Apple Watch. Some rumours suggest that with TVOS 11, Apple might open up their ecosystem to allow competitors like Amazon Prime Video. However, we are a little skeptical on this as Apple is notorious for not allowing competitors on their platforms. What is sure is that Apple will make TVOS ready for their new streaming shows such as Carpool Karaoke. New MacBooksThis is where things get really exciting for consumers as this looks to be the first WWDC in years with hardware announcements from Apple. Apple is widely expected to announce new MacBooks with Intel's 'Kaby Lake' 7th generation Core processors. Apple might also announce updates to the iMac line which has been languishing as of late and hasn't received any update since 2015. Apple did confirm earlier on in the year that new iMacs will be coming in 2017 and WWDC might be where. Many rumors point towards this year's WWDC being more consumer focused than before. Apple is expected to announce new MacBooks, a new iPad Pro and a Siri Speaker. Whether we will see updates to the Mac Mini and Macbook Air is an open question but it looks increasingly unlikely. Apple is also expected to announce a new wireless keyboard with a touch bar built in. A 10.5-inch iPad ProAn update to the iPad Pro is expected. Many rumours point to Apple releasing an all new model with a 10.5-inch screen with the same physical dimensions of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That points to a device with much slimmer bezels and possibly an all new design. Siri SpeakerThe success of standalone devices with virtual assistants built-in such as the Amazon Alexa and Google Home has piqued Apple's interest and Apple is widely expected to announce a competitor in the form of the Siri Speaker. Some rumours suggest that the device is already in production and could go on sale by the end of the month. According to MacRumours, Apple analyst Mich-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has said, " We believe there is an over 50 [percent] chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June. He has stated that the Speaker will feature excellent sound and will be price higher than the competition. There is an outside chance that Apple might also introduce a new Apple TV with 4K support at the event.

We are live at the event and will bring you an extensive live coverage. Here is a list of things which Apple is expected to announce at the WWDC 2017. New MacBooks Apple might refresh its MacBook lineup by announcing an upgraded version Macbook Pro and the 12-inch Macbook with faster processors. The MacBook Pro will be powered by a faster Kaby Lake Intel processor while the upgraded 12-inch MacBook will also come with a faster Intel chip. A 13-inch MacBook Air is also tipped to get with a new processor. iPad Pro 10.5 Apple is expected to announce a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, with edge-to-edge display. It will have small bezels especially on the top and bottom. The tablet is said to replace the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Siri powered smart speaker In a bid to compete with Google Home and Amazon Echo, Apple is expected to announce a Siri-powered smart speaker but it will not ship the device until later in the year. The smart speaker is tipped to come without a touchscreen and will use Siri, the voice assistant software on the iPhone and Mac. It will come with Apple Music integration and function as a HomeKit hub. The smart speaker will have a superior sound quality due to a virtual surround sound technology. Mac Pro Apple is rumored to be working on a new Mac Pro desktop computer which has not received an update since 2013. The Mac Pro is expected to sport powerful specs and a modular design. It is said to come with a separate pro display however, the fully redesigned model is not expected to be released this year. Updates for iOS 11/macOS/watchOS/tvOS This year it is Apple’s 10th anniversary, Apple might offer a sneak peek at iOS 11 with improved Apple Music, Siri, Maps and other core apps. Meanwhile, macOS, watchOS and tvOS are expected to get big refreshes. Apple will offer live stream on Apple Developer website and on the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV starting from the keynote on June 5th and it would probably start at 10.00 AM PDT (10:30 PM IST).

An instant-on PC. The idea for such a thing has been around for quite a while; it was at least a decade ago, maybe more, when I first heard of the concept, which was always bandied about when some new experimental types of memory had been invented that were non-volatile (I recall something about phase change and plastics. Yeah, crazy experimental!). This means the system could shut down and power off but everything in memory remained and was instantly available at boot, allowing the system to effectively pick up where it left off without reloading everything from a mass storage device again. None of them appear to have made it out of the research labs though, until now. While we’re still not anywhere near the instant-on dream just yet, Intel and Micron are beginning to roll out a completely new type of memory (the first since about 1966) that will redefine the memory hierarchy in computer systems. Called 3D XPoint (pronounced ‘cross point’) this new type of memory behaves somewhere between DRAM (as in DDR4 etc) and NAND (as in SSDs). This is because 3D XPoint is almost as responsive as DRAM with low latencies, but is non-volatile like NAND - and has capacities near NAND too. This has led Intel to release 3D XPoint products under its new Optane brand name that are focused on caching and acting as an intermediary in the memory/storage hierarchy between your SSD/HDD and RAM to speed up read/write characteristics of those mass storage devices. In essence treating it like they did SSDs to HDDs when those were just coming to market back in the day, and weren’t yet capacious enough to be used as a storage device all by themselves. 3D Xpoint and Optane products may still yet get to SSD capacities, and if they do we’ll see another leap forward in mass storage bandwidth and latencies, just as SSDs have done over HDDs over the past decade. It is an order of magnitude faster. Intel has released a server-only Optane product that’s much like a PCIe card-based NVMe SSD, but powered by 3D XPoint. It’s already blowing away server metrics and benchmarks at low queue depths (where everyone, even servers, mostly operate at), something NAND isn’t as good at as it needs to exploit the parallelism of a high queue depth to reach the peaks quoted in spec sheets. Intel is even exploring putting 3D XPoint onto memory DIMMs for servers to use directly via their memory slots, enlarging memory capacities and adding the safety net of a non-volatile memory sub system. It will be a long time before Intel and Micron fully ramp up 3D XPoint production, but as they do it will be interesting to see how the PC landscape adapts to this new memory/storage tier. Will it replace SSDs or DRAM? Or simply become yet another tier of memory/storage and will become as common place in systems as DRAM and SSDs/HDDs? Only time will tell. I can’t wait! We hope to have a review of one of these new consumer-level Optane products soon. Stay tuned. Related Articles Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles, and the difference between conflict ...

Image Credit: IBM IBM Research and partners GlobalFoundries and Samsung have created transistors for a 5-nanometer semiconductor chip. It’s a remarkable technical achievement, though a commercial version of the chip may not be possible for a while. Still, it should enable chips with 30 billion transistors, the on-off switches of electronic devices, on a fingernail-sized chip. Researchers say this kind of achievement should enable the $330 billion chip industry to stay on the path of Moore’s Law, or the prediction made in 1965 by Intel chairman emeritus Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a chip would double every couple of years. IBM is presenting details of its research on its “silicon nanosheet transistors” at the 2017 Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits conference in Kyoto, Japan. The development comes less than two years after IBM researchers made a 7-nanometer test node chip with 20 billion transistors. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and a 5-nanometer device is just a few atoms thick.) Right now, the most advanced semiconductor chips use a FinFET process with circuitry that is 10 nanometers in width. Companies such as Intel can build chips with 10 or 15 billion transistors using that process. A 5-nanometer chip could perform about 40 percent faster than a 10-nanometer chip, given the same power settings, said Mukesh Khare, vice president of semiconductor technology research at IBM Research, in an interview with VentureBeat. Or a chip could be 75 percent more power efficient. “This is a major innovation for scaling beyond 7 nanometers,” Khare said. “It’s an innovation in design and how you pack more and more transistors together. This transistor structure will enable a path to true five nanometers.” Above: A close-up of IBM’s 5-nanometer transistors. The circuits are 5 billionths of a meter apart. Image Credit: IBM IBM said the resulting increase in performance will accelerate cognitive computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other data-intensive applications delivered in the cloud. The power savings could also mean that the batteries in smartphones and other mobile products could last two to three times longer than today’s devices before needing to be charged. Scientists working as part of the IBM-led Research Alliance at the SUNY Polytechnic Institute Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering’s NanoTech Complex in Albany, N.Y. achieved the breakthrough by using stacks of silicon nanosheets for the transistor, instead of using the standard FinFET architecture, which is the blueprint for the semiconductor industry up through 7 nanometers. IBM also said the improvement provides a significant boost in terms of meeting the future demands of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and virtual reality and mobile devices. Nanosheets represent a new direction, but Khare said IBM Research has been exploring the technology for more than 10 years. This work is the first time that stacked nanosheet devices have shown advantages in electrical properties over the prevailing FinFET architecture. With this technology, Khare believes that the industry can stay on its path of progress every two or three years. Above: IBM’s 5-nanometer manufacturing equipment. Image Credit: IBM “The work is to continue to push and innovate so we can be on par or better than Moore’s Law,” said Khare. “This shows with the right investment one could continue to push semiconductor technology. This is how 5 nanometers can be put together.” The transistors are built with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is used to stencil the circuit designs on chips. With EUV lithography, the width of the nanosheets can be adjusted continuously, all within a single manufacturing process or chip design. One of the achievements of the technology is that it can be built using the same manufacturing steps and processes used in 10-nanometer manufacturing. The flexibility of nanosheets permits the fine-tuning of performance and power for specific circuits — something not possible with today’s FinFET transistor architecture, which is limited by its current-carrying fin height. Therefore, while FinFET chips can scale to 5 nanometers, simply reducing the amount of space between fins does not provide increased current flow for additional performance. IBM said three years ago that it would invest $3 billion over five years in chip research and development, and this is one of the results of that commitment. IBM Research has more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs. Above: IBM’s 5-nanometer production equipment.

The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy, a Washington-based non-profit think-tank, said. It said the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 per cent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research from government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said. "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were: Cognizant (3,949) Infosys (2,376) TCS (2,040) Accenture (1,889) IBM (1,608) Wipro (1,474) Amazon (1,416) Tech Mahindra (1,228) CapGemini (1,164) Microsoft (1,145) HCL America (1,041) Intel (1,030) Deloitte (985) Google (924) Larsen &Toubro (870) PricewaterhouseCoopers (713) Ernst & Young (649) Apple (631) Syntel (583) Facebook (472) Oracle (427) Cisco (380) Mindtree (327) Goldman Sachs (287) UST Global (283) JPMorganChase (271) IGATE (255) Stanford (221) Yahoo! (206) KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent -- a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020…and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. "That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work long term in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on high-skilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson. "The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.  Photograph: David Ryder/Reuters.

HTC Vive was used to demo an ILM experience running on Unreal Engine. This was made possible through a newly announced external GPU, which is being positioned as a developer kit housing an AMD Radeon RX 580 and a USB-C hub. This is big news for the HTC Vive team as it also just partnered recently with Google on the search giant's standalone VR initiative. "Vive is driving the VR industry forward, and in just the last month alone, we have partnered with the world's most prominent and innovative tech giants including Google, Intel and Apple, who are aligning their VR efforts around Vive," said HTC Vive on its official blog. There was no mention of Oculus at WWDC, but it's worth noting that Steam VR apps are playable on Rift. Aside from virtual reality, Apple also announced its intent to take augmented reality seriously with its new ARKit tool on iOS, which Apple boasted is now the "largest AR platform in the world." Hundreds of millions of iPhones will support ARKit, which Apple said offers "fast and stable motion tracking" that enhances AR capabilities by making objects appear as if they're really there as opposed to floating in space. During WWDC, the company showed how ARKit can map a flat surface of a table and place a teacup on it in the virtual world. Peter Jackson's studio Wingnut AR then showed off a more complicated demo of a landscape built on Unreal Engine (ARKit also supports Unity and SceneKit). The Wingnut AR demo will be made available later this year, as will iOS 11 with a slew of improvements. Of course, it's worth noting that Google already offers AR with its Tango technology, but that's only available on a small number of Android devices. Apple's conference was more than two hours long and covered new hardware configurations for Mac, Macbook and iPad, as well as a brand-new line in the vein of Amazon Echo, called HomePod, but the more significant announcement on the games development front is that the company also now supports in-app purchases right from the App Store description page. Apple announced that the redesigned App Store in iOS 11 would give games a larger video focus, enabling users to watch Let's Play videos in-app, as well as videos from developers and editors. Along with the ability to make in-app purchases without having to go into a game's menu, developers should benefit from these changes to improve discovery and more effectively communicate with the vast installed base iOS provides.

The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy - a Washington-based non-profit thin-tank said. It said the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. TCS According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 percent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. Wipro For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. Infosys For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research on government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said.   Trump impact "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Top companies Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Manufacturing companies Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. Unemployment rate in US National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent - a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. Jobs in IT According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicates there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020...and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. "That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. Salary The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said.The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. H-1B Visa Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on high-skilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson. "The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.

Before making the announcements, Cook said that this year “it is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever.” Amazon’s video app He announced that Amazon’s video app will come to Apple’s TV streaming box later this year. The app will let users stream all the Amazon original hits. Soon after the announcement Amazon tweeted, “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year.” Watch OS4 Apple also announced that watchOS 4, the next version of its smartwatch platform, will be arriving in September. It includes new features for watchfaces, such as complications updating based on time of day or location and a new Siri-based watchface. The Siri watchface uses machine learning to determine what information is most useful to you at a given point in time. Other new watchfaces include a kaleidoscope and new characters such as Woody, Jesse, and Buzz from the Toy Story movie franchise. WatchOS 4 will also bring updates to the watch’s fitness tracking, including a new user interface for the workout app and new integrations with gym equipment manufacturers. Apple said that watch wearers will be able to link their devices with the gym equipment through NFC. MacOS Next up in tech is Apple’s new version of macOS is called High Sierra which is launched with new Safari browser. Apple said that it is the fastest browser ever with features like autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention that uses machine learning to block irritating content. Apple also brought file system and virtual reality (VR) to High Sierra. The tech titan also announced updates to its entire MacBook line giving its laptops more powerful specifications in the form of the latest Intel chips. MacBook Pros will be shipped with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. The company also launched a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299. The newly updated MacBook laptops are now available. Apple also showed a sneak peek into a new all-in-one desktop called the iMac Pro. Called as “the most powerful Mac ever, the new product will be available from December starting at $4,999. The new machine will come with an 8-core Xeon processor, with configurations that scale up to an 18-core Xeon processor and an all-new AMD Radeon Vega graphics GPU, up to 16GB of VRAM and up to 4TB for SSD storage. iOS11 Cook also launched iOS 11 with over 10 new features. He said that iOS 10 had nearly 96 per cent satisfaction with 86 per cent iPhone users installing the update as compared to only seven per cent Android users who installed Android Nougat – the latest version of Google’s operating system. The new iOS will now synchronize messages across iOS and macOS automatically. If a user erases a message on your iPhone or iPad, that will be reflected on the Mac as well. Improved Siri Apple also made improvements to Siri including making the assistant’s voice sound more natural when responding to users. Siri will now be able to perform translations in various languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Eight years later, the technology giant is struggling to find its voice in AI. Analysts say the question of whether Apple can succeed in building great artificial intelligence products is as fundamental to the company's next decade as the iPhone was to its previous one. But the tech giant faces a formidable dilemma because the nature of artificial intelligence pushes Apple far out of its comfort zone in sleekly-designed hardware and services.   AI programming demands a level of data collection and mining that is at odds with Apple's rigorous approach to privacy, as well as its positioning as a company that doesn't profile consumers. Moreover, Apple's longstanding penchant for secrecy has made the company less desirable in the eyes of potential star recruits, who hail from the country's top computer science departments and are attracted to companies that publish research. WWDC 2017: Apple Launches 10.5-Inch iPad Pro and Refreshes 12.9-Inch Model; India Launch Later This Month "Artificial intelligence is not in Apple's DNA," said venture capitalist and Apple analyst Steve Munster. "They understand that in the future, every company is going to become an AI company, and they are in a particularly tough spot." At Apple's annual developer's conference on Monday - the same event where Jobs introduced Siri - the company's efforts to become an AI powerhouse were on display as executives launched a new standalone smart speaker and touted features meant to boost Siri's chops and to power AI applications on Apple products. "Machine learning" - an AI buzzword that describes a form of ultra-fast, complex computer data analysis and statistical modeling - was repeated throughout the 2.5 hour presentation, delivered to an audience of roughly 6,000 developers here. Siri will now use machine learning to predict the times of a morning commute - or scan the travel news as you are reading it on the company's Safari browser and then suggest related activities, such as booking a reservation. She will use machine learning to talk with you and help you sort through music through a new $349 home automation device, HomePod. She will automatically organise your photos into albums, like "2nd Anniversary," without you giving her any context about the pictures. There was even a new software toolkit, CoreML, that will allow for faster processing of large amounts of data collected during machine learning applications. (It's six times faster than Google's rival AI processor, an executive quipped). WWDC 2017: New iMac Models With Intel Kaby Lake Announced; iMac Pro Unveiled But Monday's announcements come as other technology companies have released similar innovations and have already spent billions on the burgeoning AI arms race. Many are placing their bets on artificial intelligence, ranging from software that one day may be smart enough to chat back and forth like a human, or computer vision that identifies real-world objects so well it can power the first fully-functioning self-driving car. That has put Apple in the disadvantaged position of trying to lead in an area where it has fallen behind - and where the effort cuts against the core aspects of the company's secretive culture. "This is a substantial shift for Apple," said Daniel Gross, a former executive who focused on artificial intelligence. "The internal focus is on building great products, not publishing papers." Ten years after launching the iPhone, Apple is on the hunt for another blockbuster product that can take its place. Sales of the iPhone propelled Apple to become the most valuable company in the world and still account for more than half of the company's revenues, which were $215.6 billion in 2016. But last year, purchases of the company's iconic smartphone dropped for the first time, suggesting that the market for high-end smartphones is finally saturated. Apple Unveils App Store Redesign with Today, Apps, and Game Tabs at WWDC 2017 "The difference between last year's iPhone and this year's iPhone is going to be much smaller than the difference between the first and second iterations of the iPhone. ... So that s-curve is starting to flatten out," said Benedict Evans, a mobile expert and partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, using an industry term for exponential increases in innovation. "Then you have the next transformative technology, that isn't here yet." Apple did not respond to repeated requests for interviews and comment. Apple's launch of HomePod, which will go for sale for $349 later this year, comes several years after Amazon and Google released their own automation devices, the Echo and the Google Home, which send consumers' spoken queries back to their servers in California for analysis. Google, Tesla, Uber, and others have been testing self-driving vehicles on public roadways for several years; Apple received its first permit to begin testing just two months ago. Before Monday's updates, the Siri assistant was still mostly a glorified web search that could tell the occasional pre-programmed joke. Now Apple is racing to catch up. Last October, the company hired Russ Salakhutdinov, a Carnegie Mellon professor whose expertise is in an area of artificial intelligence known as "deep" or "unsupervised" learning, a complex branch of machine learning in which computers are trained to replicate the way the brain's neurons fire when they recognize objects or speech. Salakhutdinov is a protege of Geoffrey Hinton, perhaps the world's top researcher in this area. Like Salakhutdinov, who divides his time between Carnegie Mellon and Apple, Hinton divides his time between Google and the University of Toronto. Building ties to academic superstars not only helps to improve products, but becomes a key recruiting tool, said Richard Zemel, director of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a professor specializing in machine learning at the University of Toronto. "You used to not see people with Apple name badges at conferences, and now you do," Zemel said. In December, Apple presented and published its first academic paper in artificial intelligence at an industry conference. Another paper has been accepted to a prestigious computer vision conference and will be published in July, Salakhutdinov said in an interview. Salakhutdinov said he was not authorized to discuss his work at Apple in any detail. Zemel, who told Bloomberg two years ago that Apple was "off the scale" in terms of secrecy, and that such secrecy was keeping them out of loop on major developments in the field, now said that the Cupertino giant was "making some changes." "But it's going to take some work," he added. Researchers at elite universities said in interviews that Apple was still not the top choice for their computer science graduates - Google, Facebook, and Amazon were by far the top picks - but that the company was moving up in the rankings. Apple's forays into AI have also been slower than its peers because it's been reluctant to embrace the data-mining practices of rivals Google and Facebook, experts said. The company has spent considerable resources building additional layers of privacy when it did so. Unlike Google and Facebook, which are primarily advertising companies that collect massive amounts of intimate data to profile their users, Apple believes in limiting the amount of user data it collects. At a previous developer's conference, executives bragged that the company did not build user profiles. Tim Cook has positioned the company as the anti-Google. But that stance against data collection becomes a problem if you are building artificial intelligence, researchers say. A home device must collect and analyze people's speech in order to improve the way the device can speak to humans, for example. For Siri to be smart, she needs to collect and interpret data from other applications, such as your calendar, your restaurant reservations, and, now, your browsing. Last year, as Apple began to embrace artificial intelligence on the iPhone, the company undertook a large privacy protection project. The project took an academic concept called differential privacy and applied it to AI applications on the iPhone. Differential privacy works by inserting noise - or bad information - into good data in order to confuse outsiders who might try to hone in on an individual's records. For example, in order for Apple software to group the photos of your dog into a single album, it needs to collect many photos of your dogs. Apple collects those images, but not before encrypting the data in them and then scrambling that data with other data, so that if anyone tried to recover the original data set they wouldn't know what was tied to a single user, the company claims. This technique is considered a stronger privacy protection than other methods, such as using mathematical formulas to render user profiles anonymous. Apple's focus on privacy may have slowed the company down in terms of building some products, Gross said, but the trade-off would be consumer trust. "Apple is dousing itself with an extra piece of really hard science, and doing so to try and preserve your privacy," he said. "I think Google and Facebook will have to answer to world where a similar product that is offered is more privacy-preserving." Munster pointed out that no tech company has a huge lead on artificial intelligence yet. "The bad news is that Apple is behind," he said. "The good news is that if we look at how AI is going to impact the world, it's still early days - there is plenty of time to catch up." © 2017 The Washington Post We discussed everything Apple announced at WWDC 2017 on Orbital, our weekly technology podcast.

Grace White, KHOU 11:15 PM. CDT June 05, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST HOUSTON - After the weekend terror attack in London, a former FBI agent in Houston says there are things you can do to protect yourself while traveling this summer. "I don't tell people not to travel," says James Conway, Global Intel Strategies. He tells people three things. First, do your research. "Many other embassies in other countries aren't as politically correct as us, they're going to be a little more candid about what the threat maybe," he said. Second, don't be a target. "Terrorists go after symbols, you saw the Ariana concert in London, that's a perfect symbol of western civilization," said Conway. Third, if you run into trouble have a plan. "When you go somewhere, think ahead of time. If something goes wrong here, what am I going to do?" he said. In it's latest travel warning for Europe, the U.S. State Department calls on citizens to keep their eyes open. Especially, during the upcoming summer travel season when large crowds may be common. Conway says it's the world we're living in and it's your job to be prepared.

WASHINGTON: Top seven India-based outsourcing companies in the US received fewer H-1B visas in 2016 as compared to 2015, and as a group their numbers dropped 37 per cent, according to a new report. The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy - a Washington-based non-profit think-tank said. It said, the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services+ (TCS) declined by 56 per cent in FY 2016 compared to FY 2015, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys+ , it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research from government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said. "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas+ , which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent - a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020 ... and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about $7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work long term in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on high-skilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson.

But the winning didn't stop for AMD with the iMac Pro, as AMD's new Radeon Pro 500 series graphics cards have made it into Apple's newly announced MacBook Pro refresh.     The new Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB of VRAM powers the highest-end MacBook Pro, which has been upgraded with Intel's new Kaby Lake CPU architecture, over the Skylake architecture used in the 2016 MBP. The new 2017 MBP rocks the Core i7-7700HQ, 16GB of LPDDR3-2133 RAM, a 256GB PCIe-based SSD, and a whopping 4 x Thunderbolt 3 ports. We also have a bigger battery, with 76 Wh on offer, over the older 2016 MBP 15-inch model with its 54.5 Wh battery.   There will be the option of the Radeon Pro 555 and Radeon Pro 560, both based on the Polaris 11 GPU.   Apple's new MacBook Pro configured with the Core i7 and AMD Radeon Pro 555 2GB will cost $2999, and they're available right now on Apple's website, and will be in your local Apple Store on June 7.

File photo Top seven India-based outsourcing companies in the US received fewer H-1B visas in 2016 as compared to 2015, and as a group their numbers dropped 37 per cent, according to a new report. The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to previous year, a report by the National Foundation for American Policy – a Washington-based non-profit think-tank said. It said, the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven Indian-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 per cent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research from government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for Indian-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said. "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to Indian-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent – a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020…and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. "That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on highskilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson. "The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.

Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo! (206) and KPMG (198). An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.org, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicate there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020 and there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump Administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labor database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when an H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. "That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labor mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on highskilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson. "The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.

Four of the five most respected publicly traded companies in the United States are West Coast technology disrupters, with Berkshire Hathaway -- a predominantly old-economy conglomerate -- as the lone non-technology firm among the leaders, according to Barron's 2017 ranking of 100 U.S.-based companies based on a survey of money managers. Barron's 100: The most respected companies of 2017 No. 1 is Alphabet, parent of Google, the search-engine behemoth that dominates global advertising. Serial inventor Apple, is No. 2, followed by online retail giant Amazon.com (its CEO Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post) at No. 3. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is No. 4. No. 5 is Microsoft, the tech grand-daddy whose stock has soared under the leadership of chief executive Satya Nadella after sputtering for more than a decade. Why the love for technology? Pretty simple, says David Kass, finance professor at the University of Maryland. "That is where there is growth," he said, "in the economy, in earnings per share, in revenue." Look at the share prices: Alphabet is up 36 percent in the past 12 months and 27 percent so far in 2017 -- with its share price surging above $1,000 Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which reflects the performance of the 500 largest U.S. public companies, is up 17 percent over the past 12 months and 7 percent this year. Apple is up 57 percent the last year and 33 percent year to date. Amazon -- whose stock passed $1,000 a share Friday -- is swimming in the same pools. Its share price has increased 39 percent in the past 12 months and 35 percent so far this year. "The economy by contrast is only growing at 2 percent," Kass said, "but these companies are outpacing virtually all other industries in revenue and profit growth, and share price is following along." The lone Oregon company on the list, Nike, came in No. 22. Intel, which is based in California but runs its largest and most advanced operations in Washington County, was No. 21.  The Barron's survey is not scientific and has no bearing on the companies. The weekly financial magazine says it polled America's money managers over six weeks to gauge their attitudes on the 100 largest publicly held companies in the S&P 500 index. The participants were asked to select one statement reflecting their opinion: highly respect, respect, respect somewhat and don't respect. In addition to technology, the money managers like shopping (Costco Wholesale, No. 6), home repairs ( Home Depot, 8; Lowe's, 14) and entertainment (Walt Disney, 10; Netflix, 15). Dropping from the top spot to No. 7 was health-care giant Johnson & Johnson, which often graces "best of" lists when it comes to management. Johnson & Johnson is one of only two Triple-A-rated companies left in the United States. The other blue-chip blessed with the rarified Triple-A rating -- which primarily measures the quality of a firm's bonds -- is Microsoft. Oil giant Exxon, which dropped from 29 to 41, and lost its membership in the exclusive AAA club a year ago after Standard and Poor's downgraded its rating in the wake of tumbling oil prices. This is the first year that Barron's has included only U.S. companies in its list. "While the survey doesn't address stock-price performance, many highly respected companies trade at a lofty premium," according to Barron's. And some don't. General Electric, the 125-year-old conglomerate, dropped from 39 to 68 as it has seen its stock price languish. Coca-Cola dropped from 34 to 66 as the Atlanta beverage giant continues to diversify beyond its carbonated-based core business. Meanwhile, rival PepiCo rose to 23 from 28 last year, mostly on the back of its robust Frito-Lay profits. Some familiar names may have been hurt by scandal. General Motors, which has weathered a costly ignition-switch scandal, ranked 88 of 100. The flaw killed at least 124 people and injured another 275 in small cars made by the old, pre-bankruptcy GM, such as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion. One rank below it, at 89, is Twenty-First Century Fox, parent of Fox News. The company has incurred tens of millions in costs related to potential litigation and settlements in the aftermath of sexual harassment allegations against top-rated news personality Bill O'Reilly, who was ousted in April, and the late Roger Ailes, the disgraced chairman of Fox News who left last summer. The biggest loser this year is Wells Fargo, the San Francisco financial giant which  held the No. 7 spot as recently as 2015 but this year turned up dead last. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns $25 billion of Wells Fargo shares, at his annual meeting last month rebuked the bank's handling of widespread illegal sales practices that spanned at least 15 years and included targeting undocumented immigrants to open new bank accounts. Buffett said the San Francisco banking giant's executives failed to act immediately after finding out that employees were creating countless fake and fraudulent bank accounts to meet the company's unrealistic sales goals. Wells Fargo "incentivized the wrong type of behavior," the 86-year-old billionaire said. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said "our top priority is to rebuild trust in our company, and we have taken decisive actions to fix the problems, make things right for customers, and build a better Wells Fargo. Our actions include eliminating product sales goals for retail bank team members, emphasizing customer experience, and strengthening ethics and risk management throughout the company." Wells Fargo's score was so low that the company displaced tobacco giants Altria Group and Philip Morris International, who keep pounding out profits even as states and municipalities pile on tobacco taxes. The image of tobacco companies making products that are dangerous to people's health may actually have created opportunities for investors willing to trade in the shares. "In the recent years, tobacco stocks have actually outperformed the S&P 500 because many investors avoid them," Kass said. "Some mutual funds perhaps are prohibited from investing in them. It creates a reduction in demand and lower share price. That in turn is an opportunity for investors to actually do reasonably well." -- The Washington Post View Comments About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

The iMac Pro takes Apple's 5K iMac chassis and crams it full of workstation-class hardware. CPU duties will be handled by what sounds like eight-core, 10-core, and even 18-core versions of Intel's presumably upcoming Skylake Xeons. Graphics power will come courtesy of AMD's Radeon Vega graphics chip with up to 16GB of VRAM on board. The truly insatiable will be able to add 128GB of ECC RAM and 4TB of PCIe SSD storage to their iMac Pros, as well. All that computing power needs copious interconnect bandwidth to communicate with the outside world, and Apple is delivering with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a built-in 10Gb Ethernet NIC. The machine will be VESA-mountable, and its space gray finish won't stand out in the subdued lighting of directors' editing bays. Apple will be introducing the iMac Pro in December with an eight-core Xeon, unspecified Vega graphics hardware, 32GB of ECC RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $4999.

His name was never mentioned Monday. But his presence loomed inside the Naylor Stone media room at the Mal Moore Athletic Facility. That was especially true when Brad Bohannon, his successor as Alabama's baseball coach, delivered his opening comments at his introductory news conference. "My goal going forward is to make Alabama the absolute best place to play college baseball in the country, and we have everything we need in place to make that happen," Bohannon said Monday. "We're going to do that by being a players-first program." It was a telling comment sandwiched between a series of remarks that coalesced into a renunciation of Goff and his methods. In short order, Bohannon presented himself as the antithesis of Goff -- his predecessor who was fired May 24 following his inaugural season, in part, because of his heavy-handed approach and his intractability. As the Crimson Tide was sliding into the abyss on way to finishing dead last in the Southeastern Conference and posting the lowest win total at Alabama since 1980, Goff tried to impose his aggressive style on a team that was reluctant to embrace him while at the same time failing to curry favor with a fan base that always approached him with a measure of skepticism. Don't expect that to happen under Bohannon. "Early on, we're going to coach to our personnel," he said. "I think it's important initially for me and our coaching staff to adjust to our players. Over time we're going to strive to be balanced." Bohannon sold his vision to Greg Byrne last Monday at the Alabama athletic director's home. The former Wake Forest MBA student and senior financial analyst at Intel Corporation used a PowerPoint presentation to illustrate his plan for resuscitating a program that has fallen on hard times. In doing so, he clearly demonstrated he wasn't anything like Goff. "He hit it all: academic, compliance, coaching, recruiting, alums, community, everything," Byrne recalled. "All the bases. He hit a grand slam, to use a baseball analogy." Before bringing Bohannon aboard, Byrne did his own reconnaissance. He wanted to find out more about the longtime assistant who has spent 14 years in the Southeastern Conference -- having worked the first 12 at Kentucky and the last two at Auburn. So, Byrne resorted to a bit of guile, instructing Alabama's associate athletic director for compliance, Matt Self, to use a blocked number and call players whom Bohannon had previously coached. Byrne was eager to hear from a wide variety of Bohannon's pupils -- the stars, the reserves and even the guys who never saw any action. The wide array of perspectives would create an accurate summation of the man Byrne was looking to hire. Self immediately took on the roll of pollster and went to work on his survey -- asking the pool of subjects how Bohannon had treated them and whether they thought he played by the rules and supported their efforts in the classroom.  "On top of that, the last question...is: 'If you had to do it all over again, would you want to play for Coach Bohannon?'" Byrne said. "And without a doubt, 100 percent of the young men that he talked to said, 'I'd absolutely play for Coach Bohannon again.' "And I knew with that, that was the kind of coach we wanted here at the University of Alabama." Byrne viewed Bohannon's ability to build relationships with all kinds of people -- from high school prospects and alumni to his wife, Kim -- as a desirable quality. And for Bohannon, it may be his greatest asset, because in the college baseball world he is known as an ace recruiter -- having landed Top 25 classes the last nine seasons. "Good players make good coaches," Bohannon said. "Kids want to play for coaches that they think can help them develop as people and players, and people they have a connection with. And if you really want to connect with people, you have to communicate." It became clear that Goff struggled -- or was often unwilling -- to do just that. He wanted it his way, and in the most draconian sense, he demanded absolute fealty to his system. The more mild-mannered Bohannon is going to tackle the same job in a different way. "You have to care," he said. "I really do want to get to know the kids because this job is all about getting the right people on the front end." Seconds later, Bohannon's first news conference as Alabama's baseball coach ended. The page had officially been turned from the Goff Era. And it was welcomed. After all, Bohannon represents a clean break from a tumultuous period Byrne and Co. would just as soon forget.

The event started with Apple CEO welcoming the audience at the 15th WWDC in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley where Apple is building its new campus. Before making the announcements, Cook said that this year “it is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever.” Cook also praised the Apple developer community which has 16 million registered developers and added three million last year. He announced that Amazon’s video app will come to Apple’s TV streaming box later this year. The app will let users stream all the Amazon original hits. Soon after the announcement, Amazon tweeted, “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year.” Apple also announced that watchOS 4, the next version of its smartwatch platform, will be arriving in September. It includes new features for watch faces, such as complications updating based on time of day or location and a new Siri-based watch face. The Siri watch face uses machine learning to determine what information is most useful to you at a given point in time. Other new watch faces include a kaleidoscope and new characters such as Woody, Jesse, and Buzz from the Toy Story movie franchise. WatchOS 4 will also bring updates to the watch’s fitness tracking, including a new user interface for the workout app and new integrations with gym equipment manufacturers. Apple said that watch wearers will be able to link their devices with the gym equipment through NFC. Next up in tech is Apple’s new version of macOS is called High Sierra which is launched with new Safari browser. Apple said that it is the fastest browser ever with features like autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention that uses machine learning to block irritating content. Apple also brought file system and virtual reality (VR) to High Sierra. The tech titan also announced updates to its entire MacBook line giving its laptops more powerful specifications in the form of the latest Intel chips. MacBook Pros will be shipped with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. The company also launched a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299. The newly updated MacBook laptops are now available. Apple also showed a sneak peek into a new all-in-one desktop called the iMac Pro. Called as “the most powerful Mac ever, the new product will be available from December starting at $4,999. The new machine will come with an 8-core Xeon processor, with configurations that scale up to an 18-core Xeon processor and an all-new AMD Radeon Vega graphics GPU, up to 16 GB of VRAM and up to 4 TB for SSD storage. Cook also launched iOS 11 with over 10 new features. He said that iOS 10 had nearly 96 per cent satisfaction with 86 per cent iPhone users installing the update as compared to only seven per cent Android users who installed Android Nougat – the latest version of Google’s operating system. The new iOS will now synchronise messages across iOS and macOS automatically. If a user erases a message on your iPhone or iPad, that will be reflected on the Mac as well. Apple also made improvements to Siri including making the assistant’s voice sound more natural when responding to users. Siri will now be able to perform translations in various languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Laptops by Lori Grunin 6 June 2017 5:50 am AEST @LoriGrunin Apple unveils iMac Pro at WWDC Apple reveals its new high-end iMac Pro workstation. The new machine will be $4,999 and available in December. 2:29 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF For WWDC 2017, Apple headed south to San Jose, dogged by damning comparisons with Google, Facebook and Microsoft over its lack of attention to mixed reality (VR and AR), Siri's absence from your smart home in comparison with smart home hubs like the Google Home  and Amazon Echo and other ways in which Apple seems to have fallen behind. Folks were eager to hear about Apple's plans to catch up in these leading-edge markets. 49 Apple's biggest WWDC announcements Even before the conference opening, we began to hear the numbers: iOS app developers earned $20 billion in 2016 (and given Apple's 30 percent cut, that means it made a not-so-paltry $6 billion) and downloads are growing at a nice pace. The company updated its Swift Playgrounds, a teach-kids-to-code-Swift (its proprietary programming language) app, to support control over robots and drones. The keynote began with a video showing how the world would fall apart if we didn't have our iOS apps and the safe and sane App Store. And in a random announcement, we see a small step for Amazon, a huge leap for Apple TV owners: you're getting an Amazon Video app.  And of course, all the inteligence is driven by enhanced Apple AI technology. Later in the conference, Michelle Obama will be talking empowerment. Apple's HomePod is a smart speaker for your home Apple wants the new Siri-powered device to be the center of your home. It will cost $349 and will be available starting in December. by Scott Stein 1:00 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF HomePod Interestingly, Apple positioned its new home speaker as a music experience rather than just the rumored a smart-home hub, ostensibly to "reinvent home music." You can't get it until later in 2017, though. Dubbed the HomePod, it has better audio specs than other hub speakers -- pretty good audio specs in general for its size -- and an A8 chip for processing (the same chip that's in the iPhone). It uses a wide-array mic that supposedly can hear you over the music, and naturally integrates with Apple Music and can control HomeKit devices. It will ship in December for $350.  16 Say hello to Apple's HomePod smart speaker iOS 11 and apps The latest update of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11, has some notable new features: Interface: A redesigned app drawer with horizontal scrolling as well as a redesigned control center with more 3D Touch operations. The lockscreen can show all notifications,  iMessages: Automatic message synchronization across devices via iCloud. Apple Pay: Now it supports person-to-person payments across all iOS devices and works with iMessages. Siri: She's got a more natural-sounding voice and can translate for you and suggest tasks. Plus there's a new more visual interface. And she knows you across your devices. But she'll respect your privacy. Camera: New H.265 video encoding for more efficient storage and a new High Efficiency Image Format based on H.265 to replace JPEG. Threre's a new depth API (needed for AR). It will enable the faux defocus mode for portraits, too. Photos: Welcome editable Live Photos with GIF-like tools like looping and reversing, and a long-exposure effect. Memories now recognizes pets and supports vertical video. Apple Maps: Now with floor plans of the mall! Also lane guidance and a do-not-disturb mode that senses when a car is moving. AirPlay 2: Control multiroom speakers (with supported speakers), and Apple TV. Apple Music will show you your friends's suggested picks. Redesigned App Store with a games tab. And more, of course. Though not a feature, Apple also launched an augmented-reality programming interface, ARKit, so that developers can incorporate AR into apps. It demoed a better-looking Pokemon Go built using it. 29 Here are the iOS 11 features Apple announced at WWDC 2017  MacBooks and iMacs The iMacs get better displays, better storage options, an improved display and 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C connectors. Also, an update to Intel 7th-generation and the new integrated graphics, plus the Retina 4K incorporates the discrete RX500 series and the 5K model gives you Radeon RX500 series options. That puts them on par with Windows 10 all-in-ones. The 21.5-inch starts at $1,100 and the 5K 27-inch starts at $1,800. A 4K 21.5 inch starts at $1,300. A new iMac Pro will ship by the end of the year, the company's most powerful Mac ever. It has better cooling than a typical iMac, it ships with up to an 18-core Xeon, Radeon Vega graphics, up to 128GB of ECC memory and up to 4TB of SSD storage.  And it will start at $5,000 when it ships in December. The MacBooks are refreshed with 7th-generation Intel chips and better graphics, and the 13-inch without Touchbar gets a price drop to $1,300. The Air gets a brush-up. 13 The new iMac Pro is truly a beast iPad and iPad Pro Apple adds an iPad Pro model with a 10.5-inch display in the 9.7-inch body, thanks to smaller bezels. Both iPad Pros will get new displays, with True Tone, DCI-P3 gamut, 600-nit brightness and ultralow reflectivity. A new feature, Pro Motion, bumps the refresh rate to 120Hz. Latency drops to 20ms with the Apple Pencil. They're also faster, thanks to the 12-core GPU and six-core CPU Fusion A10X chip. A better camera with 4K and wide-gamut capture is another hardware highlight, along with USB-C fast charging. They both come with 64GB memory and start at $650 for the smaller and $800 for the larger model. They'll be available next week. There are more iPad-specific features in iOS 11. Swipe up to bring up the dock to switch apps or bring one up and drag-and-drop anything. A new Files app brings a more desktoplike file system operation that supports third-party storage providers. There's a special markup mode for use with the Pencil and it does handwriting recognition in Notes. MacOS High Sierra The MacOS desktop operating system didn't get a major update, as you can tell from the name, just some refinements. But a lot of the High Sierra refinements are performance-focused, which is always welcome. The big enhancements: Safari: It "helps give you a serene browsing experience." Whut? But now it's faster, with autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention to filter cross-site scripting and so on. Mail: Split view for the compose window, smaller storage footprint. Photos: New organization and editing tools, filter by keywords and file types, better face recognition, synchronization across devices. The editing tools can now synchronize with other editing tools. And there are new photo book partnerships. The file system: This has needed an update for a long time, and now the much more modern APFS is the default. Video: Support for hardware acceleration and a software encoder for H.265 video. Graphics: An update to its acceleration architecture, Metal 2, with a lot of performance increases. It also supports a new external enclosure for MacBooks, with Thunderbolt 3 and A Radeon RX 580. Metal 2 also adds hooks for VR. Want MacOS High Sierra and iOS 11 sooner rather than later? Sign up for the public betas. 10 MacOS High Sierra has some really cool new features WatchOS 4 New to WatchOS, Apple's watch operating system: New faces: A new Siri watch face and a new complication for showing notifications, a Kaleidoscope face based on your image and faces with "Toy Story" characters. Fitness: Monthly challenges in the Activity tracker; a new interface and new high-intensity workout in the Workout app, two-way data exchange with gym equipment, and more. Music: It integrates better with Apple Music to feed your favorites to the watch. A vertically scrolling interface. Native Bluetooth to connect to sensors. 25 Apple WatchOS 4 preview in pics It was one of the most fast-moving, packed 2.5-hour WWDC keynotes I've seen in a while. I'm exhausted. See you in a year.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → In the Year of iPad, Mac Not Forgotten  June 5, 2017June 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink This WWDC has two big winners: iPad software and Mac hardware. Yes, there’s that new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and yes, we’ll be running macOS High Sierra come this fall, but I think these two categories are the biggest stories to come out of the keynote. iOS 11 is finally giving iPad users the tools they need to get work done more efficiently and with more power. It all looks amazing, and I cannot wait to try it out. But I really want to talk about Mac hardware. Right off the bat, the entire notebook line got a bump. The MacBooks and MacBook Pros are now shipping with Kaby Lake Intel processors, but the latter is still capped at 16 GB of RAM. Everything got updated GPUs, and the entry-model MacBook Pro without Touch Bar now runs $1299. These moves signal that Apple is committed to the pro notebook, as the updates come just months after releasing these computers. I hope Apple keeps its foot on the gas here, and works to keep things updated more aggressively from here on out. The MacBook Air also got an update to the “newer processors,” but Apple didn’t even give the dead-man-walking notebook a “New” badge on its website. That’s just cold. Even colder? The Mac mini was not mentioned or upgraded. It is, however, still for sale. The iMac line got refreshed as well. Fusion Drives are now standard on all 27-inch configurations and the top-end 21.5-inch iMac. The updated, brighter displays are powered by new GPUs. All the systems — thanks with Kaby Lake processors — are noticeably faster than the ones they replace. Around back, the four USB A ports remain. The full IO list is now: Headphone SDXC card slot Four USB 3 (Type A) Two Thunderbolt 3 Gigabit Ethernet Then there’s the big story. The iMac Pro. Apple mentioned it was working on “pro configs” of the iMac, and when this think ships at the end of the year, I’d say they would have delivered. Donned in Space Gray, this iMac is just as thin as its Retina 5K sibling, but is all-new inside: 8, 10, or 18-Core Up to 128 GB EEC RAM Up to 4 TB SSD Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU Four USB 3 (Type A) ports Four Thunderbolt 3 ports 10Gb Ethernet Even its periphals are in Space Gray. It looks dope: A post shared by Ren Caldwell (@settern) on Jun 5, 2017 at 1:20pm PDT All of this is made possible by an all-new cooling system that has added those intake slots along the bottom part of the back case. I hope Apple’s learned their Mac Pro-shaped lesson about that sort of thing and that this thermal arrangement will allow for component updates down the road. (I did notice the lack of a RAM door in Serenity’s photo. I’m hoping that it is there on the finished product, but I think I’m going to be sad.) Update: Apple says the RAM is not user-replaceable. Starting at $4,999 when it goes on sale later this year, the iMac Pro is pushing the sometime-after-2017 Mac Pro to the fringe. We don’t know anything about that machine yet, but assuming it has expansion slots, that, multiple processor support and a freedom of display choice may be its biggest selling points.1 The iMac Pro’s price point also says something about the upcoming Mac Pro. Ouch. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Sponsor: Working Copy Your sourcecode, websites, and images on your tablet and phone, even when offline.

Win! X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Apple Refreshes The Entire MacBook Line Up, And I'm Pissed Alex Cranz Jun 6, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  kaby lake macbook wwdc wwdc 2017 Share Apple's big developer conference, WWDC, is usually not the place for hardware updates, but as Tim Cook said at the beginning of WWDC 2017, "This is the biggest WWDC ever." To that end, Apple announced upgrades to nearly every single product in its computer line up, and thoroughly screwed over every single person who bought a MacBook Pro back in November. Things started off nicely enough. Apple announced an update to the iMac, with discrete AMD graphics cards coming to every 4K iMac that are powerful enough to let you enjoy the HTC Vive VR headset. There were also additional Thunderbolt 3 ports and a processor improvement: The newest iMacs will run Kaby Lake. Intel's New Kaby Lake Processors: What You Need To Know Kaby Lake, Intel's latest processor family, wasn't supposed to exist. Earlier this year Intel announced the end of its well-known tick-tock release schedule, whereby it trots out a new processor every September. The tick is the shrinking and improvements of the current microarchitecture, while the tock is a whole new architecture. Instead last year's 'tock', Skylake, was going to hang around a while, with no new 'tick' in sight. Read more If you've heard Kaby Lake discussed in relation to Apple, it's because Apple has skipped Kaby Lake in the past. Notoriously when Apple refreshed its laptop line last year, for the first time in two years, it skipped out on Kaby Lake. Now it's updated every single laptop and desktop to Kaby Lake. This is a huge improvement for iMacs and the MacBook, but it's deeply deeply annoying for those of us who bought the newly redesigned MacBook Pro back in November. Particularly as these new Kaby Lake machines are cheaper as well. The only bright side, for early adopters, is that Kaby Lake mobile processors aren't always that much faster than Skylake processors — something Gizmodo learned when pitting the Skylake Macbook Pro against Kaby Lake machines from Razer and Dell. While these kind of processor refreshes are very common with other computer makers, Apple has always been very slow to embrace processor updates. In fact, it's long been part of the "Apple Tax" (alongside the higher price Apple computers demand). So, from an early adopter who hoped she had at least a year before you refreshed and made her device obsolete — goddammit! Sent from my 2016 MacBook Pro.

Reply 0 trembre @trembre Jun 6, 2017, 8:49am If you don't drink during the presentation then you won't get pissed. Reply 1 troels @troels Jun 6, 2017, 8:54am Seriously, it was pretty obvious at the launch of the last model that this was a likely scenario. You paid the early adopter tax. Also Kaby Lake is not a huge leap in performance but there are some other major benefits in power usage, native support for HEVC encoding and decoding for 4K videos and other graphics improvements. There will be less load on the CPU as a result. https://beebom.com/intel-kaby-lake-vs-skylake/ Plus of course you can finally now get 32GB of RAM. Welcome to 2016 Apple. Last edited June 6, 2017 8:56 am Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:15am Also, Kaby Lake wasn't fully available when the last MBP was launched, and everyone knew Kaby was coming, so if you bought then, and aren't a total, well, goose, then you would have known these were coming in the next year. Had they not been released with Kaby Lake at the conference, then the headlines would have been "Apple falls behind" or similar. The 32GB is welcome, and again, it was due to a lack of a suitable chipset in the previous model that they topped out at 16GB, everyone knew a 32GB model would be coming once Kaby Lake bumped in to a model refresh. I never understand people getting pissed off that they buy tech, and that 6 months later new tech comes out that is better. It is how it works. Reply 0 troels @troels Jun 6, 2017, 9:19am Actually its not clear now if there is a 32GB option on the new MBP. Different sites are reporting different things... Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 Jun 6, 2017, 2:25pm Love it when we DE-dramatise the writer i would be pissed if i got a 4k imac last month. Discrete graphics make a big difference Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:18am and thoroughly screwed over every single person who bought a MacBook Pro back in November November was 8 months ago, I don't see how releasing an update to a computer line 8 months later or even 6 months later is screwing anyone over. Reply 3 over30yearsofsharing @over30yearsofsharing Jun 6, 2017, 10:57am Please, its Apple 101 Reply 0 fenix @fenix Jun 6, 2017, 12:58pm You made my exact comment, yearly or every second yearly refreshes are common across the board now. We live in a time where you have to size up the market, and if the product you want is on the shelf or around the corner then buy it. Once you've made that purchase you can't whinge about the next model coming out in 6-8 months. Reply 2 okibi @okibi Jun 6, 2017, 9:41am Anyone want to buy a 2 month old MacBookPro? Last edited June 6, 2017 9:41 am Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 10:03am Sure, the new upgrades aren't all that important for most work. Reply 1 Johnny F Guest Jun 6, 2017, 10:00am Get over it. How sad that just because YOU personally purchased a laptop in November you want to stop progress and everyone else from benefiting until YOU feel it is time. Stop being so damn selfish and whingy. Reply 3 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 10:04am I'm hopeful the article is at least a bit tongue in cheek. Tone is tricky in print. Reply 1 Almost Guest Jun 7, 2017, 9:28am Perhaps the author is suggesting that Apple should make the timetable for the release of new hardware explicit so that s/he (Alex is a unisex name) can make a better informed decision? Reply 0 loquaciousdandy @loquaciousdandy Jun 6, 2017, 1:17pm Firstly, your laptop isn't any slower or less capapable today then it was yesterday. Secondly, looking at the recent update history for the MacBook pro, ignoring the abnormal 527 day stretch for the 2015 model, the MacBook pro has been updated on average every 268 days, which is just short of 9 months. Even including the 2015 model only takes that average up to 10 months. There is little reason to expect the MacBook Pro line would go "at least a year" without a refresh. Thirdly, you're obviously aware that Intel has a CPU rollout timeline. There was certainly commentary at the time that Apple released the 2016 MacBook Pro that they had gone with the older Skylake chips instead of Kaby Lake - in fact, you personally wrote a post about it! https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/10/why-are-apple-and-microsoft-using-such-old-processors-in-their-new-computers/ - so if this had really mattered to you, you should have waited. Which raises the question, what would you prefer Apple had done? Ignore the increasing clamour that "they don't care about pro users anymore" and make those users, who had already waited 527 days for an updated MacBook Pro, wait another 8 months, just so the CPU inside it was absolutely brand-spanking new? Or should they have delayed the Kaby Lake refresh, just to make people who bought their 2016 MacBook Pros feel a little better about their purchases? Reply 3 fenix @fenix Jun 6, 2017, 2:26pm Sherlock laying the smackdown Reply 2 troels @troels Jun 6, 2017, 3:27pm Not sure why they couldn't have made the 2016 MBP include Kay-Lake. Dell et al were able to... Reply 0 loquaciousdandy @loquaciousdandy Jun 6, 2017, 6:36pm Although some of the Kaby Lake chips were released in 2016, most weren't released until later. Looking at the 15" MBP, it looks like it's using the i7-7820HQ, the i7-7920HQ, and the i7-7700HQ. The 13" Non-Touchbar MBP looks like it's using the i5-7360U, and the i7-7660U, and the 13" Touchbar MBP looks like it's using the i5-7267U, the i5-7287U, and the i7-7567U. All of those chips weren't launched until the 3rd of January this year. Presumably it took a while for production to ramp up, and there was no doubt a bunch of testing required as well before Apple could release new products based on them. Reply 0 nafoon @nafoon Jun 6, 2017, 1:35pm How dare apple update their line only 6 years after I purchased my 2011 macbook Reply 3 loquaciousdandy @loquaciousdandy Jun 6, 2017, 6:37pm As the owner of a 2012 MacBook Air, I feel your pain. Reply 0 novasensei @novasensei Jun 6, 2017, 1:36pm How is your device any more or less obsolete today than it was yesterday? In what way has its functionality changed? How can someone who writes for a tech blog not understand that product lines get updated and improved and that Apple has absolutely nothing to gain from giving you a six month advance warning of it? Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 Jun 6, 2017, 1:52pm I have some inside info - this new model will also be replaced within the next year. Shocking news!! Reply 0 bondles @bondles Jun 6, 2017, 3:15pm So the Kaby Lake processors aren't that much faster than Skylake, but what they do have is that hardware DRM handling for video playback. I wonder if there are any talks happening with Netflix to get their 4K video on Safari as well as Edge? It would be a good use for those nice new displays. Reply 0 ghostcorps Guest Jun 6, 2017, 4:05pm Suck it up buttercup. You bought a Mac, did you really expect your sub-par hardware would ever be competitive with the rest of the market on price/performance? Even if you did update to the new refresh like all the mac sheeple you will still be behind. If you don't know this then you should not be writing for a tech site. Reply 0 beatsbynelly @beatsbynelly Jun 6, 2017, 4:18pm I'm a little miffed that work placed an order on a Macbook Pro for me last week, and I doubt I'm getting one of these new ones.. but beyond that meh. I hope at least they get a discount if they're locked into the 'old' one. Reply 0 pformagg @pformagg Jun 6, 2017, 5:09pm iMac Pro ships with Bluetooth 4.2 and not 5.0. Why would they do that? Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 Jun 6, 2017, 6:35pm I'm curious what killer feature 5 brings you. I ask because most (all?) devices are currently BT 4. Reply 0 derpfactory @derpfactory Jun 6, 2017, 7:34pm BT 5 = quadruple the range I think it's more about being future proof. If you're paying these absurd amounts for a turd, then you'd at least expect current technology and support for common tech for at least 2 years. Reply 1 rubik @rubik Jun 7, 2017, 11:29am "Future proof" I either cringe or laugh at that phrase every time. Anything more complex than a wheelbarrow is not future proof. Reply 0 Zeugma Guest Jun 6, 2017, 8:11pm Seriously... Did you not stop and think that this would happen, bearing in mind that they were using a year out of date processor... They have a history of doing This. Not withstanding that, the first rule of buying apple products is...don't buy the 1st generation of a new hardware design. Ever! Reply 0 amfomy @amfomy Jun 6, 2017, 8:46pm "Notoriously when Apple refreshed its laptop line last year, for the first time in two years, it skipped out on Kaby Lake." Assuming you're talking about the quad core chips, didn't they skip out on Skylake? How could they skip on something they're using how? Reply 0 ducksonetime Guest Jun 6, 2017, 9:36pm How is you old macbook now obsolete? Did it stop working during the announcement? Does it somehow have reduced functionality now? I'm pretty sure you still have the exact same thing you paid for and have been using for the past year... Reply 0 elijaxon @elijaxon Jun 7, 2017, 12:43am I've had great experiences with my 2016 15". It's the nicest piece of hardware I've ever owned. It replaced my skylake XPS 13 and I haven't noticed any significant reduction in battery life. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: How does Microsoft’s Surface Pro stack up against the new iPad Pros? 0 by Michael Allison  @al_ikw Jun 5, 2017 at 21:18 GMT3 days ago Following Microsoft, Apple has announced two new iPads at its WWDC event today. Much like Microsoft’s Surface Pro, the iPad Pro is Apple’s take on a tablet designed for PC computing – and Apple’s iOS 11 software update makes that very clear. Much like the Surface Pro, Apple has doubled down on its strengths, improving the iPad’s performance with the powerful A10x processor which has been estimated to deliver desktop-class performance, rivalling Intel processors like the M-series and decimating Qualcomm’s efforts in the process. Of course, Microsoft’s Surface features an actual desktop processor, so the advantage of the iPad there is that it can somewhat match the base of the Surface, but gets left behind at the top end. The software is the important part of any modern PC, and both Apple and Microsoft offer ridiculous amounts of software for their respective devices. While some may be quick to disparage the iPads app ecosystem as being toys, or the Windows app ecosystem as being outdated and clunky, the truth is that both software experiences offer enough for the average user that it doesn’t really matter how many apps one has over the other at this stage. Microsoft and Apple likewise take different approaches to computing,with Microsoft taking an old wine into new skin approach and Apple extending its iOS to account for larger screens. Neither have been entirely successful, Microsoft’s Surface is still a better laptop than it is a tablet, and the iPad will remain a better tablet than laptop till iOS 11 ships and can be fully evaluated. With all that being said, both devices ship next week, in the meantime, here’s how they stack up on a pure hardware level. Component Surface Pro iPad Pro 12.9 iPad Pro 10.5 Display 12.3-inch PixelSense Display (2736×1824, 267 PPI, touch-enabled) 12.9-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit Multi-Touch display 2732×2048 resolution at 264 pixels per inch (ppi) 10.5-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit Multi-Touch display, 2224×1668 resolution at 264 pixels per inch (ppi) CPU 7th gen Intel Core m3 A10X Fusion chip with 64?bit architecture A10X Fusion chip with 64?bit architecture Battery Up to 13.5 hours Up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi?Fi, watching video or listening to music Up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi?Fi, watching video or listening to music Storage 128 GB SSD 64GB 64GB Ports One USB 3.0 port, Surface Connect, 3.55mm headphone jack, SD card slot One lightning connector, one 3.5 mm headphone jack One lightning connector, one 3,5 mm headphone jack Dimensions 11.50” x 7.9” x 0.33” 12″ x 9.68″ x 0.27″ 9.8″ x 6.8″ x 0.24″ Weight 768 grams 677 grams 469 grams Operating System Windows 10 iOS 10 (iOS 11 later this year) iOS 10 (iOS 11 later this year) Price $799 $799 $649 Microsoft’s Surface Pro starts at $799 and you can pre-order one right here..

Apple also rolled out an upgraded lineup of Mac computers and a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and made a host of software announcements on the first day of its Worldwide Developers Conference. The HomePod will be available in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia and cost $349. The Wi-Fi speaker will come in two colors: white and space gray. It had been rumored last week as a possible announcement for the opening keynote at the conference, which runs through Friday in San Jose, Calif. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the speaker has "amazing sound and incredible intelligence that will reinvent home music." Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said customers will want to buy two HomePod speakers per room because they automatically work together for great music playback. The HomePod comes with a built-in musicologist, or expert on music, Schiller said. With Siri voice controls, users can ask spoken questions about the songs and artists that are playing and suggest other music to enjoy. Apple's HomePod will compete with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo speakers and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home device. As with competing products, users can ask HomePod questions about news, weather, traffic and sports, and perform tasks such as setting a reminder or texting a contact. Amazon Deal, New Macs Also Monday, Apple announced that Amazon's Prime Video service will be coming to Apple TV devices later this year. Amazon had been a major holdout from the Apple TV platform. Apple didn't offer additional service launch details. Apple refreshed its Mac computers with the latest Kaby Lake processors from Intel (INTC), as well as faster graphics processors, and speedier and higher-capacity solid-state drives. It updated four MacBook Pro notebooks and three iMac desktop computers. It also previewed the iMac Pro, which boasts "workstation-class performance." It will ship in models with 8-core, 10-core or 18-core Intel Xeon processors. It will hit the market later this year. Apple also introduced a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro tablet. The previous iPad Pros had 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch displays. The new 10.5-inch model will replace the 9.7-inch version. The company is touting the 10.5-inch tablet as the perfect size for a full-size, on-screen keyboard and full-size attachable physical keyboard. Apple improved the display refresh rates for its iPads for more realistic and smooth video. And the tablets are getting faster processors, improved cameras and higher memory configurations.  New Software, Augmented Reality At the opening keynote of the conference, Apple detailed the latest developments with its four software operating systems: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. It touted its latest smartphone operating system, iOS 11; new smartwatch operating system, watchOS 4; and new Mac computer operating system, macOS High Sierra. With iOS 11, Apple made improvements to its Siri voice assistant, photo apps and notifications. It also redesigned the Control Center panel. Apple's updated Maps app will add navigation inside shopping malls and airports. And the company's revamped Apple Music app will feature a music-sharing function and playlists linked to other apps. Apple announced new augmented-reality technology for the iPhone. It introduced a kit for developers that takes advantage of the device's cameras, processors and motion sensors. Once rolled out, Apple claims it will have "the largest AR platform in the world." Apple also announced that it is redesigning its App Store. It will have a start page called Today for users to discover hot new apps. Games will have its own tab in the app store. Apps besides games will get a dedicated tab as well. The week of WWDC is usually a bad one for Apple stock. Over the last 16 years, during the week of WWDC, Apple stock has only risen once and that was likely because of a 7-for-1 stock split. On average, Apple shares have fallen 3.5% during WWDC week. Apple stock fell 1% to 153.93 on the stock market today.

Forums Join   Review of ASUS Chromebook Flip C213SA-YS02 by digitaldoc77 Monday Jun 05 2017 16:00 EDT While Chromebooks debuted as a curiosity half a decade ago, last year when they were outselling Macbooks folks began paying attention. After all, the allure of a stable platform free of malware, with a simple interface centered around the Google Chrome browser and other Google services, all at an affordable price is an easy proposition. While Chromebooks were originally thought of as niche devices, with the rise of personal cloud computing, there has been a more general acceptance of a Chromebook as a simplified PC (as an aside a friend of mine as a full time professional writer uses his Chromebook as his platform of choice to do his writing on). A popular Chromebook market is in education, specifically K-12. Combining the portability and long battery life of a tablet, with the productivity of a smaller notebook, and this is why these have become so popular with schools. A popular Chromebook last year was the ASUS C202SA, which was notable for being ruggedized, and spill resistant- enough to stand up to the “rug rats” of the local school. While the C202SA was more of a traditional Chromebook, this year’s followup to that model is the ASUS Chromebook Flip C213SA, which features a convertible design and hardware upgrades, while continuing the standout features of a spill resistant keyboard, rubber grip design, and drop test certified. Design This ASUS Chromebook C213SA-YS02 is designed to be a versatile 2-in-1 for the educational market. It features a 360 degree hinge that allows this device to perform duties as a laptop, a tablet, in tent mode for a self standing display, and to lay fully flat. It has ruggedness built into the design, with a reinforced rubber wrapped guard to mitigate damage from drops, and reportedly it meets the US Military Standard for drop testing. The whole design is textured, and hides fingerprints well. In addition, it has rubber grips on the bottom that make it comfortable and easy to hold. The overall size is 12.1” x 7.8” x 0.8,” and it weighs 2.6 lbs. This is 0.09” thinner than the C202SA, which did not have tablet functionality, making it even more portable. While this is a 2-in-1 convertible, this is first a Chromebook, and second a tablet. While the tablet mode takes a backseat, it is a nice feature for time when you want to flip through a PDF or use it as an ereader for a book. Display The display is an 11.6” HD screen. The resolution is 1366 x 768 (720P), which is fairly standard for this size of device. It is a TN panel, and also touch screen enabled. The screen has a matte coating, that functions well to repel fingerprints that smudge up these displays. Compared to an IPS display, I found the display of the C213SA to be a little dim, but this improved by pushing the backlight up to the max level. Colors and contrast were solid for this type of device, but nothing exceptional. There is a large bezel around the screen, that no doubt helps to make it more rugged, but goes against the current trend bezeless trend in smartphones and laptops. Our contact at Asus has indicated that a variant of the C213SA will debut later this summer with a glossy display. Audio The C213SA has two speakers, which is better than the mono audio solutions that some lower end devices go with in the compact category. The speakers fire out the bottom, and the audio sounds crisper when the device is on a solid surface such as a table, as opposed to being on carpeting or your lap. It also has a standard headphone jack, and a physical rocker switch to control the volume. No one really expects a compact chromebook to be an audio powerhouse. The volume maxes out at an acceptable level, but don’t expect this to provide the audio for your next rave without an additional amplifier and speakers. The audio was solid through the headphone jack. The midrange was decent, but the highs were weaker, and there was little bass. Performance The performance of the C213SA is driven by the Intel Celeron 3350 processor. This is an Apollo Lake dual core 14 nm part, with a clock speed of 1.1 to 2.4 GHz; it sips power at a mere 6W that allows for a fanless design. In use, the Chromebook got a little warm in one corner, but it was nothing too hot. The graphics are the Intel graphics that come with such a budget CPU, the HD500 solution. It is an integrated design that comes with 12 cores, and runs at 200 MHz. RAM is 4 GB of DDR4, which is fairly standard for a midrange Chromebook these days. Overall, this produces an Octane 2.0 score of 9027, which puts this solution ahead of the previous dual core Celeron parts used commonly in Chromebooks. With the Chrome OS, which runs comparatively light, this type of processor provides more than ample power, and at no point in testing did the device feel underpowered. Keyboard & Touchpad With many Chromebooks all having similar specs, the keyboard and touchpad is a significant point of differentiation. The C213SA makes a good showing in this area. Not only is the keyboard able to withstand liquid spills, but it also has 2 mm of key travel. Unlike some cheap notebooks, the keyboard feels solid, and not mushy. It also is close to full size, with excellent key spacing, comfortable 2mm key travel, and a large enough space bar. The C213SA keyboard is just large enough to avoid being cramped, and comfortable to type on all day. The touchpad was usable as well. It could be differentiated by touch, as well as visually, and was more than large enough, especially considering the overall size of the machine. As is the trend, there are no physical left and right click buttons, but they are integrated in, and did provide the physical feedback of the click, including the audio. Storage Chromebooks are made to be machines for cloud computing, and as such, have minimal storage requirements. While they are designed to interface with the web, there is still a need for local storage. This includes the Chrome OS that is installed locally. They also can cache and sync the documents from Google Drive locally so they work can be done when there is no internet connection available, such as on an airplane. A Chromebook is most at home when it is using its Chrome browser to access data on a user’s Google Drive account. With that in mind, realize that no Chromebook has much storage built into the device. The C213SA has a 32 GB eMMC for local storage duties. This is better than the 16 GB eMMC that budget devices ship with. Additional removable storage can be added via a microSD card slot. It supports the newer SDHC and SDXC formats for larger sized cards. Software The C213SA runs on the Chrome OS. It painlessly updates to the latest version with a short reboot. Software is added via the Android app store. Chrome runs quite light, with less system resources required than a traditional Windows notebook. As such, with a Celeron chip, and 4 GB of RAM, it runs quite smoothly. The downside of a Chromebook is that it can only run software that was designed for it. Historically, this has been a significant limiting factor for a Chromebook, but this is poised to change, as Chromebooks are going to be able to access to the Google Play Store, and run Android apps. A few Chromebooks currently support this, and as new ones roll out, including the C213SA, support is being added. While this is a transition time as these apps were really developed for smartphones with inherent screen resolution differences, and on the C213SA, the Google Play Store comes up as a beta, although we were able to use the store to install apps without any issues. With such a light OS, and it stored on flash memory, the boot times are super quick, and only a few seconds for startups and shutdowns. This is a standout feature that is firmly an advantage for the Chromebook camp. Battery The C213SA includes a non removable battery integrated into the device. The stated battery life is 12 hours, which is more than long enough to get through a school day for its intended educational audience. While of course when discussing battery life, YMMV depending on display brightness, workload and age of the battery. In our testing and use of the C213SA, we can confirm that the battery life exceeds 10 hours. Ports The C213SA has a decent assortment of ports for a machine of this size. These include two USB 3.1 ports, and two USB 3.0 ports.The 3.0 ports are the standard ones that you can plug a flash drive or mouse into. The newer 3.1 standard is used to charge the device, and through adapters can be connected to an HDMI display. The device is also well laid out with one port of each type on either side. This allows the device to be charged from either side, and the mouse can be plugged into either side, minimizing cable clutter from having to route cables to get to the port on the other side of the device. There is also a Kensington lock attachment. There is no optical drive, but these are not found in any recent Chromebook, although one can be added externally, realizing that it is limited to reading files, and cannot play music or DVD’s. There is also no Ethernet port, although there are reports of success using a USB to Ethernet adapter. Also understand that few, if any modern Chromebooks feature optical drives or Ethernet ports. Webcam The C213SA actually has two webcams. The first one is at the top of the display in the spot that many laptops have it. It is a 1 MP/720P camera, and is intended for video conferencing. The second webcam is at the top of the keyboard, and it is a 5 MP camera. It is designed to function as a camera when the C213SA is in tablet mode. Wireless With no Ethernet port, the wireless needs to be solid for a Chromebook. Thankfully it is as rather than using some “no name” wireless solution, the C213SA incorporates the Intel 7265 wireless solution. It features SU-MIMO, and works on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies, with the 5 GHz speed of up to 867 Mbps. It also has Bluetooth 4.0 support integrated in. In our use, the wireless of the C213SA functioned rock stable, and did not drop the connection to the router at any time. Ot is also an advantage that the wireless card can be accessed via removal of a single screw so it can be swapped in case it has an issue and needs replacement. Conclusion With the increase in popularity of Chromebooks, they are evolving into more capable, and powerful devices. The retail price of $349 puts the C213SA into midrange territory. The exterior is solid, and quite resilient, with an excellent keyboard, and a good assortment of external ports. With its combination of smooth performance, and stellar battery life, it should not only be ideal for the intended educational market, but users in other areas would do well to choose the C213SA to toss into their laptop bag.

He is the adamant type that insists things break on their own, he never goes to any bad websites or click next a bunch of times just to get installers to finish. One thing Chromebooks are subject to is browser hijacks, and obviously chrome specific ones through extensions. One nice thing is as long as you can get to chrome://settings, you can do a lesser system settings reset that keeps all your user info and passwords saved, but disables third party extensions and resets the homepage.

It is a wide cross-section of the US, all coming together to say Mr Trump’s decision is “out of step” with what is happening outside of Washington.  “The signers all understand that the Paris Agreement is a blueprint for job creation, stability and global prosperity...to create jobs, spur innovation, promote trade and ensure American competitiveness,” they said in a statement.  Mr Leonard said that though these cities would be able to combat climate change “faster and more fully” with the help of state and federal governments, the wide variety of partners in the initiative is important to note.  These new partners can “do something creative” to green their local economies, said Mr Leonard.  He explained that the reason the initiative is crucial is that decisions about transportation, ports - some large, international shipping hubs, urban planning, and land use are all made at the local government level.  These are the areas where changes need to be made to push the US to a “zero carbon future,” Mr Leonard said.  Some mayors and companies that signed on are in states that have not committed to fighting climate change. Only 13 Republican and Democratic governors have done so thus far.   Mr Leonard said though that may be an issue, policies about “sustainable agriculture, for instance, become less and less political at the local level.”  10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn't believe in climate change 10 show all 10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn't believe in climate change 1/10 A group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, Antarctica Kira Morris 2/10 Amid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks break.

Riddhima Singh Bhati 9/10 A factory in China is shrouded by a haze of air pollution. The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”. Leung Ka Wa 10/10 Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions. Mahtuf Ikhsan For instance, he pointed to the number of mayors and actors representing the Mississippi River Valley, “the breadbasket” of America that runs through several Republican states, as evidence that local leaders understand climate change’s economic impact better than most.  In addition to this initiative, 211 mayors from around the country have signed a similar pledge to “create a clean energy economy,” according to a statement from Mayors National Climate Agenda.  Cities represented include San Diego, California and Miami Beach, Florida, both contending with rising sea levels and coastal erosion.  Mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan also signed despite his city’s reliance on the auto manufacturing industry. Detroit has been in an economic downturn for several years and Mr Duggan and others feel job re-training and clean energy programmes will play a role in an economic renaissance for the city.  During his address announcing the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, Mr Trump cited the decline in the coal industry - which has actually been in decline since before the 1970s.  The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Scott Pruitt said during a news conference that the goal of withdrawal was to export American “clean coal” and the “innovation and technology” used in the US natural gas energy to “teach” the world how the US does it better.  Mr Trump also said he was elected to represent the citizens of “Pittsburgh not Paris”.  Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto responded via Twitter that his city “will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future.”  While data on national carbon emissions and some large companies has been identified, local data is more scant. It is unclear at this point whether partners in these initiatives alone will be enough to meet the US targets of reducing carbon emissions 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by the year 2025.

By Rob Thubron on Jun 5, 2017, 11:45 AM TechSpot With so many firms pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into R&D, it’s hard to deny that self-driving vehicles are the future. The biggest question now, it seems, is at what point will they make up the majority of cars on the road? Intel, which is working with BMW and Mobileye (a company it recently acquired) on autonomous vehicle tech, believes the revolution won’t take as long to arrive as some people think. On Friday, the chip maker said self-driving cars would create a new economic sector, called “the Passenger Economy,” which will be worth $800 billion by 2035, rising to $7 trillion by 2050. Should predictions of the technology turning mainstream prove accurate, could it result in driving becoming a redundant skill? That’s the view of top UK insurance firm AXA’s boss, Amanda Blanc, who says that driving a vehicle is something today's babies may never have to do. "Babies born today may never have to take a driving test," she told The Telegraph. Not only does Blanc believe that self-driving cars will become the norm sooner than expected, but she also warns that insurance companies must prepare a framework for the time when accidents are the result of computer error, rather than a human’s fault. "Driverless cars will not be able to take to the roads [without that],” she added. The technology is expected to be "much safer and increase mobility for vulnerable members of society," though there’s still plenty of work to be done when it comes to the former, as Uber and Google will attest. Many people still view self-driving cars with a raised eyebrow, and there are those that do actually enjoy driving, but with so many governments, companies, and other entities seemingly certain of a future filled with autonomous vehicles, maybe driving really will become a dying art.

Both the 21.5‑inch iMac and the 27‑inch 5K model are getting Intel Kaby Lake 7th-gen CPUs that bring support for HEVC video encoding, one of the highlight features of the upcoming High Sierra macOS update. The all-in-ones can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM, Fusion drives are now standard (hybrid HDD/SSD solution) and faster SSDs are offered with up to 2TB capacity. Two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports have been added to the back of the machines. The 21.5‑inch iMac is getting faster Iris Plus 640 integrated graphics via the Kaby Lake upgrade, with a new option for discrete Radeon Pro 500 series graphics. Meanwhile, the 27-inch iMac gets upgraded to Radeon Pro 570/575/580 graphics, which are being touted as ideal for VR content creation. macOS Sierra is getting support for Valve VR and Unreal Engine's VR Editor. A neat Star Wars VR demo was shown running on the iMac at 60+ fps. Availability on the new iMacs is immediate, at $1,099, $1,299 and $1,799 for the 21.5-inch model, 4K 21.5-inch, and 27‑inch 5K base models, respectively. During the WWDC announcement it was briefly mentioned that MacBooks were also getting updated to Kaby Lake processors. This includes the 12" MacBook, and 13" and 15" MacBook Pros. The upgrade should come with a marginal increase in performance and battery life, however Apple didn't care to elaborate acknowledging the change is a small one, not to mention they didn't address other complaints about the latest MacBook Pros not getting enough RAM expansion or their lack of ports. The only other change mentioned is a reduction in price for the base 13" MacBook Pro with no Touch Bar which is down to $1,299. Apple also unveiled a new iMac Pro model coming this December, which undoubtedly was the most exciting hardware announcement made today. Using the same all-in-one design, Apple called it the "most powerful Mac" they've ever built. Set to take over the void left by the Mac Pro (trash can workstation), the iMac Pro will come in Apple's space gray, run a 5K display, and thanks to a reworked cooling solution, it will be able to house 8-core, 10-core and up to 18-core Xeon processors on the most expensive configurations. Discrete graphics are powered by AMD's upcoming Radeon Vega with up to 16GB of VRAM, offering 11 and 22 TeraFLOPS of single and half precision performance, the later which is often used for machine learning. Other top-end configuration specs include up to 128GB of ECC memory, up to 4TB SSD, four Thunderbolt ports, 10GbE networking. The base configuration is set for release this December starting at $5,000 (for specs that Apple claims would cost around $7,000 if you were to buy a similar workstation PC at present time).

ADVERTISEMENT Apple WWDC 2017: all the highlights from Apple's developer conference Apple WWDC 2017: all the highlights from Apple's developer conference Apple 2 days ago As the name suggests, the software isn't a complete overhaul. Instead, it's a small-scale update to macOS Sierra going from macOS 10.12 to 10.13. Announcing the changes at WWDC 2017, Apple's Craig Federighi said the update was focused more on refining the previous software, rather than redesigning it.

Macs—like every other computer—get more powerful every year, but at its developers conference on Monday, Apple unveiled a new iMac Pro that it says is the fastest Mac ever built. The $4,999 iMac Pro will go on sale in December, and it's aimed at video editors combing through 4K footage and game developers working on their latest virtual reality title, among other creative professionals. While it's got the same form factor and 27-inch display as the current high-end iMac, the similarities pretty much end there. It's in slate gray, a color that hasn't been used before in the iMac lineup. Under the hood is an all-new centrifugal cooling system with two fans to draw heat away from the system's Xeon processor, which you can configure with eight, 10, or 18 cores. The dedicated graphics card is from AMD's new workstation-class Vega series, which will allow up to 22 teraflops of half-precision floating point performance. The iMac Pro also comes with up to 128GB of memory and 4GB of flash storage. I/O options include four Thunderbolt ports, which means you could power two external 5K displays and two RAID storage arrays at the same time, assuming you need that much storage and screen real estate. If you don't, Apple also refreshed the prices and specs of the regular 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac models. They include new seventh-generation Intel "Kaby Lake" processors, and the 27-inch version also gets a raised memory ceiling of 64GB. Every new iMac will also have refreshed graphics, from a new version of the integrated Intel Iris graphics in the base model that is 80 percent faster than the previous version, to the Radeon Pro 500-series with up to 8GB of eDRAM for the high-end 27-inch iMac. Related Apple Touts Speed, Privacy Upgrades in macOS High Sierra Apple Touts Speed, Privacy Upgrades in macOS High Sierra The iMac Retina 4K 21.5-inch model also has a new lower price of $1,299, while the non-4K 21.5-inch starts at $1,099 and the 27-inch begins at $1,799. All of the new models are available now. Finally, Apple is offering a similar spec upgrade for its MacBook and MacBook Air notebooks. They get Kaby Lake processors, as well as a curious new pricing scheme that lowers the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro 13-inch version to $1,299, the same price as the 12-inch MacBook. Touch Bar-equipped 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models start at $1,799 and $2,399, respectively. All of the new notebooks can be ordered today. Also today, Apple unveiled iOS 11 and a new version of macOS known as High Sierra. It also showed off a new iPad Pro, and finally embraced augmented and virtual reality.

Share Comments Search CloseSearch What's Happening at the Han Solo Set in Fuerteventura? Kevin Burwick 06.05.2017 220shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Comment Security was light, so Star Wars fan Lawrence Thespian was able to snap some great pictures on the set of Han Solo: A Star Wars Story located in Fuerteventura. Shooting for the spin-off started February 20th, 2017 at Pinewood Studios in London, and is now currently shooting in the Canary Islands. Apparently cameras were banned in the natural park, which is a popular tourist destination, while filming was going on. Many fans speculated that Han Solo could be taking place in a tropical location like Rogue One when it was first revealed that filming would take place on Fuerteventura. But those theories have been debunked by a flurry of set leaks. These images are by far the most detailed and clear look at the goings-on to date. The Intel comes from StarWarsNewsNet via Mr. Thespian, and he reports that the set is less than 5 miles from the popular holiday resort in Costa Calma. Armed security and checkpoints have been utilized to keep people away from the private set. It is not clear how Thespian (can't be his real name, can it?) was able to get so close to the set or what he was even doing there in the first place, but his pictures are good and a great addition to photos of the Trooper Speeder that leaked over the weekend. According to StarWarsNewsNet Mr. Thespian "stumbled" upon the set... According to Thespian, the set contains "two large round pavilion" complexes that could be palaces that have recently come under attack. Moisture vaporaotrs can clearly be seen, much like Tatooine in A New Hope. Could this be Tatooine? It is still unclear, but it does seem to be highly probable. Elsewhere, there are shots of igloo-like structures that were previously rumored to have been constructed of leather, but are definitely constructed of metal in these photos. There even appears to be a shipwreck that looks an awful lot like a Sail Barge. Over the weekend more shots from the Han Solo set on Fuerteventura leaked. The one picture and video show a pod car and a stormtrooper on some kind of speeder. Speeder may not be the best term since it's moving very slowly... again, it's pretty amazing that these leaks keep happening since Thespian outlined the security information in such a detailed manner. Thespian reminds me of Frankie Sharp's security guard in Wayne's World portrayed by the late great Chris Farley. Disney and Lucasfilm keep the lid tight on their projects and Han Solo: A Star Wars Story is no exception. We may know what the set looks like and who stars in the movie, but that's about it. Thanks to Thespian we know a lot about the set and that there is a no fly zone while filming takes place and that he may even know the hotel in which the cast is residing, which is kind of too much information. But whatever, cheers to Mr. Thespian and his accidental "stumble" of a find in a heavily guarded fortress of mystery.

The update includes new Retina displays. The devices will also be powered by Intel Corporation’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Kaby Lake processors. There will also be additional storage and memory options.

The update will also include the ability to sync to multiple playlists and more connectivity with gym equipment. iPhone Repairs: A new pilot program means that iPhone repairs won’t take as long for some customers, reports MacRumors. The new pilot program supplies three repair shops authorized by the company to completely handle repairs at their stores. This includes calibration of the smartphones, which was previously something only AAPL could do. This is possible because the shops now each have one of the tech company’s machines for calibration. The calibration process only takes about 15 minutes.

The announcement itself was a departure from the norm as well. Traditionally, Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where the HomePod was unveiled, is where the iPhone maker gives updates on its software. As expected, there were updates on Monday at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center for Apple’s iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS for its mobile, computer, smartwatch and Apple TV devices respectively. But this year’s WWDC also had many hardware launches – refreshed versions of the iMac all-in-one desktops and MacBook Pros laptops, a new iMac Pro computer, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the show stealing HomePod smart speaker. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up HOMEPOD “(The) HomePod is going to re-invent music in our homes,” said Mr Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing head, during the keynote address at WWDC. The new Apple HomePod is a Wi-Fi six-array speaker and has Siri, Apple’s virtual voice assistant, integrated, so users can ask for the weather or what songs to play from their Apple Music library of digital tunes. The HomePod can also link up with smart devices in the home, such as connected light bulbs, so that a user can control them with a voice command, like switching them on or off. Apple also highlighted the audio quality of the speaker and how the device can adjust its sound quality based on the room it is in. Apple's HomePod appears to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home smart speakers, which also use voice assistants to act on spoken commands from users. Media surrounding the newly-announced Apple HomePod smart speakers at the hands-on area during WWDC 2017 in San Jose. ST PHOTO: TREVOR TAN Said Mr Frank Gillett, principal analyst at research firm Forrester Research: “Home speaker devices have become an important host for virtual assistants like Siri. If Apple had not done this, their customers would embrace Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.” Alexa and Assistant refer to the digital voice assistants for Amazon's and Google's smart speakers respectively. But Apple's speaker is a lot more expensive than either of these speakers. The Amazon Echo goes for US$179.99 (S$248.48) and the Google Home is even cheaper at US$109 (S$150.47) in the United States. But the HomePod’s American price of US$349 (S$481.79) is close to double that of the Echo and more than triple that of the Home speaker. WWDC 2017 While the HomePod’s price point, compared to the competition, is a “steep barrier”, Forrester’s Mr Gillett noted that Apple has put a much more robust processor in the HomePod. “They seem be using it to drive superior user experience, sound quality, and privacy,” he said. The HomePod will ship in the US, Britain and Australia in December, and the rest of the world next year. NEW IMAC PRO WITH REFRESHED IMAC AND MACBOOK PROS, AND A NEW 10.5-INCH IPAD PRO The new iMac Pro is the most powerful Mac ever made, according to Apple. With an all-flash architecture and all-new thermal design, the iMac Pro comes with a new space grey enclosure and a 27-inch Retina 5K display. The iMac Pro features Intel Xeon processors up to 18 cores and the new Radeon Pro Vega graphics processing unit with up to 16GB of video memory.   Apple integrates Siri across devices Related Story Apple integrates Siri across devices There is also an update to Apple’s all-in-one desktops, iMac. The new iMacs are updated with better graphics processor that makes them better suited for virtual reality (VR) content creation and playback. The MacBook Pros are also updated with Kaby Lake processors and up to 50 per cent graphics processing power. The new 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with a faster A10X processor, that is 30 per cent faster processor performance than the A9X chip found in iPhone 7. The new iMac and MacBook Pro are up for order now on Apple’s Singapore website and can be bought from the Apple store from Wednesday (June 7). The 10.5-inch iPad Pro can be ordered now on Apple’s Singapore website and is expected to be delivered to customers next week. For now, the new iMac Pro will be available in the US in December.

Barton/Alabama athletics New Alabama coach Brad Bohannon talks to returning Crimson Tide baseball players. Tide introduces Bohannon as baseball coach: 'There’s some good pieces in place' By Chandler Rome, Star Sports Writer, crome@annistonstar.com Chandler Rome Jun 5, 2017 (…) Amelia B. Barton/Alabama athletics New Alabama coach Brad Bohannon talks to returning Crimson Tide baseball players. TUSCALOOSA — Twenty-four hours after he fired Greg Goff, Greg Byrne comprised an extensive list of candidates to replace him. Twenty-four hours later, it was narrowed to “five or six,” including Brad Bohannon. Insight from Dave Magadan, Jim Wells and Alan Dunn  — three men who’ve seen this once-proud program at its apex — was gleaned. “Brad checked all the boxes,” Byrne said. The first-year Crimson Tide athletics director invited the Auburn assistant coach to his Tuscaloosa home last Monday morning. Detailed on the day he fired Goff, Byrne employs a meticulous interviewing regimen. There is no interrupting when he speaks. Leaks to the press likely will disqualify a candidate. Byrne’s wife, Regina, is often an influential part of the discussions. The meeting was scheduled for one hour. Somewhat unexpectedly, Bohannon brought a PowerPoint presentation. Twelve or 14 pages of slides, as Byrne recalls, were “a grand slam.” There was an academic plan. One for compliance, alumni and community relations, too. And, obviously, a baseball strategy — all comprising Bohannon’s master plan to reconstruct the burning embers of a once-storied baseball program. “Three-and-a-half hours later, he walked out of my house,” Byrne said, “and I thought 'We can make this thing work if everything goes well.'" Bohannon was introduced as the Crimson Tide’s 32nd head coach Monday, capping a winding career journey that started as a finance analyst at Intel and reached its summit on this rainy morning in Tuscaloosa as he spoke in front of trustees, athletic administrators and at least 10 members of the team he now calls his. “When you get into college coaching, it's such a tough road,” Bohannon said. “It's so hard to get your first job. You move around like crazy, live week-to-week, you're working baseball camps for peanuts. When you're doing that, at times you question what you're doing and you also have these dreams to one day lead your own program and coach in this league. For that dream to come true for me today is just such a blessing.” A 14-year Southeastern Conference assistant who spent his last 20 months on Butch Thompson’s staff at Auburn, Bohannon was presented to the Alabama faithful merely 11 hours after the Tigers lost an extra-inning game in the Tallahassee Regional. It forced a winner-take-all regional title game at 6 p.m. today. Bohannon attended a reception following his introduction and was then scheduled to fly back to Tallahassee to coach Auburn, comprised mostly of players he lured to the Plains. A first-time head coach who’s worked under John Cohen and Gary Henderson, Bohannon stressed he and his staff — one he said will be assembled in the coming days — will coach to the returning personnel, many of whom he met with one hour before the news conference. Among the discussions: the Crimson Tide’s three-game sweep of Auburn in May that sent the then top-10 Tigers into a tailspin to end the regular season. “There’s some good pieces in place,” Bohannon said, “and I felt the kids competed pretty well. And I’m excited to build on that.” A gaggle of Crimson Tide returners — including All-Southeastern Conference power hitter Chandler Taylor and shortstop Chandler Avant — sat near the front of the Naylor Stone Media Room. They’re three weeks removed from the worst conference season in program history. Some endured Goff’s attempted revocation of their scholarships. Others will play for their third coach in three seasons, one that promised Monday to create a “players-first program” Byrne knows he can manifest. During the search, Byrne instructed associate athletics director for compliance Matt Self to call as many of Bohannon’s former players as feasible. Using a blocked phone number, Self dialed. “I wanted him to call players who played a lot. I wanted him to call players a little bit off and on, and I wanted him to call players who never got off the bench,” Byrne said. “The last question you ask is: ‘If you had to do it all over again, would you want to play for Coach Bohannon?’ And without a doubt, 100 percent of the young men that he talked to said, ‘I’d absolutely play for Coach Bohannon again.’” Now this Alabama group gets its opportunity. “There’s a lot of work to be done,” Bohannon said. “We know that, and there are no shortcuts. I don’t have any magic dust, but I can’t wait to roll the sleeves up and get to work.” There’s some good pieces in place Sports Writer Chandler Rome on Twitter: @chandler_rome.

The headline you see above is on its fourth iteration, because every time I go to write up what I’ve just heard, they go and announce something else. It’s very inconsiderate. See related  MacOS High Sierra: First look at Apple’s updated operating system Still, my discomfort is also good news for Apple fans, because there’s an awful lot to go through. Let’s go through this point by point. New iMacs for 2017 The iMacs get their first updates in nearly two years, and it's worth the wait. Not only do all the iMacs get 7th generation Kaby Lake Intel processors, but the big screen they’re known for is described as “the best Mac display ever” with a whopping 500 nits of brightness. Starting from £1,049 for the 21.5in iMac or £1,749 for the 27in 5K model, they’re now pretty damned powerful. The (comparatively) dinky Mac can have up to 32GB RAM, backed by the Radeon Pro 560 graphics card. The top of the range 27in version, on the other hand, can go all the way up to 64GB RAM paired with the Radeon Pro 580 - meaning Mac will support VR for the first time, with a little help from the latest version of macOS: High Sierra. Though it will set you back £2,249. But hey, if that leaves you feeling underwhelmed, and you have $4,999 burning a hole in your pocket then Apple would like that please. What will you get in return? The space grey iMac Pro, “the most powerful Mac ever.” You’ll have to wait until December for it, but if you do, you’ll be rewarded with an 8-core Xeon processor and the AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Oh, you didn’t think five grand was the top-of-the-range, did you? Oh you poor naive fool: you can scale this up to include an 18-core Xeon processor, but that price is only going in one direction. Better start saving. MacBooks get a Kaby Lake boost All the MacBook Pros and the MacBook are getting new Kaby Lake processors. On top of that, as a pleasingly refreshing chaser to the wallet busting iMac Pro, the entry-level MacBook Pro without touchbar now starts at £1,249 - the same price as the MacBook. Even the much-neglected MacBook Air range gets a modest speed boost with a faster Intel processor - though the company barely gave it a mention. Still: looks like it’s hanging around a little longer as an entry level product, even if Apple has decided not to give it a screen upgrade or any extra ports. Everything bar the iMac Pro is shipping from today, so fill your boots.

And with the latest updates just unveiled for the iMac, there just might be a model to satisfy everyone. Apple While the new iMacs might look the same on the outside, they’re quite a bit different inside. It starts, of course, with the screen. Apple says the new models have the “best Mac displays ever,” upping the brightness to 500 nits to make them 43 percent brighter while bringing support for a billion colors. You’ll also get faster Intel Kaby Lake processors up to 4.2 GHz, higher memory capacity, super-fast storage, and next-generation graphics, as well as a pair of Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports (which aren’t even available on the Mac Pro yet). The entry-level 21.5-inch model features an Intel Iris Plus 640 GPU while the 4K model now supports discrete AMD Radeon Pro 550 graphics with up to 4GB of VRAM. It also comes with 32GB of RAM and an SSD drive that is up to 50 percent faster. The step-up 21.5-inch model, meanwhile, will feature Radeon Pro 555 or 560 graphics and standard fusion drives. The 27-inch 5K model offers up to 64GB of RAM, standard fusion drives, and a choice between the Radeon Pro 570, 565, or 580 cards with up to 8GB of VRAM for 5.5 teraflops of graphics power. And coupled with the new improvements in macOS High Sierra, these new machines will be at the forefront of VR content creation. Apple Additionally, the new machines bring a host of minor improvements, including an improved 1080 FaceTime camera, UHS-II SDXC card slot, and Bluetooth 4.2. The 21.5-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 4K version starts at $1,299. Additionally, the 27-inch model will cost you $1,799 for the base model and goes up from there. The new iMacs are available to order today on Apple’s website, and you can pick one up in stores this Wednesday, June 7.  To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Apple also announced that watchOS 4, the next version of its smartwatch platform, will be arriving in September. It includes new features for watchfaces, such as complications updating based on time of day or location and a new Siri-based watchface. The Siri watchface uses machine learning to determine what information is most useful to you at a given point in time. Other new watchfaces include a kaleidoscope and new characters such as Woody, Jesse, and Buzz from the Toy Story movie franchise. WatchOS 4 will also bring updates to the watch's fitness tracking, including a new user interface for the workout app and new integrations with gym equipment manufacturers. Apple said that watch wearers will be able to link their devices with the gym equipment through NFC. Next up in tech is Apple's new version of macOS is called High Sierra which is launched with new Safari browser.

Cook also launched iOS 11 with over 10 new features. He said that iOS 10 had nearly 96 per cent satisfaction with 86 per cent iPhone users installing the update as compared to only seven per cent Android users who installed Android Nougat - the latest version of Google's operating system. The new iOS will now synchronize messages across iOS and macOS automatically. If a user erases a message on your iPhone or iPad, that will be reflected on the Mac as well. Apple also made improvements to Siri including making the assistant's voice sound more natural when responding to users. Siri will now be able to perform translations in various languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish. --IANS sku/qd SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Media under pressure Modi-fying bilateral relations: PM's four-nation Europe tour 'Mor' about law!

The new iMac Pro, announced at WWDC alongside macOS High Sierra, takes the form of a 27-inch, Space Grey (that's a new colour!) iMac. And it's the computing version of the kitchen sink in terms of processing and graphics hardware. So what’s it packing? iMac Pro specs At its most basic, the iMac Pro is a high-end workstation. This means the lowest-cost model – a mere $4999 – gets one of Intel’s top-end Xeon CPUs with a minimum of eight CPU cores, all the way up to 18 cores. That’s a monstrous specification, but keep in mind that Xeon processors are more sedate than the rip-roaring 18-core Core i9 chips announced at Computex last week. Still, for multi-threaded tasks such as rendering and audio production, this thing is an absolute whizzkid. Related: Best desktop PC The graphics department is a real treat as well. In fact, the GPU tech is so cutting-edge that we don’t even know what the exact specification will be. That’s because it’s using AMD’s latest Vega graphics architecture, which isn’t even out yet. It’s toting 11 teraflops (trillion floating point operations per section) of GPU power, which is far and away the most powerful graphics chip ever seen in an all-in-one PC. You’ll get up to 16GB of high-bandwidth memory with your graphics chip, and up to 128GB of ultra-reliable error correcting code (ECC) memory. All this has been made possible by a new thermal design, which Apple says increases cooling capacity by 80% over the standard iMacs. SSDs are configurable up to 4TB, with a maximum read speed of 3GB/s. That’s even faster than the storage used on the latest MacBook Pros. On the back, Apple has added four ThunderBolt 3 connectors for ultra-high-end peripherals, and on the front is a 27-inch 5K display that ticks all the boxes when it comes to colour coverage, including the moviemaker-friendly DCI P3 colour gamut. There’s also 10Gbps Ethernet, a rare thing indeed on computers, and 10 times faster than your standard gigabit Ethernet found on most other PCs. In case you couldn’t keep track, Apple put together a handy graphic of all its favourite new features for this high-end device. It starts at $4999, like we said, but we can’t even fathom how much a top-end model will cost. The iMac Pro will launch in December. Keep checking back to this story for all the latest info.

The new iMacs have up to three times more powerful graphics abilities in comparison to previous generations, faster processors, Thunderbolt 3, and faster storage options. Apple said that the updates, along with refreshes of the MacBook, represent a lineup of Mac devices that are "stronger than ever." “With major updates to iMac, and a refresh of our MacBook and MacBook Pro lines, the Mac is stronger than ever,” said John Ternus, Apple’s vice president of Hardware Engineering. “Today iMac gets a huge graphics performance increase, faster CPU performance, Thunderbolt 3 and a brighter Retina display with support for 1 billion colors. We’re also increasing CPU and SSD speed on MacBook, adding faster processors and making faster graphics standard on our 15-inch MacBook Pro and introducing a new $1,299 (US) 13-inch MacBook Pro.” With the refresh, a Retina 4K display is also coming to the 21.5-inch iMac. Both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs feature faster Kaby Lake processors up to 4.2 GHz, with Turbo Boost speeds up to 4.5 GHz. The computers support twice the memory as the previous generation, and Fusion Drive will now be standard on all 27-inch iMac configurations, as well as on the top-end 21.5-inch iMac. SSD storage will become 50 percent faster on the refreshed iMacs, and graphics on the computers are more powerful thanks to new Radeon Pro 500-series cards with up to 8GB of vRAM. In terms of faster performance, the 21.5-inch model delivers up to three times faster speeds in comparison to the previous iMacs, while the 27-inch model is up to 50 percent faster.

Now people complain Apple updates Macs too often. :rolleyes: I guess I'm not furious, just disappointed. The timing between the 2016 release and this new update just feels too close, especially since I bought my MBP in January. Kaby Lake CPUs the MacBook Pro uses were not available until this year. I do think Apple wanted the tbMBP at last WDCC to allow Kaby Lake refresh at this WDCC, but couldn't get it ready in time so they had to push it to October.

I also have a late 2016 13" MBP and, while it would've been nice to have Kaby Lake when I bought it a few months ago, I'm glad I've been able to use it in the meantime rather than wait for this minor update. Rating: 11 Votes deadlystriker 3 days ago at 11:10 am Was hoping the MacBook get a thunderbolt 3 port Rating: 8 Votes gregnv 3 days ago at 03:14 pm Dear Apple, I am not sure you get the "Pro" thing. In general, consumer products are static in build at the time of purchase, while "pro" products allowed power users to adapt their hardware to changing needs and demands. By making the MBP a static product, you have made the MBP much less attractive to real pro users. In the past, an MBP would allow users to upgrade memory and storage to meet the demands of ever increasing file sizes and project sizes. This flexibility gave pro users confidence that the system they purchase today can, for a price, be adapted to the work that needs to be done next year of the year after. Today, because the MBP is a hardware static product upon purchase, there is no confidence that the machine you buy today will be able to keep up with your work demands even before AppleCare runs out. If you want to innovate, at least make the memory and SSD upgradable after purchase. If you want to lead, add in a way to upgrade the video card after purchase as well. You have sacrificed flexibility and power for being a bit lighter and thinner, which is fine for a consumer grade product, but it makes the purchase of a new MBP difficult to justify. - G Rating: 8 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming iPhone 8 Fall 2017 New design with full-front display and no Home button expected.

The event started with Apple CEO welcoming the audience at the 15th WWDC in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley where Apple is building its new campus. Before making the announcements, Cook said that this year "it is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever." Cook also praised the Apple developer community which has 16 million registered developers and added three million last year. He announced that Amazon`s video app will come to Apple`s TV streaming box later this year. The app will let users stream all the Amazon original hits. Soon after the announcement Amazon tweeted, "You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year." Apple also announced that watchOS 4, the next version of its smartwatch platform, will be arriving in September. It includes new features for watchfaces, such as complications updating based on time of day or location and a new Siri-based watchface. The Siri watchface uses machine learning to determine what information is most useful to you at a given point in time. Other new watchfaces include a kaleidoscope and new characters such as Woody, Jesse, and Buzz from the Toy Story movie franchise. WatchOS 4 will also bring updates to the watch`s fitness tracking, including a new user interface for the workout app and new integrations with gym equipment manufacturers. Apple said that watch wearers will be able to link their devices with the gym equipment through NFC. Next up in tech is Apple`s new version of macOS is called High Sierra which is launched with new Safari browser. Apple said that it is the fastest browser ever with features like autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention that uses machine learning to block irritating content. Apple also brought file system and virtual reality (VR) to High Sierra. The tech titan also announced updates to its entire MacBook line giving its laptops more powerful specifications in the form of the latest Intel chips. MacBook Pros will be shipped with Intel`s Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. The company also launched a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299. The newly updated MacBook laptops are now available. Apple also showed a sneak peek into a new all-in-one desktop called the iMac Pro. Called as "the most powerful Mac ever, the new product will be available from December starting at $4,999. The new machine will come with an 8-core Xeon processor, with configurations that scale up to an 18-core Xeon processor and an all-new AMD Radeon Vega graphics GPU, up to 16GB of VRAM and up to 4TB for SSD storage. Cook also launched iOS 11 with over 10 new features. He said that iOS 10 had nearly 96 per cent satisfaction with 86 per cent iPhone users installing the update as compared to only seven per cent Android users who installed Android Nougat - the latest version of Google`s operating system. The new iOS will now synchronize messages across iOS and macOS automatically. If a user erases a message on your iPhone or iPad, that will be reflected on the Mac as well. Apple also made improvements to Siri including making the assistant`s voice sound more natural when responding to users. Siri will now be able to perform translations in various languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Not only did Apple announce refreshes for its iMacs, but it also announced the iMac Pro for those who need a little more power. The company didn’t stop there, though, as it also revealed some updates to the MacBook and MacBook Pro. The biggest story of these updates is Kaby Lake. These new MacBooks will feature Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, much like the new line of iMacs that were announced today. These Kaby Lake processors should offer a fairly significant speed boost over the processors that came before them, so if you’ve been thinking about picking up a new MacBook, now might be the time to buy. We’ll also be able to look forward to faster SSDs in these new MacBooks, along with faster standard graphics in the 15-inch model. Even better is the fact that the base MacBook is getting something of a price cut, dropping to $1,299. Therefore, if you waited to pick up a MacBook until now, there might be some savings on the table. Apple didn’t just stop at MacBook Pros, also announcing that the MacBook Air is going to get a bit of a boost in clock speed. Strangely, Apple didn’t spend long on this topic, so we’re not quite sure if that means it’s going to have Kaby Lake processors or not, but at the very least, a faster MacBook Air will be great for people who love the platform (despite the fact that Apple maybe ignored it a little too much up until now). So, when do these bad boys launch? Today, alongside the new lineup of iMacs. Apple certainly is pulling out all the stops with launching these new Macs, holding only the new iMac Pro until later in the year. As you can see in the image above, prices for these new MacBooks range from $1,299 for the base MacBook all the way up to $2,399 for the 15-inch model with Touch Bar, so depending on which one you want, you could be plopping down a fair bit of cash.

The new iMacs mostly just feature refreshed and improved hardware specs, bringing Intel's 7th generation 'Kaby Lake' processors and updated screen that offer 43% more brightness and up to one billion colours. The all-in-one devices will also feature up to 32GB and 64GB of RAM for the 21.5- and 27-inch devices, respectively, alongside up to 2TB of SSD storage that is 50% faster compared to the previous generation. On the I/O side, things mostly stay the same but Apple has increased the number of available Thunderbolt 3 ports to 2. Apple has also taken heed of users' repeated requests for increased graphical processing power with the inclusion of a range of options from Intel Iris Pro Graphics 640 with 64MB of eDRAM to a range of options from Radeon's dedicated GPUs between 555 to the 580 with 4-8GB of RAM depending on your chosen configuration. As a result of this increased graphical fidelity, the higher-end iMacs will also be able to support VR experiences. On the notebook side of things, things are a little less exciting as the Cupertino giant has simply refreshed its line of notebook to the current generation of Intel's Kaby Lake processors, while the MacBook Air gets a modest speed bump. The new iMacs will run you from anywhere between $1099 for the base configuration of the 21.5 inch model up to a starting price of $1799 for the 5K 27-inch iMac. The MacBooks retain their starting price compared to the last generation (starting at $1299), though the entry level Touch Mar MacBook get a slight price drop, starting at $1799.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple updates its iMac lineup at WWDC Apple updates its iMac lineup at WWDC Matthew Wilson 3 days ago Apple, Featured Tech News Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference is officially under way and so far, there has been plenty of talk surrounding the Mac. We already knew that Apple was planning a Mac Pro redesign for 2018, which would be preceded by an iMac refresh this year. Now, the new series of iMacs is official, with improved displays, better CPUs and much better graphics performance. For starters, the new iMac displays are 500 nits brighter than the previous generation and can support up to 1 billion colours. Under the hood, Apple has made the jump to Intel’s 7th generation Kaby Lake processors and upped the memory capacity to 32GB of RAM for the 21.5-inch iMac and 64GB of RAM for the 27-inch version. The most important change to the iMac comes in the GPU department though. Going forward, all 4K 21.5-inch iMacs come with a discrete graphics chip, representing a huge 80 percent boost in graphics performance. The 27-inch 5K iMac will continue to come with discrete graphics, supplied by AMD. There are two Thunderbolt 3 ports included now to help users expand their system with different external devices. Interestingly enough, Apple also took the time to discuss virtual reality, pitching its new iMacs as great content creation tools for those looking to generate VR experiences and applications. The final thing worth noting is that macOS is also getting an update this year known as ‘High Sierra’, which will make various improvements to Safari and overall OS performance. KitGuru Says: There are still some more details to come but that is the general gist of Apple’s iMac presentation today. We will keep an eye on WWDC for any other major announcements. What do you guys think of the new iMacs? For me, it’s just nice to finally see Apple paying attention to the GPU. More often than not, graphics are overlooked in many of Apple’s machines.

These increasing sales figures were likely aided by the firm’s increasing presence in the media — especially announcements of big contracts with several major automakers, which are apparently eager to use its proprietary high-definition mapping tech for their own progress. Reuters provides more: “The Israeli-based company, which is in the process of being acquired by Intel Corp, said on Thursday it earned 25 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the first quarter, up from 15 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 66% to $124.7 million. Mobileye was forecast to have earned 24 cents on revenue of $118.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “In March, Intel agreed to buy Mobileye, which develops camera-based systems to help drivers avoid collisions, for $15.3 billion in a deal that promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. “In light of the pending transaction, Mobileye said it would not hold an earnings conference call and will not provide an outlook for its financial results for future period.” With regard to the comments earlier in the article about multiple major auto manufacturers signing up to share data obtained with Mobileye’s camera-equipped advanced driver assistance systems, in order to create unmatched HD maps for self-driving cars, it’s perhaps worth highlighting that these agreements cover the diverse giants Volkswagen Group, Nissan, and BMW.

Apple announces major MacOS Sierra update called...High Sierra Being a heavily display-focussed desktop computer, you want the display to be the best it can possibly be. Apple has now improved the brightness to 500 nits, making them 43 per cent brighter than previous generation. They also now use 10-bit dithering to deliver up to 1 billion colours, making them more accurate than ever before.  The processor have had a bit of a boost too. The iMacs will now be fitted with Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake processors and can be specced with more memory than ever before: up to 32GB on the 21.5-inch display models and up to 64GB of memory on the 27-inch models. Double the amount available on the previous generation. Apple's Fusion Drive storage system is now standard on all 27-inch iMacs and can be specced on the 21.5-inch models. The solid state storage drives (SSD) also now work up to 50% faster and can be specced up to 2TB. Graphics is an area that Apple has really stepped things up, though. The entry-level 21.5-inch iMac now has Intel Iris Plus graphics, which work 80 per cent faster than the previous generation. The 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display meanwhile will use discreet Radeon Pro 555 and 560 GPU processors, which are 3 times faster than the previous generation. The 27-inch iMac gets a serious boost indeed, and can now be specced with up to 8GB of VRAM, providing 5.5 teraflops of processing power, ideal for VR content creation. Connections-wise, the latest generation of iMacs will be gifted with two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3, ideal if you have any dongles and adapters from your new MacBook Pro. The latest generation iMacs will be available to order from today. The 21.5-inch entry-level iMac will cost $1,099, 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display takes a drop in price to $1,299, and the 27-inch iMac with 4K display will start at $1,799.

Though many rumors ahead of this event told us to expect new iPads and MacBooks, the first refresh Apple announced today is coming to its 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs. That comes as something of a surprise, but we don’t think the iMac faithful will mind much. Kicking things off, Apple said that these new machines have the best Mac displays ever. Some features Apple touched on include support for 500 nits, making it them 43% brighter than previous displays, 10-bit dithering, and support for up to one billion colors. That’s pretty impressive all its own, but the displays aren’t the only aspect getting an update today. These new iMacs will feature seventh-gen Kaby Lake processors from Intel. On 21.5-inch models, those processors will be working in tandem with up to 32GB of RAM on 21.5-inch models and up to 64GB of RAM on 27-inch models. These new all-in-ones also offer up to 2TB of SSD storage, with Fusion Drives now standard on all 27-inch models. Finally, we can look forward to two new Thunderbolt 3 ports on the backside of the device. There are three new models of iMacs in all. The base 21.5-inch model will utilize Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, while the mid-range 21.5-inch model will feature a Retina 4K display and Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete graphics. Finally, we come to the top of the line iMac introduced today, the 27-inch model that comes with a Retina 5K display and your choice of a Radeon Pro 570, 575, or 580. Of course, these machines will support VR content and development, with Apple diving into a Star Wars-themed demo for us. It sounds like Apple has put together some fairly solid all-in-ones here, but the big question now is “how much will they cost?” The base 21.5-inch model will set you back $1,099, the 4K 21.5-inch model costs $1,499, and finally, the 5K 27-inch model will cost a hefty $1,799. They’re available today too, so have at it, and be sure to check out our WWDC 2017 hub for more from the show!

In addition to a bunch of refreshed software, powering the next generation of iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and Apple TV gear, today’s jam-packed keynote may introduce the world to some sizzling hot hardware. A “narrow-bezel” iPad, Siri smart speaker, perhaps even a top-end family of 2017 MacBook Pros with Intel Kaby Lake inside. If that sounds like something you want to witness in real time, you obviously can, from the comfort of your own home, without having to cough up $1,599. Just head over to this link on iPhones, iPads or the iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or later, Macs with an OS X version newer than 10.8.5 and Safari 6.0.5 or up, or even on your Windows 10 PC running the Microsoft Edge browser. Second, third and fourth-gen Apple TVs can access the live stream directly from the Apple Events channel, while everyone else needs to wait for VLC workaround instructions. The shindig kicks off at 10 am PDT, which is 1 pm EDT, 6 pm BST, 7 pm CEST, 10:30 pm IST, 1 am CST (June 6), and 3 am AEST (also June 6). Join us in a few hours for all the coverage that matters.

In a reply brief picked up by CNET, executive vice president and general counsel for Qualcomm Don Rosenberg went after the FTC’s motion and several amici briefs from conglomerates and individual players like Samsung and Intel: [The] FTC cannot and has not adequately defended its defective complaint. The complaint lacks necessary facts and fails to plead a coherent theory of competitive harm. Improperly adding alleged ‘facts’ supplied by competitors’ briefs cannot prop up a deficient complaint. The San Diego-based chipmaker is vigorously defending itself from allegations of anti-competitive behavior — racking complicated royalty contracts with device manufacturers and stacking terms to prevent them from using competing products.

IBM, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung said Monday that they have found a way to make thinner transistors, which should enable them to pack 30 billion switches onto a microprocessor chip the size of a fingernail. The tech industry has been fueled for decades by the ability of chipmakers to shoehorn ever smaller, faster transistors into the chips that power laptops, servers, and mobile devices. But industry watchers have worried lately that technology was pushing the limits of Moore's Law -- a prediction made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that computing power would double every two years as chips got more densely packed. From a report: Today's chips are built with transistors whose dimensions measure 10 nanometers, which means about 1,000 fit end-to-end across the diameter of a human hair. The next generation will shrink that dimension to 7nm, and the IBM-Samsung development goes one generation beyond that to 5nm. That means transistors can be packed four times as densely on a chip compared with today's technology. "A nanosheet-based 5nm chip will deliver performance and power, together with density," said Huiming Bu, IBM's director of silicon integration and device research. Take all those numbers with a nanograin of salt, though, because chipmakers no longer agree on what exactly they're measuring about transistors. And there's also a long road between this research announcement and actual commercial manufacturing. IBM believes this new process won't cost any more than chips with today's transistor designs, but its approach requires an expensive shift that chipmakers have put off for years: the use of extreme ultraviolet light to etch chip features onto silicon wafers. samsung technology ibm ← You may like to read: → Silicon Valley Is Too Focused On Taking the Easy Path in Health Care Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Twitter Suspends American Far-Right Activists' Accounts Former Engineer Says Uber Is a Nightmare of Sexism; CEO Orders Urgent Investigation When Their Shifts End, Uber Drivers Set Up Camp in Parking Lots Across the US Harvard Pulls Student Offers Over Online Comments IBM Research Alliance Has Figured Out How To Make 5nm Chips More | Reply Login IBM Research Alliance Has Figured Out How To Make 5nm Chips Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Considering Silicon can't scale past ~5 GHz, whereas GaAs can scale to 500+ GHz I see this as a stop-gap solution.

Oliver pointed out that the major goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep CO2 below what is known as the world's "carbon budget" because if we fail to limit the temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius, studies show that things get potentially irreversible — leading to longer droughts and more intense heat waves that would affect the world food supply. And then there are the jobs that have been created due to the world's attention to the climate. Before Trump made the decision to leave the Paris accord last Thursday, 25 companies — including Microsoft and Intel — took out a full-page ad in The New York Times urging Trump to stay in the agreement because it "generates jobs and economic growth." "Well, c'mon, he was clearly never going to be convinced by an ad in The New York Times. How was he going to see it?" Oliver said. "If those companies really wanted to get his attention, they needed to talk KFC into giving out a full-bucket ad, which he would read on the toilet while eating chicken, because that — at its core — is who our president is." Oliver also touched on what the agreement required — in that there were no requirements. Though Trump stated last Thursday that the agreement would affect the country's coal business, the Paris accord had no restrictions on coal. "It doesn't even contain the word 'coal' in the agreement," Oliver said. And perhaps what's most misunderstood about the accord is that goals set by the countries are completely voluntary and there are no penalties if they aren't met. "The only penalty was shame, and unfortunately this president is completely immune to the very concept of that," Oliver said.

Best overall Dell XPS 13 See at Dell The XPS 13 is a premium laptop offered by Dell, and it is a superb match for students. Sporting the latest generation of Intel processors, even in the base model configuration, the slim and powerful notebook will be more than a match for both studies and downtime. Bottom line: Great overall product with enough punch for demanding tasks. One more thing: It has a backlit keyboard for those late-evening sessions. Why the XPS 13 is the best laptop for students The XPS 13 by Dell is the entry product in the XPS line of premium laptops, but it is an ideal match for students looking to take advantage of capable hardware to help with their studies. The beauty of the XPS 13 is you're able to configure it exactly how you wish. Need more than 128GB of SSD storage? Simply add a 256GB drive when ordering or install one after the laptop gets delivered, if you can save money through Amazon or another online retailer. Then you have a Full HD display with barely any bezel, which can be bumped to QHD with touch-screen support. Speaking of specifications, the XPS 13 was recently refreshed by Dell to include Intel's seventh-gen Kaby Lake processors. These components are matched with at least 4GB of RAM and Killer 1535 wireless connectivity. The latter improvement with the XPS 13 is a major benefit for students here, thanks to its excellent wireless range and reliability. The laptop can also be personalized with a choice of color: silver or rose gold. The keyboard is likely what will be used the most, and this is probably the laptop's weak spot. It's not the worst keyboard on a laptop by any means, but it's also not considered by many to be among the best. With only 1.3mm of key travel (how far the key can be pressed down), it can feel somewhat "mushy" to those who are used to desktop mechanical keyboards or other portable PCs with enhanced means of input. There's also an issue with oil stains after considerable amounts of use. Overlooking the keyboard, you have a super-portable laptop with a gorgeous display and excellent performance. Couple all that with improved battery life (thanks to expanded capacity and the newest processors) and you've got one fantastic device for any student to rely on. See our review of the XPS 13 Practical HP Notebook 15-ay011nr See at Amazon Powered by an Intel i5 processor alongside 8GB of RAM, this capable HP laptop is ready to go with up to seven hours of use. Take advantage of the 15-inch display for maximum productivity. Bottom line: It's a good, portable notebook that won't break the bank. One more thing: It comes with 1TB of internal storage. Premium ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 See at Amazon This laptop is made out of aluminum, sports an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and has a great keyboard for those intense Word document sessions. Being rather thin and light also makes this ASUS notebook incredibly portable. Bottom line: This is the best looking laptop in our roundup. One more thing: There's a built-in fingerprint sensor. Affordable HP X360 See at Amazon This is by no means the most powerful PC on our list, only featuring a Celeron processor and not even 1080p display resolution, but this is an affordable laptop and one that's also a 2-in-1. Bottom line: It's an affordable package that doesn't feature top-end hardware but does have a few tricks up its sleeve. One more thing: The display can flip around and be used like a tablet. Professional Microsoft Surface Pro 4 See at Amazon The Surface Pro 4 is Microsoft's main tablet-come-laptop combo, and it starts at $799. Depending on your desired configuration, the Surface tablet can be as powerful as your needs require it to be, with the option of an Intel Core i7 processor. Bottom line: The Surface Pro brings a whole new level of productivity to the portable-PC table. One more thing: It's an excellent investment for any student who can take advantage of the pen functionality. Conclusion There are a great number of affordable, yet powerful laptops available for students. It's important to invest in a unit that offers sound battery life, ample amounts of power, as well as a striking design for anyone who is looking to dive deep into books. There are some excellent examples of this in our guide here, but overall we'd recommend the Dell XPS 13, if the price tag doesn't put you off. Best overall Dell XPS 13 See at Dell The XPS 13 is a premium laptop offered by Dell, and it is a superb match for students. Sporting the latest generation of Intel processors, even in the base model configuration, the slim and powerful notebook will be more than a match for both studies and downtime. Bottom line: Great overall product with enough punch for demanding tasks. One more thing: It has a backlit keyboard for those late-evening sessions. 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Computex 2017 also hosted a live PC case modding challenge so, as well as some truly innovative designs sponsored by the likes of InWin and displayed on their dedicated stands, there were plenty of additional wacky mods floating around. There were some rather unusual sleep aids on offer too, some bonkers smart, connected devices and we got a sneak peek at Intel’s as yet unreleased Skylake X. Best of Computex 2017: The top 5 tech products on show Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter Computex Modding Challenge PC case modders from around the world had just 24 hours to complete their builds. Here are some of the best we found: Mod Case Alien Pocket-lint Team China’s entry into the World Modding Comp was particularly impressive. It feature a moving, expanding chest and more neon piping than you can shake a stick at. Team Aus Pocket-lint We kind of liked the dystopian feel of Team Australia’s entry in the World Modding Comp. ASRock Pocket-lint We spotted this rather special boat-shaped case on the ASRock stand. Donkey Kong Cabinet Pocket-lint ThermalMike for Team USA made this retro gaming case, which was thoroughly admired by the crowds at the ThermalTake stand. Cooler Master Wheel Pocket-lint The Wheel of Star is a mod by Modder Crow from Thailand and was on the Cooler Master stand. AeroCool gaming beanbags Pocket-lint AeroCool reckons it has created the world’s first gaming beanbags. We tried them all out and we think the one on the left is the best. Sadly, they’re still just concept pieces but hopefully AeroCool will decide to bring them to market because they are pretty damn comfy. Livewire WBPA shaking bed Pocket-lint Ever wished you could burn calories while lounging in bed? The Liveware WBPA adjustable bed has you covered, from a gentle rocking motion right up to the tumultuous seventh speed which could help you slim while simply lying down. Bonkers. Smart Temphawk wine cooler Pocket-lint There’s nothing like using a super sophisticated temperature control system for a menial task. This smart, connected Temphawk device will keep your wine right at the correct temperature, but is generally used to monitor food temps during deliveries. The customer can check that, for example, their sashimi has been kept cool for the whole journey during delivery by simply checking on their phone for details. Phone-controlled automatic shoe laces Pocket-lint Because some days lacing up your shoes just seems like too much of a faff. By controlling them through your phone, it goes one step further even than Back to the Future II. Gigabyte PC case mods Pocket-lint As always, Gigabyte had some cool mods in its private showroom. This one by Maciel Baretto (Brazil), based on an Auorus Gaming 9 system, was particularly eye catching. Asus ROG Macial Pocket-lint Another classic PC mod from Brazil’s Maciel Barretto was based on an Asus ROG. We particularly liked the Van de Graaf machine. InWin Spherical case mod Pocket-lint This is the only spherical case we saw at this year's event and we have to say we were quite taken with Wei Zheng (Ai Mask)’s creation. WeeView 3D video livestreaming Pocket-lint Last year, WeeView brought us a 3D camera attachment for mobile phones. This year the company unveiled devices to livestream your 3D videos. Jumpy kids phone watch Pocket-lint The Jumpy is a mini mobile phone to strap on your kid’s wrist. It’s designed to take some knocks, can send and receive voice and messages and can even control this little toy car made out of Lego-style bricks. Next Drive Spectra DAC headphones amplifier Pocket-lint DAC headphone amplifiers are nothing new but we particularly liked the discrete slimline design of the Spectra from Next Drive. The company claims it is the world’s smallest in fact. We had a listen to the output with and without the Spectra from a standard laptop on the stand and the version without sounded so dull that we had to switch it off. It retails for around £115 plus VAT from the company's website: www.nextdrive-spectra.io. PhotoFast Flash Drive Pocket-lint PhotoFast generally specialises in iPhone solutions and it was showing off this multipurpose flash drive at the show. We thought the way the Micro USB was embedded into the USB connection was pretty nifty. PhotoFast in-call recorder Pocket-lint PhotoFast was also showing off this in-call recorder that is attached through the Lightning connection on the iPhone. The company suggested it was useful for scenarios such as complex technical calls on the go so that notes or reference could be made at a later date. Smart "caught-cheating" undies Pocket-lint We were incredibly confused by the "Men’s Sexual Data" feature on this smart underwear. The sales reps sombrely informed us that it allows a partner to track how long their husband’s underpants have been removed for, using a sensor on their phone. The male rep chipped-in with a rather outrageous (and wholly untrue) comment: "Because only men cheat!". Don’t worry, there’s also a sedentary measurement too - presumably so the wearer can also be caught out slumming around and doing nothing all day too. Smart sheet Pocket-lint If the smart undies are to designed to catch cheating spouses, God only knows what this smart sheet from the same company is supposed to achieve. Makeblock robot building kits Pocket-lint If you think that Lego kits have taken all the skill and creativity out of building things for kids you’ll probably love these Meccano-reminiscent robot building kits from Makeblock. There is a full-on 17 parts box kit designed for schools too. It’s not cheap though. The mini kits start at $100 and the full range is a cool $7,000: www.makeblock.com. Makeblock modular drone Pocket-lint This foam modular drone is also from Makeblock and we reckon it would make any kid's Christmas to wake up to one of these in his or her stocking. Santa could use one to deliver it too. It will set you back $180 mind you: www.makeblock.com. Intel Skylake X chip Pocket-lint We were lucky enough to get a sneak peak at Intel’s as yet unreleased Skylake X processing chip. Overclocking meister HWbot ran the sister chip, the Kabylake X, down to -269-dgrees Celsius (just 3-degrees above max zero O-degree Kevalan) at its pre-Computex overclocking event on Monday night in Taipei. Asus ROG curve Pocket-lint This massive, 35-inch curved monitor from Asus' ROG brand has UWQHD resolution. We wondered aloud if it would be possible to set three up together and were assured technically it was, but it would have to be a very serious system indeed. Corsair Concept Zeus Qi charging mouse pad Pocket-lint One can always count on Corsair to come up with some nifty peripheral at Computex. This year it was its Concept Zeus Qi-enabled charging mouse pad. Drop your wireless mouse on the spot when you’re done or use it to charge your phone wirelessly. Corsair K68 water resistant keyboard Pocket-lint Although it was hard to get a decent photo of this, you’re looking at the spill and dust resistant K68 mechanical keyboard from Cosair being continually drenched with water. Corsair Concept Curve PC Pocket-lint Corsair also likes to show off awesome concept PCs. This year it came up with the Concept Curve. The company removed the side panels/top and replaced them with curved tempered glass and finished the whole thing off with $10,000-worth of hand-laid carbon fibre. Cheapskates. Corsair Concept Slate PC Pocket-lint We rather thought that Corsair’s Concept Slate could have used a few more fans. 32 simply isn’t enough you know. There are, after all, two PCs in there. Full-colour 3D printer Pocket-lint The 3D printer that made these full-colour figurines won a Best in Show award from the organisers at Computex this year. Unfortunately, we didn't find out its actual name. Chess-playing robot Pocket-lint We would have challenged this robot to a game, but we did pretty badly playing ping pong against a robot at CEATEC Tokyo last September and our egos felt a little too fragile that morning. Plus, we saw it raised its arms in triumph when it beat this lady and we didn’t want to encourage it any further.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC Press Release Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC 05 Jun 2017 FRAMINGHAM, Mass., June 5, 2017 – The worldwide wearables market maintained its upward trajectory during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with Xiaomi and Apple leading all companies and multiple products experiencing double- and triple-digit growth. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, companies shipped a total of 24.7 million wearable devices during 1Q17, up 17.9% from the 20.9 million units shipped in 1Q16. “Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products,” noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC’s Wearables team. “This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide. Now that Xiaomi and Apple have supplanted Fitbit, the next question is whether they will be able to maintain their position. “However, by no means should Fitbit be removed from the wearables conversation,” continued Llamas. “With a user base of 50 million, a strong presence within corporate wellness, and assets that keep it top of mind for digital health, Fitbit is well positioned to move into new segments and markets.” “The market is arguably still in the first phase of development, where companies are focused on seeding wearables into the market,” said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. “It’s all about getting people accustomed to the idea of wearing a device. And the opportunity remains very enticing for traditional and fashion watch brands as the scale of the consumer electronics market far surpasses their world. “The second phase of development will be all about putting user data to good use,” continued Ubrani. “This is when step counts translate into healthier hearts and minds. And it’s also when we will start to see devices that actually augment our abilities and make our lives easier or more productive rather than just being another screen we keep an eye on.” Company Highlights Xiaomi started 2017 as the co-leader of the worldwide wearables market alongside Apple, having spent several years as the number two or three company. More than 96% of its shipment volume – primarily fitness tracking wristbands – remained within China, and many were shipped as part of smartphone bundles to consumers. The company is branching out from wristwear, having announced its “90 Minutes Ultra Smart Sportswear” shoes powered by Intel’s Curie. Apple saw sustained demand for its Watches nearly two quarters after the Series 1 and Series 2 versions launched to the market, and recorded the second highest year-over-year growth among the leading companies. The Series 1 and 2 have been a welcome change from the higher priced and undifferentiated experience found on the original Apple Watch from a year ago, attracting both first-time users and those seeking to replace their previous Watches. Having led the wearables market for several years, Fitbit finds itself in third place to start off 2017. Still, the company believes that there is market need for fitness trackers with the launch of its Alta HR and continued popularity of its Charge 2 wristband and Blaze watch. Moreover, its recent acquisitions of Coin, Pebble, and Vector are expected to translate into the company’s first smartwatch. Samsung led all companies in year-over-year growth, nearly doubling its wearables volumes from a year ago. Driving volumes higher were its Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which in many markets had their first full quarter of availability, as well as its IconX headphones and Gear Fit 2 fitness band. Altogether, the diversification of products is several steps ahead of Samsung’s smartwatch-only emphasis from a year ago. Garmin‘s shift from basic wearables to smart wearables continued in earnest during 1Q17, with total volumes for each nearly equaling each other. Key to this was the addition of Vivo- and Fenix-branded smartwatches that address citizen athletes and outdoors enthusiasts with third party applications beyond health and fitness. The introduction of the Fenix 5 also boded well for the company as the smaller size made the watch accessible to a wider audience.

Apple's big developer conference, WWDC 2017, has begun and its opening keynote has just finished. Amongst other things, we've had several new announcements including a MacBook Pro refresh. Here's what we know so far: MacBook Pro 2017 – What's changed The big change here is the addition of Kaby Lake processors. That's Intel's 7th generation chipset and means the entire MacBook Pro line has received a significant bump in processing power, with new processor models from the more efficient generation of chips. There’s also a new 13-inch MacBook Pro configuration, that comes sans Touch Bar but starts at the lower price of £1249/$1299. A lower-price MacBook Pro was something many people had been clamouring for, although it appears the only change that's been made to make this possible is halving the base model of storage to 128GB. Our tables below show you what's new, with each model compared with its 2016 equivalent. Model 2016 CPU 2017 CPU 13 non-touch 2-3.1GHz Core i5 2.3-3.6GHz Core i5 13 non-touch 2.4-3.4GHz Core i7 2.5-4GHz Core i5 13 Touch 2.9-3.3GHz Core i5 3.1-3.5GHz Core i5 13 Touch 3.1-3.5GHz Core i5 3.3-3.7GHz Core i5 13 Touch 3.3-3.6GHz Core i7 3.5-4GHz Core i7 15 Touch 2.6-3.5GHz quad-core Core i7 2.8-3.8GHz quad-core Core i7 15 Touch 2.7-3.6GHz quad-core Core i7 2.9-3.9GHz quad-core Core i7 15 Touch 2.9-3.8GHz quad-core Core i7 3.1-4.1Ghz quad-core Core i7 Model 2016 GPU 2017 GPU 13 non-touch Intel Iris 540 Intel Iris Plus 640 13 Touch Intel Iris 550 Intel Iris Plus 650 15 Touch Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 Radeon Pro 555 or 560 Model 2016 memory 2017 memory 13 non-touch 8-16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 8-16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 13 touch 8-16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 8-16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 15 touch 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 Related: iOS 11 There doesn't appear to have been a bump in memory, which initial reports suggested, and we're stuck on a maximum of 16GB for all the devices. But the base model now gets 2133MHz memory, where before it was limited to 1866MHz. Other than that, not much has changed. Previous reports suggested we'd see a new in-house chip that would improve low-power performance when the device is sleeping, but Apple mentioned no such thing during the WWDC Keynote. That means the new MacBook Pro 2017 comes with all the same specs as existing models, from the Retina displays, Touch Bars on more expensive models and plenty of Thunderbolt 3 support. We'll add more as we learn more. New MacBook Pro 2017 Price and Release Date As mentioned, the new MacBook Pros are available right now and the prices have changed. The 13-inch model is starting at £1249/$1,299 and the 15-inch starting at £2349/$2399. Stay tuned for all the latest from WWDC as TrustedReviews will be providing updates throughout the night. Let us know what you want to see from the new MacBook Pros in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments SoCal482 June 5, 2017, 6:39 pm I'm pretty sure Apple users have been asking for more RAM for MBPs longer than 'since last year' - try 'forever'. zofrex June 5, 2017, 7:40 pm Are you sure about that RAM bump for the Macbook Pro? :P danwat1234 June 5, 2017, 8:10 pm Wow ... . still only 16GB of RAM. Come on now.. Minor CPU speed bump as expected with Kaby Lake. Steven L. VanAllen June 5, 2017, 8:12 pm I heard it's going to be 32GB RAM. Tim Edmonds June 5, 2017, 8:13 pm Still 16 gb RAM, Bye Bye Macbook Pro, Hello Dell XPS 15 and Linux. They should rename it the Macboob Amateur. Lucius June 5, 2017, 8:15 pm There better be a darn good reason why they can't include an option for 32GB of RAM. Michael Passingham June 5, 2017, 8:32 pm Indeed, slight error as wires were crossed over the upgraded iMacs. Corrected now, and thanks! jms June 5, 2017, 10:01 pm 16gb in 2017... so much for being long on AAPL.. GORDON RAMSAY June 5, 2017, 10:53 pm Got my order in for my new 15" MBP, whee! A speed bump, but I'm upgrading from a mid-2015. Can't wait to get it. GORDON RAMSAY June 5, 2017, 10:54 pm Ha ha, you have stock to sell? I'll take it! ;') Oleg Lustenko June 6, 2017, 12:08 pm because that Kaby Lake processor isn't energy efficient enough to add more RAM. With 32GB RAM laptop will spend much more energy and uptime will fall dramatically. Intel will update processors in autumn, interest what Apple will doing with these Ciprian Alexandru June 6, 2017, 1:13 pm I own a one month old MBP that was taken out of the box and activated exactly two weeks ago. Apple knew that they would give MBP a refresh with the Kaby Lake CPU and it would had been moral to make that clear to the public. Instead Apple for the reason of not loosing any sells on the new MBP decided to stay quiet like this is not even an issue. Remember this is not an usual upgrade cycle for MBP and I am sure that some buyers would have had waited for the new release if they knew their machine would become "previous model" a few months after purchase. As a result of this the value of your machine would go down at least a couple hundred dollars if you decide to sell; if you look at your MBP as an asset, and why not, you have incurred a loss. The bottom line is that this was a profitable strategic move for Apple @ the cost of its early adopters and I think they should do something about it. Lucius June 6, 2017, 3:50 pm Would Apple come out with another model so soon after this latest one? Or more like 2018? Luke Fisher June 6, 2017, 5:20 pm Think I'll wait for 2018 upgrade to 32GB RAM.. if it does happen. Drew June 6, 2017, 6:16 pm Apple might have known, but it’s often not up to Apple when it comes to chipsets. Often, one manufacturer will buy exclusive access to have a chip release first for several months before all other competitors, and it turns into a bidding war to the highest bidder. With every chip release, just because it’s “out” doesn’t mean every hardware manufacturer is licensed to use it. Or it would be too expensive to purchase licensing straight away. Blame the chip companies, not the hardware manufacturers. That said, Apple still knows when they’re getting access to the new line, and could have disclosed that. No arguments there. Lucius June 7, 2017, 3:16 pm Personally, the difference between 16 and 32GB is not enough for me to change "ecosystem". For my purposes 16 GB will suffice though 32 would be nice for "future proofing" and super intense multitasking. At the end of the day, I do photography editing, vector graphics, light 3D work, 1080p video editing, multimedia powepoint/keynote, with some gaming like F1 2016. Not to mention word processing, multi document editing and note taking for graduate school, which makes the size and weight of the 15" ideal. For those purposes 16GB works just fine. If I were doing hardcore 4K video/sound editing, multiple 50 megapixel image manipulation in photoshop, 3D animation and internet...at the same time...then yeah, 32 might be needed. Or maybe if I needed three Virtual Machines running at the same time for developing. Then again, if I WERE doing all that and really needed 32 GB RAM I'm pretty sure I'd be using a desktop and maybe going for 64GB RAM at that point with a 6 or 8GB GPU. Obviously the MBP isn't for everyone, but I believe it strikes a good balance for me. Lucius June 7, 2017, 6:07 pm It's all about the niche they're made for. At this point most people don't need 32GB of RAM on a laptop; if you do, congratulations, go buy a Lenovo workhorse, I hear they're awesome. And the argument that "professionals" MUST have at least 32GB of RAM or they don't qualify as professional is plain absurd. There's a lot of types of professionals out there. 16GB of RAM on a laptop with that footprint, weight, portability, SSD speed, USB-C transfer speeds, GPU (which is not terrible by any means unless you're just out for hyperbole), that can be used with an external GPU via USB-C and 5K displays...is nothing to sneeze at. Now if you wanna have a d*** measuring contest, that's another story. jms June 7, 2017, 6:17 pm Stop. Whatever you do for a living, it clearly doesnt require multiple VMs and Java apps running at the same time. So have a great time browsing IG with vim running in a console, god bless you and your life, but every systems / security admin I know is running multiple VMs and Java apps at the same time and for the better part of 2 years, we've been migrating to more robust hardware because of it. And that's a huge problem for those of us who wish to remain on OSX. Lucius June 7, 2017, 6:59 pm No I get why it's a huge problem for you, but clearly Apple must have had a reason for not including 32GB of RAM as an option for their hardware and I bet those reasons had very much to do with profit and the limitations of the technology they're currently using. Do you really think that Apple is going to suffer financially because they're not addressing people's need for 32GB of RAM? jms June 7, 2017, 7:08 pm I think that if Apple wasnt going to follow through on its numerous public commitments to upgrade RAM, thats news a lot of us could have used earlier. I also think turning what was once the best-in-slot laptop into a disposable and underpowered gimmick shows exactly how badly Apple has misjudged the roots of consumer faith in what was once both an expensive and totally essential tool. I'm now hearing rumors that they are going to come out with a 32gb model in 3 months, btw, but at this point I think they would say anything to keep their cult of core evangelists faithful. Lucius June 7, 2017, 7:43 pm Power and "professional" users (whatever that means) made the Mac trendy and fashionable and now Apple is milking that brand loyalty and appeal for all its worth by addressing a different user niche. Is it a sustainable practice? Not really, but in the short run it's very profitable and I'm sure they've got themselves covered in other ways for the future. Honestly though, "disposable and underpowered gimmick" is a bit dramatic. It's non-upgradable for a reason (whether that reason is worth it to you or not is subjective), it's plenty powerful enough for many users and the reason why you think its disposable and underpowered is because it wasn't made with *your* specific needs in mind. I'm sorry that you're not one of those users but for many, the balance they achieved in power, portability, functionality and style makes it a very solid computer. I doubt you're gonna just up and stop using Apple products altogether anyways (or maybe you will). You'll just start using something else for the things that need it, like you said. Where have you heard rumors of a 32GB model coming in three months? And when did Apple make public commitments to specifically upgrade RAM? jms June 7, 2017, 8:21 pm Go to bed Tim Cook, you're drunk. jms June 7, 2017, 8:41 pm The only thing more offensive than the RAM issue are the Fedora flavored fan boys defending it. Lucius June 7, 2017, 9:01 pm Dog-nabbit! You found me out! Sorry friend, I don't have time to get drunk; I'm too busy making millions. Also, it's only 2 PM in California. jms June 7, 2017, 9:02 pm It's wine oclock somewhere... I hope...

Get Flash to see this player. Reckons price-to-performance ratio makes it great for high-end NAS. High-end NAS units tend to have powerful CPUs at their helm, helping buffer operations when eight to 16 drives are in a box. Historically, these have been powered by Intel processors, typically the Core series or, looking to the extreme end of the market, Xeons. However, the recent release of AMD Ryzen 7 processors have brought high-end performance down to a more agreeable price point. This is why Qnap, a leading NAS provider is the first to use Ryzen 7 chips in its six, eight, and 12-bay NAS boxes known as TS-x77. Watch the video to hear Banson Chang, general manager, talk through the benefits and opportunities that running Ryzen 7 brings to QNAP.

Posted by qasdfdsaq - Wed 07 Jun 2017 00:21 While Ryzen isn't much interest to me in a desktop CPU atm, I'm definitely attracted to the idea of a cheap, ECC-capable 6-8 core CPU in my NAS box. My existing 26-drive NAS uses a quad-core E3 Xeon only because an E5 would have cost ridiculous amounts. Ryzen is presenting an incredibly good perf per pound/dollar proposition for 8-core ECC systems. A R7 1700 doubles the core count of my E3-1230v3 while matching the clockspeed and reducing the power consumption all for barely 10% higher cost.

If you prefer to hide a PC behind a monitor, you can't go far wrong with one of the Gigabyte BRIX mini PCs. They've been available for a few generations of Intel chips now, offering a mix of Celeron, Pentium, and Core i3, i5, and i7 options. But more recently Gigabyte expanded the range and the size of the case to allow for performance for gaming. With that in mind, Gigabyte just launched the BRIX Gaming VR mini PC. It's a tiny tower PC that manages to cram in a 7th generation Kaby Lake Core i7-7700HQ processor and a GeForce GTX 1060 GPU complete with 6GB GDDR5 RAM. Even though the case only measures 220-by-110-by-110mm, there's room to fit two M.2 SSDs, a 2.5-inch HDD or SSD, and two SO-DIMM slots for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM. Gigabyte is also generous with ports. There's HDMI (x2), Mini DisplayPort (x2), USB 3.0 (x3), and two USB 3.1 ports with one of those being USB Type C. Display resolution support includes 4096-by-2160 over HDMI and 3840-by-2160 over Mini DisplayPort, with this BRIX capable of running quad displays. There's also Gigabit LAN, Dual Band Wireless-AC, and Bluetooth 4.2. Related Gigabyte's Latest BRIX PC Is for IoT Gigabyte's Latest BRIX PC Is for IoT You'd expect the combination of a Core i7 and GTX 1060 GPU in such a small package to generate a lot of heat and therefore cooling fan noise. But that's apparently not the case according to Gigabyte. The Gaming VR produces 20dB when idle, increasing to just 35dB under full load. If that's the case, noise will not be an issue. The BRIX Gaming VR was originally unveiled during CES in January and finally saw a launch during Computex last week. We still don't know pricing, but expect this tiny desktop PC to appear for sale very soon.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC FRAMINGHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The worldwide wearables market maintained its upward trajectory during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with Xiaomi and Apple leading all companies and multiple products experiencing double- and triple-digit growth. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, companies shipped a total of 24.7 million wearable devices during 1Q17, up 17.9% from the 20.9 million units shipped in 1Q16. „Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products,” noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC’s Wearables team. „This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide. Now that Xiaomi and Apple have supplanted Fitbit, the next question is whether they will be able to maintain their position. „However, by no means should Fitbit be removed from the wearables conversation,” continued Llamas. „With a user base of 50 million, a strong presence within corporate wellness, and assets that keep it top of mind for digital health, Fitbit is well positioned to move into new segments and markets.” „The market is arguably still in the first phase of development, where companies are focused on seeding wearables into the market,” said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. „It’s all about getting people accustomed to the idea of wearing a device. And the opportunity remains very enticing for traditional and fashion watch brands as the scale of the consumer electronics market far surpasses their world. „The second phase of development will be all about putting user data to good use,” continued Ubrani. „This is when step counts translate into healthier hearts and minds. And it’s also when we will start to see devices that actually augment our abilities and make our lives easier or more productive rather than just being another screen we keep an eye on.” Company Highlights Xiaomi started 2017 as the co-leader of the worldwide wearables market alongside Apple, having spent several years as the number two or three company. More than 96% of its shipment volume – primarily fitness tracking wristbands – remained within China, and many were shipped as part of smartphone bundles to consumers. The company is branching out from wristwear, having announced its „90 Minutes Ultra Smart Sportswear” shoes powered by Intel’s Curie. Apple saw sustained demand for its Watches nearly two quarters after the Series 1 and Series 2 versions launched to the market, and recorded the second highest year-over-year growth among the leading companies. The Series 1 and 2 have been a welcome change from the higher priced and undifferentiated experience found on the original Apple Watch from a year ago, attracting both first-time users and those seeking to replace their previous Watches. Having led the wearables market for several years, Fitbit finds itself in third place to start off 2017. Still, the company believes that there is market need for fitness trackers with the launch of its Alta HR and continued popularity of its Charge 2 wristband and Blaze watch. Moreover, its recent acquisitions of Coin, Pebble, and Vector are expected to translate into the company’s first smartwatch. Samsung led all companies in year-over-year growth, nearly doubling its wearables volumes from a year ago. Driving volumes higher were its Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which in many markets had their first full quarter of availability, as well as its IconX headphones and Gear Fit 2 fitness band. Altogether, the diversification of products is several steps ahead of Samsung’s smartwatch-only emphasis from a year ago. Garmin‚s shift from basic wearables to smart wearables continued in earnest during 1Q17, with total volumes for each nearly equaling each other. Key to this was the addition of Vivo- and Fenix-branded smartwatches that address citizen athletes and outdoors enthusiasts with third party applications beyond health and fitness. The introduction of the Fenix 5 also boded well for the company as the smaller size made the watch accessible to a wider audience.   Top 5 Worldwide Wearable Device Companies, Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, Q1 2017 (shipments in millions) Company       1Q17 Shipment Volumes     1Q17 Market Share     1Q16 Shipment Volumes     1Q16 Market Share     Year Over Year Change 1.

Expansion Through Acquisition Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC FRAMINGHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The worldwide wearables market maintained its upward trajectory during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with Xiaomi and Apple leading all companies and multiple products experiencing double- and triple-digit growth. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, companies shipped a total of 24.7 million wearable devices during 1Q17, up 17.9% from the 20.9 million units shipped in 1Q16. „Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products,” noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC’s Wearables team. „This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide. Now that Xiaomi and Apple have supplanted Fitbit, the next question is whether they will be able to maintain their position. „However, by no means should Fitbit be removed from the wearables conversation,” continued Llamas. „With a user base of 50 million, a strong presence within corporate wellness, and assets that keep it top of mind for digital health, Fitbit is well positioned to move into new segments and markets.” „The market is arguably still in the first phase of development, where companies are focused on seeding wearables into the market,” said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. „It’s all about getting people accustomed to the idea of wearing a device. And the opportunity remains very enticing for traditional and fashion watch brands as the scale of the consumer electronics market far surpasses their world. „The second phase of development will be all about putting user data to good use,” continued Ubrani. „This is when step counts translate into healthier hearts and minds. And it’s also when we will start to see devices that actually augment our abilities and make our lives easier or more productive rather than just being another screen we keep an eye on.” Company Highlights Xiaomi started 2017 as the co-leader of the worldwide wearables market alongside Apple, having spent several years as the number two or three company. More than 96% of its shipment volume – primarily fitness tracking wristbands – remained within China, and many were shipped as part of smartphone bundles to consumers. The company is branching out from wristwear, having announced its „90 Minutes Ultra Smart Sportswear” shoes powered by Intel’s Curie. Apple saw sustained demand for its Watches nearly two quarters after the Series 1 and Series 2 versions launched to the market, and recorded the second highest year-over-year growth among the leading companies. The Series 1 and 2 have been a welcome change from the higher priced and undifferentiated experience found on the original Apple Watch from a year ago, attracting both first-time users and those seeking to replace their previous Watches. Having led the wearables market for several years, Fitbit finds itself in third place to start off 2017. Still, the company believes that there is market need for fitness trackers with the launch of its Alta HR and continued popularity of its Charge 2 wristband and Blaze watch. Moreover, its recent acquisitions of Coin, Pebble, and Vector are expected to translate into the company’s first smartwatch. Samsung led all companies in year-over-year growth, nearly doubling its wearables volumes from a year ago. Driving volumes higher were its Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which in many markets had their first full quarter of availability, as well as its IconX headphones and Gear Fit 2 fitness band. Altogether, the diversification of products is several steps ahead of Samsung’s smartwatch-only emphasis from a year ago. Garmin‚s shift from basic wearables to smart wearables continued in earnest during 1Q17, with total volumes for each nearly equaling each other. Key to this was the addition of Vivo- and Fenix-branded smartwatches that address citizen athletes and outdoors enthusiasts with third party applications beyond health and fitness. The introduction of the Fenix 5 also boded well for the company as the smaller size made the watch accessible to a wider audience.   Top 5 Worldwide Wearable Device Companies, Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, Q1 2017 (shipments in millions) Company       1Q17 Shipment Volumes     1Q17 Market Share     1Q16 Shipment Volumes     1Q16 Market Share     Year Over Year Change 1.

The tech industry has been fueled for decades by the ability of chipmakers to shoehorn ever smaller, faster transistors into the chips that power laptops, servers, and mobile devices. But industry watchers have worried lately that technology was pushing the limits of Moore's Law—a prediction made by Intel (intc) co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that chips could double in power every two years or less. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily tech newsletter. Monday's news means they could enable the production of smaller, 5-nanometer processors within a few years. Most of today's high-end chips sport 10 nanometer transistors. IBM said chips using this transistor technology will be 40% faster and use 75% less power than the current 10-nanometer chips. Smaller faster chips would suit artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and other compute-intensive uses, IBM said. "This is a big change in transistor design," Jim McGregor, founder and principal analyst of Tirias Research, tells Fortune. The goal there is to keep shrinking the transistors while also improving performance, he adds. Related: IBM Still Awaits Payoffs on Big Bets This work, which the three companies will discuss at a tech conference in Japan this week, should show up in working chips around 2020 or beyond. "Right now we're moving from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer, with 5-nanometer to follow," McGregor says. Related: IBM Dumps Chip Division, Books Steep Charge IBM sold its chip-making capabilities to GlobalFoundries three years ago, but continues to work on server chip design. So while IBM (ibm) is no longer a chipmaker, it works closely with chip fabrication partners and still has key talent doing transistor and processor technology research, McGregor notes.

She suggests that, with the strong possibility that driverless cars could hit the roads within 15 years, it's possible that driving could become an obsolete skill. "Babies born today may never have to take a driving test," Axa UK chief executive Amanda Blanc told The Telegraph . The insurance chief also warned that the car insurance industry will need to prepare for future accidents where the car's software may be controlling the driving rather than the human passenger. Read More Driverless shuttle bus to be tested by British public for the first time in East London trial Various reports have suggested that autonomous cars could reduce the number of traffic accidents. In future, roads would be "much safer and increase mobility for vulnerable members of society," Ms Blanc told The Telegraph. Car insurance rates are predicted to drop as a result of the decrease in the number of accidents. Intel believes that the adoption of self-driving cars will take slightly longer, suggesting that uptake will increase from 2035 onwards. The tech giant believes that self-driving vehicles will free up more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the world's busiest cities. Read More Uber takes self-driving cars off the road after accident leaves one on its side Intel calls this the 'Passenger Economy' and claims that it will generate a whopping $7 trillion by 2050. “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape," said Strategy Analytics president Harvey Cohen, co-author of Intel's Passenger Economy report . However, driverless cars are still somewhat controversial and have been involved in a number of accidents. In March, Uber was forced to take its self-driving cars off the roads after an accident left one of its vehicles on its side. At the time of the crash, an engineer was sitting in the driver’s seat but the vehicle was in self-driving mode. Police said the Uber was not at fault for the accident and the driver of another vehicle had failed to give way.
