That the Surface Book i7 can actually give you better graphics performance than a larger 15-inch laptop with discrete graphics is amazing. Combined with its tablet mode, swanky hinge, pen support, beautiful screen, and stellar battery life, it’s easy to remember what made us fall in love with the Surface Book in the first place. Would you buy this? Yes 3 No 0 Price $ 4,454.00 (AUD) Special Offers Coupon: Dell Branded Accessories Coupon Is it a laptop or is it a tablet? It's neither yet both and yet different to other convertibles in the market too. And just look at that price! It’s always been difficult trying to find the right category for Microsoft’s hybrid tablet/laptop Surface Book. And now with the new Surface Book i7 in hand, it’s even harder to figure out just what square hole to put this round peg into. Before we get too far into the review, let me say that the Surface Book i7 is incredibly fast for a laptop in its class, offering no less than twice the performance of the original Surface Book, which itself outstripped all others in its day. Even better, it has stupidly long battery life that bests all the laptops we’ve tested. Done. Fini. Move along, right? Well, not quite. The world isn’t the same as it was a year ago and the Surface Book i7’s competitors have been hard at work too, and there are aspects of Microsoft’s hybrid device that aren’t perfect. Microsoft The Surface Book i7 is hard to define but still pretty damned fast. What it is If you’re not up on current events, the Surface Book i7 is the second iteration of Microsoft’s “convertible” laptop. The top half is a beautifully proportioned 13.5-inch tablet with a “PixelSense” screen that has touch and pen support. The keyboard base (aka the Performance Base) is home to a discrete graphics chip, which takes the Surface Book’s performance beyond that of any other laptop in its class. The two sides are held together with that same crazy hinge found on the first Surface Book. There were rumors Microsoft would give up on its “dynamic fulcrum hinge” and eliminate the gap it creates, but nah, it’s still there and remains one of the most prominent features of the Surface Book i7. Gordon Mah Ung Bam. Dat hinge. Love it or hate it, it’s still there in the latest Surface Book i7. In fact, it looks unchanged from last year’s (above). The old and the new of it The Surface Book’s tablet looks identical to the previous version. In fact, from what I can tell, nothing has changed externally. The PixelSense screen is the same IPS panel with 3200x2400 resolution. Behind the screen there’s an Intel dual-core 6th-gen Skylake Core i7-6600U. It’s pared with 8GB and 16GB LPDDR3 options, as well as an SSD from 256GB to 1TB. (We received a model with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which can be bought from Microsoft's own store for a whopping $4,454). For hardware addicts, that CPU is a disappointment. With truckloads of laptops now using Intel’s 7th-gen Kaby Lake CPUs, you’re probably wondering why Microsoft “pulled an Apple” and went with an older processor. Gordon Mah Ung The Performance Base on the newest Surface Book i7 (left) is about two millimeters thicker than the original Surface Book’s base (right). It appears that Microsoft was more concerned with upgrading the graphics in Performance Base. The original Surface Book featured a discrete Nvidia “GeForce” chip, which was custom but widely believed to be a GeForce GT 940M. The more powerful GPU in the Surface Book i7 requires a larger 95-watt power brick (bottom) vs. the 60-watt brick of the original Surface Book’s (top). The new Surface Book i7 packs an Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M chip with 2GB of GDDR5 RAM. The newer GPU is far faster, but also far hotter. Microsoft said it added a second fan to keep it cool, but the Performance Base is also a little thicker than the original model, with larger air vents. From this angle you can see just how much thicker the new Performance Base (left) is with its GeForce GTX 965M inside of it. Under heavy load, the fans get louder, but the acoustics aren’t bad. A bit shrill, maybe, but totally acceptable. The fans also seem to work pretty well at keeping the GPU cool. I ran a GPU torture test on the Surface Book i7 for more than an hour and although it got warmer, it didn’t get uncomfortable to touch or use. So good job on the implementation, Microsoft. After running the torture test FurMark for more than an hour, the Surface Book i7’s keyboard deck was reasonably cool. Surface Book i7 performance The Surface Book i7’s CPU performance can be summed up pretty much in one sentence: It’s a dual-core Intel chip. Being a 6th-generation Skylake CPU, it’s around 10 percent slower than a comparable 7th-generation Kaby Lake. Of course, a lot of people won’t feel that deficit very often. Handbrake performance To illustrate that point, the chart below shows how the Surface Book i7 compares to a stack of the best laptops around. For additional context, I also threw in a larger quad-core Dell XPS 15 and the Microsoft Surface 3, which runs on the anemic Atom X7 CPU. Our test takes a 30GB MKV file and converts it with Handbrake 0.9.9. On most dual-core laptops (including the Kaby Lake-based Dell XPS 13 and HP Spectre x360), it takes almost two hours to run this test, and as you can see in the chart, as the chips heat up and slow down during the course of the test, there are minimal differences in performance. That doesn’t mean there aren’t any differences, but the 6th-gen Skylake chip keeps up. A dual-core CPU is pretty much a dual-core CPU in our lengthy Handbrake encode test. The chart also illustrates just how little has changed from the first Surface Book. In another performance test—the CPU-heavy Cinebench R15—the score for this year’s Surface Book was actually identical to one I recorded last year. It’s all about the GPU The performance you really care about is the GPU that Microsoft tucked under the keyboard. Even though we all hoped for some secret new AMD or Nvidia GPU, the GeForce GTX 965M doesn’t disappoint. 3DMark Sky Diver performance Futuremark’s 3DMark Sky Diver is a synthetic test that measures the graphics performance of a PC. Although it doesn’t use an actual video game engine, it’s still well respected. For comparison I also threw in the Dell XPS 15. It’s a much thicker and larger 15-inch laptop with a quad-core CPU and GeForce GTX 960M. Since the overall score factors in the CPU cores, the XPS 15 takes the win. Elsewhere in the the pack though, you can see how last year’s Surface Book is head and shoulders above everyone else. But then you get to the Surface Book i7’s GeForce GTX 965M, which is basically three times the performance of most laptops with integrated graphics. Watch out. No other 13-inch Ultrabook can touch the Surface Book i7. But is it still an Ultrabook? 3DMark also gives you a sub score which focuses solely on the graphics performance and cuts out the CPU performance. Once we take the quad-core out of the equation, the Surface Book i7 moves into first place. Not by as much as I expected, but it’s not bad. The Surface Book i7 is basically plenty fast. Look at that GPU go. Tomb Raider performance Not everyone trusts synthetic tests though, so I also ran the 3-year-old, but still quite lovely, Tomb Raider game. I don’t have quite as many comparable laptops, but you can see how two of the XPS 13’s perform when running the game at 1920x1080 on the High setting. The slowest of the bunch is the 7th-gen Kaby Lake laptop with HD 620 graphics. Moving up to the Dell XPS 13, with an Intel Core i7-6560U and Iris 540, nets a decent boost. The original Surface Book with its GeForce GT 940M is faster still, but at 35.4fps, I wouldn’t play the game. That changes with the Surface Book i7, which achieves a totally satisfying 80.8fps, and even exceeds the Dell XPS 15’s GeForce GTX 960M. The Surface Book i7’s GeForce GTX 965M mashes the competing 13-inch laptops in gaming performance. Stupid-good battery performance too With the Surface Book i7’s upgrade you already know Microsoft didn’t touch the tablet portion, which has the same DYN-made 18 watt-hour batteries. Where Microsoft did change things was, again, in the Performance Base, whose now-thicker profile accommodates more battery capacity. The original Surface Book with GeForce card packs a 53 watt-hour cell while the new one has nearly a 63 watt-hour battery. All told, that’s a massive 81 watt-hour battery pushing the Surface Book i7 along. To see how well it does, I ran our standard video rundown test on both it and the last-gen Surface Book. Our test loops a 4K resolution movie using Windows 10 Movies & TV app. That particular app is selected because it’s a super-efficient video player. We set the laptops to airplane mode and the brightness to a relatively bright 250 to 260 nits to approximate what you’d use in a typical house or office in the daytime. Audio is enabled but we use a pair of small earbuds. The result? Stupendous battery life. In fact, it set a new record for battery life in a laptop at just over 13 hours of playback. The original Surface Book gave us a respectable 10 hours and the next closest competitor was Dell’s current XPS 13 at about 11 hours. With its giant battery, you also get pretty stupendous battery life out of the newest Surface Book i7. Think of it as Project Ara, but that you can buy Since the tablet of the new Surface Book i7 appears to be exactly the same as the original, I naturally wondered if I could simply attach the original to the upgraded Performance Base, since that’s where most of the upgrade happened. Sure enough, the two sides fit, and after a few driver downloads it was a go. Don’t believe me? Here’s a screenshot of last year’s Surface Book tablet with the new Performance Base and its GeForce GTX 965M. That score is the same as we got with the “new” Surface Book i7 and the Performance Base. In some ways, the Surface Book i7 is the first modular laptop. With the GPU and extra batteries stored in the base, you could, in theory, upgrade by just buying a new base. It’s almost like Google’s cancelled Project Ara, except it’s an actual product. The problem, of course, is that Microsoft doesn’t sell just the base. That’s too bad because I think Microsoft is missing an opportunity. Plenty of people who bought a Surface Book last year are probably still pretty happy with the Skyale CPU and tablet portion, but that GeForce GT 940M is getting long in the tooth. If I cared about graphics performance and I had the original, I’d jump at the chance to buy the Performance Base with the GeForce GTX 965M upgrade. Gordon Mah Ung Microsoft’s Surface Book i7 (bottom) certainly isn’t the tiniest laptop around compared to the last-generation MacBook Pro 13 (second from bottom), the latest-generation HP Spectre x360 13 (third from bottom), and Dell’s bantam XPS 13 (top.) What’s wrong with it The most obvious problems are the prior sins. The original Surface Book amazed everyone at launch but went through many months of teething pains with docking and undocking issues, and multiple firmware fixes issued over the last year, which both corrected and then reintroduced new docking or sleep issues. In the interest of full disclosure, I used an original Surface Book (although not the original review sample) off and on for the better part of the the last 10 months. For the most part, problems were few and far between but they were there and occassionaly maddening. But whether those were problems with the Surface Book, per se, or issues induced by Windows 10 Insider Preview program, I don’t know. Despite all that, I still have no problems recommending it. Still, I have complaints. The most prominent is the lack of Thunderbolt 3, or at least a faster 10Gbps port. With this class of performance, “pro” ports should be part of the package. One of the stickiest points with the Surface Book i7 is its price. The unit you see here with Core i7, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and GeForce GTX 965M is $4,454 and that's supposedly a sale price - down from $4,949! Ouch. A high spec MacBook Pro 13 will set you back $2,999 — so yeah, this is a premium product at a premium price. You can knock $675 off the Surface Book i7’s price by cutting the SSD capacity in half. Or you can step down to 8GB of RAM and a 128GB drive for $2,069. The problem is those prices aren’t competitive with competing laptops from PC makers. Of course, no other PC vendors offers anything quite like the Surface Book i7 either. It’s either too light or too heavy The other issue I have is the size and weight of the Surface Book i7. I weighed our review unit at 1.52KG. That’s only slightly heavier than the original Surface Book, but it’s hefty. The current Dell XPS 13 with a 7th-gen CPU and no touchscreen is significantly. Going the other direction, the MSI GS63VR Stealth with a quad-core Skylake chip, 15-inch screen, and a much more powerful GeForce GTX 1060 weighs just 300g more than the Surface Book i7. And that MSI will plain blow the doors off the Surface Book i7 in everything, save battery life and build quality. Well, and screen quality. The perennial target of the Surface Book i7, Apple’s MacBook Pro 13, has also recently gone on a diet and weighs just 1.KG. That kind of puts the updated Surface Book i7 in a strange, middle place: It’s heavy enough that you might consider getting a larger quad-core alternative, but yet light enough that you might be tempted to opt for the even-lighter competition. Conclusion When Microsoft announced details of the Surface Book i7, I was pretty disappointed in its middle-aged hardware. In use, however, it appears there’s plenty of life left in these parts. That the Surface Book i7 can actually give you better graphics performance than a larger 15-inch laptop with discrete graphics is amazing. Combined with its tablet mode, swanky hinge, pen support, beautiful screen, and stellar battery life, it’s easy to remember what made us fall in love with the Surface Book in the first place.

Tweet Posted by Andru Edwards - Categories: Editorial, Microsoft, PC / Laptop If you've been shopping for a laptop lately, you may have a vague idea that "ultrabook" means "lightweight" and "small" but otherwise you may be a little confused about why some laptops are called ultrabooks and others aren't. It's understandable – this is one of those areas where names sort of caught on and many different manufacturers started using it, often with different ideas about what it meant. Here are the major points that define an ultrabook, and more importantly the top ultrabooks, and why they matter if you are getting ready to buy a computer. Brief History Ultrabook was actually a term created by Intel by in the early 2010s to market a very specific type of laptop – a thin laptop that was still as powerful as larger, bulkier versions (maybe even more powerful). The name was designed, of course, to show customers that Intel processors could do a lot more with less, and so were worth the purchase. Several Intel partners created these top ultrabook lines, which meant that the term was widely used by several brands at once, essentially saturating the laptop world. It's no wonder then that the term caught on and soon used a bit more loosely throughout the industry – but still referring to those core concepts that Intel had in mind. Size Ultrabooks are very thin – just how thin can vary because laptops are getting thinner all the time, but generally they are laptops that make you pause and think, "Wow, that's really thin." Around three quarters of an inch thick is the largest that the best early ultrabooks got. General design and displays also tend to be small: Most ultrabooks have a 13-inch screen, and rarely get any larger (some 14-inch and 15-inch models are out there). This makes ultrabooks more suitable for on-the-go work, and a little less useful for design work or entertainment. They also tend to be generally more flexible or hybridized than their larger cousins, often coming with touchscreens and styluses to support different work styles. Performance Ultrabooks are also notable for their high-end performance. These laptops won't be competing with gaming computers any time soon, but then generally have enough RAM, enough storage, and a powerful enough processor to handle most tasks. They are often even more powerful than larger laptops and may equal desktop models in some regards. That processor, by the way, is almost by definition an Intel chip (although there are several different lines of Intel processors, each with their own unique qualities). The Intel brand is why few people ever think about MacBooks as ultrabooks, no matter how thin they get – and the power is why lightweight, light-spec models like Chromebooks are very rarely referred to as ultrabooks. Price Ultrabook prices vary, but because they tend to have cutting edge specs, you usually have to pay for them. This differentiates them from Chromebooks, which often sell for only a few hundred dollars. Something like the Microsoft Surface Book, on the other hand, can easily cost $2,000 or more because of its advanced specs as the best ultrabook. Market Definition These days, ultrabook is used as a product definition term – if you see the word ultrabook, you as a consumer know to expect several things: A very thin, very portable laptop that still tends to have as much power as is possible – and a price tag to match. This helps divide the laptop market into different categories to speed up shopping. For example, if you are looking for a great travel laptop for business purposes, you may want to only look at laptops labeled as ultrabooks, because this is exactly what you need.

Intel announces $250 million for autonomous driving tech Posted 9 hours ago by Kristen Hall-Geisler (@kristenhg) 0 SHARES Next Story Google’s AI Experiments help you understand neural networks by playing with them When Intel decided to take a crack at its first keynote at an automotive event, it swung for the fences. The company’s CEO, Brian Krzanich, took the stage at the Los Angeles Auto Show‘s Automobility event this morning to announce that Intel Capital would be investing $250 million in autonomous driving over the next two years. Technologies that will benefit from the investment include connectivity, context awareness, deep learning and security. The goal of autonomous cars is to improve safety by removing as much human error as possible, which requires the vehicles and their data to be safe and reliable. Intel’s processing power itself comes into play with the amount of data required for autonomous driving. Krzanich pointed out that cars are already equipped with a variety of sensors, cameras and controllers that create, gather and transmit data. He said the automotive industry needs to be prepared for 4 terabytes of data being generated by every car every day. The fact that Intel chose to make this announcement at the LA Auto Show’s press days highlights the massive crossover that’s happening between technology and transportation. Representatives of every major car manufacturer were at CES 2016, one of the biggest shows for consumer electronics. The North American Auto Show will debut Automobili-D, its tech-focused event in January 2017. And this is the first year of Automobility, the rebranded tech event at the LA Auto Show. As cars become devices that we drive (or not) and devices become more integrated with our transportation experience across modes, including bike sharing and public transit, cross-pollination between tech companies and auto manufacturers is becoming more than the norm — it’s becoming a necessity.

Hawkins@andyjayhawk Nov 15, 2016, 3:39pm EST share tweet Linkedin In a keynote speech during the LA Auto Show today, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said his company will spend $250 million over the next two years toward the development of autonomous vehicles. It’s a significant sum of money and a clear sign that the computer chip manufacturer is serious about playing a large role in the future of automobiles. But that doesn’t mean that Intel is about to create its own fleet of self-driving cars. After all, the process of building a car from scratch is incredibly complex and expensive. Intel sounds like it’s more interested in what goes into the technology that powers a self-driving car than building the car itself. "Fully" is the key word in Intel's news today In a statement, Intel says the investment will help “push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more.” In other words, Intel wants to be the company that processes the data powering the self-driving cars made by auto manufacturers like BMW. Previously, the German automaker said it was partnering with Intel and Mobileye, the Israeli supplier of driver assistance systems and sensors that supplies a large percentage of the auto industry, to produce fully autonomous vehicles by 2021. "Fully" is the key word in Intel's news today. Production vehicles today already offer various forms of partial automation like dynamic cruise control and lane assistance, and more advanced systems like Tesla's Autopilot and GM's Super Cruise. But a fully self-driving car — something akin to the Google car — is an entirely different level of capability and complexity where you simply summon your vehicle, get in, and let it take you wherever you want to go without needing to intervene or pay attention. Intel is not well-known for its software, but it has been playing catch-up in a number of different spaces, including AI, machine learning, and the Internet of Things. Intel isn’t the only tech company investing heavily in self-driving cars. Practically every automaker and tech startup is working on the technology as well. Nvidia, the GPU manufacturer, and Baidu, the Chinese search giant, are working on a self-driving car platform. And the federal Department of Transportation under the Obama administration has said it aims to spend $4 billion over 10 years on pilot programs to test (and create regulations around) connected and autonomous car technologies.

  Home Topics Archives About Contact  RSS Headlines « Ford working with Bloomberg Aspen Initiative on Cities and Autonomous Vehicles | Main Print this post Intel to invest more than $250M over next two years in autonomous driving; “Data is the new oil” 15 November 2016 In a keynote address at the AutoMobility LA conference, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that Intel Capital is targeting more than $250 million of additional new investments over the next two years to make fully autonomous driving a reality. This is the first time Intel is keynoting at an automotive conference, signifying how critical the automotive market has become for the company. These investments will drive the development of technologies that push the boundaries on next-generation connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, security, safety and more. Drilling down into the areas that will be fueled by the fresh investments, Krzanich highlighted technologies that will drive global Internet of Things (IoT) innovation in transportation; areas where technology can directly mitigate risks while improving safety, mobility, and efficiency at a reduced cost; and companies that harness the value of the data to improve reliability of automated driving systems. When it comes to the car of the future and automated driving experiences, data is literally the new oil. Data has the potential to radically change the way we think about the driving experience: as consumers, as automakers, as technologists and as citizens of our communities. In fact, as a technologist, one of the trends I see as most disruptive to almost every industry is the enormous flood of data driven by the proliferation of smart, connected devices. —Brian Krzanich In his talk, Krzanich noted that in 2016, the average person generates 650MB of data a day through use of their PCs, mobile phones and wearables. By 2020, projections show that the average person will generate 1.5GB of data a day. Despite the impressive ramp up, however, that volume of data is paltry compared to what will be generated by autonomous vehicles. Each autonomous vehicle, supported by it platoon of sensors—cameras, radar, sonar, GPS and LiDAR—will be generating approximately 4,000 GB—i.e., 4 terabytes—of data per day, Krzanich said. Cameras will generate 20-60 MB/second, radar upwards of 10 kB/s, sonar 10-100 kB/s, GPS will run at 50 kB/s, and LIDAR will range between 10-70 MB/s. Every autonomous car will generate the data equivalent of almost 3,000 people. Extrapolate this further and think about how many cars are on the road. Let’s estimate just 1 million autonomous cars worldwide—that means automated driving will be representative of the data of 3 billion people. Just as oil has transformed our world over the last century, data is poised to transform our world for the next hundred years – and beyond. —Brian Krzanich In his talk, Krzanich differentiated between three types of data generated and used by autonomous vehicles: Technical data. This data comes from the car’s sensors that interpret the difference between a child or an animal, a fallen branch or a traffic cone and directs the outward decisions and movements of the car. This data takes an incredible amount of compute power, and whoever has the best data can develop the best artificial intelligence tools of machine learning, deep learning algorithms and data analytics. Societal and crowdsourced data. Data from the world around the vehicle, such as traffic, influences how the car gets from point A to point B, and how the car can change course to point C. The Waze app is a good example of this type of data today. With this data, whoever has the most data will be able to develop the best applications. Personal data. Data that tracks how many people are in the car, music preferences of each passenger, or even what stores or brands passengers prefer and, when you are near them, tees up sale items. Wearables and other sensors inside the car can also monitor behavior, focus, emotional and biometric status to increase safety and security. Whoever has the most personal data will be able to develop and deliver the best user experience. Data is truly the new currency of the automotive world. It’s not enough just to capture the data. We have to turn the data into an actionable set of insights to get the full value out of it. To do that requires an end-to-end computing solution from the car through the network and to the cloud – and strong connectivity. —Brian Krzanich In addition to the requirement for copious, low-cost, non-volatile memory; field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); and cloud systems, Krzanich said, 5G communications will be fundamental to realizing the promise of autonomous vehicles.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 12:07 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Computer Processors Computer Hardware Servers Comments CPU performance increases were ignored for years, but AMD put them back on the map with its upcoming Zen chip. This has rubbed off on Intel in a good way. Intel's taken its fastest server chip, the top-line 22-core Xeon E5-2699 v4 chip, and made some tweaks to squeeze out more CPU performance. It has created a new chip called the 22-core Xeon E5-2699A v4, which is about 5 percent faster. While 5 percent may sound like a small number, it's big for those installing thousands of servers running on the chips. Four-socket servers can have up to 88 CPU cores and run up a 20 percent gain in performance improvements. The new chip could also be used in workstations with the latest GPUs to create VR content or run engineering applications like SolidWorks. The new chip is a sign that Intel's paying more attention to CPU performance. Each new chip generation has normally brought about a 10 to 20 percent boost in CPU performance. But Intel executives, during a recent phone call, talked about the need to pack more speed into server chips to run demanding applications. That's especially highlighted in the 72-core Xeon Phi chip code-named Knights Landing, which is now being tweaked for artificial intelligence uses. The question remains if Intel can ever match AMD's claim of a 40 percent improvement gain with Zen. Intel's new 22-core server chip is based on the Broadwell architecture. Intel plans to release new server chips based on Skylake in the middle of next year, which will also boast performance gains. Intel's latest PC chips are based a new architecture called Kaby Lake, but the company is often slow to bring new architecture to its server chips. Intel achieved the CPU performance gains by making tweaks to its 14-nm process, which in the past has proven problematic. The early Broadwell chips for PCs were delayed because Intel had manufacturing problems, but the chipmaker hit its stride with Skylake and is making further chip improvements. The Xeon E5-2699A v4 runs at a clock speed of 2.40GHz and has 55MB of L3 cache. It has integrated networking, storage and I/O support, and cache allocation is more efficient. Intel dominates the server processor market, with more than a 90 percent share. But competitors are catching up, and it's taking Intel by surprise. The world's fastest supercomputer, called TaihuLight, is based on a homegrown Chinese chip, while ARM is being adopted by Fujitsu to build one of the world's fastest supercomputers in Japan.

News & Analysis Intel Preps its AI Strategy Deep learning may be Xeons inflection point Rick Merritt 11/15/2016 02:30 PM EST Post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — Intel is showing at the Supercomputing 2016 show this week two new versions of its Xeon processor and a new FPGA card for deep learning. The demos are just the tip of the iceberg for a soup-to-nuts offering in machine learning the company will announce at an event on November 17. The industry has been waiting to hear Intel’s plan for machine learning, one of the hottest areas to emerge in semiconductors in recent years. “I think [Intel CEO] Brian Krzanich will bet the company,” said Nigel Toon, chief executive and co-founder of Graphcore, a startup with its own AI processor that recently snagged $30 million from investors including Intel archrival Samsung. Intel’s been making a few investments of its own. In recent weeks, the PC giant acquired two hot processor startups in neural networking—Nervana and Movidius. They add to Intel’s $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera whose FPGAs are already being used to accelerate search, networking and other jobs in the data centers of Baidu and Microsoft. Meanwhile Intel continues to position Xeon Phi, a massively multicore x86 processor, as its key weapon against graphics processors from Nvidia and AMD. At IDF in August it said the Knights Mill version of Phi, the first to act as both host and accelerator, will ship in 2017. Machine learning presents what former Intel CEO Andy Grove might have called a critical inflection point. Intel dominates the high margin market for server processors, but machine learning demands more performance on highly parallel tasks than those chips offer. Intel debuts today a new Arria 10 PCIe card for deep learning. (Images: Intel) Google is already using its own ASIC to accelerate the kind of inference tasks in machine learning Intel targets with a new PCI Express card using an Altera Arria FPGA. Facebook designed its own GPU server using Nvidia chips for the computationally intensive job of training neural networks. Meanwhile, Nvidia launched its own GPU server earlier this year, and IBM and Nvidia collaborated on another one using Power processors. For its part, AMD rolled out an open software initiative for its GPUs earlier this year. All are vying for sockets in a deep learning hardware market forecast to grow from $436 million in 2015 to $41.5 billion by 2024, according to market watcher Tractica. The potential is fueling a tactical rise in investments in semiconductor startups such as Graphcore, Wave Computing and Cornami in addition to the two Intel bought this year. “Nervana was bought for the software — I don’t think the hardware was strong enough to push forward,” said Toon of Graphcore, although one Intel manager suggested Intel will aim the Nervana hardware at the enterprise market for private clouds. “Movidius is well aligned to [Intel’s] RealSense [3D camera] line for low power systems at the edge of the network and the Internet of Things,” Toon said. Indeed Intel and Movidius were partners in with car maker BMW prior to the acquisition. “I’m not sure how Altera fits to be honest,” said Toon who joined the FPGA maker in 1988, helping it launch and run its business in Europe. “Intel may try to use FPGAs as machine learning accelerators in some way but having been involved in FPGAs, I don’t think that’s the right approach,” he said, noting his multicore chips will be more powerful than either FPGAs or GPUs for deep learning.

 Intel is investing $250 million to make self-driving cars a reality Danielle Muoio Nov. 15, 2016, 2:22 PM 1,214 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel Intel just announced it will invest more than $250 million to make autonomous driving a reality. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday that the company will target over $250 million in investments to advance the development of self-driving car tech. Intel wrote in a press release that the investment will be geared toward advancing tech related to connectivity, communication, deep learning, and cybersecurity for cars. Krzanich said at the LA event that the industry will need to prepare for a data deluge where a single car uses more than 4,000 GB of data each day as it relies on self-driving tech like sensors, cameras, and lidar. Intel is currently working with BMW and Mobileye, a former supplier for Tesla's Autopilot, to build a self-driving car by 2021. Intel is involved in 30 vehicle programs on the road currently and is looking to increase that number to 49 by 2020.

português suomeksi svenska Packet Introduces Global ARMv8-A Bare Metal Cloud to Power Container and IoT Workloads The company's new "Type 2A" configuration enables developers to deploy high density compute at 1/10th the cost per core of Intel-powered machines News provided by Cavium, Inc. Nov 15, 2016, 13:55 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Packet, the leading bare metal cloud for developers, today announced a new ARM®v8-A based on-demand server configuration, available to deploy in less than ten minutes from its data centers in Parsippany (NJ), Sunnyvale (CA), Amsterdam (NL) and Tokyo (JP). The ARMv8-A option - powered by a pair of 48-core Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM) ThunderX chips - makes Packet the first cloud provider to offer a 64-bit ARM server with the same elastic benefits of Intel-powered solutions. The 2A server is priced at $0.50/hr, or $0.005/core per hour (about 1/10th the cost per core of Packet's existing Intel-powered Type 2) and is available in minutes via API, portal or widely used DevOps tools such as Terraform and Ansible. "Making a powerful, low-cost ARM compute node available to developers has been a dream of mine for years," said Zachary Smith, CEO at Packet. "With the support of the Cavium and SoftBank teams, as well as our hardware and ecosystem partners, we're thrilled that users can take advantage of ARMv8-A powered bare metal at this incredible price point with the same experience as our x86 solutions." Unlike lower-end ARMv7-A variants, the ARMv8-A architecture powering Packet's bare metal Type 2A is designed for high density data center workloads and thrives on tasks like container-based applications, data processing, threaded application workloads and network heavy functions such as load balancing. To encourage rapid adoption, Packet also announced full 64-bit ARM support for Ubuntu 16.04, as well as a pipeline that includes CoreOS, FreeBSD and CentOS. "Packet is enabling genuine choice in the data center market with an instantly available ARMv8-A 64-bit server solution that is a direct challenger to legacy providers," said Jeff Underhill, director of server programs, ARM. "The combination of outstanding performance at a compelling price is bolstered by Packet's access to a wide range of developer networks anxious to test their workloads on ARM processor-based servers." Cloud native (Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are natural workloads for ARMv8-A as they are highly portable and do not require the same tie-in with Intel processors. Packet's offering follows a recent investment by SoftBank, who acquired ARM Holdings for $32 billion in September. "Packet brought the public cloud experience to single tenant bare metal," said Rishi Chugh, Director Marketing, Data Center Processor Group at Cavium. "The ARM-based high density server platform, built on Cavium's award-winning workload optimized ThunderX processor, further accelerates the enablement of next generation cloud applications that power the modern internet and technology of tomorrow." About Packet Founded in 2014, Packet's proprietary technology automates physical servers and networks without the use of virtualization or multi-tenancy to provide on-demand compute and connectivity. Customers can either build on Packet's public cloud service or leverage advanced automation software to enable their own private compute infrastructure. The company is headquartered in New York City and maintains an advanced global IP network between its data center locations in New York Metro (Parsippany, NJ), Sunnyvale (CA), Amsterdam (NL) and Tokyo (JP).  Packet is a member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and supports many open source projects, including Memcached.org, which uses Packet to perform automatic performance and burn-in testing of new features.

The new small form-factor PC is based on Intel’s Apollo Lake system-on-chip and thus features improved general purpose performance, graphics, and multimedia playback. The ECS LIVA Z comes in a small 117×128×33 black enclosure, which is a bit larger than the Apple TV STB and about the same size as Intel’s entry-level NUCs. While the LIVA Z has rather advanced media playback capabilities and has both HDMI and mDP outputs (as well as a TRRS connector for analog audio), ECS positions its new SFF system not as a media-centric PC, but rather as an affordable miniature computer. This is a reason why the LIVA Z does not come with a remote control or even an IR receiver, but has two GbE ports in addition to 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.0. For peripherals, the system has three USB 3.0 Type-A ports as well as a USB 3.0 Type-C port. The heart of the ECS LIVA Z is an Apollo Lake SoC, which brand and model numbers the manufacturer does not disclose, but FanlessTech claims that the chip is a desktop part with 10 W TDP. Anyway, we do know that Intel’s Apollo Lake chips feature up to four x86 cores based on the latest low-power Goldmont microarchitecture, a new graphics core that features Intel’s ninth-generation architecture (Gen9) with 12 or 18 EUs as well as a new multimedia playback engine that supports hardware-accelerated playback of 4K video from hardware decoding of HEVC and VP9 codecs. The architectural and multimedia-related enhancements of the Apollo Lake SoCs make the LIVA Z quite good for light multimedia and video playback workloads. Comparison of Intel's Entry-Level PC Platforms   Bay Trail-M/D Braswell Apollo Lake CPU Microarchitecture Silvermont Airmont Goldmont Core Count Up to 4 Graphics Architecture Gen 7 Gen8 Gen9 EU Count unknown 12 or 16 12 or 18 Process Technology 22 nm 14 nm 14 nm Launch Q1 2014 Q1 2015 Q3 2016 So far, ECS has published only brief specs of the LIVA Z on its website, but we understand that the system will exist in different configurations, (possibly different regions will get different variants). The SFF PC will feature up to 8 GB of DDR3L memory (up to two SO-DIMMs), a pre-installed eMMC 32 GB/64 module as well as an M.2-2242 slot for SATA SSDs. There is no place for 2.5” HDDs/SSDs inside the LIVA Z, hence the system supports only solid-state M.2 storage devices. Currently the maximum capacity of available M.2-2242 SATA SSDs is 512 GB (albeit, they are rare), which means that people with vast multimedia libraries will have to use external storage.

Prices will naturally depend on exact SoC, RAM, eMMC configuration as well as on the version of Windows included (or the lack of any OS). Some of the previous-gen ECS LIVA systems started at $170 and $180, so expect the new versions to be in the same range.

Wccftech is reporting that the Intel Core i3-7350K, a dual-core / four threaded processor with a base clock of 4.0GHz (boost up to 4.2GHz), 4MB of L3 cache and a TDP of 91 watts, will ship unlocked and thus, ready to be overclocked. What’s the big deal about an unlocked Core i3 chip, you ask? During the heyday of overclocking when there was a significant performance gap between different processor lines, it was possible to purchase a budget chip like Intel’s Celeron 300A or one of AMD’s Athlon Slot A processors and overclock them by a couple hundred megahertz or so. The first enthusiast processor I purchased, for example, was a 500MHz Slot A Athlon with a 600MHz core (AMD underclocked it to meet demand) that I overclocked to 800MHz using a Golden Fingers device (my actual processor pictured above). I then moved to a 700MHz Slot A chip with a 900MHz core that I pushed to 1GHz. That may not sound like much today but back then, a few hundred megahertz made a huge difference, separating budget CPUs from much more expensive Pentium-branded chips. AMD pulled out of the consumer CPU race years ago which allowed Intel to take its foot off the accelerator of innovation and minimize the performance gain that each new processor generation affords. Worse yet, Intel eventually fought back against overclockers by unlocking all but a handful of their most expensive processors, effectively putting the technique out of hand of budget builders. Intel is expected to unveil its Kaby Lake desktop lineup in the near future.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets Intel may add Wi-Fi, USB 3.1 to next-generation chipsets By Joel Hruska on November 10, 2016 at 4:46 pm Comment Motherboard chipsets haven’t really changed much in the last few years. There’s been some support for new storage options and standards, like M.2 for SSDs, some limited support for features like Thunderbolt, and faster memory speeds have trickled out over time. Intel might shake things up a bit for its 300-series chipsets in 2017, if rumors are to be believed, with integrated support for Wi-Fi and USB 3.1. Both standards could be useful to consumers and a new report from Digitimes implies Intel is considering the concept. USB 3.1 Gen 2 offers up to 10Gbps of transfer speed, while USB 3.0 (aka USB 3.1 Gen 1) tops out at just 5Gbps. Objectively, there aren’t that many consumers who currently need USB 3.1 Gen 2, but the technology could be useful for secondary displays or high-performance external storage arrays. If Intel integrates Wi-Fi, it would likely use its own radios, which would need to be either shrunk to an equivalent process technology or placed on-package rather than integrated directly into the CPU. The benefits of node shrinks for radios are considerably smaller than what we see in conventional logic. Radios and cellular modems are commonly integrated into mobile SoCs, but to the best of our knowledge Intel has never released hardware with either feature directly integrated on-board. The SoFIA chips that Intel would have built had integrated radios, but these were going to be fabbed at TSMC. The downside to this play is that it could have a significant negative effect on third-party providers like Realtek, Broadcom, and Asmedia who often provide supplemental chips that provide Wi-Fi or USB 3.1 support to Intel and AMD chips. Some need for these designs would still remain, since motherboard companies often use them to add even more port support to high-end boards, but losing mainstream business could still hurt. Asmedia has also contracted with AMD to provide some of its chipset needs, which should lessen the impact — especially if AMD manages a successful launch with Zen. Up until now, Intel’s Wi-Fi solutions have been available via cards like this one. Integrating the feature on-chip or on-package would be an interesting move for the company. As for whether or not these features will drive upgrades, I think the forecast there is a bit mixed. On the one hand, I’d love to have a robust option for Wi-Fi integrated into a desktop, especially if Intel offers a version with an external antenna to improve performance. Even if you prefer wired Internet (and I very much do), we’ve all had scenarios where running a new line for a system was a serious routing headache. Good Wi-Fi support baked in from the get-go would mitigate that problem. Plus, the fastest Wi-Fi solutions are approaching throughput performance that can rival wired Ethernet, especially if you have an older router or switch that only supports 100TX performance between ports. (A number of routers and switches that claim to offer gigabit performance only have one gigabit port — the port that connects to the modem itself.) But whether integrated Wi-Fi is a key feature that’ll spur people to upgrade is something I’m less sure of. Systems last longer and longer these days — I recently took a side-grade to a different motherboard after my existing system developed some USB-specific problems after five years. Just 10 years ago, trying to make do with a Pentium 3 or Athlon from 2000 in 2005 was possible, but not much fun. Today, a five-year-old CPU barely even feels like an issue. That’s not a situation Intel is thrilled with, but it has proven to be a very hard problem to solve. I suspect the big play here, at least in Wi-Fi, is that it allows Intel to ship its own hardware to more customers by expanding the market for Intel wireless solutions. Desktops aren’t a huge market these days, but they still represent a significant sales increase.

With the 960 Pro, Samsung targeted professionals and enthusiasts willing to pay a premium to have the best performance money can buy. With the 960 EVO, Samsung is targeting the mainstream market where affordability is the key ingredient. Samsung's 960 EVO strikes a perfect balance between price and performance. Facilitating the 960 EVO's affordability is Samsung's third-generation V-NAND 3-bit flash. 3-bit flash is much cheaper per gigabyte to produce than 2-bit flash resulting in lower cost to the consumer.     To date, only two TLC-based consumer NVMe SSDs have hit the market; the Intel 600P and now Samsung's 960 EVO. Intel's 600P has become popular with mainstream consumers because it is literally half the cost of current MLC-based NVMe SSDs. Mainstream users, for the most part, are willing to sacrifice some performance for lower cost of ownership. In the case of Intel's 600P, they are willing to sacrifice a ton of performance for lower cost. This is where Samsung sees a golden opportunity for their new 960 EVO. Samsung designed the 960 EVO to deliver massive performance at a super-low price point, giving the mainstream user the best of both worlds.   The key to Samsung's performance advantage is their flash. Samsung's V-NAND 3D flash has proven to be a game changer. Samsung is way ahead of the curve when it comes to NAND flash technology. At this time, we are starting to see competing first generation 3D flash hit the market while Samsung is currently developing their fourth-generation 3D NAND flash.   Samsung's 3-bit EVO series has been massively successful; in fact, it is by far the world's bestselling line of SSDs. We have to look no further than the 850 EVO to see why. The 3-bit V-NAND-powered 850 EVO outperforms all competing TLC and MLC SATA SSDs on the market; doing so with a very low cost per gigabyte. Samsung is looking to perform a similar feat in the NVMe arena with the 960 EVO. The 960 EVO is a bit of a different animal than the 850 EVO because of the NVMe interface.   The SATA-based 850 EVO is, for the most part, just as fast or even faster than the 2-bit 850 Pro. This is because the SATA interface is so restrictive that Samsung's 3-bit V-NAND appears to deliver performance that is just as good as 2-bit V-NAND. This is not the case with the 960 EVO. It is not going to be competing with the 960 Pro in terms of performance. Over the NVMe interface, 2-bit flash clearly delivers better performance than 3-bit.   The 960 EVO and the 960 Pro share a common NVMe controller. "Polaris" is Samsung's second-generation NVMe controller. Samsung's Polaris NVMe controller is a 5-core design that replaces the 3-core UBX controller found on the 950 Pro. The additional channels along with architectural improvements make Polaris the best performing consumer NVMe controller ever released. Polaris dedicates four cores to the NAND array, and one core is dedicated to optimizing the communication between the host and controller. To maximize the 960 EVO's 3-bit MLC performance, Samsung employs two types NAND flash; 128Gb 3-bit V-NAND for the 250GB model and 256Gb 3-bit V-NAND for the 500GB and 1TB models.   In terms of read/write performance, the 960 EVO is second only to the 960 Pro. At similar capacity points, the 960 EVO outperforms the potent 950 Pro by as much as 45% when reading sequential data and by as much as 67% when writing sequential data. Additionally, 4K random performance is up by as much as 200% comparatively. To get burst performance this good with 3-bit flash, Samsung has developed caching technology called "Intelligent TurboWrite." Intelligent TurboWrite is a more refined version of the TurboWrite technology found on the 850 EVO. Intelligent TurboWrite dedicates a portion of the drive's flash array as an SLC buffer layer. Intelligent TurboWrite identifies user workloads intelligently and defines the appropriate SLC buffer. Samsung's Intelligent TurboWrite has a default and dynamic size that breaks down as follows.     TurboWrite makes it possible for the 960 EVO to reach sequential read/write speeds of up to 3200/1900 MB/s and random read/write performance of up to 380,000/360,000 IOPS.   Like the 950/960 Pro, the 960 EVO is a single-sided M.2 22mm x 80mm design. A 2280 single-sided design is most desirable because it will fit into just about any laptop on the market with an M.2 PCIe slot. Additionally, a single-sided design is easier to cool. To further assist heat dissipation under load, Samsung has developed an innovative heat-dissipating label that extends peak data transferability by over 60% in comparison to the 950 Pro. Samsung's unique four-layer heat dissipating label has a thin copper layer that helps to shed heat faster than would be possible without the label.   To compliment the 960 Series SSDs, Samsung is introducing a new 2.0 version of their proprietary NVMe driver. Samsung's new NVMe driver 2.0 is designed to ensure full compatibility and maximum performance for 960 users. We will be utilizing Samsung's new NVMe 2.0 driver for most of our testing. Samsung has also revamped their Magician software. The new version of Magician offers a more personalized, intuitive interface along with host of new features. Unfortunately, we do not have the new version in-hand, so we will have to show you the new interface and features when we can do so.     Specifications     Samsung's 960 EVO M.2 x 2280 NVMe SSD is available in three capacities: 250GB, 500GB, and 1TB.   Sequential Read: up to 3,200 MB/s Sequential Write: up to 1,900 MB/s Max 4K Random Read Speed: up to 380,000 IOPS Max 4K Random Write Speed: up to 360,000 IOPS Max 4K QD1 Random Read Speed: up to 14,000 IOPS Max 4K QD1 Random Write Speed: up to 50,000 IOPS Endurance: up to 400 TBW MTTF: 1.5 Million Hours Warranty: 3-Year Limited Warranty Active Power Consumption: 4.4-5.7W Avg.

NEW YORK-- November 15, 2016 --Packet, the leading bare metal cloud for developers, today announced a new ARM®v8-A based on-demand server configuration, available to deploy in less than ten minutes from its data centers in Parsippany (NJ), Sunnyvale (CA), Amsterdam (NL) and Tokyo (JP). The ARMv8-A option - powered by a pair of 48-core Cavium (NASDAQ: CAVM) ThunderX chips - makes Packet the first cloud provider to offer a 64-bit ARM server with the same elastic benefits of Intel-powered solutions. The 2A server is priced at $0.50/hr, or $0.005/core per hour (about 1/10th the cost per core of Packet’s existing Intel-powered Type 2) and is available in minutes via API, portal or widely used DevOps tools such as Terraform and Ansible. “Making a powerful, low-cost ARM compute node available to developers has been a dream of mine for years,” said Zachary Smith, CEO at Packet. “With the support of the Cavium and SoftBank teams, as well as our hardware and ecosystem partners, we’re thrilled that users can take advantage of ARMv8-A powered bare metal at this incredible price point with the same experience as our x86 solutions.” Unlike lower-end ARMv7-A variants, the ARMv8-A architecture powering Packet’s bare metal Type 2A is designed for high density data center workloads and thrives on tasks like container-based applications, data processing, threaded application workloads and network heavy functions such as load balancing. To encourage rapid adoption, Packet also announced full 64-bit ARM support for Ubuntu 16.04, as well as a pipeline that includes CoreOS, FreeBSD and CentOS. “Packet is enabling genuine choice in the data center market with an instantly available ARMv8-A 64-bit server solution that is a direct challenger to legacy providers,” said Jeff Underhill, director of server programs, ARM. “The combination of outstanding performance at a compelling price is bolstered by Packet’s access to a wide range of developer networks anxious to test their workloads on ARM processor-based servers.” Cloud native (Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are natural workloads for ARMv8-A as they are highly portable and do not require the same tie-in with Intel processors. Packet’s offering follows a recent investment by SoftBank, who acquired ARM Holdings for $32 billion in September. “Packet brought the public cloud experience to single tenant bare metal,” said Rishi Chugh, Director Marketing, Data Center Processor Group at Cavium. “The ARM-based high density server platform, built on Cavium’s award-winning workload optimized ThunderX processor, further accelerates the enablement of next generation cloud applications that power the modern internet and technology of tomorrow.” About Packet Founded in 2014, Packet’s proprietary technology automates physical servers and networks without the use of virtualization or multi-tenancy to provide on-demand compute and connectivity. Customers can either build on Packet’s public cloud service or leverage advanced automation software to enable their own private compute infrastructure. The company is headquartered in New York City and maintains an advanced global IP network between its data center locations in New York Metro (Parsippany, NJ), Sunnyvale (CA), Amsterdam (NL) and Tokyo (JP). Packet is a member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and supports many open source projects, including Memcached.org, which uses Packet to perform automatic performance and burn-in testing of new features.     Contact Packet Architects AB Fill out this form for contacting a Packet Architects AB representative.

Macs & Mac OS X | 03 Nov 2016 | Listen  | Print  | Comment (58) Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between by Glenn Fleishman The first Mac with Thunderbolt 3 is now available, the non-Touch Bar 13-inch model from Apple’s new series of MacBook Pro laptops (see “New MacBook Pros Add Context-sensitive Touch Bar,” 27 October 2016); the rest of the models ship soon. Thunderbolt 3 relies on the USB-C physical connector and, with the appropriate adapters, supports nearly all common peripheral-connection and networking protocols, including USB 2, USB 3, FireWire, Thunderbolt 2, Ethernet, and DisplayPort, and by extension, HDMI, DVI, and VGA. The reason confusion afflicts this space is that a USB-C port on another computer may support just USB, USB plus display and networking protocols, or all of that plus Thunderbolt 3. The 12-inch MacBook’s USB-C port, for instance, natively supports USB 2 and USB 3 along with DisplayPort and, via adapters, VGA, HDMI, and Ethernet connections, but not Thunderbolt 2 or FireWire. The summary for potential late 2016 MacBook Pro owners is that all current USB-C devices, cables, and adapters should work when plugged into a MacBook Pro’s Thunderbolt 3 ports. However, Thunderbolt 3-specific devices won’t work with computers and other devices like the 12-inch MacBook whose USB-C ports are less capable. Now, let’s drill down into details. How These Standards Relate to Each Other -- USB-C is a standard developed by the USB Implementors Forum to modernize and coalesce USB into a single plug style that supports a variety of data, video, and power options for ports, cables, and adapters. It’s reversible, just like the Lightning plug Apple uses for iOS devices and recent peripherals like the Apple Pencil and Magic Mouse 2. Support for high-wattage and high-amperage cables allows USB-C chargers to charge laptops and other devices. While previous versions of USB allowed for high power flow, USB-C is the first version in which laptops take advantage of that, allowing external charging from an AC adapter or external battery. USB-C also offers bidirectional power, so a MacBook Pro could recharge itself via an external battery while also charging an iPhone. (Although we’re focusing here on USB-C, or more formally, USB Type-C, USB also supports other plug types. These include USB Type-A, the standard rectangular USB plug we’re all accustomed to; USB Type-B, the squarish USB plug often used by large peripherals; and the smaller Mini-A, Mini-B, Micro-A, Micro-B, and Micro-B SuperSpeed plugs.) USB-C appeared first in 2015 in the 12-inch MacBook, and shortly thereafter in equipment from Google and others. It has spread gradually, but it is still not the connection of choice for laptops and mobile phones. The third-party peripheral market, especially for docks and high-quality cables, started to accelerate only in early 2016. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use the same physical connector as Mini DisplayPort, which allowed a jack to fit easily into a thin laptop. Natively, they support two protocols: Thunderbolt (originally built on top of PCI Express) for general data and DisplayPort for video. With adapters, they can also carry USB, FireWire, and Ethernet. Although Intel developed Thunderbolt jointly with Apple, Intel seems to control its future. In June 2015, Intel and the USB Implementors Forum announced that Thunderbolt 3 would rely on the USB-C plug style. That was good news: one fewer cable type and all ports would become multi-purpose! How this works has to do with abstraction: the hardware no longer defines a single associated communications protocol. USB-C and DisplayPort exist both as a physical specification for connectors and cables, and also as a logical protocol that defines how data moves across a data bus. The USB-C data bus has a number of channels (called “lanes”) that can be assigned and configured to different protocols, depending on the USB-C controller hardware in the host computer or other device, including USB, DisplayPort, PCI Express, and Thunderbolt. DisplayPort can either use its own connector type or be encapsulated and carried by other standards, which include USB-C, whether or not the controller hardware supports Thunderbolt. This capability of DisplayPort made it possible for Thunderbolt to use the Mini DisplayPort connector type and be backward compatible with existing DisplayPort devices. Thunderbolt allows daisy chaining — plugging one peripheral into the next — though DisplayPort monitors have to be at the end of such a chain. Though I can’t find a definitive answer, it appears that you cannot daisy chain USB devices connected via USB-C, although you can simulate daisy chaining with the addition of USB-C–connected hubs. Power, which is effectively a different kind of protocol in USB-C, can be passed through multiple devices. When it comes to protocols, USB-C natively supports: USB 2.0 (480 Mbps) USB 3.0 (5 Gbps, branded SuperSpeed, now described as USB 3.1 Gen 1) USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps, branded SuperSpeed+, which requires USB-C as a connector type) DisplayPort (under the ungainly name “DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C Connector Standard”) MHL 3.0 (Mobile High-Definition Link, which you’ve probably never heard of: it’s a way to connect mobile devices to HD displays) Thunderbolt 3 (on computers that have Thunderbolt 3 controllers, like the new MacBook Pros) USB-C can create the appropriate electrical signals for these natively supported standards internally and pass them through a cable with a USB-C plug on one end and the native format, like DisplayPort or USB 3 Type-A, on the other. Some of these are in the form of a dongle with a jack on the non-USB-C end, but it’s still sending the signal straight through. For other protocols, you need an adapter, which performs internal signal conversion between USB-C and the adapter’s input port, like HDMI, VGA, Ethernet, and FireWire. (The HDMI trade group added USB-C as an option recently and says that monitors with native USB-C support will be out in 2017. For now, Ethernet is supported directly only in a 10 Gbps peer-to-peer version that’s part of Thunderbolt 3.) USB-C can drive at least a single 4K monitor, depending on the display circuitry on the host device. A computer with Multi-Stream Transport (MST) can drive two displays from a single USB-C port. Apple built MST into some Macs, but the 12-inch MacBook lacks it, and thus can only handle one external monitor. Thunderbolt 3 has more robust display support, enabling it to use higher refresh rates and manage significantly more pixels overall. Thunderbolt 3 cables are labeled with the same lightning logo used by Thunderbolt 2 cables, while USB cables with USB-C connectors show the familiar USB logo and may also be branded with SS+ for SuperSpeed+. Older USB 3.0 (also known as USB 3.1 Gen 1) cables are sometimes also branded with an SS for SuperSpeed. Happily, Thunderbolt 3, as supported by the new MacBook Pros, supports all the protocols handled by USB-C, plus Thunderbolt and FireWire. The end result is that nearly any device can be plugged into a Thunderbolt 3 port, with the correct cable, adapter, or dock, as I explain next. (What kinds of ports are you using with a Mac laptop? You can fill out my survey and see the current results.) Adapt or Die! -- There’s both some FUD and reasonable caution about USB-C cables and adapters. Quality gear comes from the likes of Apple, Belkin, Google, and Kensington, although Apple’s products have historically been quite expensive. Apple recently cut prices of all its USB-C and Thunderbolt 3 accessories through 31 December 2016; see “Responding to Complaints, Apple Drops Adapter and Monitor Prices” (4 November 2016). You can often find less expensive gear made cheaply by little-known manufacturers and sold via Amazon (see “Be Careful When Buying Apple Accessories on Amazon,” 24 October 2016). Before buying from unfamiliar brands, I recommend that you consult Google engineer Benson Leung’s Amazon reviews, whether or not you make the purchase via Amazon. He has extensively tested cables, adapters, and other equipment in his personal time, and he can steer you towards and away from USB-C products. Let’s assume you have or are planning to get a new MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 3. Here’s a rundown of what you’ll need for each of the various connection types: USB: For connecting older USB peripherals, you’ll need a USB-C adapter, cable, or dock. Existing products will work fine with the MacBook Pro models. If you want the simplest one-to-one converter, pick up a USB-C to USB Type-A adapter — or several. Apple’s adapter is $9; well-reviewed adapters on Amazon cost a couple bucks less. My favorite dock is currently the Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Type C Adapter, which I gave top marks to in a review at Macworld. It offers a 4K display output (via HDMI, compatible with DisplayPort), two USB 3.0 Type-A ports, and pass-through power. It held up well in testing, and it’s an attractive, compact unit. Lightning: If you want to charge a Lightning-equipped device without using an adapter or dock, you can get Apple’s USB-C to Lightning cable, available in 3.3 foot/1 meter ($19) and 6.6 feet/2 meters ($29) versions. Ethernet: To add gigabit Ethernet, which many people prefer over Wi-Fi when it’s available at a home or business office, you have plenty of options with USB-C now. Don’t overpay: the $17 Kanex adapter fits the bill. Like many USB to Ethernet adapters, it requires a free driver for the Mac. (Thunderbolt 3 uses the 10 Gbps Ethernet specification for peer-to-peer transfers between two computers using a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 3 cable.) FireWire: If you have older equipment that supports FireWire 400 or 800 as its only or fastest communications method, you may need to wait to see what materializes. There’s no direct adapter or cable available. Apple’s FireWire 800 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter would then have to pass through a Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter (see below), a combination that hasn’t yet been tested for reliability, but which Apple says is supported. Some Thunderbolt 2 docks include FireWire ports, and an updated version of one of those could be the right path. Thunderbolt: Because Thunderbolt 3 is backward compatible with the previous version, Thunderbolt 2 docks should work fine. It’s possible there could be incompatibilities with certain chips or features, so you may want to wait for others to test and report on them. Roman Loyola at Macworld rounded up the best Thunderbolt 2 docks in December 2015. Docks will require a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter ($29). Unfortunately, that adapter doesn’t allow for connections to Mini DisplayPort displays like Apple’s older Cinema Displays, although it should work with the 27-inch Thunderbolt Display. By the way, Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 3 cables are currently a little pricey: Apple is selling two Belkin cables: $22 for 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) and $52 for 2 meters (6.6 feet). Belkin has announced a Thunderbolt 3 dock too. The Thunderbolt 3 Express Dock HD is a refresh of a previous version that cost about $250. It will sport pass-through power (up to 85 watts, enough for any MacBook Pro model), two Thunderbolt 3 ports, one full-size DisplayPort jack, gigabit Ethernet, two analog audio jacks, and three USB Type-A 3.0 ports. It can handle two monitors, each up to 4K, by using one Thunderbolt 3 port and the DisplayPort connection. A lot more Thunderbolt 3 docks are coming. For more details on other adapters and cables, consult Roman Loyola’s recently posted Thunderbolt 3 adapter guide at Macworld. Displays: On the monitor side of the equation, you should be able to use all displays, up to 4K resolution, that support DisplayPort 1.2 or later. You’ll need a USB-C to DisplayPort adapter or cable. An increasing number of monitors offer DisplayPort over USB-C as an option — sometimes the only option (see, for instance, “Acer H277HU USB-C Display Is an Affordable MacBook Companion,” 11 April 2016). However, 5K displays will need native Thunderbolt 3 support, as with the new LG 5K monitor Apple showed off in its keynote and which it will be selling in Apple Stores. Apple just dropped the price on its previously expensive USB-C multiport adapters, both of which offer video out, along with a USB-C power-only port for passthrough charging and a USB Type-A port. The Digital AV Multiport Adapter with HDMI and the VGA Multiport Adapter are both $49, at least through the end of 2016, after which the price may return to $69. You can also get a variety of USB-C to DVI adapters from other parties, though we don’t have a particular recommendation. The 13-inch MacBook Pro models have built-in video support for one 5K display or two 4K displays. The 15-inch models can handle two 5K displays and a whopping four 4K displays. That’s because the 13-inch models have one USB-C controller and a perfectly fine video system; the 15-inch models include two USB-C controllers and much better display circuitry. Real-World Scenarios -- Now that you know what the adapter options are, how do you apply them? There are two notable scenarios: moving data to a new MacBook Pro via the Setup Assistant or Migration Assistant, and working with Target Disk Mode. Apple has published a support page explaining the possibilities for migrating data to a 12-inch MacBook or late-2016 MacBook Pro; also be sure to read “How to Migrate to a New Mac” (14 September 2016). Depending on the Macs in question, Apple suggests a few choices: Wi-Fi: Apple suggests that Wi-Fi is the simplest method, but it’s by far the slowest, and in our experience, it often fails in the middle. We recommend Wi-Fi as the last-ditch method. From a backup drive: If you have a backup of your previous Mac, either a bootable duplicate or a Time Machine backup, you can attach that drive to the new MacBook Pro via USB-C. Ethernet: With a USB-C to Ethernet adapter for the new MacBook Pro, and another adapter for the older Mac if necessary, Setup/Migration Assistant can transfer your data over a standard Ethernet cable. USB-C: If you’re migrating from a 12-inch MacBook to a new MacBook Pro, a USB-C to USB-C cable will work. Not all such cables have full data transfer capabilities, so make sure to get one that does, such as this one from Belkin. Target Disk Mode, a way to turn one Mac into a bootable drive for another Mac, is a somewhat different situation. Apple has updated its Target Disk Mode page to include a mention of Thunderbolt 3. Apple is light on the specifics but seems to imply that you will need two matching ports and a cable to connect them. From this reading, only the 12-inch MacBook and the new MacBook Pros will be able to employ Target Disk Mode between themselves, using either a USB-only USB-C cable or a Thunderbolt 3 cable. However, Target Disk Mode also reportedly worked with a Thunderbolt 2-to-FireWire adapter, so that combination may also work with an additional Thunderbolt 2-to-3 adapter, but we haven’t yet seen confirmation. USB-Cing Stars -- This may all seem confusing initially, but it should pass quickly because everything on the market for USB and DisplayPort over USB-C today should work with Thunderbolt 3. The main group that will be disappointed are those who buy Thunderbolt 3 peripherals and expect them to work with a 12-inch MacBook, which doesn’t extend USB-C support to Thunderbolt. We can hope that Apple makes Thunderbolt 3 standard across the entire Mac line. I anticipate that, now that Thunderbolt 3 is out and available in a mainstream Mac, other manufacturers will ship more new high-end computers with Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C. USB 3.1 Gen 2 tops out at 10 Gbps, which will be fine for lower-end systems, which don’t require 40 Gbps performance and aren’t intended to support more than two displays. Mobile devices outside of the Apple ecosystem will stick with and continue to adopt USB-C without Thunderbolt 3 for simplicity, power consumption, and controller cost. With nothing else like either USB 3.1 Gen 2 or Thunderbolt 3 on the horizon and the broad industry support of the USB-C connector, USB is finally living up to the Universal part of its name — even when Thunderbolt is thrown in on top.   READERS LIKE YOU!

Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Simon   2016-11-04 00:48 Very useful guide. Thanks, Glenn. You mention USB-C to DisplayPort cables. What about HDMI? Are there or will there be such cables, or do I need to resort to Apple's "Digital AV Multiport Adapter"? (assuming I don't have a TB3 dock with built-in HDMI) For Ethernet adapters I prefer Apple's so I don't have to worry about 3rd party drivers. But Apple so far only offers TB2 to Gigabit. Would that work in combination with a TB2 to TB3 dongle? Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-04 01:28 Lots of USB-C to HDMI adapter/dongle options. Google has one even. And it's a standard feature of most docks. As for Ethernet, I've found some that require a driver for full functionality (wake from sleep) and others that require a driver to work at all. I'd definitely read reviews for USB-C to Ethernet adapters, and see what other Mac owners say. Reply Peter  2016-11-04 12:36 Plugable has stated their USB-C to HDMI adapter behaves inconsistently--this is apparently unrelated to the Thunderbolt 3 chipset compatibility issue (http://plugable.com/2016/10/27/the-new-2016-macbook-pros-plugables-thunderbolt-3-and-usb-c-products/). I wonder if similar HDMI adapters from StarTech or Monoprice will have issues. Reply Simon   2016-11-08 05:40 Thanks to another kind poster I was pointed to this support ducument: https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT207266 It clearly mentions the Gigabit-TB2 adapter can be used on a new MBP in conjunction with Apple's new TB3-TB2 dongle. Reply bitguru  2016-11-04 16:31 There were strong rumors at the time that the type-C connector was actually developed by Apple and given away so that it would be adopted widely for USB and Thunderbolt. Were these ever confirmed or debunked? Reply Daniel Compton  2016-11-07 16:03 Unfortunately, it looks like not all Thunderbolt 3 devices will work with the new Macbook Pro, adding more confusion to this situation: https://9to5mac.com/2016/11/03/2016-macbook-pro-thunderbolt-compatibility-issues/. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 16:06 We’re waiting for some more clarity about that. Apple hasn’t offered comment, and it’s a single vendor. I would expect to hear from Intel and Texas Instruments, too. We’ll provide more detail when we feel there’s more to go on. Reply Mark  2016-11-07 16:17 Will daisychaining monitors work over USB C? The 4K LG monitor just has a few USB C ports, and Apple says they are only 2.0 for some reason. What I'd like to do is connect my 1080p monitor to one of these using a DisplayPort to USB c cable to preserve the one cable with Power to the MBP. So: 1080p DisplayPort-->USB c 4K-->2016 MBP. Apple support said this was possible but I don't believe them given that daisychaining only works with TB on the Mac, and the 2.0 specifications on the USB Ports. But maybe because this is Apple sanctioned they made it work. Edit: you do say this: "Though I can’t find a definitive answer, it appears that you cannot daisy chain USB devices connected via USB-C, although you can simulate daisy chaining with the addition of USB-C–connected hubs. " So if I'm understanding this right, I'd need a USB c dock in the middle? Would the monitor be able to pass power through it to the MBP? Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 16:24 My understanding is that works only with Thunderbolt 3 monitors, not USB-C ones. USB-C, from what I can tell, does not support daisy chaining, only hubs. The LG monitor uses so many USB-C "lanes" for 4K DisplayPort that it lacks enough lanes to offer USB 3, thus drops to USB 2 (480 Mbps), which requires fewer lanes. A Thunderbolt 3 monitor can daisy chain both because the spec supports it and Thunderbolt 3 has enough raw throughput to pass through enough DisplayPort signal. But USB-based USB-C monitors can’t. Conceivably, a non Thunderbolt 3 monitor could pass through a signal (by acting as a hub of sorts), but the monitor resolution for each connected display would have to be half of 4K (about 1080p or so), and the Mac model would have to support MST, described in the article, which the 12-inch MacBook does not, and the new MacBook Pros don't require as such. Reply Mark  2016-11-07 16:49 So would a cheap USB C dock in the middle fix this? I'll be docking this laptop every day and want a one-cable solution. If I am forced to buy an expensive TB3 dock anyway, then I'd rather get a cheaper 4K monitor. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:30 Yes. I've tested USB-C docks with a 12-inch MacBook where you can have a 4K display and get USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5 Gbps) throughput on the USB ports. Reply Mark  2016-11-08 13:21 Do you have links? All I can find are docks that are limited to 30 Hz. The caldigit can do it with a firmware upgrade but then your USB ports become 2.0. Reply Andrew  2016-11-07 16:38 Is there a difference between a USB-C to USB-C cable and a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 3 cable? I know physically they would appear the same but would they both be capable of transmitting at the same data rate given identical host and peripheral? Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 16:47 They will be different electrically and functionally, made to different specifications. Also, every USB-C cable will have a tiny computer in the connector end that negotiates details with the port's controller. A USB-C cable designed for USB data will work with Thunderbolt 3, even between Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 3 ports, but the controller will recognize it can only handle USB 2 or USB 3. A Thunderbolt 3 cable should work with a USB-only port or ports, but will max out at USB 3 speeds (or whatever the controller wants). USB-only USB-C cables will be marked with a USB logo as noted in the article. Thunderbolt 3 cables will have a lightning bolt icon and a tiny 3. Reply Peter  2016-11-07 20:25 There are also "active" and "passive" versions of TB3 cables. The latter max out at 20gbps while the former can utilize the full 40gbps rate of TB3. Right now it seems that the active cables are only available in 0.5m lengths but that will change. The passive cables are available up to 2m. Reply John  2016-11-07 17:45 I can verify that Target Disk Mode does work over Thunderbolt 2 to Firewire adapters. We used it to image 2011 Mac Pros to 2013 Mac Pros. Reply Jim Vance  2016-11-07 18:48 What does "but not vice versa" mean in this context? Re-writing or adding a clarifying note would be most welcome. Thanks. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-07 19:05 I don't see that phrase in this article, so I'm not sure to what you're referring? Reply Jim Vance  2016-11-08 16:12 Sorry, this phrase is in the summary of the article that one sees on the tidbits home page. It reads as follows: Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between The new MacBook Pro laptops are the first Macs with Thunderbolt 3, a standard that uses the USB-C plug style and retains USB compatibility, but not vice versa.

So we are unlikely to update it to add more options, but will probably write more about different angles, like docks, etc. Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-08 01:15 Satechi are about to release a USB-C adapter packed with more ports: https://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Aluminum-Multi-Port-Adapter-Ethernet/dp/B01FWT7MEA/ref=pd_sim_107_1/151-9551496-6486460?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=FJP9074YB6JG8SJ36AS1 EThernet, HDMI, SD cards, USB3 & USB-C pass-through Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-14 22:18 Received my Satechi "Multi-port" adapter today - fast postage from USA! Most things seems to work well: HDMI, USB, ethernet... The Macbook connects to internet via ethernet and I can access a Time Capsule HD but, strangely, Network Diagnostics report a local network error. Only disappointment is that my iPad won't charge (it will with the Apple HDMI adapter). It should be great for travel and also as a dock for the office (just one cable to plug into the Macboook to connect internet, USB, HDMI and power). Reply Simon   2016-11-15 00:00 This is one of my main gripes with USB. The power rating always seems to be hit and miss. And of course it doesn't help that hardly a hardware manufacturer openly states what power each and every port can deliver. The MBP's USB-C obviously offers enough juice to charge the iPad. So my guess is that the USB-A ports on the Satechi do not pass through the full 2 Amps (or similar) that USB-A can. Bummer. It would be interesting to see if you can at least charge the iPad if you hook it up to the Satechi's USB-C through a Lightning-to-USB-C cable. Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-15 02:43 At least my iPhone charges OK. That is my main travel requirement. Not sure what you mean about Lighting-to-USB-c cable. Reply Simon   2016-11-15 03:03 http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0X2AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-cable-1-m Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-15 20:10 Also the SD slot & micro SD slot are handy. They turn the adapter into a memory stick. Reply Wibbly  2016-11-08 03:47 Apple has a support document that provides details on which adapters can be connected together to provide which protocols. In particular, I had a need for Firewire and the note says you can chain the Thunderbolt3-Thunderbolt2 adapter and then add the Thunderbolt2-Firewire adapter Here is the document: https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT207266 Reply Marc  2016-11-08 04:42 Could you please add information about the HDMI 4K adapters whether they support 60Hz (good) or only 30Hz (toy)? The Satechi adapter can only support 30Hz, which makes it a no-go option for me. Since TVs are way more affordable than monitors, people which do not want ultra-sharp displays like the new LG 5K 27" and 4K 21" but more screen space might want to connect one or two 40" curved 4K TVs via HDMI 2.0 as computer displays and show unscaled 3840 pixels (I currently type this on a LG 34" ultrawide 21:9 monitor with 3440*1440 px, unscaled, which is already 2 years old, and of course I want MORE space on my next monitor...). Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:47 It depends on the controller. The 12-inch MacBook only supports 4K at up to 30 Hz (and only 3840 by 2160). The MBP models support 4K (4096 by 2304) and 5K at up to 60 Hz. We'll be writing follow-up articles; this piece would get ungainly if we kept adding to it. Reply Marc  2016-11-09 01:35 Right - the MacBook 12" is no Pro, and has weak graphics. It supports only a single external 4K display with 30Hz. But the Pro line supports 60Hz (13" max two displays, 15" up to four 4K displays), so please check all HDMI adapters for that. Thx Reply rolf786  2016-11-08 06:06 Could Apple (or someone) make a Magsafe to USB-C charging adapter dongle, similar to the Magsafe 1 to Magsafe 2 adapter they did? That way you could make use of your spare laptop charges AND you'd still get protection against tripping over your charging cable. Reply Adam Engst   2016-11-08 10:27 Griffin Technology has one, but it still sticks out of the Mac, so it's not quite the same thing: https://griffintechnology.com/us/breaksafe-magnetic-usb-c-power-cable Reply rolf786  2016-11-15 03:19 Griffin have their own adapter format (and reviews say it's not that nice as magsafe). I was thinking specifically of a Magsafe-compatible dongle (I have quite an investment in Apple laptop chargers!) but I wasn't sure if the voltage/current it provides is compatible with USB C charging. Reply Michael Brown  2016-11-08 08:43 "...Thunderbolt 2 to 3 adapter ($29). Unfortunately, that adapter doesn’t allow for connections to Mini DisplayPort displays like Apple’s older Cinema Displays" Wait what? So I won't be able to plug my Dell display into a TB 2 to 3 adapter via a mini Display Port cable? That's what I got it for :-( Reply Simon   2016-11-08 09:04 It will still work, just with a cable instead of a dongle. If you take a USB-C/TB3 to (m)DP cable you should be fine. Here's an example. https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-DisplayPort-Chromebook-Thunderbolt-3840x2160/dp/B01EXKDRAC/ Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:48 Exactly. DisplayPort is native to USB-C and part of Thunderbolt 3 (for higher resolutions). So you don't need to use a Thunderbolt 2 to 3 converter at all. You can use a dock or a cable or an adapter, and plug from USB-C directly to a DisplayPort or HDMI connection. Reply Michael Brown  2016-11-08 15:08 As I already have a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter I was hoping to kill 2 birds with one stone with the TB 3 to 2 adapter, allowing me to use my old TB to Ethernet *and* for hooking up my external display (not at the same time of course). Looks like I'll have to get a USB-C to DP cable / adapter then :-( Reply Rich  2016-11-10 15:01 Do you know if it's possible to connect the old Apple Cinema Display (ACD) to a 2016 MacBook Pro? The ACD has a built-in cable with a male mini DisplayPort at the end. Would a female-to-female DisplayPort adaptor and a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C to male mini DisplayPort cable work? Or does this adapter actually support the ACD: https://www.amazon.com/USB-C-DisplayPort-Adapter-Aluminium-Macbook/dp/B00ZU1TXHA The Amazon reviews are mixed and it's USB-C rather than Thunderbolt so who knows what it supports?! Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-10 15:09 It's a tricky question. We know that the Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 adapter doesn't work with DisplayPort. We know that DisplayPort is native to USB-C and by extension to Thunderbolt 3. We know that full-sized DisplayPort to USB-C and HDMI to USB-C adapters and docks work! But there's apparently something funny with the Apple Cinema Display. I reviewed a dock at Macworld by the folks at Nonda with explicit ACD support, and they said because of chip issues, they could only support the 2015 MacBook (not the 2016) and only the ACD (not the Apple Thunderbolt Display). They were stymied. http://www.macworld.com/article/3131627/macbook-accessories/nonda-hub-mini-review.html Any USB-C adapter will work with a Thunderbolt 3 system, though, through backwards compatibility. So if it worked with USB-C that lacks Thunderbolt 3 it'll work with Thunderbolt 3 as well. Reply Josh   2016-11-08 10:38 Thanks Glenn, this is great and an awesome roadmap. One thing that I may have missed is will this work with the original USB 1. As a photographer I have stashes of old hard drives and a Zip drive stored away. I've moved them all to larger drives but keep the old as backups. I can see a day where those are no longer accessible and it may be today with USB C. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-08 11:49 USB 1 has largely been abandoned, so I'd recommend making additional copies, maybe writing to permanent discs and sticking in a safe-deposit vault. Zip disks are only rated to last a few years, so they may have degraded beyond readable point, in any case. Old hard drives magnetic properties degrade over time, too. Reply Michael Paine  2016-11-09 15:43 I use 25Gb bluray disks for long-term backup of crucial data. I realise typical photo libraries now exceed this capacity but the really important stuff should fit. Unlike DVD and CD (and magnetic media, and SSD!) Bluray is designed to last for decades. The biggest problem may be finding a Bluray drive in 2030! Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-09 15:50 Good plan! Although 1 TB SSD with a USB 3 interface might be a good investment when it gets cheap enough. Treat your USB 1 and Zip drives as quaint artifacts, rather than backups. Reply emma  2016-11-11 09:45 Apple sells a multi AV adapter to connect the new MacBook Pro to HDMI monitors, but I wonder if it would also allow an Apple TV to connect to a Thunderbolt 3 monitor. Is it possible to connect devices with HDMI out (Apple TV, PlayStation 4) to Thunderbolt 3 monitors (LG UltraFine 4k/5k) with a (combination) of cables or dongles? I thought it might work if the monitor supports "DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C Connector Standard", _and_ you buy an active (and relatively expensive) HDMI to DisplayPort adapter, and chain the DisplayPort to USB-C Thunderbolt 3 somehow. However, is DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB Type-C something that an input such as a monitor can accept or is it only an option if the output (e.g. a MacBook Pro) supports it? I'd be interested in a Thunderbolt 3 monitor if it could be used for more than only the new MacBook Pro. This article mentions that only the LG 5k monitor requires Thunderbolt 3 sources. Does that mean it might work with the 4k monitor? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-11 10:41 As you've found, HDMI - DisplayPort adapters are not bidirectional. Adapting a DisplayPort source to an HDMI display requires a cheap and relatively simple adapter but adapting an HDMI source to a DisplayPort display requires expensive, complex hardware. My hunch is once you've converted to some kind of DisplayPort, converting it further to DisplayPort Alternate Mode on USB-C is feasible. The LG 4K monitor is not a Thunderbolt 3 device so it's more likely to work. I think it's better to wait and see what other products come along, a 4K monitor with both USB-C and HDMI interfaces would be much simpler to work with. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-11 13:03 What Curtis said! Thanks for providing all that detail. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-11 13:06 A monitor that only features a USB-C connection (either built in or a connector into which to plug a cable) will only work over USB-C. A monitor with Thunderbolt 3 as its only connection method (such as the 5K) will only work with Thunderbolt 3. However, we're like to see monitors that offer DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C, as there's no real reason not to—all three standards can support 4K, and it lets a monitor maker sell to a broader audience. Internally, I don't think very much more circuitry is needed, because it's all effectively DisplayPort just being routed out of a controller. Reply Bruno  2016-11-12 10:11 How much bandwidth does it take to drive a 4K display at 60Hz? Could there be a hypothetical USB-c hub that connects to a single MBP USB-c/TB3 port and drives two 4K at 60 Hz + 1Gpbs Ethernet + a couple of USB-3.1 ports, simultaneously? Reply Curtis Wilcox   2016-11-12 15:05 A single UHD@60Hz* display is effectively 17.28 Gbit/s but it's not like the connector has a bandwidth budget that's partially consumed by video and by other devices using USB, it's more complex than that. The announced OWC *Thunderbolt 3* dock can do all that. https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbolt/thunderbolt-3-dock-overview However when the source port is a USB-C connector that does not support Thunderbolt 3, only USB 3.1, I expect the options are more limited. The video is separated from the USB-ness, it's DisplayPort Alternate Mode. DisplayPort 1.2 introduced "Multi-Stream Transport" (MST) which allows daisy-chaining monitors or having a hub. However, DisplayPort 1.2 can't be used for 2 4K/UHD displays and no Mac supports 1.3 yet. As Glenn wrote, the 12-inch MacBook doesn't support MST. Apple will probably stick with Thunderbolt 3 so what USB 3.1 supports won't matter to them but at least some PC manufacturers probably won't adopt Thunderbolt 3 and we'll see what docks and display hubs they come up with. Dell already made the D3100 which supports 1 UHD and 2 Full HD monitors on a single USB connection. * Often when people say "4K" they really mean UHD; UHD is 4 times more pixels than Full HD, 1080p, it's 3840x2160. "4K" is a wider, more cinematic resolution, 4096×2160. This may be one of those cases where the mis-use becomes so common that we just have to accept it, like "literally." Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-12 15:44 USB-C has "lanes," which get allocated, so it's not per se about bandwidth. Thunderbolt 3 supports 40 Gbps of data in each direction, but it has to be carved up and assigned to pins, essentially, which introduces limits so you can't make maximum use of the 40 Gbps with a mix of devices, depending on the mix. Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-12 15:46 Yes, this is what's confusing is that DisplayPort is both an alternate mode that works on USB-C without Thunderbolt 3 and (according to Intel's explanation) DisplayPort is incorporated inside Thunderbolt 3 separately. So a 5K monitor via Thunderbolt 3 is technically using Thunderbolt 3 alternate mode and DisplayPort inside that, while a 4K connected to any USB-C is using DisplayPort in alternate mode directly. Reply Openreels   2016-11-12 12:16 Gawd this is a mess! What we really need is a "USB-C Ecossytem" diagram that shows all the various sub-connections and how they relate (ie" what can carry, or is compatible with, what). I'd make one myself if I could get it all straight! Here's a resource that might be helpful: https://hermanproav.com/learningcenter.aspx?id=290 Reply Glenn Fleishman   2016-11-12 15:46 That's an excellent idea.

The new MacBook Pro laptops are the first Macs with Thunderbolt 3, a standard that uses the USB-C plug style and retains USB compatibility. But what’s most interesting about Thunderbolt 3 is how it supports numerous other protocols, including USB, Thunderbolt 2, FireWire, DisplayPort, and Ethernet, with the addition of appropriate adapters.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Rumor Intel Cannonlake Processors and 300-Series Motherboards Allegedly Launching in Late 2017 By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 5 days ago 115Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel is said to launch their 8th generation Cannonlake processors in late 2017. A report from Digitimes has alleged that Intel has scheduled the launch of their Cannonlake processors and 300-Series motherboards in late-2017. Intel Cannonlake CPUs and 300-Series Motherboards Scheduled For Late 2017 Launch Intel’s Cannonlake CPU lineup would replace the upcoming Kaby Lake processors which are going to launch at CES 2017. The new processors are based on a new process technology and would feature additional CPU and GPU architecture enhancements for improved performance. Digitimes has revealed that 300-series products will be available in late 2017 which would allow support for the 8th generation desktop processors. Intel reportedly is planning to add USB 3.1 and Wi-Fi functions into its motherboard chipsets and the new design may be implemented in its upcoming 300-series scheduled to be released at the end of 2017, according to sources from motherboard makers. Intel declined to comment on market speculation. via Digitimes Some of the key features that would be added to the new 300-series motherboards is native USB 3.1 and WiFi functionalities. This would allow Intel to not rely on third party manufacturers for WiFi and USB 3.1 controllers. This would affect many companies such as Broadcom, Realtek and ASMedia who either supply WLAN or USB – 3.1 chips. But at the same time, it would allow Intel to increase and standardize the new technologies on their platforms. Intel 200-series motherboards would be out in January so we will have to wait at least 10-12 months before we get to see 300-series products in the market. It is not known whether they would change the socket with 300-series but since it’s a die shrink of Skylake, it may be kept compatible with current LGA 1151 socket. Intel Broadwell-E HEDT Core i7 Processors Launching on 30th May - Official Prices and Specifications Confirmed Intel Cannonlake CPUs Rumored For 2017 Launch – Here are The Expected Features and Details Intel Cannonlake CPUs will be based on a new 10nm process node which would improve power efficiency. The new process would allow faster clocks under the same power envelope but we expect to see a bit more from Cannonlake CPUs. Although Cannonlake may be considered as a die shrink of Skylake or Kaby Lake which have the same basic architecture hierarchy, Cannonlake would be a bit different. We expect to see some sort of CPU and GPU architecture enhancements that would lead to IPC gains. We can consider this the same jump as we saw from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge. Moving on, the Cannonlake CPUs will be compatible with DDR4-2400 MHz (native). Advertisement Kaby Lake, the code name for a new microprocessor due to begin production late this year using Intel’s current 14-nanometer technology. Cannon Lake, Intel’s first 10nm microprocessor, due late in 2017. Ice Lake, the second generation of 10nm technology While Cannonlake is said to launch in 2017, we aren’t exactly sure whether Intel would be naming the family as Coffee Lake or Cannonlake. Coffee Lake is the name of the family that will feature the 14nm process node but would be architecturally similar to Cannonlake chips. The true Cannonlake chips which are not internally known as Coffee Lake are based on 10nm process node and the new enhancements. A previous leak revealed that Cannon Lake-S chips (desktop) would be part of the Coffee Lake family. So they might not be based on 10nm process, but rather 14nm. Intel CPU Generation Comparison:   Intel Sandy Bridge Platform Intel Ivy Bridge Platform Intel Haswell Platform Intel Broadwell Platform Intel Skylake Platform Intel Kaby Lake Platform Intel Coffee Lake Platform Intel Cannonlake Platform Processor Architecture Sandy Bridge Ivy Bridge Haswell Broadwell Skylake Kaby Lake Coffee Lake Cannonlake Processor Process 32nm 22nm 22nm 14nm 14nm 14nm 14nm 10nm Processors Cores (Max) 4 4 4 4 4 4 6 TBA Platform Chipset 6-Series “Cougar Point” 7-Series “Panther Point” 8-Series “Lynx Point” 9-Series “Wild Cat Point” 100-Series “Sunrise Point” 200-Series “Union Point” TBA TBA Platform Socket LGA 1155 LGA 1155 LGA 1150 LGA 1150 LGA 1151 LGA 1151 TBA TBA Memory Support DDR3 DDR3 DDR3 DDR3 DDR4/DDR3L DDR4/DDR3L DDR4 DDR4 TDPs 35-95W 35-77W 35-84W 65W 35-95W 35-95W TBA TBA Thunderbolt Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Platform Desktop LGA Desktop LGA Desktop LGA Desktop LGA Desktop LGA Desktop LGA Desktop LGA Desktop LGA Launch 2011 2012 2013-2014 2015 2015 2016-2017 2018 TBA Intel Kaby Lake Desktop CPU Prices Leaked - Core i7-7700K To Cost $349 US, Core i5-7600K To Cost $239 US Intel Cannonlake CPUs For Desktop Platform Could Be First Mainstream Chips To Feature Up To 6 Cores If the Cannonlake CPUs are indeed based on 14nm for desktop platforms than Intel might take another route to woo their customers. Since this would be the fourth 14nm family for desktop platforms, Intel can update the total core count to 6 on mainstream desktop PCs. It is already known from roadmap leaks that Intel would be upping the core count for Coffee Lake-H platforms to 6 so it doesn’t make sense not to do the same with the desktop platforms. More details for the entire Intel CPU family roadmap can be seen here. It will be interesting to see how Intel handles the desktop launch of Cannonlake / Coffee Lake chips in late 2017. For all we know, the 300-series boards sound like a good deal for mainstream users who aren’t interested in the upcoming 200-series boards. For now, we are waiting for the launch of Kaby Lake and 200-series motherboards in January 2017.

Carroll November 15, 2016 at 1:00 AM 6 Comments At Autodesk University in Las Vegas, HP introduced the HP Z2 Mini G3, a mini PC with a workstation-class Nvidia Quadro GPU that supports Intel Xeon E3-1200v5 CPUs. The small form factor (SFF) PC measures only 8.5 x 8.5 x 2.28 inches, which is decidedly larger than a device such as an Intel NUC, but it’s comparable to many other mini PCs that don’t house discrete graphics. The Z2 Mini is one tenth the size of a traditional workstation tower, and about one fifth the size of HP’s Z240 SFF workstation PC. Furthermore, the Z2 Mini is (on paper) twice as powerful as the aforementioned mini PCs. The Z2 Mini supports Intel Core i3, i5 and i7 processors, in addition to Xeon E3 processors. It also supports up to 32GB of DDR4 SO-DIMM memory, and the unit can be equipped with Nvidia Quadro M620 graphics with 2GB of memory. It has both a PCIe M.2 connector as well as space for a 2.5” hard drive, and the M.2 slot is positioned so that it can benefit from the cooling offered by the GPU cooler. The Z2 Mini G3 was designed with airflow in mind, to keep both the CPU and GPU cool while running quietly. The heat vents on the corners of the machine are even designed to resist blockage caused by loose papers or desk clutter. The company claimed the new Z2 Mini is 63% quieter than a comparable HP business-class mini PC. HP also boasted about the rigorous testing the Z2 Mini G3 endured, receiving three times the amount of testing hours that the company’s business PCs do. At launch, the HP Z2 Mini G3 workstation has already received 20 application certifications at launch. The HP Z2 Mini G3 can be set on top of or under a desk, mounted directly behind a display, or on a VESA arm between the arm and the rear of the monitor. The Z2 Mini G3 saves space by being overtly unobtrusive, so that it can certainly just disappear on your desk. To that end, it supports remote power on from the keyboard or mouse, because the system is designed to be tucked away. The HP Z2 Mini G3 comes in Entry and Performance models. The largest differences between the two is the lack of a dedicated GPU in the Entry model and the back panel--the Entry model has three DisplayPort interfaces and two USB 3.0 Type A connectors, whereas the Performance version adds another DisplayPort (for a total of four) and two USB 3.1 Type-C (Gen 1) ports. Both feature another two USB 3.0 Type-A ports on the side, and there is a provision to add a conventional serial port to the unit, which could be useful for businesses that still rely on older equipment. HP expects that the small, light, quiet Z2 Mini G3 will be popular in the design and CAD market segments, where an ever-increasing number of users are still migrating from 2D CAD programs to 3D applications. However, the financial markets and the medical segment could also significantly benefit from the Z2 Mini’s feature set. The HP Z2 Mini G3 workstation is expected to be available starting in December at $699. Update, 11/15/2016 8:55pm CT: A change was made to clarify the storage capacity and GPU options of the HP Z2 Mini G3. Product HP Z2 G3 Mini Workstation Processor Options - Intel Xeon E3-1200v5 Processors - Intel Core i3/i5/i7 Processors Chipset Intel C236 Memory Capacity Up to 32GB (2x SODIMM) Graphics Nvidia Quadro M620 2GB (Performance Model) Storage Options - Up 1TB 2.5" SATA - 512GB HP Z Turbo Drive (M.2 SSD) Ports - USB 3.1 Type-C (Gen 1) x2 - USB 3.0 x4 (1 Charging) Networking - Gigabit LAN - Wireless AC w/Bluetooth (Optional) Power Supply 135W Dimensions 8.5 x 8.5 x 2.28 inches Weight Starting at 4.5 lbs.

Also, that Titan isn't supported by something like Solidworks. 1 Display All 6 comments Comment Firstname Submit Most Popular Best Deals: November 11 (Update: Now Available For Pre-Order) A Protoype No More, MSI VR One Backpack Unveiled AMD Polaris Makes Its Debut In Zotac's ZBox Magnus ERX480 Mini PC Tom's Hardware Around the World Tom's Hardware Around the World Russia France Germany UK Italy USA Subscribe to Tom's Hardware Search the site Ok About Tom's Hardware Advertising About us Contact Purch Privacy Policy Terms Of Use and Sale Copyright Policy Copyright © 2016 Purch Group, Inc.

HP has reinvented the professional workstation — again — with the announcement of the world’s first mini workstation at Autodesk University 2016 in Las Vegas. First to market with the small form factor (SFF) workstation in 2010 and again with the all-in-one workstation in 2012, the computing giant has forged yet another new product category with the HP Z2 Mini, designed for users of CAD and other compute-intensive applications. Measuring a mere 8.5” x 8.5” x 2.3”, the HP Z2 Mini is ten times smaller than a traditional tower workstation and weighs in starting at 4.5 lb. It is twice as powerful as any commercial mini PC on the market today, according to HP, and can support six displays right out of the box. Shorter than a cup of espresso, the new HP Z2 Mini Workstation is capable of designing anything from state-of-the-art electronics to home and office buildings. System Configuration The HP Z2 Mini runs on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro or Linux and comes equipped with Intel Xeon E3-1200v5 or Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processors as well as optional NVIDIA professional graphics and HP Z Turbo Drive for speedy large-file handling. It is equipped with two SODIMM memory slots, one 2.5” internal drive bay, and one M.2 PCIe expansion slot. As for graphics, the Z2 Mini offers Intel integrated graphics and optionally, the new NVIDIA Quadro M620 2GB discrete mobile workstation GPU. Dual monitors are possible via the integrated graphics, plus an additional six via the optional GPU, for a total of six possible monitors.   Wolf in sheep’s clothing: The new HP Z2 Mini looks unassuming but packs the power of a full-size workstation. On the side, the Z2 Mini has two USB 3.0 ports (one charging); on the back, it has two USB 3.0 and two USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C ports and one audio line in. A mounting sleeve is available to attach the unit to the back of a monitor, the underside of a desktop, a wall, or other location. An optional Kensington Security Slot allows for physically locking the unit in place. Short in stature, the HP Z2 Mini isn’t short on ports. When Other Workstations Just Won’t Do HP Z2 Mini designed for what HP sees as the workspace (and the worker) of the future and aims to covert the 42% of designers who still are not using a professional workstation. Several trends drove development: Computer performance needs are increasing as CAD users move from 2D to 3D design. Workflows can’t afford downtime so hardware reliability is a must. Desk space is shrinking — in fact, HP reports a 60% space reduction per person in the United States over the past ten years. Workspaces are cluttered on the desktop (38% of users have two or more displays, according to HP, and floor space tends to be crowded, hot, and dirty. Users want attractive products, even when it comes to a computer chassis. According to HP, design is the No. 2 concern among end users; 52% of millennials believe design is important when choosing a PC.      “We realized that we needed to reinvent what it meant to be a workstation." The new model offers more than three times the graphics performance of an HP business-class mini PC, is 63% quieter even when running at a heavy load, and has had three times the quality testing —368,000 hours total. It is ISV certified for more than 20 critical applications, including most Autodesk and Adobe software as well as SOLIDWORKS. Groundbreaking Design The HP Z2 Mini was a design feat as much as an engineering one. The octagonal HP Z2 Mini, the company claims, is the most uniquely designed system in the company’s 35-year workstation history. Like a mobile workstation, the Z2 Mini packs a lot of powerful (and power-hungry) components into a small space, requiring high-end cooling capabilities. Vents are designed into all four corners of the unit, each with a guard to prevent air-flow blockage should it be inadvertently pushed against something. The front panel pops off to provide access to machine components, including a fan that swings up to reveal  system memory. Lead designer Paul Drew said his team aimed for a design that conveys “luxury” — a premium look and feel — with black chrome on the vents and a surface inside the vent guards “that reflects light onto the chrome and gives it sparkle. “When you express the function visually, it’s usually beautiful,” Drew said. HP has a reputation for listening to its workstation users, and brainstorming with customers resulted in several key design moves. For example, the system features remote power-on using any keystroke or mouse click from as far away as 30 ft. It also is mountable behind a monitor to save desk space. “This came out of brainstorming about what customers give up and what they gain when the unit is mounted behind the display. Customers identified this need, then HP engineers figured out how to solve for it."   The new HP Z2 Mini workstation is shown mounted behind a dual-monitor setup.   “If we had we not shared our plans with customers, we might not have identified this, said  Josh Peterson, director, worldwide product management, HP Z Workstations. “We also moved power button from back to front [to make it more accessible]. We wanted front to be clean but made the change in the interest of customers.” The Z2 Mini will inevitably lure away many users of the HP Z1 all-in-one and SFF workstations; approximately 80% of SFF users could obtain a comparable configuration with the Z2 Mini. But, “We’re committed for now to supporting development of the SFF” as well as the Z1, said Jeff Wood, vice-president and general manager, Workstations and Thin Clients. “Right now the Z2 is as small as we can go,” Wood added. “To go any smaller would require the components to produce less heat. It took six years [to evolve from the original HP Z desktop workstations to the Z2 Mini] so we don’t see getting any smaller in the near future.” Pricing and Availability Covered by HP’s standard three-year workstation warranty, the HP Z2 Mini is expected to be available worldwide in December starting at $699.   About the Author: Nancy Spurling Johnson E-mail Nancy Spurling Johnson About Nancy Spurling Johnson See contents by Nancy Spurling Johnson Note: Comments are moderated and will appear live after approval by the site moderator.

If you are running Windows on your Mac - like I'm doing on my 2015 retina MacBook Pro because macOS is far too unoptimised to run on it - and it's using an Intel graphics chip, be sure to replace Apple's own Boot Camp graphics drivers with Intel's own latest drivers. The reason why you should do this is kind of fascinating. I noticed that while Windows as a whole ran quite fast and snappy - much more so than macOS with its crappy responsiveness, FPS drops, and hangs, even after reinstallations - two applications had responsiveness issues: Chrome and Microsoft Office. With Chrome, I chalked it up to #justchromethings and moved on. With Office though, I was perplexed. The past few versions of Office, including the current one, are fast, snappy, and instant. The days where Office applications were slow and cumbersome are long gone, even on lower-end hardware like the 2015 retina MacBook Pro. However, Office applications were slow, rendering was terrible, and things like dragging and resizing Office windows was literally a slide show - and I wanted to know why. I found out that on Windows, Microsoft Office uses its own rendering pipeline (framework? I'm not really sure what the accurate terminology is here), different from both Win32 and Metro applications. As it turns out, Office does its own check of the video card and driver to determine if hardware acceleration for Office should be disabled or not. By default, hardware acceleration is automatically disabled in Office programs if certain video card and video card driver combinations are detected when you start an Office program. If hardware acceleration is automatically disabled by the program, nothing indicates that this change occurred. Well, except that Office now runs like a total dog, of course. Apparently, the Office team maintains its own list of video card/driver combinations and keeps this list a secret. The list of video card/video driver combinations that trigger this automatic disabling of hardware graphics acceleration is not documented because the list is hard-coded in the Office programs and will be constantly changing as we discover additional video combinations that cause problems in Office programs. When I ran the Intel Driver Update Utility on my retina MacBook Pro to determine if the Apple-provided Intel graphics driver was up-to-date, the tool found a newer driver, but warned me that my OEM (Apple) had modified the already-installed driver, and that I would lose those customisations. I proceeded to download the new driver anyway, only to be hit by a very peculiar dialog upon trying to install the driver Intel told me was newer than what I had installed: the installer warned my I was installing an older driver than what I had installed. So, I decided to download the latest driver (the latest beta) manually, installed it, and this fixed not just Office, but also Chrome - which I find particularly baffling (maybe Chrome maintains a similar list?). The list that the Office team maintains is not of good drivers, but of bad drivers. For Office's hardware acceleration to fail, the driver needs to be on the list. This means that the combination "Apple-modified Intel graphics driver/Iris 6100" was, at some point, added to the list, triggering the disabling of hardware acceleration for Office. The combination "Intel's own graphics driver/Iris 6100" is not on the list. There's a number of possible explanations here, and I'm not really sure which one makes the most sense. Apple cares too little about Boot Camp users to intentionally cripple the Apple-supplied Intel drivers, so that's definitely not the cause. I also don't think the Intel driver magically improved a ton in the span of just a few weeks (there's only a few weeks of difference between the two versions, but I'm not trusting version numbers here) - but maybe it did? I honestly don't know. It's Intel's beta driver that isn't even signed by Microsoft, but somehow, the Office team tested it and removed it from their list? My first instinct was to think that because Apple had modified the driver, it wasn't on Microsoft's list - but since the list is for bad drivers, that makes no sense. The most logical explanation I have right now - suggested by Steven Troughton-Smith - is that Apple changes a few things in the Intel driver to optimise Windows' battery life, which in turn tune down the performance, causing the Office team to add this specific driver/video card combination to the list. I've been keeping an eye on battery life since installing the driver, but haven't noticed much of a difference. I don't think this little tip will be useful for a lot of people, but I really enjoyed trying to figure out what was going on.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Inspur and Intel Co-Launch Leading FPGA Card in the US SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Inspur and Intel announced partnership on an R&D project — the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) (a programmable logic microchip) accelerator card F10A at the 2016 International Supercomputing Conference (SC16). This is a high density and high performance FPGA card based on OpenCL. Due to the easy programmability of OpenCL’s high-level development language, the F10A makes a qualitative leap in Software Productivity. In Traditional FPGA development, developer requirements are higher and the development period is longer – leading to applications in high-performance computing being limited. Based on OpenCL, F10A substantially shortens the development period by adopting software high-level language and programming models. According to data provided by Inspur, an engineer can independently transplant a GZIP application within one month with F10A using OpenCL – while it would take a period of three months to complete the transplantation using Verilog. F10A also features high performance, high density, and high applicability. Based on Altera’s Arria 10 microchip, F10A has a single precision floating-point performance of 1.5 TFlops, while the peak power consumption is only 35W, and the performance per watt is 42 GFlops. At the same time, F10A is designed for high-density half-length and low-profile, and has flexible on-board storage allocation and maximum support of 32GB memory, which is 4 to 8 times the industry average. Additionally, F10A supports two SFP+ GE/10GE interfaces, which can transfer data directly from the internet to the board card to be processed without needing to go through the CPU, thus greatly reducing transmission delay. The F10A supports data parallelism in DNRange mode and task parallelism in the Pipeline mode, fully supporting low-latency, high-intensity applications such as high-performance computing, deep learning, data acquisition, high-frequency transaction, network processing and signal processing, etc. With the explosive growth of HPC and AI, the performance and power consumption ratio of the traditional processor chip is a bottleneck. The OpenCL FPGA lies between a dedicated chip and a universal chip with programmability, reflecting distinct hardware reconfiguration and software-defined features, and in dealing with specific applications it has even more efficiency. Previously, Inspur teamed with IFLYTEK and Altera to successfully apply the FPGA chip to the online intelligent voice recognition sphere. This was 2.871 times faster than the CPU performance, while the power consumption was equivalent to 15.7% of the CPU performance. Power consumption increased by 18 times. satprnews.com Author RSS ImportPosted on November 16, 2016Categories Uncategorized Post navigation Previous Previous post: Red Berries Market: Global Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment, 2016 – 2026 Next Next post: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action against Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Certain Officers – ARWR Search for: Search Recent Posts Insomnia Pipeline Landscape and Therapeutics Development Market Review H2 2016 McKay Brothers Slashes Latency Between Tokyo and Singapore Diet Doc Provides Pharmacy-Grade Weight Loss Solutions and Customized Diet Plans With Ketogenic Diet U.S. News & World Report Names Best Nursing Homes for 2016-17 U.S. Census Bureau Daily Feature for November 16: Time Zones Recent Comments Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 November 2013 September 2013 June 2013 March 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 July 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 April 2010 March 2010 August 2009 January 1970 Categories Satellite Space Flights Uncategorized VSAT Meta Log in Entries RSS Comments RSS WordPress.org Partners TS2 Space Space Flights .news Satellite Press Releases Proudly powered by WordPress

CEO Brian Krzanich on Tuesday, Nov. 15, discusses the amount of data expected to be produced by autonomous vehicles by 2020 during a keynote speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show’s Mobility LA conference. (Photo: Michael Wayland/The Detroit News)Buy Photo Los Angeles — Intel Corp. plans to invest more than $250 million in the next two years for research and development of technologies for autonomous and connected cars. The targeted investment by Intel’s capital investment arm was announced Tuesday by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich during a speech at the Los Angeles Auto Show’s Mobility LA conference. It marks the most recent convergence of the automotive and tech industries in the race to connected and self-driving vehicles. Krzanich said the California-based tech giant will invest in startups that are trying to provide security to the connected vehicle space as well as other initiatives to “drive innovation and collaboration across the industry.” Intel, which has been growing its presence in the auto industry in recent years, sees opportunity in the massive amount of data that will be produced by self-driving cars. “Data is the new form of oil,” Krzanich said. “Let’s say you have a car driving between here and San Diego. Well, if you want to do that in an autonomous world, without data that car will not move … you’re going to have to have data as much as you’re going to have to have any type of propulsion.” According to Intel, one autonomous vehicle by 2020 will produce as much data in a day as about 3,000 people. If 1 million autonomous vehicles are on the road by then or later, that’s the amount of data produced by 3 billion people per day. The announcement is part of Intel’s ongoing work with automakers and system suppliers to help integrate advanced technologies in cars. Intel has booked more than $1 billion worth of revenue in the past 12 months from automotive-related business. The company has worked with leading global car manufacturers including BMW, Daimler, Hyundai, Rolls-Royce, Toyota, Tesla and others. “We really want to work collaboratively in this space,” Krzanich said, adding that no one company has all the answers or resources to proliferate connected, self-driving vehicles. The collision of automotive and tech companies was a main discussion among industry insiders at the mobility conference, which comes a day before automakers unveil more than 50 vehicles for the LA Auto Show. Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields on Tuesday said the industry is “on the cusp of a mobility revolution,” but collaborations and partnerships will continue to be needed. Starting next year, Ford will accelerate its efforts of urban mobility by working with city officials more closely to design the “city of tomorrow.” Part of the automaker’s plans include beginning to work with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his Compact of Mayors coalition, which focuses on helping cities and countries set and achieve more ambitious goals for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Fields said Ford plans to go to city officials and discuss their specific problems and needs in an attempt to determine what mobility efforts — ride-sharing, bikes, ride-hailing, etc. — may work best for that city’s residents. Fields said the company sees mobility as a much larger, more-profitable business than just producing and selling cars and trucks. “While we continue to make great vehicles, they are no longer our entire game,” he said. “Today we’re not only dreaming about the world of tomorrow, we’re also focused on creating the city of tomorrow, which means continuing to find ways to make peoples’ lives better whether they own a car or not.” Ford is investing heavily in autonomous cars because it believes driverless vehicles could account for 20 percent of industry-wide U.S. yearly sales by 2030. Of that 20 percent, Fields said 80 percent will be in fleets, while 20 percent will be for personal use. The company in August said it will have a fully driverless car without a steering wheel or pedals for braking and acceleration in 2021. mwayland@detroitnews.com CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2fvPf7Z TOP VIDEOS Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55 Tomorrow's doctors have fun at the Little Medical School 0:39 New housing, retail development in New Center breaks ground 2:48 Henry Payne goes 0 to 60 in the Porsche Boxster-Cayman 2:01 Open Streets in Detroit 1:47

Specifically, Kurosaki has revealed some of the creative inspirations behind the shooter’s story, revealing that the studio looked to modern classics such as Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan during development. With war stories, in particular, we looked at everything from Steven Pressfield’s Gates of Fire, which talks about the Spartan warriors at the gates of Thermopylae. They’re soldiers. They’re human soldiers fighting a human enemy and they’re relatable. For war, we looked at everything from that to Black Hawk Down, to Saving Private Ryan. In terms of in things that take place more in the science fiction setting, it was really looking at production design. I’m a big fan of James Cameron, who has a really interesting way of combining the familiar and the unfamiliar. When you combine those in an effective way, it grounds your whole universe and makes it more believable, more relatable. Call of Duty occupies a universe that doesn’t have monsters or aliens or giant blue people. We are in a plausible future where it’s a human versus human conflict, same as what it would be on Earth. But one of the things Cameron does is that he knows that he’s going into unfamiliar worlds, so he brings the familiar with him. What you have in Aliens and in Avatar are these heavy, tactile components. You have cockpits that are made of glass and steel and have heavy switches, you have helmets that look like they’re more from the Vietnam era than they are from some imagined, science fiction world.

Yeah certainly gonna help him come the end of the season when he gets. His release and is able to shop himself around in caches and but but still not many guys would have said that prepared statement. Asked if it was a whole prepared billion and I know the cynical say I hate it. Biggest threat that thing you know some agent or PR person wrote that maybe if I would complain about this it would be like. Circumcised and a mosquito hey I don't think he wrote that. Good gas LeBron James isn't happy with nick president Phil Jackson. ESPN published an interview with Jackson on Monday that included a wide ranging QNA in it Jackson talked about the state of the next and other topics. But James took exception with Jackson's description. Of the group of friends who travel and work with LeBron James as his posse. In the beginning we were highly criticized I was on the criticize about what I wanted to do. Those guys around become very successful business you know it just sucks that you notice. You know now at this point haven't wanted to. Go. Biggest businesses that you can have both on and off the floor. Covenant certified agent which bought up in the certify business or whomever part of that's just some great business. The fifth title for young African Americans. The work pops. We see the success that we had it been there have been is always someone that edition of house bills I'll always goes up there. You know ago I don't believe this could just use this same term this bomb he was doing this someone else. You know and and you know working with another team or use worked with anybody in sports on his own team. That was an African American head a group of guys around me he didn't agree with video that you caught off. So to use that label and if you go rigid definition with the world bosses. This yes it's not. Built over my career now Austin court no offense and us four and I believe always use they'll war with some young African American government to. Help help me out is is. Posse now a dog whistle word of this is Phil Jackson a racist because of so he's the first since Buddhist ever to join aryan. Can I just read you what it says in the dictionary shoot a body are forced armed with the legal authority. Slang a group of friends or associates. Ari I don't see the racial charge I would just reading another another odd definition I do a group of people who have a common characteristic occupation or purpose. Nobody I know I think what he's getting at is the you know let's roundup a posse and right it is that ordered only to Michael's and Arabs game plan. Kraft. Group crowd packed court heard throng mob swarmed troops cluster. You know nobody calls. Nobody says a white athlete had policy fails. You don't hear that. I ice tucked away ironically Emmy Lou Maloney is seen in the big David in high school he was part of a group that. Call themselves the foxy possibly believe it or not. Oh. Not oxy I'm like why let admitted that when I heard today they would have said because they're grandma has prescription drugs for sale. But hey you said it's because they brought the oxygen to the place like they would necessary at. Is that it ironically but it's Phil Jackson I hate her Big Easy it is seen demeaning people of color is that. If she's donating eggs demeaning LeBron LeBron didn't like it and he can't. Look I can't fit the political bias which it did get a that you can't do that you can't say that guy. I don't he can't save the Phil Jackson's races. Now what LeBron thing it was you know like the term anything spilled Jackson would have used the term. We were talking about a white athlete I haven't heard anybody. Describe white athlete in his policy heard about Allen Iverson the guys heard about Dez Bryant. Arnold could be. Maybe haven't been around and maybe haven't listened to enough people describe. Happened that way all athletes that. Bottom McGregor won its title bout against Eddie Alvarez Saturday night at USC to a five after the bite McGregor gracious as always. Absolutely no. That nobody is sell in the sport that is an am he has he has Vince McMahon you know if if it meant built up an athlete in up in a laughed. It cannot like Connor McGregor yeah it's after he'd be about a foot taller guys who haven't had parked him juice out of his mind since his latest victory a lot of and analysts and commentators have been describing McGregor is the Floyd Mayweather up MMA. That description does not sit well with Floyd. If you see the flu Mayweather. None of us felt. Heavier remained three version beta one oh boy had every minute. Everybody's definitely one night so it's never prepare. They're it's it's a total disrespect that comment on the palace and don't be quick hits you have to so large and see. Come on Floyd so if somebody calls him the Floyd Mayweather and he immediately goes to the money aspect of it. I'd like to be one thought it was harder to my money. And I don't think that's what everybody was worried about. So the New York Islanders have lost their last three games having a tough time early on in this NHL season there's talk may be their coach Jack app you want a may have to be replaced. But details today on boomer and carton down a New York Jerry's pal Craig carton. Revealed one reason why it may be hard for islanders GM Garth snow to replace cap you wanna. I would wish. Yes I would summer Long Island's Jack. So yeah that's correct but you are you really this can't come on now if that's regards those basement. Excuse me what happened why aren't so has George don't. That's his basement if environment for clothes and little white had been cheated on partly paid ninety. As we heard yeah crashes it's those basement. I. It anyway. So true so the culture the computers is living in the basement of the general manager is adamant in a box like eleven and stranger things it is long narrow and so it's probably mansion like a separate apartment. Splits. Basement out all pictured at full wood paneling from the seventies made a shag rug. It will be quite honest there's going to cap you wanna wants to get away from its general manager and wanna have to build a base over the kitchen table. Couple of grants to get to hear first off the cowboys beat the Steelers Sunday when rookie back Ezekiel Elliott broke a 32 yard touchdown fourth. Yesterday this video appeared on social media it's a Steelers fan so enraged. He decides to smash his flat screen TV but let's be honest we have ever reasonably. This thing is 100%. A. Fake fake fake fake we discovered some mini me about this it's. Well it I did I don't know I don't know. Don't peace is reaching for the court of the TV with security knows what's gonna happen second vault the TV that he's matches is much smaller team. Actually should do or at all Terry pointed out the TV that he supposedly smashed and when he was smashing. It was OK so and fourth of all we don't know Steelers fans can't procreate. Well our coast I think those kids would have been much more terrified him and black man I don't know. That's got to hardy boys on the street and they of this match steel and glass items packaged to support children's. Acceptable just did it looks. My real question is why your children such bad actors. As they got their Q it would title there cared so acutely it would it would play like a tree at the school like by the way Ben. Our buddy Michael forgot about. The most famous athletic posse for an expert a white guy. Channel Mac in the mean street posse out Michael had to come on oh yeah Shane McMahon well like finally I forgot about him.

We used his hobby to catch his wife cheating on on the on oh good people ice well he likes drones in his spare time maybe that's what he's. It might upload the video captured the state hole held a Friday night you're sprint from Charlotte error that a large take drugs. When he suspected his wife.

Russian and out of the notion though is make an original Arabic socialized and doctor Carol L experts think this guy is hiding behind.

By the way the more team says here's the moment and so she leans in the frightened as it's making a what what is she sixteen years old and his troops have been married for eighteen years nightmare and they got me in the parking lot and they get there what we got their make outs. The got a big guy got a little bubble in the back yet I always go to CBS and and fans love and love and it it's the bedrock and don't count adopted thank you gonna get your joke from 2009 was in the car Tiger Woods left nothing.

BUSINESS L.A. Auto Show 2016 live updates: Mercedes exec says human drivers will bully robot cars Nov. 15, 2016, 8:15 p.m. The Los Angeles Auto Show opens to the public Friday and ends Nov. 27. Take a look through our coverage from the four days of press previews and keynotes, known as AutoMobility L.A., to see photos and analysis of the latest high-tech offerings. The disappearing stick shift: Less than 3% of cars sold in the U.S. have manual transmissions Electric cars are less than 1% of the market. Yet automakers are pushing them big time. Why? What to expect if you go to the L.A. Auto ShowWhat to expect if you go to the L.A. Auto Show All updatesGadgets and techHybrid and electric carsSelf-driving vehiclesUnveilings Self-driving vehicles Nov. 15, 2016, 12:00 p.m. Intel CEO calls for automakers to buddy up on self-driving safety features Paresh Dave (Paresh Dave / Los Angeles Times) Businesses don’t like to share proprietary information with competitors. But for the sake of consumer safety, the auto industry should open up some self-driving car data, Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said during a keynote address Tuesday. Automakers point to trying to make roadways safer as the biggest reason for developing self-driving vehicles. But getting the technology right requires refining software that analyzes radar, camera and other sensor data. The thinking goes that the more data considered, the better the algorithm, the safer the car, Krzanich said. How does a car react to a particular unsafe situation? The technical details of the response is the type of content Krzanich said the industry might want to gather in a central database. It should enable everyone to get the “fundamentals” right, he said, and companies individually can add redundancies and other safety measures that go above and beyond. It’s unclear whether his message will find a receptive audience as automakers wrestle with how to gather and store the increasing amount of of performance, environment and user information produced within vehicles. Krzanich noted that in the coming years, a million self-driving cars in operation will be — in terms of data production — the equivalent of adding 3 billion people to the world. Calling for data sharing is good for Intel because it offers technology for companies to store and share data online. It also could be good for the automotive start-ups that Intel’s investment arm expects to back with $250 million over the next several years. Access to the shared information could help those start-ups develop sensors and software much faster than they could working independently.

The sunglasses are also outfitted with a bunch of sensors, including an accelerometer and gyroscope. They can also apparently detect pressure, humidity, and proximity.

Even after brushing aside the last-generation machines that are still for sale, the current offerings are confusing. Both 15-inch models come with the Touch Bar, but only two of the three 13-inch models offered do. That $1,499 non-Touch-Bar-but-still-in-the-new-skinny-case 13-inch MacBook Pro is what I'm typing on right now. It's a great little laptop. The screen is gorgeous, battery life is great and it's more than fast enough for what I need when I'm not in front of my 5K iMac. It's a weird machine, though. I'm sure Apple left the Touch Bar — and two Thunderbolt 3 ports — out solely to hit the price point, which is already higher than the model it replaces. My guess is that this MacBook Pro will either drop in price or be replaced in the future as the Touch Bar trickles down. Until then, it's in the ranks of some other modern-era Macs that were caught between other products or different eras of hardware design. Let's look at some other examples. Power Mac G4 (PCI Graphics) This initial Power Mac G4 — codenamed Yikes! — was based on the Blue and White Power Mac G3 that came before it. Apple basically took the G3's logic board and added the G4 to it. If that sounds a little weird, it's because it was. The Power Mac G3 (PCI Graphics) was a hedge in case the "real" Power Mac G4 — with AGP graphics, AirPort compatibility, a faster memory bus and more — wasn't ready in time. That ended up being the case, so Apple sold this PCI Graphics model as the low-end model, with the faster, totally re-worked AGP-based machines shipping a month or two later. By the end of 1999, the PCI Graphics model was phased out, making it the shortest-lived computers modern Apple has ever sold. Power Mac G4 Cube This is one of those Apple projects that very clearly existed because Steve Jobs willed it into being. It was an entire G4 computer, packed into an 8-inch cube, that was then suspended in a clear acrylic case. It's still one of the most beautiful objects I own. It sits on my desk to this day. That beauty came at a cost, however. The Cube didn't have the same dual-CPU setup that could be found in the Power Macs, and the machines suffered from several design flaws from case cracks to overheating. The biggest problem was that it was hard to know who it was for. It marked the first time Apple expanded its product line beyond the "Grid of Four" that Jobs had implemented when he came back to the company: It was far more powerful than the iMac G3s Apple was selling at the time, but not as fast — while being nearly as expensive — as the towers. As a result, it didn't sell very well and was "put on ice" in July 2001. In that press release Phil Schiller said, "Cube owners love their Cubes, but most customers decided to buy our powerful Power Mac G4 minitowers instead." Mac mini (Early 2006; Core Solo) While it's a story for a different time, the switch to Intel was one of Apple's finest engineering hours. Not only was it a smooth transition for end users, the first Intel Macs were solid machines. When the first Intel iMac replaced the iMac G5, and when the PowerBook was replaced with the MacBook Pro, Apple was able to keep the costs the same. The MacBook started in between the cost of the 12-inch and 14-inch iBooks, but the Mac mini saw a price jump from $499 to $599 when the G4 was replaced. There was a catch though. To get a decent Mac mini, it suddenly cost $799. Here's Jonathan Seff, writing at Macworld in 2006: ...it’s important to remember that the original $499 Mac mini lacked all but the basic features, including the now-standard AirPort and Bluetooth wireless options. Adding those features to an older Mac mini cost about $100. And that’s not even considering the new chip and faster frontside bus and RAM; the switch to Serial ATA hard drives; and the addition of Gigabit Ethernet and two more USB 2.0 ports (now four in total). And the $799 model costs $200 more than its predecessor, but includes a Core Duo processor and 8x dual-layer DVD burner. The cheap model goes down in history as the only Intel Core Solo Mac ever sold. Like my MacBook Pro, it seems like Apple had to compromise on the specs to hit a price point. I remember Mac users being pretty upset about it at the time; I know I was. Thankfully by the end of 2006, the base Mini was updated to include a Core Duo chipset ending this weird little footnote to the Intel transition. Late 2008 & Early 2009 MacBooks The white and black plastic MacBooks seemed ubiquitous for a long time. After several years — and in conjunction with the unibody MacBook Pros — Apple reintroduced the MacBook. This generation featured the same aluminum case, glass-covered display and expansive trackpad as the then-new MacBook Pros, but lacked the horsepower and FireWire 800 port seen on the Pros. With this redesign, the price went up, so Apple would soon announce another new MacBook that was sold as a $999 alternative. It was one last white plastic model, albeit one that was just as weird: It was technically a unibody machine, but the only one ever to be made of plastic instead of aluminum. Confusing days. Progress Always Means Weirdness Every transition in technology brings a period of time in which less-than-optimal decisions have to be made. Price, features and timelines are always at war with one another. Sometimes that means Apple ships computers that aren't everything they could be. Sometimes it means there are big delays between generations. Sometimes they just make the Mac faithful sad. Better days are often just around the corner. Probably. Tags: mac Join Now Like MacStories?

The company’s India data-centre business, which contributed $145 million (1 per cent) to Intel’s total Data Centre Group revenues of $14.5 billion in fiscal 2014, is expected to clock double-digit growth this fiscal. ‘Buzzing market’ “Asia is a buzzing market for our data-centre business, and India is a high growth-opportunity market for Intel, especially with the digital infrastructure build-out, which the government is driving, gaining momentum. Two years ago, Intel’s data-centre business globally registered 18 per cent growth, and last year, we saw 11 per cent growth in revenue. We expect to maintain double-digit growth rates in our data-centre business,” Prakash Mallya, Director - Asia, Data Centre Group, Intel, told BusinessLine. He said Asia is one of the fastest-growing data-centre markets not just for Intel, but for all companies that are in the business. As per an estimate of research firm Research and Markets, the global data-centre construction market is expected to grow from $14.59 billion in 2014 to $22.73 billion by 2019, at a CAGR of 9.3 per cent. At a time when the PC market is shrinking globally, the $60-billion chip maker is counting on data centre, its fastest growing and most profitable business, to drive its future growth. In the third quarter of the current fiscal reported last month, Intel reported a revenue of $15.8 billion, of which the Data Centre Group contributed $4.5 billion, recording 13 per cent sequential growth and 10 per cent YoY growth. Digital India While Mallya declined to mention the latest India revenues and growth rates of the Data Centre Group for the current fiscal, stating that it is company policy not to split region-wise revenue and growth numbers, he said Intel will be investing significantly in all the Digital India-related solutions, such as IndiaStack, UID and eGovernance 2.0, all of which represent huge workloads that the data-centre business will address. In an interaction with BusinessLine early last December, Diane M Bryant, Senior Vice-President and General Manager, Data Centre Group for Intel, had revealed that India revenues of $145 million in the data-centre business in 2014 would witness a 50 per cent growth in fiscal 2015, which would translate to approximately $218 million. According to Bryant, the Data Centre Group was expected to grow at 15 per cent CAGR globally, over the next five years.

It needs a win … badly. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Although Target stock is up 7% for the past five trading days, shares have yet to reclaim the ground they lost in response to rather pitiful second quarter — on a year-over-year basis revenues fell 8%, for a variety or reasons. Income fell nearly 10%. Same-store sales were down 1.1%. It’s not the direction the retailer was hoping to be headed into what could be a crucial holiday shopping season. Is there any chance Target stock could have stopped the bleeding between then and now? There’s always that chance, but there aren’t too many $40 billion companies that can turn on a dime. Target Stock Earnings Preview As of the last look, analysts collectively expect Target stock to report income of 83 cents per share on sales of $16.3 billion for its third quarter. Both would be down from year-ago figures of earnings of 86 cents per share of Target stock and a top line of $17.6 billion. 7 CEOs That Are Heading to the Chopping Block by 2018 The company itself had offered Q3 profit guidance of between 75 cents and 95 cents per share, but only added that same-store sales would likely be between flat and down 2% for the latter half of the year. Analysts, however, have posted more specific suggestions — they’re looking for a 1.2% decline in same store sales for the third quarter, and a 1.5% dip for Q4’s same-store sales figure. Target stock has topped analyst estimates more often than not since its fiscal 2014 (calendar 2013) lull, and has broadly grown the per-share bottom line. Bear in mind, however, that aggressive stock buybacks have greatly contributed to that growth. Actual net income has quietly been slumping for years, which doesn’t bode well for Target stock. 3 Keys for Target Stock Holders While in the end it’s always about the numbers, the figures Target produces are ultimately about the company’s initiatives and decisions. There are three keys to the results the retailer has been producing and will produce in the foreseeable future. Groceries: Target touted the expansion of it grocery category as the key to sales growth earlier in the year; the company was certain it could become the one-stop solution for consumers. So far though, no dice. A quarter ago the company was reporting that produce and meats were spoiling sitting on the stores’ shelves before they were bought. TGT vowed to keep working it, but with the impending exit of the grocery division’s chief, Anne Dament, that business is about to face a sizable disruption before being put on track.

It has set up a router in village centres so that villagers can download information on their apps without relying on data plans on their mobile network. Another startup, Klassik Klonec has completed building an IOT-enabled hydroponic system, which is a prcoess that enables growing vegetables on sand and water without using soil. This involves growing green leafs and vegetables in households and industrial areas.  The startup has developed a box that maintains temperature and other conditions automatically inside the box. It has various individual customers across India and has also got customers from abroad looking to import the equipment to grow plants within an enclosed space. Smartron is a Bengaluru-based OEM startup that has come up with the t-phone and t-book. The company has its own t-store to buy applications and has already started selling its product through Amazon in India. These firms were part of the nine startups to have first batch of products made from the Intel makers' laboratory. Intel says that they achieved higher success rates because of the method of choosing startups that were best suited for the acceleration program. "We took in people, who really needed some technology help and required mentorship that could accelerate what they were doing.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 4:42 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Windows PCs Computer Hardware Comments HP has been hoping that sleek, powerful hardware will lure Apple Mac aficionados to switch to its PCs, and now is aiming the new Z2 Mini mini-desktop at Mac Mini users. The Z2 Mini packs the computing power of a full-size desktop into a box that can be held in one hand. Starting at $699, it will be available worldwide starting in December. HP has been excelling in PC design, with innovative desktops like Pavilion Wave, a cylindrical desktop, and Elite Slice, a modular mini-desktop onto which components can be snapped. The 2.4-kilogram Z2 Mini can cram an Intel server CPU and discrete Nvidia GPU -- both of which have their own cooling fans -- into a tiny space while delivering screaming performance. The Z2 Mini could be an alternative for those looking to replace the aging Mac Mini, which hasn't received a design or hardware upgrade for years now. Apple has been abandoning the professional market and, for engineers and designers, the Z2 Mini is superior to the Mac Mini, said Jeff Wood, vice president of HP's workstation business, during a briefing. The idea that Apple is stepping away from the professional market was highlighted during the recent release of the MacBook Pro, which has innovative features like the Touch Bar. But it attracted criticism for using old Intel Skylake chips, and was widely considered more of a consumer than a business PC. Apple also hasn't upgraded its Mac Pro desktop since 2013, and workstations with Windows are filling that void. The new Windows workstations have superior processors, GPUs, memory and SSD storage. The Z2 Mini is targeted at engineers and architects using applications like Autodesk or Solidworks. However, it isn't meant for use with VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, an HP spokesperson said. Nvidia's Quadro M620 GPU isn't designed for VR, and headsets typically need full-powered desktops like the Z840 with cutting-edge GPUs. The Z2 mini-desktop can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3-1200v5 CPU, or Core chips. It supports up to 32GB of memory and up to 1.5TB of storage. An entry-level model will have three DisplayPort ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet port. A fully loaded model will have two additional USB Type-C ports. But some features are missing. It doesn't have an HDMI port to attach displays, or a Thunderbolt 3 slot to attach high-speed storage. Workstation users dealing with high-end graphics need more than 1.5TB of storage, and the USB 3.0 port, with its data transfer speed of 10Gbps (bits per second), may not be enough. Storage devices attached to a Thunderbolt 3 port -- which transfers data at 40Gbps -- can be used in real time, much like internal storage.  The Z2 can be mounted behind a monitor so it remains hidden.

The new earbuds introduced biometrics that could monitor a user's heartbeat and more while being controlled by their digital assistant called "Jarvis." Of course Apple had such an invention going all the way back to their filing in 2008. That invention has now been granted a patent. Another site reporting on this today mistakenly said that Apple's invention would work with Siri, but the invention doesn't support spoken commands whatsoever. The invention does however support head-gestures to control this next-generation of EarPods. The "wireless communications" noted in the report is in context with communicating with the monitoring system on an iPhone or iPod, not verbal communications.   Apple's newly granted patent 9,497,534 covers their invention relating to a monitoring system that could be placed proximate to the head or ear of a user. According to one embodiment, the monitoring system can be used with a hearing device, headphones, earbuds or headsets. The monitoring system could, for example, be used to monitor user activity, such as during exercise or sporting activities. The positioning of the monitoring system could also facilitate sensing of other user characteristics (e.g., biometric data), such as temperature, perspiration and heart rate.   Apple's patent states that the new sports oriented EarPods would be convenient for users than having to use a monitoring device in running shoes like the Nike+iPod system.   The added feature unique to this next-generation of EarPods, should it come to market, is that the user would be able to control some functionality using head gestures. Apple's patent notes that "receiving head motion data pertaining a head motion of a user of the electronic device; determining whether the head motion data matches any of a plurality of predetermined head gestures; and identifying an action associated with the matching predetermined head gesture. Additionally, the method can further operate to perform the identified action on the electronic device."   While Apple could always add Siri to the mix, it's not supported in this particular patent in its claims or otherwise.   Although some of the patent claims were updated over the years, the original 2008 patent application that was published by USPTO in 2010 was covered in our original report titled "Apple Reveals Advanced Sports Monitoring and Head Gesturing Systems." Check out our original report for more details.   Patently Apple presents only a brief summary of granted patents with associated graphics for journalistic news purposes as each Granted Patent is revealed by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Lenovo ZUK Z2: Promising smartphone, with a few caveats [Review] By Desire Athow Published 2 months ago 6 Comments Tweet Lenovo is already a well-established brand in Western Europe thanks to its personal computer brand which counts the legendary ThinkPad range and German manufacturer, Medion, amongst its ranks. It also absorbed storage vendor Iomega, IBM’s Intel-based server business and NEC personal computer range. The company has acquired phone manufacturer Motorola, inheriting yet another iconic brand whose name still carries a lot of value for a mainstream audience. But the latest move of the Chinese company, which is also the biggest PC vendor in the world, has been surprising. It launched a division called Zuk, which is a Chinese-only brand, apparently aiming to compete with the likes of OnePlus (a subsidiary of OPPO), Honor (a subsidiary of Huawei) and Xiaomi. Gearbest sent us the Zuk Z2 which is its latest addition to its portfolio, one that goes head to head against the Honor 8 and the OnePlus 2. The phone costs just under £200 including delivery; we would suggest that you read this piece about the pros and cons of buying technology from online Chinese retailers (links to our sister website, TechRadar). The Design No surprise there, ZUK uses the same sort of design that you’d find on premium models. Indeed, the phone has an air of iPhone 5 about it, with an entirely black finish. It sports lean lines and a minimalist design with dual 2.5D Arc glass front and back sides. As a business phone, the ZUK will have no problem displayed next to the latest high-end smartphones on the market. Not a hint of plastic here. The software is an entirely different story; more on that later. Glass is a premium material, but suffers from three big disadvantages. It is fragile (despite what Gorilla Glass will say -- note that the phone doesn’t use GG), it does attract fingerprints and it has a nasty tendency to slide on smooth surfaces (which often ends with a big thump when it hits the floor). To Lenovo’s credit, it seems that it used an oleophobic coating to make the rear and the front less greasy. The front fascia contains the speaker, a front facing camera as well as a physical home button that hides a few tricks. Just below that, on the shorter sides, is the headset input, the USB Type C connector and the speaker grill. On the side is the power button, the volume rocker and the SIM card holder. There’s no micro SD card slot -- the phone comes with 64GB by default -- and two nano SIM cards, both on standby, can be supported. At the back is a small ZUK logo -- no mention of Lenovo -- a single flash and the camera sensor. ZUK says that it used metal particle coating on the sides to enhance the phone’s look; what that means is that it makes it look matte. The Hardware The phone’s dimensions -- 8.5 x 142 x 69mm -- are great for whoever is not a big fan of phablets; ditto for the weight which tops the scale at only 149g. Bear in mind that it has a smaller than average 5-inch display, coupled with a full HD resolution, though, it does produce sharp pictures. More on that later. As for most of the high end vendors -- and unlike many of its tier-2 Chinese competitors which have opted for Mediatek chip -- the Zuk Z2 uses a Qualcomm one, the Snapdragon 820, a beast of a processor that runs four cores at up to 2.2GHz and has an Adreno 530 GPU. As expected, it supports 802.11ac, LTE (all UK 4G bands except Band 20/800MHz), LPDDR4 and Bluetooth 4.1. There’s also an array of sensors including a gyroscope, a compass, a hall sensor, a proximity sensor and a light one. As mentioned before the ZUK Z2 comes with 64GB onboard storage; note that the phone uses the slower eMMC 5.1 technology rather than the faster -- but more expensive -- UFS 2.0 one. The rear camera sports a 13-megapixel sensor from Samsung while the front one is an 8-megapixel model. Both have fairly wide apertures (f/2.2 and f/2.0 respectively). And the rear camera can shoot at 4K. The smartphone also came with a USB Type C cable and a tiny adaptor with a Chinese plug, but one which delivers far more juice than your average charger. It’s rated 2.5A at 5.3V which equals 13.25W or almost a third more than a standard mobile power adaptor. Sadly, there’s no NFC capabilities which is simply unacceptable on a phone in this category. This short-range, low power connectivity mechanism has become more popular and omitting it automatically excludes it from some use case scenarios like Android Pay. In Use As expected, the components in the ZUK Z2 deliver a stellar performance; it blazed through the popular Antutu mobile benchmark, delivering a superb score of 140,058 which is within spitting distance of the leader, the OnePlus 3. The display uses the LTPS technology, probably from Sharp (now Foxconn); that’s a similar display used by the Apple iPhone 7. The pictures look crisp even in broad day light with an average contrast and excellent brightness. Colors are not too saturated and looked natural with excellent viewing angles; out-of-the-box options to tinker with the display settings are limited though. As expected -- thanks to a pixel density of 441PPI -- the icons and texts remained sharp. The sound quality is one of the few weak spots; the mono speaker failed to deliver the oomph and reach the highs of devices like the Sony Xperia Z3 which deliver sound through two front facing speakers. Audio quality remains a recurrent issue with Chinese smartphones. One bright spot though has to be the fingerprint reader which can be configured and is not only fast (100ms response time) but also unobtrusive. The hardware only tells half of the story: bear in mind that this is a smartphone for the Chinese market so the installed firmware indicates that. We encountered Chinese characters when trying to update to the latest version of the OS (2.1.059 ST). Sadly, that didn’t go as planned and is symptomatic of the sort of experience you encounter with devices that are not location-optimized. We had to install a VPN to download the most recent firmware update as ZUK’s servers wouldn’t allow anyone from outside China to do it. And even then, we couldn’t install it because the phone was apparently encrypted (we couldn’t find any option in the settings to disable it). Furthermore, although the ZUK Z2 came with Google Play, most of the other Google services (Youtube, Gmail etc) were not installed by default. At the time of writing, there’s no English version of the ZUK website which means no official support (you can always rely on unofficial third party user forums, but at your own risk). As for the battery life, it was excellent. The 3,500mAh battery managed to keep the phone running for almost two days, albeit without any intensive tasks (no Youtube or gaming involved). Verdict Clearly, using this phone is not for the faint hearted. The number of hoops you need to go through to get an OTA (over the air) update is frightening and highlights the gulf that exists between established brands like Huawei or Samsung and those -- which, like ZUK -- aspire to match them. Obviously, Lenovo has no excuse to fall back on. The OTA experience should be much better than that even if it is a smartphone destined for the Chinese market. There’s also the lack of NFC which puzzled us as much as it disappointed us. And, while entirely subjective, the use of glass at the back instead of metal or plastic means that the phone is more likely to be scratched especially as it slides more easily on any surface with a gentle slope. Ours got a few scratches within 24 hours. Sure, a protective sleeve or case would help, but then doesn’t that negate the purpose of having a glass back in the first place? That combined with the fact that it doesn’t support band 20 (800MHz) makes it a no-no for O2 customers whose LTE service uses this frequency exclusively. MVNO customers from Giff Gaff, Tesco Mobile and Talk Talk are also in the same boat. In the end, the ZUK Z2 is a prime example of a phone that could certainly become a hit, but will probably have to be sidelined until the major issues highlighted before are solved.

But we were disappointed to see that things were actually worse. While the infrastructure had improved, the amount of exposure students received to the outside world remained the same. So we wanted to do something about it,” Arun Prakash recollected. Dealing With the Language Barrier View photos guvi1More “One thing that stood out was the fact that there were many talented students, but they were held back by the language barrier. Their sparse knowledge of English made it difficult for them to follow lessons, particularly those related to computers,” said Arun. The trio returned to Chennai and began thinking of ways to help these students. Soon, GUVI was born, initially just as a YouTube channel. “We started a YouTube channel and started uploading instructional videos in vernacular languages. For instance, if you wanted to learn coding or programming in your native tongue, you could do that,” said Arun. The channel soon had over 4,000 subscribers and more than a million views. Many students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities wrote in, letting them know that the videos had a positive impact on their lives. This motivated the founders and they decided to quit their jobs to launch an official GUVI platform that would make available mentors, practice material, and job opportunities. A One-Stop Solution [caption id="attachment_75105" align="aligncenter" width="710"] The founders[/caption] Arun had 14 years of experience in the IT industry, and had worked with Symantec earlier; Balamurugan and Sridevi had worked with PayPal. Leaving behind this cushioned corporate life, the three of them registered GUVI in November 2014. Soon enough, the start-up received a chance to work with the QEEE project, which aims to teach the Python programming in 150 colleges in India in local languages. In order to utilise GUVI, students must create their accounts on the website, and in turn, they gain access to most of the videos free of cost. Students who opt to sign up for special packages, advanced courses, practice assignments, etc., have to pay fees ranging from Rs. 800 to Rs. 3,000. All the videos are made by industry professionals who work in the particular technology field. “If it is a video about Android programming, a developer who has some six years of experience in the field makes it, or provides a voiceover for it. The content is made only by experts who have hands-on knowledge,” said Arun. GUVI has courses on programming (from the beginner to expert levels), databases, web development, and mobile development.

When we were doing only videos, we got requests to include some theory lessons and exercises for students to practise. So we included those. Soon, start-ups began to approach us about hiring our students, so we set up a recruitment channel,” said Arun. Changing Lives with Every Click View photos guvi2More Today, GUVI has over 40,000 users, of which 10,000 users pay for the advanced courses. Students with little knowledge of English or with no background in programming can simply use personal computers to log on to the portal and learn using the available instructional videos. They can also use the various learning exercises to hone their skills. Their performance in these exercises is reflected in a ‘profile’, which is used as a resume by prospective employers to assess their skills. The platform also gives reward points to users who practise and finish their courses, which is again visible on their performance profiles. Arun estimates that at least 30,000 students have benefitted from the portal and are now proficient in computer programming. They use PCs to practice what they learn and are equipped with the right set of skills for different jobs. “The pay package these students attract is anywhere between Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. 12 lakh annually, depending on their skills and the field. Given that many of these students are first-time graduates from their families, it’s a huge step forward for them.” Murgan is a GUVI student who comes from a family of daily wage earners. Every day, after college and even during the weekends, he used to help his family members with their work to earn a living. A smart but shy student, Murgan didn’t have good communication skills. Once he enrolled himself with GUVI and developed his skills using a PC, Arun and his team recommended him to a company, asking the employers to test him on his technical skills and not just his ability to speak in English. Murgan got the job and has been the star performer in his company for three years now. View photos guvi6More GUVI has a core team of nine people and an extended team of experts to help with content creation. The team also works with colleges in Chennai and Coimbatore so the latter can purchase their content and let their students use it for practice. This helps spread the word about the website too. Arun is proud of the fact that the widespread reach of GUVI has helped many talented girls gain access to a platform where they can learn, practise, and challenge assumptions about their expertise. “Once, a hi-tech startup company was hiring from GUVI. Many people assume boys are better at programming than girls. But we shattered this stereotype during the hiring process when the first person selected for the job was a girl. This is a platform where girls too come and showcase their skills and this is mainly because they find role models here. One of these is a girl who we mentored and who now works as a developer. She says if it were not for GUVI, she would have been married and without a job by now,” said Arun proudly. GUVI has made knowledge that is useful to many students seeking careers in the IT industry, accessible, regardless of their linguistic backgrounds. With hard work and dedication, there is no reason that they cannot go forward, rise in their careers and fulfil their untapped potential.

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship The New Touch-Bar-Equipped MacBook Pros and the State of the Mac Monday, 14 November 2016 I think there’s been a lot of confusion over the nomenclatural transition Apple is going through in its MacBook lineup. Back in 1998, Steve Jobs presented a simple four-quadrant lineup for Apple’s entire Mac line: a consumer notebook (iBook), pro notebook (PowerBook), consumer desktop (iMac), and pro desktop (Power Mac). No one could be confused by the difference between an iBook and a PowerBook. The PowerBook was more expensive, faster, had a better display, and even used more “serious” design language — iBooks were candy-colored and the PowerBooks were matte black. Much has changed since then, including all those product names (except for the iMac). About midway between then and now, Apple introduced what I believe to be the best-selling Mac notebook in history: the MacBook Air. At the time the Air was introduced in 2008, Apple’s other notebooks were the “regular” MacBook and the MacBook Pro. Sound familiar? The MacBook and MacBook Pro played the exact same roles as the iBook and the PowerBook. One was significantly less expensive, and accordingly, not as nice. Plastic vs. aluminum, slower vs. faster. I used a white iBook for several years. My wife used a white MacBook for several years about a decade ago. These were good notebooks and I remember them both fondly. But the only reason we bought those machines was that we couldn’t or didn’t want to spend the money for a PowerBook or MacBook Pro. The PowerBook “pro” alternative to my old white iBook was one of the most ahead-of-its-time designs Apple has ever made: the 12-inch PowerBook G4. Just look at it. It’s thick and heavy by today’s standards, but it foretold much of Apple’s aluminum-era design language. I wanted one badly, but couldn’t justify the price difference compared to the iBook, especially for what was going to be a secondary machine. One notebook that was slower but cheaper. One notebook that was faster and more expensive. The MacBook Air didn’t fit into this matrix at all. It was slower than the regular MacBook but as expensive as a MacBook Pro. What you were paying for wasn’t “power” but instead right there in the (then utterly perfect, today somewhat confusing) name “Air”: remarkable thinness and lightness. Apple moved from the names PowerBook and Power Mac to MacBook Pro and Mac Pro when they shifted from PowerPC to Intel processors. At the time, I chalked this up entirely to wanting to distinguish the Intel-based machines from the “Power” in “PowerPC”. In hindsight, though, I think it also signified a subtle shift in Apple’s design priorities for its very best computers. For decades, computers were starved for raw performance. CPUs were slow, RAM was scarce, disks were slow (and unreliable), graphics were slow. Printing was slow. Networking was slow. Everything was slow. And the more money you spent, the more you could alleviate these problems with faster components, and more ports and peripherals. Just about everyone agreed the original MacBook Air was beautiful to behold and that something so light and thin would be nicer to carry around than something thicker and heavier. But many critics thought Apple had lost its goddamn collective mind by breaking the rule that you spend more money on “faster”. From EveryMac’s page describing the differences between the original MacBook Air and the then-current regular MacBook: Upon viewing the respective specifications pages for the original MacBook Air and a “regular” MacBook at the time the original MacBook Air was introduced — the MacBook “Core 2 Duo” 2.4 13” (Black- Early 2008), for example — two users might come to very different conclusions. A style-conscious user might view the MacBook Air as sleek and beautiful and the “regular” MacBook as comparatively clunky. A cynical user might instead view the MacBook Air as half the system for twice the price. Both of these viewpoints could be legitimate. Most would agree that the MacBook does look rather “clunky” compared to the MacBook Air. Likewise, there is no denying that the MacBook Air does have substantial limitations compared to the “regular” MacBook in performance (it’s slower and uses the same lackluster integrated graphics), connectivity (it only has one USB 2.0 port and no onboard Ethernet, compared to the “regular” MacBook with two USB 2.0 ports, a Firewire “400” port, Gigabit Ethernet, and optical digital audio in/out), and expansion (no swappable battery or upgradable RAM and it is a pain to upgrade the hard drive, compared to the “regular” MacBook which has a swappable battery, upgradable RAM, and it is relatively simple to upgrade the hard drive). The “regular” MacBook also has a convenient internal optical drive whereas the MacBook Air requires the usage of an external one or software workarounds. Costs more. Not faster. Fewer ports. Fewer user-replaceable components. Sound familiar? MacBook Air buyers were paying a premium not for performance (or to use the old word, power) but instead for niceness. Apple effectively bifurcated the premium side of the MacBook lineup: Air for niceness, Pro for performance. But then a funny thing happened. MacBook Airs got steadily faster and cheaper. Moore’s Law at work. The regular MacBooks went away, and eventually the 11-inch MacBook Air dropped to $899, and the more popular 13-inch Air to $999. The MacBook Air transitioned — not in one fell swoop, but slowly and steadily, year after year — from being a premium product to being Apple’s most decidedly consumer-oriented Mac. The go-to Mac for students, casual users, and the budget-conscious. Last year Apple reintroduced the no-adjective MacBook brand for a device that was thinner, lighter, had a better display, one single expansion port that doubles for charging — and came at a premium price. Oh, and it’s quite arguably slower not just than the old MacBook Airs that are still sitting there in Apple’s lineup, but also slower than an iPhone. The regular MacBook’s value proposition today is exactly what the Air’s was in 2008. The MacBook Air’s value proposition today is exactly what the MacBook’s was in 2008. They’ve flipped. But the Air is the device whose name implies “thin and light”. Here’s what I wrote back in May: The outrage is coming from people who want Apple to update the MacBook Airs with retina displays. That’s not going to happen. The Airs are now Apple’s low-priced models. The Pros will get thinner (and thus more Air-like) and the new MacBook will get faster (and thus more Air-like). But the MacBook Air as we know it serves only one purpose: to hit the $899/999 price points. Back in March 2015, after the debut of the current one-port MacBook, I wrote: The key to understanding the new MacBook is that it didn’t replace any existing models in Apple’s lineup. In fact, the 11- and 13-inch Airs and the 13-inch MacBook Pro all got speed bump updates last week. If you need more ports or better performance, or if you frequently need to work while your MacBook is plugged into a power outlet, this machine is not for you, today. That’s why it didn’t (yet) replace anything in the lineup. The original 2008 MacBook Air was slow, expensive (based on specs), lacked storage, only had one USB port, was the first Apple notebook without an optical drive, etc. It was not for everyone. It was not for most people, in fact. But some people loved it. The new 2015 MacBook is the same thing — some people will love it today, and it shows us Apple’s vision for the future of the notebook form factor. So forget about the word Air. Apple’s vision for computers — notebooks, phones, tablets, even desktops — is thinner and lighter. Everything Apple makes today is an Air model in spirit. The name “Air” is no longer meaningful. My Thoughts on the New MacBook Pros I’ve spent almost three weeks testing a few models of the new MacBook Pros: the 13-inch model that lacks the Touch Bar, a mid-range (Core i5) 13-inch with the Touch Bar, and a 15-inch model with the Touch Bar. By way of comparison, my personal MacBook is a top-of-the-line 13-inch MacBook Pro that I bought just about exactly two years ago. As I’ve used these new models, the thought I keep turning back to is this: What Apple means by “pro” is tied very much to being nicer. A rundown of details and observations: The build quality is decidedly nicer. This is particularly noticeable with the display hinge. It feels better when you open it, it moves smoother as you adjust it to your preferred angle, and it closes with a more satisfying snap. iFixit’s teardown contains some interesting observations about how Apple achieved these improvements. Space gray looks amazing. I wish it were even a little darker, but it’s very cool. In very bright light, it doesn’t look that different from the traditional silver finish. In darker lighting, though, the difference is very noticeable. The trackpad is excellent. I enjoy that it’s bigger, and Apple’s palm detection has worked perfectly. Not once has it gotten in the way. The reduction in bezel area surrounding the display is noticeable. The combination of device thinness, bezel reduction, and the space gray finish all serve to make my previous MacBook Pro look old. The keyboard is, for me, a mixed bag, and it’s probably the one thing that many people will like least about these machines. I find less key travel to be less pleasant while typing. But I’m so far out there on this issue that I use a 20-year-old Apple Extended Keyboard II, with mechanical key switches, at my desk. I’ve never liked any notebook keyboard compared to an actual mechanical keyboard. But every time Apple makes its keyboards thinner, I get used to it. I always do, and I’m already pretty used to these new ones. And here’s the mixed bag part: the new MacBook Pro key switches do have a premium feel to them. I now can’t stop noticing how much the key caps on my old MacBook Pro jiggle around when I’m just resting my fingers on the keys. The new keys don’t do that. It feels like a premium keyboard — just one with incredibly short key travel, alas. [Update: Is the new MacBook keyboard too loud?] The keyboard change I’m having the most trouble with is the arrow key arrangement. Starting with the 2015 new MacBook, Apple has made the left and right arrow keys full-height; previously all four arrow keys were half-height, in an upside-down T arrangement. I’m having a devil of a time getting used to this. I use those keys frequently and do so without looking at them, and my fingers just can’t find what they’re feeling for. I’ll get used to it, I suspect, but this is one of the few things I’d change if I could. I like the Touch Bar a lot, especially Touch ID. It also feels like the right way to do a keyboard for the emoji age.1 I’m still not entirely used to it, and I’m unsure how best to use it to suit my needs. What I’m sure of is that the wrong way to think about the Touch Bar is to expect it be to be a game-changing input method. It’s just a modern, dynamic replacement for a fiddly, static set of cryptic buttons. And it’s really nicely done. It looks less like a screen and more like a button bar with dynamically changing labels. It took about three days using Touch ID on this review unit before I instinctively tried to use it to unlock my old MacBook. Typing my login password now feels archaic. The Esc is the one button in the classic function key row that some people really use a lot. I’ve heard from them. “How’s the Esc key?” is the number one question I’ve gotten from readers about the Touch Bar. For some reason, the Esc key doesn’t sit flush with the left edge of the Touch Bar. It’s inset by about the width of a key. (My best guess is that it is inset for visual symmetry with the Touch ID sensor on the other side, but it’s possible there were engineering constraints.) But about half of the blank area at the left edge is touch sensitive, even though there is no display under that part of the bar. I made a brief video about this that shows it better than I can explain it. The bottom line is that it’s pretty easy to hit Esc accurately without looking — the team that made the Touch Bar was clearly aware that some people really do use the Esc key a lot. My main wish for the next-generation Touch Bar: Taptic Engine support. Fake clicks like those on the Magic Trackpad, or even like the iPhone 7’s 3D Touch haptics, would be great. This might be trickier for Apple to pull off than I’m imagining, though. The trackpad has better haptics and works with much less pressure from your fingers, but the trackpad doesn’t have a display. The iPhone has a display, but 3D Touch on the iPhone takes more pressure to activate than I think a keyboard button should. This might take a few years. I miss MagSafe. I think what it gets down to is that Apple sees the future as being battery-only while using it. Charge it like your phone — overnight — and then just go all day. And I also see the beauty in having just four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports that all work the same way. But boy, MagSafe sure was a great idea, and it will be missed. (Even leaving aside the “trip over the cable accidentally scenario”, MagSafe is great on a daily basis just because it’s so effortless to connect. It feels like a cable that connects itself.) Speaking of battery life, it has been amazing. I watched Game 7 of the World Series with the 13-inch Touch Bar-equipped model open on my lap, for following Twitter and messaging a few friends about the game. It was a long game, over four hours, and I had the brightness on the display set as high as I wanted. (Maximum brightness would have been way too bright.) When the game ended the MacBook Pro still had 70 percent of its battery remaining. That’s probably the definition of “light use”, but my two-year-old MacBook Pro never got that much battery life under similar conditions. It is almost criminal that the extended power cord is now a $19 peripheral, and not included in the box. These machines cost upwards of $4,000 and they’re going to nickel-and-dime you over a power cord? Nickel-and-dime move number two: Not including a USB-C to Lightning cable with the iPhone 7. You can walk into an Apple Store today and drop thousands of dollars on a new MacBook and iPhone, but you can’t connect the two without a $19 cable (which will cost $25 again come January). I don’t know if this is a nickel-and-dime move or just a design decision, but the wall charger no longer has flip-out arms for wrapping the cable. That was a great little thoughtful detail, and I miss it. As promised, sound is way better from the built-in speakers. There’s almost no comparison. Where the Mac Stands Within Apple To me, an iPad in notebook mode — connected to a keyboard cover — is so much less nice than a real notebook. And the difference is more stark when compared to a great notebook, like these MacBook Pros. There are advantages to the tablet form factor, but no tablet will ever be as nice as a notebook as these MacBook Pros. I also prefer MacOS over iOS for, well, “doing work”. I think I’m more productive on a Mac than I am on an iPad. I can’t prove it, but even if I’m wrong, the fact that I feel like it’s true matters. I always feel slightly hamstrung working on an iPad. I never do on a Mac (at least once I’ve got it configured with all the apps and little shortcuts, scripts, and utilities I use). There are a lot of Mac users who feel the same way I do, and these new MacBook Pros have debuted at a time when many of these users look at Apple’s laggardly update pace for new Mac hardware (including the 1,000-plus day-old Mac Pros) and have come to the conclusion that Apple is sunsetting the Mac. They think Tim Cook really does want them to switch to an iPad. I think these new MacBook Pros, and the Touch Bar in particular, stand as refutation to that. These are very nice machines, designed and made with great care. And the Touch Bar is clearly no afterthought. A lot of teams from across the company worked for a long time on this. It’s an embedded iOS device, with the accompanying characteristics you’d expect: 60 FPS animation, seemingly instantaneous touch latency, well-done animation as things like the Control Strip expand and retract, and more. The Touch Bar is also, clearly, a costly component, making the Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pros more expensive. Price aside, the new MacBook Pro with the old-school function keys shouldn’t exist. But the Touch Bar won’t be expensive forever. It’s just so clear to me that these machines share the design ethos of the original MacBook Air. They’re designed for the future — the near future, I think — but until then, we’ll buy compatibility dongles and wait another year to see versions that support more than 16 GB of RAM. There’s much griping about these machines now, just like there was much griping about the original Air then, but these are exactly the MacBooks I want Apple to be making — ones that show that the company is putting very hard work into every aspect of them. I’d be more worried about Apple’s commitment to the Mac if they did the easy thing — easier both technically and in terms of initial critical response — and just stuck a retina display in a MacBook Air and called it a day. I do wish my most-used emoji characters synced across my various devices through iCloud, the way my keyboard text substitutions do. It seems weird that every device I use has a different set of most-used emoji. ↩︎ Previous: On Hiding vs. Encapsulating Complexity, in the Context of Twitter’s Experimental Reply Interface Display Preferences Copyright © 2002–2016 The Daring Fireball Company LLC.

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 16, 2016 -- 01:16 GMT (17:16 PST) | Topic: Mobility Like fellow PC manufacturers Dell and HP, Samsung's online store has Black Friday deals of its own. Electronics giant Samsung joins rival hardware manufactures like Dell, HP, and even Microsoft who are not content to have their PCs sold on Black Friday just by their retail partners. Instead, they want their own online stores in on the shopping madness. Samsung has just posted a preview of its upcoming deals, but is it worth buying directly from the source? In a few cases, it appears that the answer is "no". Many of the sale prices on its Galaxy Tab tablets are the same that we've seen, and in some cases, chains are offering even lower prices. For example, BJ's Wholesale has the 7-inch Galaxy Tab A for $10 less on Black Friday than Samsung is advertising ($99.99) -- and even throwing in a 16GB microSD card, which the Galaxy manufacturer isn't matching. No retailer is putting the breadth of Galaxy slates on sale like Samsung.com, however, so it may be the only place where you can score some savings on the giant Galaxy View with a 18.4-inch display ($399.99 for 32GB version starting on November 18). A similar scenario occurs with the Chromebook 3, which Samsung is touting at a $149.99 price point, but Walmart is selling it for just $119 and even Best Buy undercuts Samsung's direct price by $10. Again, you may have better luck with Samsung's Windows laptops, if for no other reason than we haven't seen them on sale in other Black Friday ads thus far. For instance, its budget-friendly Notebook M with Intel Celeron N3060 processor, 4GB of RAM, 128GB of solid-state storage, and 11.6-inch screen receives a $50 price trim for Black Friday to $399.99, the same discount as the more robust Notebook 3 with Intel Core i5 CPU, 4GB of memory, terabyte hard drive, and full HD 15.6-inch display. Samsung also has some deals on its more stylish laptops. The Notebook 7 spin is a 2-in-1 available in 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch sizes, both of which are on sale for Black Friday. At $649 the 13.3-inch Notebook 7 spin with Core i5, 8GB of memory, 1TB hard drive, and full HD rotating touchscreen receives a $150 discount, while the bigger version is offered in two different configurations (also $150 off), both with Core i7 and terabyte hard drive. One with 12GB of RAM is $849.99, whereas the other with 16 gigs and an additional 128GB SSD is $1,049.99. The Notebook 9 is a lightweight Ultrabook also available in 13.3- and 15.6-inch sizes and receiving $100 and $200 discounts, respectively, as part of Samsung's Black Friday specials. The 13.3-inch laptop includes Core i5, 8 gigs of RAM, 256GB SSD, and full HD screen for $899.99, while its larger sibling upgrades to a Core i7 processor for $999.99.

For that, we are joined by Alex Isenstadt of Politico. So, Alex, you’re reporting on this every today. Where do things stand right now? ALEX ISENSTADT, Politico: Well, look, it’s a transition that’s very much in flux. And you’re starting to see a pattern here of a Donald Trump sort of overseeing a process that very much was sort of like his campaign. There was a little bit of chaos involved. You’re sort of starting to see some of that chaos seep into the transition a little bit. And perhaps this is a little — perhaps this provides an indication of what Donald Trump’s management and leadership style is going to be like once he gets to the White House. HARI SREENIVASAN: And Chris Christie was demoted last week. Mike Pence replaced him. And he’s overarching the kind of lead on this. But there’s been some internal strife. We hear Mike Rogers stepped down. What was behind that? ALEX ISENSTADT: Well, look, Mike Rogers, former congressman from Michigan, used to head the Intel Committee in Congress, he was very close to Chris Christie, who last week was pushed aside in a leadership shuffle, where they put vice president-elect Mike Pence in charge. And so this is something that you also saw during the campaign where Donald Trump went through several different campaign managers. He’s now going through a few different transition heads. Again, you’re starting to see sort of a pattern emerge here. HARI SREENIVASAN: In the grand scheme of things, does it matter? I probably couldn’t tell you who managed the transition for the last three, four, ever presidents? ALEX ISENSTADT: Well, it’s a great question. And, to some extent, this is inside baseball. It’s parlor game stuff. But to some degree, it does indicate perhaps something about Donald Trump’s leadership style, how he oversees things, and exactly how he’s going to make some decisions. This comes at a time when a lot of Americans are looking for more information on how Donald Trump is going to lead and how he makes key decisions. HARI SREENIVASAN: And there also seems to be this tension. What he wanted on the campaign was — he ran as an outsider. He wanted people from outside Washington. Yet, right now, when you actually have lots and lots of jobs to fill, he’s calling on some insiders. ALEX ISENSTADT: Absolutely. Look at the names that you’re hearing talked of for top jobs, people like Rudy Giuliani, people like Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator. These people are — to some degree, they’re insiders, but they also share a similar trait, which is that they were all loyal to him during the campaign, at a time, during a campaign, when a lot of Republicans sought to distance themselves from Donald Trump. He’s priding loyalty and he’s looking to those who were loyal to him during the campaign, who stood behind him. HARI SREENIVASAN: He’s also now getting the intelligence briefings on a daily basis that President Obama gets. How is that influencing some of the decisions that he has in front of him now? ALEX ISENSTADT: It’s unclear. And it’s also unclear exactly how this is shaping who is going to be getting some of these top posts. There was some reporting over the last day or so that Trump wanted clearance for his children and for his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to also be getting these security clearances. The campaign — or the transition committee, rather, pushed back a little bit on that reporting. But, look, it’s clear that this is a guy who is new to government. He’s new to this kind of thing, and he’s now for the first time getting this information. HARI SREENIVASAN: Are transition teams the place where you start to reward your friends who have been loyal to you for so long and eventually maybe in government positions as well? ALEX ISENSTADT: Well, look, you look back at George W. Bush’s administration, he selected people who were very close to his family, to his father, and so you do see some of that But it’s interesting. You look at the people who Donald Trump is looking at, even people who he has already selected, Reince Priebus, Stephen Bannon. Those are people who really played key roles in his campaign and now are going to be overseeing his White House. HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Alex Isenstadt of Politico, thanks so much.

The Land Rover Discovery's newest feature is just for you By David Booth 8 hours ago Small Medium Large Despite all the talk about car sharing — Turo now claims 2 million members willing to pimp out their ride — and data sharing — by 2020, the average autonomous car will be pumping 4,000 gigabytes of data into the cloud-o-sphere, says the CEO of Intel — the most significant advancement, at least the most significant immediate advancement for this timid U-hauler, at this year’s Los Angeles Auto Show’s technology exposition was Land Rover’s Advanced Tow Assist. For those of you used to reversing 18-wheelers into the tight confines of a loading bay, JLR’s assisted towing will prove little more than a nuisance, all the ingenious software and precautionary slow speeds wasted. But for those of us — and, as I have already admitted numerous times, I am absolutely terrified of backing up a trailer — it’s nothing short of a Godsend. Essentially, all that’s necessary — once you’ve keyed in basic dimensions such as the distance from the tongue to the axle and the wheelbase (if it’s a dual axle kit) for your trailer-to-be — is to engage the Tow Assist program and then set the desired destination. You still have to manage the throttle and brake, but Tow Assist does the rest, including warning the driver if the trajectory that he, or she, has chosen will result in a jack-knife situation. Determining your destination is done via the Discovery’s Terrain Response 2 rotary controller Determining the destination is done via the Terrain Response 2 rotary controller. Simply match the desired parking space and the rear of the trailer via the rearview camera’s digital trajectory lines (think of rear park assist guidelines in your current rearview camera) and then slowly backup. The technology takes over and the steering wheel flails about, first one way — to set up the turn — and then the other — to complete the desired arc. It’s all so very seamless, the only caveat that you may have to — as I did — update the destination once you get closer to the parking space. Nonetheless, reversing the big Land Rover with a 23-foot Airstream in tow was a doddle. Smaller boat trailers are now child’s play and even a huge horse trailer was an easily surmountable adventure in parking. Considering that the system is simply an amalgam of the existing centre console screen, standard parking software and cameras in the rear hatch as well as one in each side mirror, this is yet another one of those technologies that, once you’ve sampled it, leaves you wondering why it took so long to come to market. For anyone who has ever shied away from a recreational activity because the idea of trailering the equipment was too daunting, your shame is over.

BlackPearl is a SpectraLogic system; it calls it a deep storage gateway, that front-ends disk and tape archiving to target back-end repositories, accepting and retrieving data through its HTTP command facility. This is an extension of Amazon's S3 storage interface. Spectra is announcing: Lustre HPC archiving using Campaign Storage's HSM software. Ceph backup and archiving through BlackPearl. The Lustre archiving integration is formally called the SpectraLogic Lustre Archive Campaign Storage Solution (SLACSS) and has Spectra's BlackPearl gateway acting as the target storage device. It needs Campaign Storage's* HSM product, Intel's Lustre file system and an industry-standard policy manager (such as Robinhood). Spectra says it provides "nearly instantaneous archive search," management, parallel performance and "nearly unlimited scalability." Spectra CTO Matt Starr claimed in a canned quote that the integrated setup solves "the core performance issues present in current archive systems ... [By] adding control and monitoring for large parallel data moves, Spectra and its partners have created a revolutionary platform that will transform the entire storage architecture of HPC and big data solutions." The Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) has developed an integration, a Ceph client, between its Ceph clustered file system storage environment and the BlackPearl gateway, which is designed for backup and archive. As BlackPearl can shunt files off to tape – thank you LTFS – LIBR can write all of the organization's data to BlackPearl and on to its own LTO tape infrastructure. LIBR used Spectra's SDK and the Spectra HTTP command set to craft the Ceph client. It will be offering this Ceph-BlackPearl integration code to any BlackPearl user by the end of December 2016, free of charge, through GitHub. The happy Spectra BlackPearl pirates can now sail their ship into Lustre and Ceph harbors and pillage for archiving business. ® *Dr Peter Braam is the CEO of Campaign Storage LLC and the creator of the Lustre file system.

November 14, 2016 Sabina Chaudhuri, Business Systems Analyst  My journey started back in 2011 when I decided to pursue a career in managerial economics from the University of California, Davis. I spent my first two years heavily involved with student organizations and dance teams. My interest for technology started when I visited the tech company my older sister was working at. I loved the atmosphere and decided I wanted to follow in her footsteps. Starting my junior year, I juggled between running a student organization, working on campus, and completing internships at companies such as CBS and Intel. When senior year came around, I realized I wanted to pursue a career working as an analyst and came across Cisco at our Fall Career Fair. After going through the entire recruiting process I received my offer letter and was excited to start the next journey of my life. I decided to choose Cisco because I knew my position would challenge me and allow me to grow professionally and personally. At Cisco I work as a Business Systems Analyst on the Global Infrastructure: Business Strategy Team. I work with analytics to help support business decisions. The culture and the people around me is what makes me love Cisco as a company. When I listen to the career journey of my fellow peers, it motivates me to maintain a forward-thinking mindset and to always work hard. I am an avid traveler, a knowledge seeker of business, philosophy and random art, and love to spend my weekends outdoors with my family/friends and my dog. Growing up I played the piano, loved to dance, and played varsity golf for my high school. Since I was born in the Bay Area, I bleed blue and gold (Go Warriors!) and have a tradition of going to a Warriors game with my dad every winter. If you see me around the San Jose site, feel free to stop and ask me about what book I am reading or my favorite place to travel!

Carnegie Mellon's Student Newspaper Since 1906 November 14, 2016 Current Issue Home News Sci/Tech Forum Sports Pillbox Comics Advertising Archives November 14, 2016 Join the Staff | Advertising | About Us | Contact Us Bluetooth technology connects devices together wirelessly Stephanie You Nov 13, 2016 Tweet EMAIL PRINT Suggest this article to a friend: From: (name) (email) To: (email) In today’s media-run world, Bluetooth technology surrounds us in our cars, in our pockets, and on our ears. With its beginnings rooted in the ‘90s, back when people used Nokia 9000s, Bluetooth has revolutionized the way devices communicate wirelessly. With Bluetooth, we can wirelessly play music on speakers from our phones, transfer photos between devices, and so much more. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group originally consisted of five companies: Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Toshiba, and Nokia. Now, it has over 20,000 member companies, and its growth does not show signs of stagnating. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used to exchange data across devices in close proximity. To communicate, industrial, scientific, and medical devices (ISM) send short-wavelength radio waves across 79 designated Bluetooth channels on the globally unlicensed ISM radio frequency band. It is inexpensive, automatic, and low-energy. Even with Bluetooth running in the background of a smartphone, the battery is hardly drained. The most recent Bluetooth standard, version 4.2, has a theoretical maximum speed of 25 megabits per second (Mbps) and a theoretical maximum range of 100 meters, or 330 feet. The upcoming version, 5.0, will have a theoretical maximum speed of 50 Mbps and a theoretical maximum range of 800 meters, over 2600 feet. Bluetooth allows for eight devices to be connected at once, and the devices can automatically detect each other. Each Bluetooth device has a small computer chip with a Bluetooth radio and software. Communication between devices occurs over networks called piconets, or personal-area networks (PAN) — individual networks of devices connected using Bluetooth protocols. One of the devices becomes the “master,” and all other connected devices act as “slaves.” A master and a slave could switch positions, too; the positions are not rigid. Moreover, while the master can have multiple slaves, as of right now, slaves cannot have more than one master. This type of network is called an ad-hoc computer network — it is spontaneous, decentralized, and does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure of hardware. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called frequency-hopping spread spectrum in which transmitted data is divided into packets, and each packet is transmitted on one of the 79 channels. There are “even slots” and “odd slots” of time in which a packet can be transmitted. For single-slot situations, the master transmits data in even slots and receives in odd slots, while the slave receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. So, if there is more than one slave, how does the master transmit packets to all? Using an algorithm called round-robin scheduling, the master handles each slave without priority in a circular order, and switches rapidly between devices; transmitters change frequencies 1600 times per second. The specs of Bluetooth technology eliminate the problems of infrared wireless technology, which television remotes use. First, Bluetooth does not need the devices to be in each others’ lines of sight, contrasting with how we need to point television remotes at the television for them to work. The devices only need to be visible in a quasi-optical wireless path, referring to an invisible network in which two things are in the same region. Second, Bluetooth works across multiple devices at the same time, as mentioned before.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums MSI Trident wants to be part of a portable VR rig by Wayne Manion  1:00 PM on November 15, 2016 The Rift and Vive VR headsets offers substantially better audiovisual fidelity compared to mobile-based VR experiences. Unfortunately, the packaging and setup for PC-based VR rigs is less convenient, particularly for those that wish to transport their VR systems for demonstrations. MSI seeks to stick a fork in those pains with the Trident, which the manufacturer calls the "smallest VR-Ready gaming PC." The Trident comes with a choice of Skylake Intel Core i5-6400 or i7-6700 CPUs and custom-designed Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card in 3GB and 6GB variants. All this goes into a chassis that takes up a volume of only 4.7L. MSI's "Silent Storm" cooling system with independent chambers for the CPU and graphics card aims to keep system temperatures in check. The Trident's pair of SODIMM slots can accomodate up to 32GB of memory, though memory clock speeds are limited 2133 MT/s. Storage devices can go into a 2.5" drive bay and an M.2 slot. Wireless connectivity comes by way of an Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 adapter. The Trident's front panel has audio jacks, one USB 3.1 Type-C and two USB 3.1 Type-A ports, and an HDMI connector that MSI labels VR Link. Additional connections on the rear panel include a Gigabit Ethernet port, a USB 3.1 Type-A connector, four USB 2.0 ports, and additional display connections. The Trident's external dimensions ring in at 13.6" x 9.1" x 2.8" (34.6 cm x 23.2 cm x 7.2 cm) without a stand. The Trident comes with its own 230-W power brick. The PC can lay down, or it can be mounted vertically in the included stand. Either way, the Trident's RGB LED lighting should help the Trident blend into or stand out from its environment. MSI did not provide pricing information, but the company did say it expects the Trident to ship in mid-November.

No, I’m not talking about the impact of a Trump presidency, but something bigger—much bigger. The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies, including machine learning, deep learning and neural networks, is now starting to be felt almost everywhere we look. (See my previous column “Learning About Deep Learning” for more.) From everyday devices like PCs and smartphones, to media companies like Facebook, to smart home security services, to connected cars and even to medical diagnostics, the influence of AI is growing rapidly. Not only is it changing the products and services we use, it’s dramatically reshaping the technical infrastructure behind cloud-based services ranging from web searching to communications bots to personalized advertising (unfortunately!) and much more. Driving improvements in AI performance is also becoming a key motivating factor for product developments and strategic partnerships. In fact, it seems like virtually all the biggest news-related announcements from tech vendors now have some kind of AI-related angle. On the semiconductor side, for example, nVidia, AMD, Intel, Qualcomm and many others are focused on creating chips and software that can drive massive improvements in deep learning in large data centers. At this week’s SC16 supercomputing conference, for example, nVidia talked about its efforts on the Cancer Moonshot, a project it’s working on with the National Cancer Institute and the US Department of Energy to deliver a decade of advances in cancer research in just five years thanks to GPU-driven AI applications. AMD unveiled a new partnership with Google for using its latest GPUs in Google’s Compute Engine and Cloud Machine Learning services, as well as enhancements to its open-source AI-focused Radeon Open Compute Platform (ROCm). In the world of media, Facebook just announced that it’s planning to leverage AI to help combat its problem with fake news stories. In the devices world, Apple has talked about its AI efforts to help make Siri smarter about your needs and interests, while still maintaining privacy. Google, meanwhile, is leveraging AI to build up a whole range of services that are both more contextually aware of the environments you might find yourself in, as well as personally aware of the specific ways you like to use them. The question is, are we ready for the onslaught of AI? It’s clear that tech-related companies certainly are. But for individuals, the answers are a bit more opaque. In short, we’re being surrounded by the first significant fruits from the long-growing but previously near-barren AI tree. For many, these fruits may not offer much taste yet, but it’s clear from early nibbles, that we’re due for an explosion of flavor. The question then is, are we ready for the onslaught of AI? Based on numerous signs, it’s clear that tech-related companies certainly are. But for individuals, the answers are a bit more opaque. Sure, it’s easy to get excited about the possibilities that AI and related technologies offer, but there can be downsides as well, particularly regarding privacy. The real trick behind many AI-based products and services is to recognize patterns and then react to those patterns based on previous knowledge about an individual’s preferences. In a positive case, a digital assistant might be able to use that knowledge to help you make better decisions. As many have started to recognize, however, technologies with good intentions can often be used in unexpected and negative ways. The same set of data about your habits and preferences could be leveraged by criminals to figure out how and when to digitally burglarize you, for example. Unfortunately, understanding not just the intentions but the decidedly human biases that creep into (or even form the foundation of) the algorithms that drive AI-based products can be very challenging. Nevertheless, as the AI era dawns around us, it’s best to be prepared for a wide range of potential outcomes, with the knowledge that there are bound to be few unpleasant bumps along the way.

It’s about making innovative products that drive narratives about the future of computing. The company late last month held its Windows 10 Update event. Making software presentations interesting is a chore. So Microsoft decided to go to a place far away from its utilitarian roots. It showed off hardware so cool you could imagine seeing the gear in an episode of the tech-trendy, sci-fi TV series Black Mirror. We’re talking sleek, futuristic and aimed at the hip, creative people Apple  (AAPL) normally attracts. Microsoft’s Surface Studio PC (shown below) is a gorgeous 28-inch all-in-one computer with a single hidden cord. The most striking feature of the device is the massive high-resolution touch-screen monitor. Microsoft says the 4500 x 3000 screen will easily push its 13.5 million pixels thanks to a best-in-class Nvidia (NVDA) graphics unit, backed by Intel (INTC) core i5 or i7 chipsets and 32-gigs of RAM. But the real shocker is the slim 13-millimeter aluminum case and the adjustable arm that allows the unit to lie nearly flat for drawing. The Microsoft Surface Studio PC boasts features that rival the top-of-the-line Macs and that have Apple fans drooling. And because Microsoft is primarily a software company, it saved one new trick to leave tech observers slack-jawed: Surface Dial, a small, metal, puck-like device can be placed on the screen to manipulate the software in new ways. You can rotate the screen, select pen tips and colors for the stylus and much more. When the machine lies flat, it’s virtually like working on a drawing board. This appeal to creative professionals might seem out of character for Microsoft. Its Microsoft Office productivity suite remains the first choice for corporations to create and manage documents. That strength has carried into the cloud. Despite a multiple-year head start for Google Docs, Office 365 has enjoyed rapid adoption. The suite added 900,000 subscribers in the most recent quarter reported October 20. The Office lock-in is also helping Microsoft continue to build out its hybrid and public cloud businesses, which are led by Azure. And while Azure still runs a distant second to Amazon Web Services overall, sales and profit margins are soaring despite continued massive investment in infrastructure. In the first quarter, Azure had a profit margin of 49% on sales of $6.32 billion. And it is worth noting that Azure is becoming a major player in fast-growing business concentrations like Blockchain and the Internet of Things. In a research note, Morningstar analyst Rodney Nelson wrote: “We view Microsoft’s public cloud offering Azure as a multifaceted service that not only provides substantial growth opportunities, but also serves as a natural hedge against potential declines in other aspects of its business.” Microsoft has a reputation for building utilitarian software products your boss makes you use to get work done. The Surface Studio is certainly not that. It’s something traditional Apple customers will want to buy. That’s a good narrative for a company best known for spreadsheets. Microsoft shares were down as much as 10% for the year in mid-summer but are now up 9%. They are just emerging from a 16-year trough, so they are rested and ready for their next leg higher.

Blog 3D XPoint  Reality, Opportunity, and Competition Sang-Yun Lee, CEO, BeSang Inc. 11/15/2016 11:16 AM EST  9 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet 3D XPoint was debuted with big claims in 2015. However, there are many wild guess and speculations because details have not been shared in public domain Early this year, details about 3D XPoint came out from EE Times interview with Guy Blalock, co-CEO of IM Flash. 3D XPoint is well-known phase change memory and switch (PCMS). (Picture source: Intel) According to Micron, 3D XPoint has many technical and operational challenges, such as 100 new materials raising supply chain issues, cutting fab throughput by 15%, 3x-5x increase in capital expenses compared to planar NAND, and heavily depending on lithography tools. Therefore, 3D XPoint becomes expensive. The 2nd generation 3D XPoint with 4-layer stacking is expected to be about 5 times more expensive than planar NAND. So, it seems difficult to be an affordable storage device. Instead, 3D NAND will serve the storage market. According to Intel/Micron, 3D XPoint is aiming at high-end SSD and DDR4 NVDIMM markets. Though, 3D XPoint-based SSD will serve niche market because of cost issue. The sweet spot of 3D XPoint should be the DDR4 NVDIMM because of low read latency (i.e. ~100ns). The configuration of DDR4 NVDIMM is shown below. Data comes to DRAM from CPU and copied to 3D XPoint. Then, the data goes back to CPU from 3D XPoint. It is possible because 3D XPoint has low read latency. However, because 3D XPoint has much less endurance compared to DRAM and its write speed is very slow, it cannot directly replace DRAM. Instead, as a shadow of DRAM, data in DRAM is copied to 3D XPoint in order to expand the size of main memory. In this case, DRAM works as a buffer for 3D XPoint. As a result, 3D XPoint will significantly replace DRAM if it works well. One important consideration is the cost of 3D XPoint. The 2nd generation of 3D XPoint with 4-layer stack is expected to be about half price of DRAM. If the cost advantage of 3D XPoint over DRAM is less than 2x, then, customers may prefer to use DRAM instead of 3D XPoint even though 3D XPoint is non-volatile. DRAM still continues about 30% bit growth every year. So, considering the technical and operational difficulties associated with mass production of 3D XPoint, it will not be easy for 3D XPoint to keep up with 2x cost advantage over DRAM. (Picture source: BeSang Inc.) Software-based NVDIMM-P is emerging as a competitor against 3D XPoint. As shown below, predictive software allocates data between NAND and DRAM in anticipation of being needed. In fact, such prediction may work or may not work well. In order to increase the chance of success, NVDIMM-P should increase the size of DRAM. Therefore, NVDIMM-P strongly depends on DRAM while 3D XPoint reduces the dependence on DRAM. (Picture source: The Register) 3D Super-NOR is also emerging and could replace 3D XPoint. Similar to 3D XPoint, 3D Super-NOR is NOR-based non-volatile memory having low ready latency (i.e. ~100ns). It does not need huge fab investment. Memory cell is vertically stackable and it has very small cell size (i.e. 4F2). Unlike 3D XPoint, no new material and no extreme process are needed at all. Most importantly, 3D Super-NOR is about 10 times cheaper than 3D XPoint and 20 time cheaper than DRAM. Therefore, 3D Super-NOR will be attractive as a replacement of DRAM at DDR4 NVDIMM. As shown below, 3D Super-NOR shares the same memory cell structure with 3D Super-NAND which is expected to be 2 cents per GB. (Picture source: BeSang Inc.) 3D XPoint has huge market potential as a main memory. However, the technical and operational difficulties associated with mass production of 3D XPoint may make it difficult to be an affordable solution over DRAM. Software-based NVDIMM-P could be a low cost alternative solution. However, there should be limitation as a software driven technology. It also increases DRAM dependence. 3D Super-NOR could replace 3D XPoint and provide the most affordable storage class memory solution. Sang-Yun Lee is the CEO of BeSang Inc.

Magnetic bubbles went the same way. Flash is like 15x cheaper than DRAM, so 2x cheaper with fast read speeds is likely only attractive for really large mostly read data. Not sure how big the market is for that.

Specs 25 Pictures Best Deals Pros Powerful CPU and GPU Processor and graphics overclocking Great design Punchy speakers Cons High temperatures and noise output Middling keyboard So-so screen quality Key Features 3.6GHz Intel Core i7-6820HK 8GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 17.3-inch 2,560 x 1,440 G-Sync IPS screen 16GB 2,400MHz DDR4 memory 256GB Toshiba XG3 M.2 SSD 1TB hard disk Windows 10 64-bit 1-year RTB warranty Manufacturer: Gigabyte Review Price: £2,500.00 What is Aorus X7 v6? It’s normal for notebooks to make compromises, but Aorus machines try to go above and beyond. Take the X7 v6, which includes a huge list of features: a GTX 1070 GPU, an overclockable Core i7 processor and a 120Hz screen with G-Sync. The result is a gaming monster. Related: Best PC Games Aorus X7 v6 – Features The GTX 1070 is proving to be the most popular Nvidia Pascal GPU chipset. It’s powerful enough to play any game at Full HD and 1440p, and it’s not as expensive as the GTX 1080, which is really designed for 4K. The mobile version of the GTX 1070 has 2,048 stream processors and a 1,442MHz core alongside 8GB of memory, which puts it on par with the desktop card. Here, though, Aorus has done something unusual – it's overclocked the GPU. The GTX 1070 runs at five pre-configured speeds. The first option is selected by default, which means the GPU runs at 1,468MHz and with 8,060MHz memory. The fifth option sets those clocks to 1,543MHz and 8,208MHz. Impressively, the GPU isn’t the only overclockable component – the Core i7-6820HK is the only Intel mobile CPU with an unlocked multiplier. By default the Aorus runs at 4GHz, which is the machine’s beefiest CPU overclock, but it can be toned down to 3.6GHz – still miles above the CPU’s 2.7GHz stock pace. This overclocking helps the Aorus to stand out. The Gigabyte P35X v6 is a superb GTX 1070 laptop, but it ran at stock speeds and costs less at £2,100. The £2,550 Scan 3XS LG17 Carbon Extreme is a 17.3-inch system with a GTX 1080 and a desktop-class Core i7-6700K processor, but no overclocking. The rest of the specification is good, but contains no surprises. There’s 16GB of 2,400MHz DDR4 memory, a 512GB Toshiba XG3 SSD and a 1TB hard disk. Qualcomm's Killer gaming brand provides the Ethernet and wireless connectivity, and there’s also Bluetooth. Two alternative specifications are available: the X7 v6-CF2 costs £2,200 and has a 1080p screen and 256GB SSD, while the £3,000 X7 DT v6-CF1 has 32GB of memory and a GTX 1080. Aorus X7 v6 – Design Aorus laptops always look great. The mirrored logo on the lid lights up and the power button is illuminated. The button is flanked with dramatic grilles for the system’s fans, and the trackpad has another Aorus logo. There’s a chunky rear section with vents alongside smaller exhausts on the machine’s left- and right-hand edges. Those edges hold USB 3 and USB 3.1 connectors, HDMI and Mini DisplayPort outputs, and an SD card slot. Related: Best Gaming Mice The Aorus is slimmer and lighter than its main rival, too. It weighs 3.2kg and is 25mm thick, which is impressive for a machine with this specification – the Scan is a kilo heavier and half a centimetre thicker. Despite the relative slimness, the Aorus is sturdy throughout. The base panel can be removed, but it’s held down by a dozen Torx screws, which is awkward. However, it reveals two memory sockets and a spare M.2 connector free, which is good for a notebook.

Google, Intel and IBM are just some of the big names investing millions currently in the field of quantum computing which will enable faster, more efficient computing required to power our future computing needs. Now a researcher and his team at Tyndall National Institute in Cork have made a ‘quantum leap’ by developing a technical step that could enable the use of quantum computers sooner than expected. Conventional digital computing uses ‘on-off’ switches, but quantum computing looks to harness quantum state of matters – such as entangled photons of light or multiple states of atoms – to encode information. In theory, this can lead to much faster and more powerful computer processing, but the technology to underpin quantum computing is currently difficult to develop at scale.

Or a zero client running a virtual desktop? Packet.net strong-ARMs cloud for $0.005 per core per hour Packet.net, a bare-metal cloud aimed at developers, has flicked the switch on cloud-running servers powered by a pair of Cavium's 48-core ARMv8-A ThunderX processors. CEO Zachary Smith told The Register that the company's cooked up the cloud for a few reasons. Price is one: Packet will offer ARM cores at a tenth of the price it charges for Intel cores, at US$0.50 per hour per server, or $0.005 per core per hour. Smith thinks that will be a head-turner by itself. He also thinks developers will appreciate the chance to try native Docker on many-cored machines and appreciate the opportunity an ARM-powered cloud represents as they pursue 100 per cent portable software. He believes open source folk will see the arrival of an ARM-powered cloud as incentive to accelerate cross-platform versions of their pet projects. Even ARM will benefit, he says, because having a working cloud on the market will give both it and licensees more reason to innovate for the data centre. ARM's recent purchaser, SoftBank, recently tipped some money into Packet.net, but Smith swears he's had a long-term ambition to offer an ARM-powered cloud, if only because he enjoys having multiple ARM server CPU vendors willing to do deals. That kind of competition is not currently possible in the x86 world, at least until AMD returns to servers in 2017. Smith also feels that ARM clouds are inevitable, probably thanks to telcos looking to offer cores to rent at the edge of their networks. The CEO feels that telcos will build edge clouds because they're sick of over-the-top players having all the fun and profits: this time telcos want to build a revenue-generating platform beyond mere carriage. For now, Packet's ARM cloud offers 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04, but promises that CoreOS, FreeBSD and CentOS are in the pipeline. Four different ARM server configurations are also in the works. The cloud will have an API, a portal, and will also be accessible from DevOps favourites likes Terraform and Ansible. Four of the company's bit barns – in Parsippany New Jersey, Sunnyvale California, Amsterdam and Tokyo – will offer the service as of Tuesday. "We want to offer a super-cheap, 'you would be stupid not to try it' offering," Smith told The Register. "If we can get the open source ecosystem rebooted, I think Intel's grip on the data centre will be shattered." ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections 3 Comments More from The Register Broadcom would certainly be broader with Brocade on board Fibre Channel market entering the merchant silicon end-game phase Broadcom snaps up Brocade for $5.9bn We want your Fibre Channel SAN stuff, but the IP biz can take a hike 6 Comments Cavium and QLogic sitting in a tree, S I G N I N G Chip designer plonks US$1.3 billion on table for data centre push Emulex joins Brocade, ATTO and QLogic in 32Gbit/s FC sprintfest Fibre Channel accelerates to flash array speeds QLogic boosted profits 700% in a year.

The report titled “Pedal to the Metal: Mitigating New Threats Faster with Rapid Intel and Automation” is underwritten by Palo Alto Networks and is based on an online survey of 150 federal employees that work with security operations teams, MeriTalk said Monday. “To address today’s threats and prevent successful cyberattacks, it’s imperative to automate the creation and distribution of new protections in near-real time and predict the attacker’s next step,” said Pamela Warren, director of government and industry initiatives at Palo Alto Networks. “The survey indicates feds have plenty of data, but need to implement the tools and the processes to achieve that goal,” Warren added. MeriTalk added 20 percent of respondents said that 12 or more members of their agency’s security operations center team create custom signatures for security technologies; correlate isolated network events and indicators of compromise; and form actionable threat intelligence from various feeds. Thirty percent of federal security operations employees are inclined to invest in technologies that will automate signature creation and distribution, the report found. The survey also revealed 71 percent of agencies use automated analysis and reports to address data volume and focus on tracking targeted attacks while 48 percent use dynamic analysis, 32 percent apply static analysis and 19 percent practice machine learning techniques. Security operations employees subscribe to an average of 25 external feeds daily and 72 percent of respondents state it takes hours to days to identify unique threats while 81 percent say it takes the same amount of time to form security changes. MeriTalk noted 15 percent of respondents claim their agencies can establish security measures against new threats within minutes while 17 percent can distribute protections for enforcement during the same time frame. Sixty-one percent of agencies have the capacity to automatically disseminate information on malicious behaviors across different enforcement points. Most agencies monitor traditional entry points like mail servers  and internet gateways but less than half protect data centers, Software-as-a-service enforcement points and mobile endpoints, according to the report.

If you go to the MSI Global news section there's an article, pictures and specifications for this machine uploaded. However the dedicated launch site still has 8 hours on the clock… So, its good to have the cold hard facts about this machine in the form of a spec list. Basically this compact VR gaming PC is based upon your choice between an Intel Skylake Core i7-6700 and i5-6400 with the graphics grunt supplied by either a 3GB or 6GB GeForce GTX 1060. Supporting those twin processing power plants you can install up to 32GB of DDR4 2133MHz RAM (via 2x SODIMM slots) and both an M.2 and a 2.5-inch SATA storage device. The headline of this story calls out the compact size MSI has managed to shoehorn the components into. The unit measures 346 x 232 x 72mm without the (upright) stand with an internal capacity of 4.7 litres. MSI includes a stand so you can position the Trident horizontally or vertically to suit. We don't know the weight of the Trident. A couple of days ago MSI released a teaser pic highlighting the Silent Storm 2 cooling system (reproduced above). According to today's news, the chassis is compartmentalised, with "key components in different chambers with optimized airflow". It is apparently fine tuned to allow super-silent gaming for hours on end. As you can see from the pictures, MSI has positioned handy VR Ready ports to the front of the chassis. Last but not least the Trident features RGB Mystic Light with many colours and effects available. MSI hasn't given any pointers regarding pricing but says that this complete ready-to-go VR system will be available worldwide from mid-November (very soon).

Register today! Posted by EndlessWaves - Tue 15 Nov 2016 12:36 “with an internal capacity of 4.7 litres” Great, now I know how much water it'll hold if I ever need to use it as a bucket. Such a silly statement can only have come from a marketing department and I'm surprised you reprinted it. The volume the case takes up is ~5.8 litres. Plus whatever size the hefty 230W external PSU is, probably another half a litre. Overall it looks like a reasonable approach, it's a shame about the external PSU and lack of Freesync option (not to mention the looks) but it could turn out to be decently quiet. Posted by plexabit - Tue 15 Nov 2016 14:12 I think MSI conveniently forgot the Zotac EN1060, EN1070, and EN1080. But those don't have upgradeable CPU/GPU. Hopefully there are cards released that will work in this.

Or a zero client running a virtual desktop? Packet.net strong-ARMs cloud for $0.005 per core per hour Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has clarified its requirements for a new supercomputer, after an inquiry from The Register pointed out an inconsistency in its tender. As we reported yesterday, CSIRO's tender called for Windows compatibility and either Intel x86 or IBM Power CPUs. As the latter won't run Windows, we concluded that perhaps CSIRO mentioned Power as a nod to competition rather than out of sincere interest in Big Blue's silicon but asked CSIRO to explain the seeming anomaly. CSIRO's procurement officer has responded to let us know that “Addendum No. 1 has been published on the AusTender site to answer your query” and to “Thank you for your advice that clarification may be required.” The thanks come because the Addendum explains that “If an IBM Power system is offered then Windows compatibility is not required.” IBM's therefore back in play with both its silicon and its services to port x86 code to Power systems running Linux.

Pointing to developer’s official website, a pair of screenshots appear to confirm that Mark Lamia has now been elected Chairman of Treyarch, with Mark Gordon, Jason Blundell and Dan Bunting each assuming the title of co-Studio Head. Lamia had previously held the role of Studio Head prior to these findings, while the others filled VP of Development (Gordon), Director and Executive Producer of Campaign & Zombies (Blundell) and Game Director, Multiplayer (Bunting). At press time, there’s no mention of a statement from Treyarch to confirm or deny the purported shake-up. A separate report from Charlie Intel goes on to claim that Call of Duty: Stronghold is the current codename of 2017’s installment – Sledgehammer’s, perhaps? Citing a listing published by SAG-AFTRA, the post writes that the yet-to-be-revealed title is “also known as Call of Duty: Stronghold & Lethal Combat.” What do our readers make of this purported change at the helm?

One of the options was a discreet graphics card which once delivered is a switchable card with the built in Intel HD 530 doing most of the work. The AMD seems to take over as needed. There is limited info on the r7 A370 on the AMD website, I am assuming it is very similar to the M370 which is the laptop card. My question is is there an upgrade path for me to get a better card (r9?), I just do not know enough about the laptop/AIO environment.

TRENDING NOW: Watch Dogs 2 first impressions Home News CPU, APU & Chipsets AMD Zen - 16 CPU threads of Intel beating perf at $300?! AMD's next-gen Zen could arrive with 16 CPU threads for $300, and that would be awesome By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: 1 day, 6 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Alright... most of you will know that I'm beyond pumped for AMD and their next-gen Zen architecture, but there are some new details that have surfaced on the /r/AMD subreddit, and it has me even more excited.     Intel has been dominating the CPU world for what feels like forever, but when AMD does throw down - Thunderbird, Duron, Athlon X2 - it does it in a big way. Zen is the biggest stomping yet, with multiple things to be excited about. It looks like we can expect an 8-core/16-thread Zen CPU at around $300, which would be freakin' amazing.   Some of the bigger notes from the post is that Zen will arrive in a purported 6850K with 8 CPU cores/16 CPU threads for around $300. This is amazing if it's true, and I believe we are looking at this price bracket for Zen's higher-end SKUs. But then the tease that AMD's Hyper-Threading equivalent is something called SMU and that it's "******* good" with the "same efficiency as Intel's HT", should have everyone excited.   Even in gaming, the post says that Zen is "neck and neck" with Intel, "even at low res where CPU bound". As for clock speeds, as of August they were hitting 3.8GHz, but "right now" AMD is reaching 4.2GHz overclocked, and 5GHz+ using LN2. The samples will continue to improve until retail spec sampling begins to partners.   Zen details:   There are some errata issues present in the current testing samples, similar in a way to the TLB bug of the Phenom. The workaround right now is done via the BIOS. The workaround however, strips around 30 ~ 40% of the CPU performance.   The CPUs are well behind schedule and every day there's real progress and bug fixing being done. Unlike with INTEL's E0 CPUs which make it to the wild that are almost completely final silicon. AMD's samples will continue to get bug fixes right up until retail spec sampling to partners.   In August Clock speeds were 3.8GHz, right now 4.2GHz overclocking is possible, with LN2 5GHz is doable. Again this will change of course, but it is just the current silicon that is behaving like this.   AM4/ZEN uses an SOC design, that means even CMOS/BIOS configuration is on package (not necessarily on silicon, I can't confirm this) so it is possible to clear the "BIOS" and still have old value applied 30 minutes later. How this will be addressed remains to be seen. Perhaps it won't be the same scenario for final silicon   Operating voltages (nominal) are 1.3v and all the way up to 1.5v should be fine it seems for AIO cooling. Frequency scaling isn't a strong point but again that may have everything to do with the process at this point rather than an inherent design limitation.   Performance is particularly strong at this point vs. INTEL's latest offerings. Single thread performance is matching Haswell-E and of course multi-threading performance as well. Tests that are memory bandwidth dependent may go to the INTEL platform simply as a result of having more memory channels, but I can't confirm that right now and have no info on that. The important thing here is that the 16Thread/8-Core CPU is minimum 5960X performance if not better actually. (Based on Cinebench R15) with the error fix disabled.   Can't speak to how well the IMC is working as current samples are locked to low DRAM frequencies (2133MHz and lower) and of course this has an impact on performance.   As stated in the beginning, every week is progress and AMD is working at an unprecedented rate to get these ready by March.   You're unlikely to see any high-end boards for the CPUs prior to launch or at launch, simply because no vendors can commit to too much right now as plenty is changing at a rapid rate.   All overclocking is done via Overdrive, you can't change any performance features at all in the BIOS (on to that next) at all.   BIOS or UEFI is actually built into the CPU, so only AMD can update the "BIOS" or microcode. All overclocking must take place within the Operating system   Right now it takes up to 30 minutes to clear the BIOS. If you remove the CPU and place it on another motherboard, it'll have the same settings applied as on the previous board. So debugging is a nightmare   6850K SKU (May not be final designation) is wait for it.... $300 roughly. That's 8 Cores and 16 Threads   AMD's Hyper Threading is called SMU and it is ************ good. The same efficiency as Intel's HT.   Performance is really good, be it SuperPi, Cinebench, 3DMark etc, it's FPU performance is incredibly good and easily matching that of what Intel offers.   Current performance is staggering even though it is limited to 2133MHz (as mentioned before) and NorthBridge Frequency is limited to 2400MHz   There will be a nigher SKU than the 6850K, but it is a higher bin so it will certainly overclock better than 6850K and that may carry a premium price, but unlikely to be double.   There's plenty of excitement from all board vendors about the platform, so we will see how it all pans out. (Especially with the hot mess that INTEL has in store for us H2 2017, that we can leave to another thread)   For Gaming, the CPU is neck and neck with INTEL, even at low res where CPU bound.

The Dell-EMC merger has led to the formation of Dell Technologies. Mumbai: Dell Technologies chairman and chief executive officer Michael Dell is determined to change the common perception of his company—that it’s a traditional maker of low-margin products like personal computers, servers and storage systems. The view changed little even after Dell said in October 2015 that it will buy EMC Corp. Now that the merger of the two companies is complete, Dell’s strategy to alter this view is revolving around quickly rolling out new infrastructure products that have been jointly developed by Dell and EMC teams, cross-selling them to clients of both, strengthening existing partnerships with firms like SAP AG, Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp., and forging new ones even with competitors like Amazon Web Services Inc. Dell executives say they are best suited to help clients go “digital” with the combined entity’s broad technology portfolio, which not only comprises computing products but also services and solutions in the areas of hybrid cloud, software-defined data centres and converged- and hyper-converged infrastructure (integration managed by software), platform-as-a-service, data analytics, mobility and cybersecurity. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion purchase of Broadcom This multipronged strategy was evident when Dell took the stage at the first-ever Dell-EMC World 2016 event in Austin, Texas, on 18 October, and gave an impassioned speech that had all the trappings of a successful road map for next-gen computing. Beginning with a reiteration of the ‘Go Big or Go Home, Baby!’ slogan delivered at last year’s Dell event, he peppered this year’s speech with technology buzzwords like digital, the Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Alluding to Dell’s Digital Transformation Index , Dell underscored the presence of a “digital fear” among the 4,000 business leaders across 16 countries and 12 industries that were surveyed as part of a recent report. His pitch: “This (digital) future is coming very rapidly and the future does not care whether you are ready. But we do... (We are) the trusted provider of essential infrastructure for the next industrial revolution.” Dell evidently believes in economies of scale, made evident by his ‘Go Big…’ slogan. The Dell-EMC merger, announced last October, was the largest deal in tech history, topping Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion purchase of Broadcom Corp. Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses. Photo: Reuters Dell Technologies is now a $74 billion company that comprises a PC business and affiliated businesses including virtualization (the partitioning of a physical server into smaller virtual servers in a bid to reduce costs) company VMware Inc., security firms RSA Security Llc and SecureWorks Inc., software and services (including cloud and Big Data analytics) company Pivotal Software Inc., and cloud management software firm Virtustream Inc. Dell’s eponymous combined business now comprises two segments—Dell EMC is the sub-brand for the company’s enterprise business, including products and solutions, and Dell is the sub-brand for the company’s client solutions for consumers, business and institutional customers. Dell plans to go about the task of ramping up business growth also by touting that the combined company “stands as a market leader in many of the most important and high-growth areas of the information technology (IT) market, including positions as the ‘Leader’ in 20 Gartner Magic Quadrants and a portfolio of more than 20,000 patents and applications”. Does the pecking order bear out Dell’s claim? To be sure, the worldwide IT spending figure augurs well for technology companies like Dell Technologies, which figures in the top three in PCs, servers and storage. Overall IT spending is forecast to reach $3.5 trillion in 2017, up 2.9% from estimated spending of $3.4 trillion this year, according to Gartner Inc. According to the research firm, software and IT services segments have been the bright spots. Software spending is projected to grow 6% in 2016 and another 7.2% in 2017 to total $357 billion, while IT services spending is forecast to grow 3.9% in 2016 to $900 billion and 4.8% in 2017 to $943 billion. ALSO READ | Dell Technologies’s road map for India The total worldwide enterprise storage systems factory revenue remained flat year-on-year at $8.8 billion during the second quarter of 2016, according to research firm International Data Corporation’s (IDC’s) Worldwide Quarterly Enterprise Storage Systems Tracker. EMC and HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise) accounted for 18.1% and 17.6% of spending, respectively, of the enterprise storage market (IDC declares a statistical tie when there is less than 1% difference in the revenue share of two or more vendors.). Dell held the next position with 11.5% share of revenue during the quarter. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and NetApp Inc. accounted for 6.8% and 6.7% of global spending, respectively. Sales of server-based storage were up 9.8% during the quarter and accounted for almost $2.4 billion in revenue. External storage systems remained the largest market segment, but the $5.7 billion in sales represented flat year-on-year growth. However, according to Liz Conner, research manager of storage systems at IDC, “…spending on all flash-based storage deployments continues to grow and help drive the market”, following the decreasing cost of flash media, deployments and availability of flash-based storage products (a sharp focus area for the combined entity, Dell Technologies). ALSO READ |In firms, PCs and smartphones coexist in a multi-device world: Michael Dell In the same period, worldwide server revenue declined 0.8% year-on-year, while shipments grew 2% from the second quarter of 2015, according to Gartner. Dell moved into the top spot in shipments, while HPE remained the worldwide leader in server revenue. Dell garnered 19.3% of the market and moved into the No. 1 position in worldwide server shipments due primarily to growth resulting from programmes it has in place in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably in China. HPE continued to lead the x86 server (Intel-based server) market in revenue with 26% of the market. IBM secured the third position with 9.1% of the market, but experienced the largest decline among the top five vendors, according to the Gartner report. Contrarian bets Notwithstanding the scepticism over the merger, there is certainly some merit in Dell’s claim over the economies of scale that this merger can achieve even as there remain formidable challenges that continue to keep some analysts and clients sceptical. The challenges include concerns over the sum paid for the acquisition, integration challenges, some overlap in products and technologies between Dell and EMC, leadership issues in the combined entity, and partnership conflicts since some Dell partners compete with EMC and VMware. “Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt,” said R ‘Ray’ Wang, principal analyst, founder and chairman of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc. He, however, pointed out that customers and partners remain sceptical, wondering “if this is an exercise to sell off the parts of the acquisition to pay down debt and save Dell, or a strategic play to own the cloud and the future of the data centre”. “Shedding the enterprise software assets leads us to believe that this may not be an innovation play yet but a move to sell off assets to save Dell. The experience at HP Enterprise is what customers are scared of. They don’t want to see their favourite vendors exit the market where massive investments have been made. The challenge is having two legacy players come together for innovation. The math in the accounting makes it hard to believe what innovations will come about. Dell did attempt to address this road map at Dell World but most of our clients remain sceptical,” said Wang. "Michael has an opportunity to redefine computing if he reinvests on innovation and can pare back the debt"- R.Ray Wang, primcipal, analyst,Conslellation Research, Silicon Vlley Dell is also a contrarian when it comes to defying certain technology trends. For instance, Dell became a private company on 5 February 2013, in a deal led by Silver Lake that was valued at $24.9 billion—the biggest leveraged buyout since the financial crisis—even as other tech firms seek stock market listings. Second, he believes in mergers and acquisitions even as competing companies like Hewlett Packard have split their businesses. Third, while the world is betting on smartphones, his company no longer makes them. “I don’t think the world needs another smartphone company,” says Dell. “A smartphone is just another node,” explains Dell, adding that “all the information you get on a smartphone comes from a data centre. And what you upload, goes back to the data centre”. This, for Dell, is a business opportunity since his company provides servers that are used by data centres. Wang agrees that the smartphone market is “a bad one to be in and is not worth it when you don’t own the OS (operating system)”. "Overnight, shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... Machine learning AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the world’s greatest challenges."- Michael Dell However, the fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC (desktops and laptops), worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015, according to the preliminary findings of Gartner. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of decline in PC shipments—the longest streak in the history of the PC industry. Lenovo Corp. continued to be the worldwide market leader based on preliminary PC shipments, but HP Inc. is nearly tied for this top spot. Segment-wise, Dell claims his company is No. 1 in PCs in terms of revenue but Dell ranked third in terms of shipments with a share of 13.5% in the third quarter of 2016. (All these rankings could change when final shipment results are published by Gartner.) Dell is insistent that revenue is more important than shipments. The fact is that even as Dell remains optimistic over the future of the PC, worldwide PC shipments totalled 68.9 million units in the third quarter of 2016, a 5.7% decline from the third quarter of 2015 Banking on innovation “We have been growing (the PC business) for 15 quarters. We want to be profitable so that we can reinvest in innovation,” he says. Part of his company’s “innovation” is around the “PC computing system”, as Jeff Clarke, vice- chairman of operations and president of client solutions, puts it. “There is much innovation in the PC computing system... like the computer becoming personal and new experiences with AR/VR that provide users with new ways to interact,” explains Clarke. In a 7 September blog, Clarke also points out that “…beyond the device, workforce transformation requires a cloud-based infrastructure to support people’s new behaviors, new devices and new expectations”, which EMC can provide. He also underscored the importance of Airwatch (now a Dell company) as an “EMM (enterprise mobility management) solution for managing phones and tablets”. “And with cloud client-computing VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure solutions) from VMWare, we are the only true end-to-end VDI provider in the industry, from planning to deployment, data center to the endpoint, on- and off-premise. Bottom line: Combining EMC’s cloud capabilities with our award-winning PCs, we have just created a very powerful solution,” wrote Clarke. For instance, the Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRail—a hyper-converged infrastructure solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dell’s PowerEdge servers. As opposed to a converged infrastructure model (also known as hardware-defined) where the server, networking and storage can be separated if needed, in a hyper-converged infrastructure (referred to as software-defined) the components are integrated and hence cannot be split. Dell-EMC product collaboration has resulted in products like VxRail—a hyper-converged infras solution from VMware that includes fifth generation Intel Xeon processors and Dell’s PowerEdge servers The other part of “innovation” revolves around Dell’s belief that IoT is “fundamentally changing businesses”. Explaining his rationale for why “we created Dell Technologies”, Dell says the planet is becoming “more intelligent and more connected by the minute, and ultimately will become intertwined with a vast Internet of Things, paving the way for our customers to do incredible things”. Dell elaborated in his speech that “as the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world. We have about 8 billion connected devices on the planet, and 15 years from now there will be 200 billion or more, and all these sensors and nodes in those devices will provide access to a host of new digital applications, creating massive new sources of information.” Using this information to provide better insights and build a better world may be the biggest opportunity in history, he said. Using the premise that “everything improves about 10x every five years”, Dell in his speech also envisioned a future with smart cities, driverless cars and nanobots that cure cancer and repair cell damage. He added that “overnight shipping will seem like snail mail compared to the instant gratification of drone delivery... AR and VR will redefine work, learning and play... machine learning, deep learning, AI and unsupervised learning to all this data will unleash a torrent of innovation and progress and solve some of the world’s greatest challenges”. "As the cost of making something intelligent approaches zero dollars, intelligence is being embedded into every aspect of our physical world."- Michael Dell Towards this end, Dell and EMC have made a cumulative research and development (R&D) investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year, “which is multiple times what the competition is investing”, Dell said. Dell, for instance, has invested in six worldwide global command centres where technicians constantly monitor events like flight delays, traffic jams, weather conditions, earthquakes or even unsettling events like riots that might impact the company’s ability to handle a support call. The technicians track live tweets, live broadcasts of news and weather, and map the location using geographical information systems and Google Earth—all in a single window using a customized interface. India (Bengaluru) does not have a global command centre but has a social media listening command centre. In June, Dell’s Extreme Scale Infrastructure group unveiled Triton—a liquid cooling technology that scores over traditional air-cooled solutions for data centres. It designed this water-based system to cool server chips (developed with Intel Corp.) in eBay.com’s data centres. Dell and EMC have made a cumulative R&D investment of $12.7 billion over the past three years and plan to invest $4.5 billion in R&D this year In an 18 October note, Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, agreed that Dell Technologies was “uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle”. Dell, Krell wrote, combines experience and credibility with specific vertical market enterprises, “a curated partner ecosystem with deep vertical knowledge, the industry’s broadest offering of IoT-focused infrastructure, and an ability to provide a world-class customer experience to help customers solve specific IoT problems—today”. But will ‘Go Big…’ work for Dell? Dell’s growth strategy also revolves around acquisitions, which Dell says will “continue”. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its chief executive in 2007, the company has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC purchase. These included EqualLogic ($1.4 billion; storage area networks, where EMC dominates), Perot Systems ($3.9 billion; IT services), SecureWorks ($612 million; security services, where EMC’s RSA division has a big presence), Force10 ($700 million; data centre Ethernet switches) and Quest Software ($2.4 billion; system management and security software), among others. Ever since Michael Dell returned to the company as its CEO in 2007, the firm has spent as much as $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions prior to the $67 billion EMC acquisition However, not all of those acquisitions have done well for Dell, including some with a significant presence in the Indian market (security provider SonicWALL, for instance). According to a 20 June report on TechCrunch, while Dell had reportedly paid $3.6 billion for Quest Software and SonicWALL, it was only able to recoup around $2 billion for the duo when it sold them to private equity firm Francisco Partners and hedge fund Elliott Management. Dell also had to sell Perot Systems to Japan’s NTT Data Corp. for $3.1 billion in March. Nevertheless, analysts like Ashish Nadkarni, program director for IDC’s worldwide infrastructure practice, believe that “having a bigger, more full-service portfolio allows the combined company (Dell Technologies) to address a wide range of use cases in a very holistic fashion”. In a 16 April note, he pointed out that these solutions could be diverse and even emerging, like IoT and real-time analytics. “Dell and EMC can likewise take advantage of synergies when it comes to joint go-to-market efforts around compute, storage, and networking solutions,” wrote Nadkarni. He also believes that since Dell Technologies is a privately-held company, it will be able to offer the “flexibility of interesting product road maps and solutions as well as additional purchasing options, like subscription-based offerings, free from the 90-day shot clock pressures typically exerted on public companies”. "Dell Technologies, the newly formed merger of Dell Inc. and the EMC Federation, is uniquely positioned to help customers solve their IoT puzzle."- Mike Krell, lead IoT analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy On his part, Dell is clear that his company needs to “savour customer relationships”. He concludes: “There are many customers who do not want to change, and we don’t want to change them. There are plenty of opportunities for cross-selling. When we looked at the top 5,000 Dell customers and the top 5,000 EMC customers, we found only 1,000 common ones. So there are enormous opportunities to cross-sell among the portfolio. Customers are excited about that too—they actually like the fact that we are bringing everything together with these engineered and integrated solutions. That’s what we are focused on.” "Given the all-star teams we have in the combined Dell-EMC group, we have effectively an Olympic team."- Michael Dell Leslie D'Monte Topics: Dell EMC mergerDell TechnologiesMichael Dellcloud servicesPC business More from this Section Modi’s black money crackdown threatens corporate profit recovery Rishi Jaitly named CEO of Times Global Partners How bad is India’s corporate debt problem?

Photo: Reuters Mumbai: “India is our third-largest market in the world. And incredibly important as a base of operations, as a source of talent, R&D labs. All that continues. The Indian economy is doing well and the opportunities in IT, business technology and transformation are tremendous,” Dell Technologies chief executive Michael Dell said in an interview on the sidelines of Dell World 2016 in Austin, Texas. According to International Data Corporation, in the overall personal computer (PC) shipments for the April-June quarter, HP Inc. reclaimed its top spot with a 28.4% market share and Dell captured the second spot with 22.2%, “backed by focused efforts on growing branded consumer desktop category”. ALSO READ | Will Dell make it big with EMC? In the India x86 (Intel-based servers) market, HP maintained its lead position in the October-December quarter of 2015 with 36% market share in terms of unit shipments, followed by Dell with a market share of 24% and Lenovo with 12%. EMC led in India’s external storage industry with a 28.4% market share in the January quarter. In an interview on 13 October, Alok Ohrie, president and managing director (India commercial business) at Dell EMC, insisted that the combined company is now “uniquely positioned” to provide customers with solutions that will secure their digital future with “a single window of engagement”. Other than PCs, server and data centre businesses, Dell India is partnering with a number of companies in areas like digitization and Digital India, which is all about getting people connected both from a device and from a network perspective, according to Ohrie. India is also the only country, outside of the US, where Dell has networking, storage and server research and development operations. Dell Technologies’ employee count in India is around 27,000 people. Dell does not break-up revenue by countries, but according to estimates by Dataquest, a Cyber Media (India) Ltd publication, Dell India’s revenue grew from Rs13,984 crore in FY15 to Rs17,480 crore in FY16, a rise of 25% (). Dataquest estimated EMC India revenue in FY15 to be Rs2,452 crore, a 15% rise over the previous fiscal year. If similar growth were to be assumed, the revenue for FY16 would come to about Rs2,819 crore, which would make the combined Dell-EMC India revenue a little over Rs20,000 crore. According to Tom Sweet, chief financial officer of Dell Technologies, the combined revenue of the two companies in India is “closer to $2.5 billion”.

In an interview on the sidelines of Dell World 2016 in Austin, Texas, on 19 October, Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of the world’s largest privately-controlled technology company, Dell Technologies, shared his views on the prospects for the combined Dell-EMC. Edited excerpts: In a world of smartphones, you remain committed to a PC-centric world. Why? We listen to customers. I did not say that smartphones are not important. I believe it’s a multi-device world. In 2012, the idea was smartphones here and PCs there—it’s not correct now. In organizations, smartphones and PCs coexist in a multi-device world. The view around that time (that the) PC was dead created an opportunity for us. Many customers are not giving up on PCs. Liken this to transportation, where people use different modes like bicycles, cars, trains and planes. Computing is like that too with tablets, smartphones, PCs, etc. PCs offer another way of computing. But PCs, servers, storage, etc. are commoditized businesses... ...in the PC segment, we have gained share for 15 quarters in a row. We are doing very well, we are growing. When a commercial client chooses Dell PCs, it chooses us for the services and support and also Intel and AMD (Advanced Micro Devices Inc.) and Microsoft. It’s another way of saying these are our suppliers that have a higher share. Therefore, we should be more concerned about our suppliers if margin erosion is a concern. ALSO READ | Will Dell make it big with EMC? One of the reasons for our success is because we have brought tremendous value for our customers, democratized technology by making it more available and more affordable. There is no shortage of competitors in the business we are in. We need to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, build great relationships and customers will reward us. How are you tackling issues around cultural challenges in the merged Dell-EMC entity? We had a decade-and-a-half lead-up to the combination. And it goes back to 2001 when we had announced an alliance called Dell EMC. The apparent intent was that Dell was going to sell EMC storage technologies to its customers. We did billions of dollars of sales. Under the cover, Dell server technology was embedded into pretty much every storage product line that existed and EMC became our largest OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customer in the world. And so our teams, beginning 2001, learnt how to work together in terms of supply chain, R&D, sales and importantly culture—we became friends. The businesses don’t have a lot of overlap. In 2009, we had a fairly in-depth look at whether we should combine the companies—reams of analyses, we had consultants from both companies, we had directors from the boards of both the public companies meeting secretly in places, and we were negotiating combining both the companies. However, because of the financial crisis at that time, we decided not to do so. "We need to provide high levels of service, continue to innovate, build great relationships and customers will reward us"- Michael Dell Then, in 2013, we took the company private. Everyone thought the PC was dead. So, we bought the company back. Thank you very much. And in 2014, I called my friend Joe Tucci (Joseph Tucci is the former chairman, president and chief executive officer of EMC) and said, “Why don’t we re-examine what we looked at five years earlier, refresh all the analyses and see if it makes sense now?” So, that was more than two years ago, which resulted in our October 2015 result. I got some great advice. I talked to a number of executives who had gone through a number of combinations like these—some had succeeded; some had failed. One of the things that a number of them said: You should as early you can, communicate the strategy of the new company and its structure. They also said, with all due respect to the current CEO of EMC, you should act as if you were leading the new company from the day of the announcement of the planned merger, not the closure date. Legally, you are not supposed to do that. And I didn’t break any laws. ALSO READ | Dell Technologies’s road map for India I was very present within EMC from the day of the announcement—at the leadership meetings, meeting the whole team, learning about the teams, and as we come together as one family and the cultures are a lot more similar than different. What’s the strategy you are employing to handle a smooth integration? We communicated the hierarchies within the organization to our teams. Not everyone has got exactly the job they want. Given the all-star teams we have in the combined Dell-EMC group, we effectively have an Olympic team. You must always start with the strategy. If you do it by personality or anything else, it will be a totally wrong way to do it. From the strategy, you must define the structure to achieve the strategy. You lay out the strategy. Then find out who are the people from within, or outside, the organization for each role to accomplish the strategy. For each role, you have several candidates. So you find the job—are you excited about the job, are you passionate. Some may want to play golf, instead. But if you are great and want to be part of the Olympic team, we have one heck of an opportunity for you.

share," Amal Clooney told a sold-out audience at the 17th Annual Texas Conference for Women at the Austin Convention Center. "It's not a bond of geography or culture, but of shared experience. There are struggles that only women face. The worst thing we can do as women is not stand up for each other. [But] if we are united, if we keep up the fight for each other's rights, there is no limit to what we can do." Clooney, a British human rights lawyer, has appeared before the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, the European Court of Human Rights and various courts in the United Kingdom and the United States and she has held a number of posts within the United Nations. Most recently, she has begun a case against ISIS on behalf of Nobel Peace Prize nominee Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who escaped capture and sexual enslavement by ISIS.   The 7,250 attendees also heard keynote address from Abby Wambach, Olympian, FIFA Women's World Cup champion and author, "Forward: A Memoir"; Diane Von Furstenberg, iconic fashion designer, philanthropist and author, "The Woman I Wanted to Be"; Annie Clark, founder of End Rape on Campus, whose work is featured in the documentary "The Hunting Ground"; Nina Tassler, highest ranking Latina in network television and recently retired chairman of CBS Entertainment; and Linda Cliatt-Wayman, renowned educator and principal of Strawberry Mansion High School in Philadelphia.

"It's not a bond of geography or culture, but of shared experience. There are struggles that only women face. The worst thing we can do as women is not stand up for each other. [But] if we are united, if we keep up the fight for each other's rights, there is no limit to what we can do." Clooney, a British human rights lawyer, has appeared before the International Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court, the European Court of Human Rights and various courts in the United Kingdom and the United States and she has held a number of posts within the United Nations. Most recently, she has begun a case against ISIS on behalf of Nobel Peace Prize nominee Nadia Murad, a young Yazidi woman who escaped capture and sexual enslavement by ISIS.   The 7,250 attendees also heard keynote address from Abby Wambach, Olympian, FIFA Women's World Cup champion and author, "Forward: A Memoir"; Diane Von Furstenberg, iconic fashion designer, philanthropist and author, "The Woman I Wanted to Be"; Annie Clark, founder of End Rape on Campus, whose work is featured in the documentary "The Hunting Ground"; Nina Tassler, highest ranking Latina in network television and recently retired chairman of CBS Entertainment; and Linda Cliatt-Wayman, renowned educator and principal of Strawberry Mansion High School in Philadelphia. Texas First Lady Cecilia Abbott also addressed attendees. Themed "The Power of Us: Amplify your Voice," the nonpartisan, nonprofit Conference, the largest of its kind in Texas, also featured breakout sessions led by more than 100 experts in the fields of leadership, philanthropy, health and wellness, finance, media, personal branding and professional development. This year, conference attendees visited the career pavilion for professional development workshops, resume reviews with human resource experts, LinkedIn profile makeovers and executive coaching with the International Coach Federation Austin and Texas Women in Business. In the Community Connection Pavilion, United Health Care provided interactive volunteer opportunities with Special Olympics. "Women derive incredible strength and inspiration when we come together to celebrate, encourage and amplify each other's voices," said Johnita Jones, president of the Conference Board.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | November 15, 2016 -- 15:00 GMT (07:00 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things GE on Tuesday announced it is acquiring Bit Stew and Wise.io, two companies that will bolster its industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offerings with new edge capabilities and machine learning -- crucial IIoT competencies. The acquisitions were announced at the Minds + Machines conference, where GE also announced updates to Predix, its IIoT platform. They also announced a new collaborative app development program for independent software vendors on the Predix platform, which is launching with partners like Box, Pitney Bowes and Ericsson. Through its acquisitions and partnerships, GE is attempting to build a robust Predix ecosystem that cements its status as a digital industrial leader around the globe. GE says it's quickly building up business in the industrial software market: Its software revenues are on target to increase 20 percent in 2016. More from Mind + Machines: GE releases new suite of Predix applications, services | GE Power lands Exelon as Predix customer, co-innovation partner GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh told ZDNet that GE's digital ambitions reach just about all corners of the globe. Its geographic areas of interest include the US, Europe (particularly the UK, Germany and France), China, Japan, Singapore, the Middle East and India. "It's not about mature industries or emerging industries," he said. "It's about, 'How do I get a barrel of oil out of the ground cheaper than I did yesterday? How do I ensure I'm delivering electricity consistently and at the best price?'" The potential in the IIoT market, he said, simply "reflects the need to be more productive in our operations and the need to get more out of our machines." To get the most out of industrial machinery, GE is working to build up its edge-to-cloud offerings. With that in mind, the company announced it has acquired Bit Stew, a data integration platform provider for asset-intensive industries. By integrating Bit Stew technology into GE's Asset Performance Management (APM) offering and the Predix platform, GE will be able to help industrial companies better organize large amounts of data at its source. With the acquisition of Wis.io, a predictive intelligence technology platform, GE Digital is accelerating the development of advanced machine learning and data science capabilities in the Predix platform. Machine learning is going to be "core competency" for industrial customers looking for ways to stand out in the market, Ruh said. To stand out, a company must organize the data it owns, Ruh said -- "that's their water rights to the valley." From there, a company has to build out capabilities from that data. By adding Wise.io's technology to the mix and opening it up as a programmable interface, GE is helping companies add their own "secret sauce," Ruh said. "That gives the customer the ability to look at the past and look for patterns of behavior they couldn't see before." Machine learning is also helping GE add modeling and simulation capabilities to its "digital twin" offering, which is virtual twin of an industrial asset. Along with acquiring capabilities, GE is building up its third-party partnerships. Its new independent software vendor (ISV) program will allow partners to use Predix to build new industrial applications, for functions like maintenance, content development or asset management. Inaugural partners include Box, Decisyon App Composer, Entercoms, Ericsson, Mobideo, Nurego, Pitney Bowes and OAG Analytics. The ISV program adds to GE's Digital Alliance Program, which now has more than 270 global partners including major enterprise players like AT&T and Intel. Additionally, GE expects to open additional foundries in 2017 in the ASEAN region, as well as in the Middle East/North Africa/Turkey region, and a second European foundry in Germany. GE Digital opened three foundries in 2016 in Paris, Shanghai and San Ramon. GE acknowledges that building out this ecosystem of partners is crucial to a platform's success -- but embracing that viewpoint "really required a new way of thinking," Ruh said. The company adopted that perspective in part by bringing on new talent, Ruh said. For instance, Darren Haas, one of the developers of Siri, moved from Apple to GE to help build the Predix platform. Additionally, Denzil Samuels, who joined GE Digital from Salesforce.com, is helping to drive GE's ecosystem play. "Industrial companies haven't traditionally interacted with ecosystems in the same way," Ruh said. "They don't have open platforms, they have proprietary, closed systems... We are emphasizing ecosystem in a new way." The Power of IoT and Big Data We delve into where IoT will have the biggest impact and what it means for the future of big data analytics.

The China-based Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer, which first claimed the title of the world's fastest system in June 2016, still reigns supreme. For more information on Servers Navigating Your IT Career Exploring the Private Cloud for Your Organization IT Manager's Guide to Social Networking Partner Offers Sunway TaihuLight was built by the National Research Center of Parallel Computer Engineering and Technology (NRCPC), and it is installed at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China. Tianhe-2, which was the top supercomputer in the world from June 2013 to June 2016, once again came in second with its score of 33.86 petaflops. In terms of overall standings, the U.S and China now have 171 systems each on the Top500 supercomputer list, accounting for two-thirds of all supercomputers in the world. The June 2016 standings are somewhat of a reversal for the U.S from the June 2015 top500 list, when there were only 108 supercomputers in China and 200 in the U.S. Overall, the supercomputing landscape is getting faster each year, with the current entry-level system on the top 500 list coming in at 349.3 teraflops, up from the entry level of 206.3 teraflops in November 2015. The total performance of all 500 computers on the list is now 672 petaflops, a 60 percent increase from a year ago. In terms of system architecture components, Intel dominates the list with 462 out 500 systems. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), inclusive of its recent acquisition of SGI, is the top systems vendor with 140 supercomputers on the list. The single most pervasive technology component across the top500 supercomputer list, however, is in terms of operating system. Linux is now on 498 of the top 500 supercomputers, or 99.6 percent. In contrast, in November 2015, Linux was on 494 of the top 500. Looking even further back, in November 2010, Linux represented 460 out of the top 50 systems.

"While the averages might not have told you this today, I am telling you that today was the most bullish day yet in the now fabled post-election Trump rally," the "Mad Money" host said. Tuesday's market was not only bullish for post-election stocks, but also the pre-election winners took part in the action. This included banks, drug stocks and technology stocks. However, underlying it all were bonds, which controlled the current of the market. Interest rates have soared after the election because Trump plans to do some serious spending and big-league tax cuts. That means borrowing money from the bond market in order to fund all of this.

Warren Buffett has been a vocal critic of the airline industry, so after Berkshire Hathaway's purchase of shares in four airlines, Cramer wanted to know what changed Buffett's mind. Buffett now owns 21.7 million shares of American Airlines, 6.3 million shares of Delta Air Lines, 4.5 million shares of United Continental and an undisclosed stake in Southwest Airlines. "I need to give you the standard warning about trying to piggyback off of famous investors, because by the time you see their filings, it is often too late to capture the bottom," Cramer said. Cramer was also shocked by the collapse of natural gas prices in the past month. "One of the largest natural gas collapses in recent memory, a crash of epic proportions that no one is talking about," he said. To figure out where natural gas prices could be headed, he turned to technician and commodities expert Carley Garner. She is a colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com and the co-founder of DeCarley Trading. While Garner predicted the decline of natural gas a month ago, she was stunned by the rapid decline. She believes that the natural gas market is showing signs of bottoming. Ultimately, the charts suggested to Garner that natural gas will head lower before it can rebound. She recommended investors to be prepared for a slide lower, and then there could be a sustained comeback. There's a new semiconductor company in town, and Cramer was so impressed, he's calling it the "Intel of this generation." NVIDIA is the maker of powerful graphics chips for PCs used by gamers. It supplies the components for the connected car, the internet of things, the data center, cloud and artificial intelligence. It basically has exposure to most of the hot end markets in technology. The success showed in the numbers, as NVIDIA delivered a strong quarter on Friday. This led Cramer to believe it's now more than a chipmaker. It is a hybrid play on graphics cloud-based artificial intelligence solutions for enterprise. "I think that makes NVIDIA the defining semiconductor story of this generation, which is why I believe it's got more room to run. Although, ideally, you should wait for a pullback here before you pull the trigger," Cramer said. Another technology play on Cramer's radar is Talend, the software company that helps to integrate data and applications in real-time across traditional, modern cloud or big data environments. Talend's platform lets customers see a unified view of how their businesses are doing and what their customers want. Cramer last spoke with Talend when it was privately held. However, it came public at the end of July. The company reported a strong quarter last Thursday, with a narrower than expected loss, 40 percent revenue growth and optimistic guidance for the next quarter. Talend's CEO Mike Tuchen spoke with Cramer on Tuesday, who explained that with more things measurable than ever before, big data has grown in importance. "Right now, companies are trying to do more and more decision-making based on data, not heuristics, not gut feel. And they are doing that because the world is becoming more and more digitized," Tuchen said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: Buffalo Wild Wings: "I like what the activists are saying. I do like the company, I think the company is going to enjoy better times now post-election. That's what Zoe's Kitchen said, so my answer is, let her ride!" Spark Energy: "If we are going to go down into the retail energy business, then we are going to go and we are going to stick with Chevron. I'm not kidding, because we want that power."

The first four nights, protestors congregated in Pioneer Square to listen to speakers, after which they marched through the streets shouting chants such as “Not my president,” “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist USA,” and “The people united will never be divided.” The protests have continued despite statements by leading Democratic politicians including President Obama, Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders pledging to work loyally with a Trump administration. On Wednesday and Thursday nights, marchers took over several city blocks as they crossed the Morrison Bridge and the Hawthorne Bridge from Pioneer Square to the Moda Center on the east side of the Willamette River. Hundreds blocked bridges and interstate highways, bringing public transportation and vehicle traffic to a halt. The protests attracted broad layers of the population with a strong presence of students and young people. The crowd overwhelmingly rejected the reactionary positions promoted by Trump during his campaign, calling attention to the US-Mexico border wall as well as his verbal attacks on gays, women and Muslims. The protests have been largely peaceful; however, the Portland police have been deployed in force using the acts of vandalism by small bands of self-declared anarchists as a pretext. The police used flash-bang grenades and pepper spray against the protesters on Thursday and used rubber bullets and tear gas on Friday. Thursday night, police arrested 25 after announcing that what had, up till then, been a peaceful protest was now a “riot.” Police ordered protesters to leave the area at 8 p.m., and responded with rubber pepper balls—a “less lethal” projectile, containing a chili pepper dust. A total of 113 people have been arrested so far. On Saturday night, Portland Democratic mayor Charlie Hales and Police Chief Mike Marshman issued warnings to the protesters as a whole, declaring the protests “unlawful” and once again deployed police against protesters, including large numbers of heavily militarized police. The protests reflected the heavy influence of various pseudo-left groups that sought to channel the genuine opposition and outrage of workers and young people behind the Democratic Party. As in many other cities, they blamed Trump’s triumph on an alleged resurfacing of racist and sexist tendencies among the white working class. The main organizers of the protests are behind the local group Portland’s Resistance (PR), a liberal outfit in the orbit of the Democratic Party. The group has offered a list of demands—”an end to police brutality, clean air and water, open and accountable elections”—directed to the very political structure responsible for these regressive policies. The politics of PR are focused on pushing the Democratic Party to the left. Its spokesman, Gregory McKelvey, revealed this perspective in an interview with the Oregonian newspaper, saying, “I think protesting is one of those angles [of change]—there’s nothing more patriotic than using your first amendment right to push for change.” He states that, with enough support for these demands, Portland can become a “beacon of light for the rest of the nation.” In fact, Democratic Party politicians have dominated Oregon state and local governments for decades, a period in which inequality, poverty, hunger and homelessness have become entrenched. Oregon has one of the highest rates of inequality in the nation. Homelessness has exploded, with spontaneous tent cities popping up on public sidewalks and under freeways. Figures from the city’s web site—not updated since June of 2015—show 4,000 homeless individuals on any given night with another 12,000 “doubling up.” Hunger is endemic, with nearly 20 percent of Oregon’s population on food stamps. Meanwhile, Oregon’s corporate tax rate is the lowest in the nation, with both corporate giants Nike and Intel receiving special tax cuts from former Democratic governor Ted Kulongoski in 2013. No tendency outside of the Socialist Equality Party and the International Youth and Students for Social (IYSSE) Equality offered a cohesive political perspective. SEP and IYSSE supporters explained that Trump’s election was not the product of a “racist” white working class, but reflected the political bankruptcy of the Democratic Party. Clinton’s appeal was not directed to the working class, but to wealthier layers of the upper middle class based on race and gender issues. Clinton lost because millions of workers—black, white and immigrant—were disgusted with the Clinton campaign, which advanced a program of war, while not concealing its subservience to Wall Street. The Portland chapter of the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) attended every night of the protests to distribute flyers for the upcoming public meeting (see below) on November 15th with speaker Joseph Santolan from the Socialist Equality Party. The World Socialist Web Site spoke with rally attendees at Waterfront Park on Sunday. An estimated 500 to 600 participated. While mostly young people were in attendance, a cross-section of society—workers, middle class and students—were present. A number expressed illusions in the campaign of self-proclaimed democratic socialist Sanders, who sought to channel opposition to the right-wing Clinton campaign back into support for the Democrats. Meredith Jordan, an unemployed graduate student in environmental science, referring to Trump’s anti-climate change position, said, “With Trump in office, there will be no science whatsoever. I was shocked and very surprised at his election. I was living in an echo chamber of my friends and community that he was unelectable.” Ashley and her friend Mikaela Rodriguez is a first-year medical resident at Oregon Health Science University. “I was shocked and stunned and in disbelief at Trump’s election. I was working the night shift, glancing at the TV monitor, watching state after state go red. I felt that Bernie [Sanders] better reflected our values. I was a lot more politically involved when I was younger, but Bush’s second term hit me hard.” Ashley Wagar and her friend Ellisa told the WSWS, “I’m here because the world is watching what we do here. Trump’s election is obviously a global issue and we have to show the world that our protest is not just a bunch of ‘liberal sore losers’ as the right says. It isn’t a small matter, we are part of a much larger issue.” The WSWS also spoke with a group of young people, most in high school. Lloyd said, “I have been at every protest every night. I was unable to vote even though I will be personally affected by Trump and the Trump presidency.” Hugo added, “They are upset with the political system, but it is terribly complicated, the Electoral College of faceless voters determines the president. It is not the decision of the popular vote. Hugo (left) and Lloyd (center) with their friends, holding candles “The Electoral College was designed to protect the slave states, and these states are holding the rest of the nation hostage.

The hardware side of the drone business would be quickly commodified, he told me, and the real value would be collected by the software makers who built platforms that were used by a wide range of manufacturers. This was a reasonable assumption to make if you believed the market for drones would look something like the market for Android smartphones. Dozens of manufacturers would squeeze out small margins while relying on a central operating system whose creator could then monetize that massive install base. Hardware innovation staves off commodification The reality today, however, looks a lot more like the other side of the smartphone market: Apple’s hardware empire. And the company positioned to be the Apple of drones is China’s DJI. It has captured more than 50 percent of the market for consumer drone sales in the US, and its biggest American competitors are dropping like flies. That dominance has positioned its hardware as the platform, with every major drone software provider working to integrate their offering with DJI’s mobile app and SDK. The volume of new product being pushed by DJI is astonishing. It released two drones today, updates to its Phantom and Inspire lines. Last week it released a new version of its Matrice drone, and last month it rolled out an entirely new line of drone, the Mavic. The craziest part about all the new product DJI is pushing is that, by and large, it’s only competing with itself. DJI has the fat middle of the market all to itself There are some very high-end drones made by companies like FreeFly and Ascending Technologies that can match the capabilities DJI’s drones offer. But those units sell for more than $15,000, three times the cost of DJI’s new Matrice 600 Pro. Between $1,000 and $6,000 there are now four different kinds of DJI drone, the cheapest of which is better than practically anything else you can get for under six figures. DJI is now able to slide features from across its various product lines up and down the spectrum. Just like Apple’s fingerprint sensor began on its phone but now lives on its laptops, DJI has taken key pieces of its Phantom line and moved them up to the Inspire and down to the Mavic. The one place DJI hasn’t gone is down market. It has never introduced a drone that cost less than $999 to start. But the blistering pace with which it’s introducing new product means that its older models, just like last-gen iPhones, can fill in this gap. If someone were to ask me today what the best drone on the market for $500 is, I would say without hesitation it’s the Phantom 3. It’s is a year and half old, but it’s more powerful and reliable than anything else at that price point. Competition is faltering Meanwhile the competition is actually shrinking. 3D Robotics, a promising Silicon Valley startup, got out of the consumer drone business after the disastrous launch of the Solo, its DJI Phantom competitor. And GoPro, which seemed poised to shake up the market, was forced to recall its new Karma drone after they started falling out of the sky. The much hyped Lily drone still hasn’t shipped. China’s Yuneec is one of the last competitors standing. It’s being assisted by Intel, which has given Yuneec both investment and technology. Intel sees drones as a fast-growing market and wants to ensure it has a home for its chips in the coming robot revolution. I would love to see it become the Android of these aircraft, providing a base of software and perhaps core technology that lots of manufacturers could build off of. Right now, however, it’s a more like Windows phones, hardware that could continue to chug along, supported by a corporate parent, but so far hasn’t managed to grab significant market share among consumers. I don’t think the venture capitalist I spoke to regrets his decision to invest in the software side of drones. The company he backed is doing quite well. But he may experience a twinge of regret that he didn’t pursue the much larger opportunity to invest in an increasingly rare kind of startup, a company that can combine hardware and software into one seamless package, that can appeal to consumer but satisfy professionals, and that seems poised to leave its competition in the dust for years to come.

But how do you present a car that, for the most part, only exists in a prototype?  Typically, you’d just see the prototype, but using Dell Precision Workstations and HTC VIVE VR Headsets, Jaguar set up two large showcases— one in Los Angeles and one in London— where we could virtually explore the car and they could sell us on a concept that wouldn’t exist in final form until mid-2018— that’s a full two years off.   It was an amazing experience and car, and I just signed up to buy one instead of a Tesla, so that speaks to how effective the sales pitch was.  But imagine being able to fully explore a car that won’t exist in final form for years either in a dealership or even in your home.  Dell, HTC, and Jaguar are changing not only how you buy cars but how you design, build, and buy them.  The I-Pace I have to start with talking about this amazing car.   One of the issues for me with the Tesla X is that it is ugly and Tesla’s new small coupe that it got over 300K pre-orders for looks like someone took an eraser to the grill.  That is the difference between a tech company building cars and a car company building cars— the car company gets that, particularly for a car targeted at a premium buyer, it has to look attractive. And the I-Pace is, and I’m understating this, gorgeous.   The only weak angle is the rear of the car which looks like something was left off, but in every other shot this car looks like McLaren and the F-Type Jaguar had a baby.  With 400 HP and what is likely an understated 0-60 time of four seconds, this will be one of the quickest cars in its class. I know that because I just bought the Mercedes GLA-45 AMG, which leads the class in speed now, and this is faster.  It should also have a range in excess of 300 miles and use standard chargers (Superchargers are Tesla only).   One of the interesting things about this car vs. a Tesla is that it has both a grill and a radiator.  Those of us that are into computer gaming have learned that water-cooling electronics are far more effective than air cooling, and it has always bothered me that Tesla seemingly didn’t get that memo.  Well Jaguar did and the I-Pace is liquid cooled.   Finally, the car is a tech showcase with full displays for instruments and entertainment and LED headlights that can be made dynamic (angling where you turn) electronically.  The only disappointment is that the Intel and Jaguar won’t have the coming feature that allows headlights to make snow and rain disappear; I’m told that won’t be ready until around 2020.  Shame, as I’ve seen it work and it’s a killer app, particularly here in the North West.  VR The other big story at the event was how VR was effectively used to present the car.  Before we’d even seen the physical car, they had us all put on HTC Vive VR headsets, which were connected to those Dell Workstations, and they gave us a presentation to end all presentations.  No PowerPoint slides of death. Instead, they took us into space and began their pitch hundreds of miles above the earth— not sure why, probably just because they could, but talk about an amazing presentation space.  They took us through how the car was designed and built, key features for performance and handling, and what made the batteries more advanced than the ones Tesla is using.  They then took us down to earth (it would have been cool had we done that in the car) and then took us inside and around the car so we could check out the features from both outside and inside of it.  I have to admit being able to stand up and stick my head right through the roof was a tad disconcerting.  But at least it didn’t hurt like it would have in a real vehicle.  By the time they were done I wanted the I-Pace badly, and I was far from alone, showcasing how VR can be used to effectively sell things that don’t even exist yet.  By the time we were done with the presentation they had pulled the prototype up near us and we got to see what I’m told will be very close to the final car but, by then, we literally knew it inside and out.  Wrapping Up: We are at the beginning of an automotive revolution from new power sources like electricity, to autonomous driving, to how we present and sell the vehicles. The world of 2020 will look massively different on the road and in the dealership than it does today.  I don’t think we yet have a full grasp of just how different, but one way to get there is through VR and, this week, I got a little taste of that.  The only problem is I now have a long wait until the new car I lust for shows up.  I’m thinking both Dell and Jaguar don’t think that is a bad thing, not a bad thing at all.  There is a word for that, which I’m not actually allowed to write down.  It’s not nice to make someone want something they can’t have.  Damn, I want that car!!

Google, Intel and IBM are just some of the big names investing millions currently in the field of quantum computing which will enable faster, more efficient computing required to power the requirements of our future computing needs. Now a researcher and his team at Tyndall National Institute in Cork have made a quantum leap by developing a technical step that could enable the use of quantum computers sooner than expected. Conventional digital computing uses on-off switches, but quantum computing looks to harness quantum state of matters - such as entangled photons of light or multiple states of atoms - to encode information. In theory, this can lead to much faster and more powerful computer processing, but the technology to underpin quantum computing is currently difficult to develop at scale. Researchers at Tyndall have taken a step forward by making quantum dot light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that can produce entangled photons (whose actions are linked), theoretically enabling their use to encode information in quantum computing. This is not the first time that LEDs have been made that can produce entangled photons, but the methods and materials described in the new paper (Nature Photonics, "Selective carrier injection into patterned arrays of pyramidal quantum dots for entangled photon light-emitting diodes") have important implications for the future of quantum technologies, explains researcher Dr Emanuele Pelucchi, Head of Epitaxy and Physics of Nanostructures and a member of the Science Foundation Ireland-funded Irish Photonic Integration Centre (IPIC) at Tyndall National Institute in Cork. Dr Emanuele Pelucchi. The new development here is that we have engineered a scalable array of electrically driven quantum dots using easily-sourced materials and conventional semiconductor fabrication technologies, and our method allows you to direct the position of these sources of entangled photons, he says. Being able to control the positions of the quantum dots and to build them at scale are key factors to underpin more widespread use of quantum computing technologies as they develop. The Tyndall technology uses nanotechnology to electrify arrays of the pyramid-shaped quantum dots so they produce entangled photons. We exploit intrinsic nanoscale properties of the whole pyramidal structure, in particular, an engineered self-assembled vertical quantum wire, which selectively injects current into the vicinity of a quantum dot, explains Dr Pelucchi. The reported results are an important step towards the realisation of integrated quantum photonic circuits designed for quantum information processing tasks, where thousands or more sources would function in unison. "It is exciting to see how research at Tyndall continues to break new ground, particularly in relation to this development in quantum computing. The significant breakthrough by Dr Pelucchi advances our understanding of how to harness the opportunity and power of quantum computing and undoubtedly accelerates progress in this field internationally. Photonics innovations by the IPIC team at Tyndall are being commercialised across a number sectors and as a result, we are directly driving global innovation through our investment, talent and research in this area," said Dr Kieran Drain, CEO at Tyndall National Institute.

Start-up bootcamp for Spike Island prison Investors, start-ups, aspiring entrepreneurs and business advisors will be detained on Spike Island with no escape this weekend. The deserted prison is playing host to an overnight bootcamp that will challenge the way start-ups think. Organisers say a night in the cells will give start-ups plenty of time to think about their business models, while networking with fellow inmates could open up some unique business opportunities. Some 150 start-ups who want to learn the real, hard truths about making it in business will report for duty in Cobh on Friday before making their way across to Spike Island for a rigorous debriefing. ADVERTISEMENT Draper Esprit partner Brian Caulfield, SNP Communications founder Renn Vara, Intel former vice president of Internet of Things Philip Moynagh, and IMERC director Dr Val Cummins are among the mentors that will take part in the start-up bootcamp. Andrew Parish, start-up facilitator at Start-up Ireland, said Ireland has a vibrant startup community, as evident by the enormous engagement with Startup Gathering 2015, which saw over 400 events held throughout Ireland across one week. “This year we want to offer something completely different for start-ups; a gritty bootcamp that looks at the harsh realities of making it in business.” David Merriman, head of enterprise development at Bank of Ireland, said the unique event will challenge participating start-ups to hone their skills in an intense, high pressure weekend. Cork to host Startup Nations Summit The Startup Nations Summit will take place in Cork this weekend, marking the first time the event is being held in Europe. The summit is expected to bring together the leaders of national entrepreneurship initiatives from over 80 countries, and will be the cornerstone of the Global Startup Gathering. Taking place over three days, the gathering aims to attract hundreds of international and national business people, entrepreneurs and those thinking of starting up across a number of sectors from biotech to food, manufacturing, e-health, nutrition and technology. It aims to build on the success of Ireland’s Startup Gathering 2015 which engaged more than 18,000 individuals across 22 counties in five days. The programme of events will include debate and discussions, pitches, workshops, immersion labs, networking opportunities, mentoring all with the aim of promoting entrepreneurship and showcasing Ireland’s startup sector to a global audience. A global investor challenge will be run by Cork BIC for startups and entrepreneurs seeking investment. Judges will seek to find the most investable business from a global audience. Siobhán Finn, project director of Cork innovates and the Global Startup Gathering, said the winning entrepreneur will receive a prize worth more than €30,000, which will include cash and international services.       Topics: Barratt Developments CRH Datalex EasyJet Ifg Group KBC Group Kingspan Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Transport & Tourism Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of International Gordon D’Arcy: All Blacks will be bitter, Ireland must be better Economy Always-on world making people happier, survey claims Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hines emerges as top bidder for student residence beside UCD 06:45 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 06:34 €700 per sq m rent for top D2 offices 06:30 Tourist industry urged to shift focus from UK to EU 06:08 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 06:06 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 London Briefing: Carney takes chance to get own back on MPs 2 Easyjet may apply for Irish licence to ensure EU access 3 UK group secures €22m profit on Irish Nationwide's Dublin HQ 4 Martin McGuinness says he was ‘in the dark’ over Project Eagle 5 & Other Stories to open on Grafton Street next month 6 Sorry millennials: Buying a home was just as hard for your parents 7 Bank of Ireland ‘will utilise any relaxation of mortgage rules’ 8 Laura Slattery: Media record is stained but it is Trump who is appalling 9 Brexit casts shadow over Irish retailers in run-up to Christmas 10 Global bond markets rebound as euro-dollar parity bets soar Never miss a story.

Baca / Journal Staff Writer Tuesday, November 15th, 2016 at 10:09am The PNM Building is located at 414 Silver Avenue SW in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico on Monday, March 7, 2016. (Greg Sorber/Albuquerque Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — The state’s largest electric utility, Public Service Company of New Mexico, said it would lay off 30 managers and staff members as part of an effort to reduce costs. PNM currently employs about 1,500 people in New Mexico. The eliminated positions account for 2 percent of the company’s workforce here. “Over the past year, PNM has implemented a series of measures to increase efficiencies and reduce costs,” said PNM spokesman Pahl Shipley in a statement. “We are constantly evaluating how we do things, and we examine best practices across our industry, which is responding to rapidly evolving technology, changing customer needs, increasing regulation, and other factors.” Shipley told the Journal that the recent rate case, in which regulators allowed PNM a much smaller customer rate hike than what the company requested, was “one of many factors” that contributed to the layoffs. The primary factors, according to Shipley, were “the weak economy and lack of load growth.” In its third-quarter call with investors last month, PNM attributed a drop in net earnings to several factors, including decreased load from industrial customers. Though they would not single out the company by name, PNM described a customer consistent with the profile of the Intel plant in Rio Rancho, saying the industrial load drop was primarily due to decreased electricity usage from that customer. Intel began laying off an unknown number of employees at the plant earlier this year as part of a plan to reduce its global workforce by 11 percent. In the statement, Shipley said despite the layoffs, PNM plans to continue “meeting our commitment to serve our customers with reliable, affordable, and environmentally responsible energy.” Advertisement Continue reading Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe Energy Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: PNM Resources earnings climb 18 percent in Q1 – May 2, 2014 PNM asking for 15.8 percent rate hike – Aug 27, 2015 PNM loses support in rate case – Jul 5, 2016 Facebook looking at New Mexico for data storage center – Jul 8, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

The 48th edition shows that while Chinese machines are hanging on to the number one and two positions, the US now has the same number of computers in the top 500 as its Asian rival. Back in June, Sunway TaihuLight’s Linpack benchmark of 93 petaflops knocked Tianhe-2 – clocked at 34 petaflops - off the number one spot. The highest US supercomputer on the list, the 17.59 petaflop Titan, was in third place. Six months later, the top three entries remain the same. June’s list also marked the first time that China had more supercomputers in the top 500 than the US – 167 compared to America’s 165. But the two countries are now back on equal terms, boasting 171 entries each. In terms of aggregate Linpack performance, the US holds 33.9 percent of the total, slightly ahead of China’s 33.3 percent. Adding together the performance of all the supercomputers on the list equals 672 petaflops, an increase of 60 percent compared to the same period last year. Germany sits behind China and the US with the third largest number of supercomputers in the top 500. It’s followed by Japan, France, and the UK. Two new computers make it into November’s top ten: the 14 petaflop Cori arrives at number five, which is a Cray XC40 system from Berkeley Lab’s National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC); while Japan’s Oakforest-PACS – rated at 13.6 petaflops – comes in at number six. Both machines run Intel Knights Landing Xeon Phi 7250 68-core processors. One interesting statistic from the list is that 498 of the 500 computers are now running Linux. Only two Chinese machines – at 386 and 387 – run IBM AIX, a variant of Unix. Linux completely overtook Unix as the supercomputer OS of choice in 2004, just six years after it first appeared on the list, and has been ahead ever since.

The stylish, new HP Z2 Mini Workstation delivers breakthrough power and versatility  and at only 2.3” high is 90% smaller than a traditional business-class tower 2.  With this new offering, HP is positioned to extend its workstation leadership by delivering a new category of workstation that offers superb performance, elegance and efficiency. HP Z Workstation products have become the industry standard for customers demanding a full performance workstation. Building off the success of the HP Z240 SFF, the HP Z2 Mini Workstation is twice as powerful as any commercial mini PC on the market today3 and has the ability to support six displays right out of the box. The HP Z2 Mini was designed for the  millions of CAD users demanding smaller hardware without compromising acoustics and performance and mission-critical reliability. “When designing some of the most technically complex architectural forms the need for cutting edge technology is essential,” said Daniel Libeskind, a world-renowned architect and founder of Studio Libeskind.4  “The speed in which we create, and the complexity of projects have become more intense over the years, but computers like HP Workstations are helping quickly bring the visions of my designers to life.” Shorter than a cup of espresso, the new HP Z2 Mini Workstation is capable of designing anything from state-of-the-art electronics to home and office buildings. The workstation, running Windows 10 Pro or Linux, comes equipped with next generation Intel® Xeon® processors5,  NVIDIA® professional graphics and the availability of HP Z Turbo Drive for handling large files remarkably fast.   “The HP Z2 Mini, the world’s first mini workstation, delivers breakthrough power and versatility in a small, iconic design,” said Jeff Wood, vice president and general manager, Workstations and Thin Clients, HP Inc. “HP redefined the workstation in 2009 with the introduction of the HP Z series, and now once again is disrupting the category with the new HP Z2 Mini Workstation - the ultimate combination of space efficiency, elegance and power for our customers and partners.” HP Z2 Mini designed for the workspace of the future As workplaces become more space constrained, there’s a greater business need for the smaller workstations like the HP Z2 Mini. The incredibly compact form factor resembles more a super computer from the future than a PC of today. The octagon form of the HP Z2 Mini is the most uniquely designed HP Workstation in HP’s 35 years of workstation history, and incorporates HP Z DNA throughout the product including extensive ISV certification and 368,000 hours of quality testing. The ultra-compact and aesthetically pleasing workstation provides users with numerous versatility options: on/under the desk, behind an HP Z display, or on a wall6. HP engineers created custom designed fans and a cooling system for whisper-quiet acoustics (63 percent quieter than an HP business-class mini PC) for workstation customers that need mission-critical reliability. The HP Z2 Mini design and engineering ingenuity will transform the way people think about workstations and workspaces. Pricing and Availability7: HP Z2 Mini Workstation is expected to be available worldwide in December starting at $699.00USD. Based on publicly available information of workstation competitors as of October 3, 2016 with volume of at least 1 million units annually as of October 3, 2016 having < 3 litres volume, professional graphics, Intel® Xeon® quad core processor, ISV certified applications, ECC memory. Based on business-class towers with >1 million units annually as of October 3, 2016 with performance measured by processor clock speed and ViewPerf12 rating, having 4th or 6th Gen Intel processors or AMD Pro processors, integrated VESA mount, VGA, 6 USB Ports, Windows Pro OS and TPM.

Gregg Greenberg Nov 15, 2016 10:58 AM EST The election of Donald Trump is clearly a "mixed bag" for technology investors and investment bankers, says Ted Smith, president of Union Square Advisors. Trump has also talked about being a trustbuster with regard to some of the bigger deals in the markets and there has been a resurgence of activity by traditional large corporate acquirers this year including AT&T (T) , Microsoft (MSFT) , Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco (CSCO) . There has also been widespread divestiture activity by the likes of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) , Intel (INTC) and Dell as these companies seek to reposition themselves for improved revenue growth. Smith expects the already high level of tech-focused activity by private equity firms to continue in 2017. There have been 10 take-private transactions valued at over $1 billion already announced in 2016, more than any other year in the past decade. As for the IPO market, Smith expects it to pick up in 2017 after a moribund 2016.

Most people are aware that the sturdiness of a business grade laptop typically bumps the price up by quite a bit (vs. a similarly spec’d bu consumer-oriented laptop). However, that doesn’t mean you can’t go out and find discounts especially during seasonal sales period. As mentioned earlier, this week Lenovo is running a Back-To-School sale on its ThinkPad line of business laptops. This notably includes the slick looking 2014 ThinkPad Carbon X1 model (pictured above) at its lowest price ever according to sales price history. Amid Lenovo’s modern designs in their consumer lineup, you might notice that every ThinkPad comes with that red dot do-hickey in the center of their keyboards. The “Pointing Stick” is a staple of the ThinkPad series for those unintiated, a throwback to the days before reliable touchpads. (And veteran ThinkPad will swear by the ThinkPad’s Trackpoint). Other features notable in the laptops below are modern Intel 4th generation processors which notably give 15% performance gains with lower power consumption vs. the 3rd gen. We highly recommend the either the X240 or the X1 Carbon for those concern with weight and portability. If you want a bigger screen, the T440 and T440s are good picks. If you need plenty of power, the W540 workstation class laptop can be equipped to be heavy duty (though of course there’s a price premium). Be sure to use coupon code EXTRA100OFF at checkout to get an extra $100 off all the ThinkPad listed below. All deals listed below are at their “cheapest ever” price according to online price database.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | November 15, 2016 -- 15:00 GMT (07:00 PST) | Topic: Internet of Things GE on Tuesday announced it is acquiring Bit Stew and Wise.io, two companies that will bolster its industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) offerings with new edge capabilities and machine learning -- crucial IIoT competencies. The acquisitions were announced at the Minds + Machines conference, where GE also announced updates to Predix, its IIoT platform. They also announced a new collaborative app development program for independent software vendors on the Predix platform, which is launching with partners like Box, Pitney Bowes and Ericsson. Through its acquisitions and partnerships, GE is attempting to build a robust Predix ecosystem that cements its status as a digital industrial leader around the globe. GE says it's quickly building up business in the industrial software market: Its software revenues are on target to increase 20 percent in 2016. More from Mind + Machines: GE releases new suite of Predix applications, services | GE Power lands Exelon as Predix customer, co-innovation partner GE Digital CEO Bill Ruh told ZDNet that GE's digital ambitions reach just about all corners of the globe. Its geographic areas of interest include the US, Europe (particularly the UK, Germany and France), China, Japan, Singapore, the Middle East and India. "It's not about mature industries or emerging industries," he said. "It's about, 'How do I get a barrel of oil out of the ground cheaper than I did yesterday? How do I ensure I'm delivering electricity consistently and at the best price?'" The potential in the IIoT market, he said, simply "reflects the need to be more productive in our operations and the need to get more out of our machines." To get the most out of industrial machinery, GE is working to build up its edge-to-cloud offerings. With that in mind, the company announced it has acquired Bit Stew, a data integration platform provider for asset-intensive industries. By integrating Bit Stew technology into GE's Asset Performance Management (APM) offering and the Predix platform, GE will be able to help industrial companies better organize large amounts of data at its source. With the acquisition of Wis.io, a predictive intelligence technology platform, GE Digital is accelerating the development of advanced machine learning and data science capabilities in the Predix platform. Machine learning is going to be "core competency" for industrial customers looking for ways to stand out in the market, Ruh said. To stand out, a company must organize the data it owns, Ruh said -- "that's their water rights to the valley." From there, a company has to build out capabilities from that data. By adding Wise.io's technology to the mix and opening it up as a programmable interface, GE is helping companies add their own "secret sauce," Ruh said. "That gives the customer the ability to look at the past and look for patterns of behavior they couldn't see before." Machine learning is also helping GE add modeling and simulation capabilities to its "digital twin" offering, which is virtual twin of an industrial asset. Along with acquiring capabilities, GE is building up its third-party partnerships. Its new independent software vendor (ISV) program will allow partners to use Predix to build new industrial applications, for functions like maintenance, content development or asset management. Inaugural partners include Box, Decisyon App Composer, Entercoms, Ericsson, Mobideo, Nurego, Pitney Bowes and OAG Analytics. The ISV program adds to GE's Digital Alliance Program, which now has more than 270 global partners including major enterprise players like AT&T and Intel. Additionally, GE expects to open additional foundries in 2017 in the ASEAN region, as well as in the Middle East/North Africa/Turkey region, and a second European foundry in Germany. GE Digital opened three foundries in 2016 in Paris, Shanghai and San Ramon. GE acknowledges that building out this ecosystem of partners is crucial to a platform's success -- but embracing that viewpoint "really required a new way of thinking," Ruh said. The company adopted that perspective in part by bringing on new talent, Ruh said. For instance, Darren Haas, one of the developers of Siri, moved from Apple to GE to help build the Predix platform. Additionally, Denzil Samuels, who joined GE Digital from Salesforce.com, is helping to drive GE's ecosystem play. "Industrial companies haven't traditionally interacted with ecosystems in the same way," Ruh said. "They don't have open platforms, they have proprietary, closed systems... We are emphasizing ecosystem in a new way." The Power of IoT and Big Data We delve into where IoT will have the biggest impact and what it means for the future of big data analytics.

Brian Smale To build OpenAI—a new artificial intelligence lab that seeks to openly share its research with the world at large—Elon Musk and Sam Altman recruited several top researchers from inside Google and Facebook. But if this unusual project is going to push AI research to new heights, it will need more than talent. It will needs enormous amounts of computing power. Google and Facebook have the resources needed to build the massive computing clusters that drive modern AI research, including vast networks of machines packed with GPU processors and other specialized chips. Google has even gone so far as to build its own AI processor. But although OpenAI says it’s backed by more than a billion dollars in funding, the company is taking a different route. It’s using cloud computing services offered by Microsoft and perhaps other tech giants. “We have a very high need for compute load, and Microsoft can help us support that,” says Altman, the president of the tech incubator Y Combinator and co-chairman of OpenAI alongside Musk, the founder of the electric car company Tesla. Related Video President Barack Obama on How Artificial Intelligence Will Affect Jobs The arrangement points to a new battlefield in the increasingly important world of cloud computing, where companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google offer massive amounts of computing power over the Internet. OpenAI is part of a sweeping movement towards deep neural networks, networks of hardware and software than learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data, and this technology leans heavily on GPUs and other specialized chips, including the TPU processor built by Google. As deep learning continues to spread across the tech industry—driving everything from image and speech recognition to machine translation to security—companies and developers will require cloud computing services that provide this new breed of hardware. “Anyone who wants a trained neural net model to handle real enterprise workloads either uses multiple GPUs or twiddles their thumbs for days,” says Chris Nicholson, founder of Skymind, a San Francisco startup that helps other companies build deep learning applications. “So every company that needs AI to improve the accuracy of its predictions and data recognition [will run] on them. The market is large now and will be huge.” Skymind’s own operations run on GPU-backed cloud computing services offered by Microsoft and Amazon. A research outfit like OpenAI, which is trying to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, requires more specialized computing power than the average shop. Deep learning research is often a matter of extreme trial and error across enormous farms of GPUs. But even if you’re training existing AI algorithms on your own data, you still need help from chips like this. Related Stories Inside OpenAI, Elon Musk’s Wild Plan to Set Artificial Intelligence Free Google Built Its Very Own Chips to Power Its AI Bots The Epic Story of Dropbox’s Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire At the same time, as Altman points out, the hardware used to train and execute deep neural networks is changing. Google’s TPU is an example of that. Inside its own operation, Microsoft is moving to FPGAs, a breed of programmable chip. Chip makers like IBM and Nervana, now owned by Intel, are developing similar chips devoted to AI applications. As Altman explains, GPUs were not designed for AI. They were designed for rendering graphics. “They just happen to be what we have,” he says. Altman says that although OpenAI won’t use Azure exclusively, it is moving a majority of its work to the Microsoft cloud computing service. OpenAI chose Azure, he explains, in part because Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and company gave the startup an idea of where their cloud “roadmap” is headed. But it’s unclear what that roadmap looks like. He also acknowledges that OpenAI picked Azure because Microsoft has provided his high profile operation with some sort of price break on the service. According to Altman and Harry Shum, head of Microsoft new AI and research group, OpenAI’s use of Azure is part of a larger partnership between the two companies. In the future, Altman and Shum tell WIRED, the two companies may also collaborate on research. “We’re exploring a couple of specific projects,” Altman says. “I’m assuming something will happen there.” That too will require some serious hardware.

Codeplay is a company that is internationally recognized for expertise in heterogeneous systems, and has many years of experience in the development of compilers, runtimes, debuggers, test systems, and other specialized tools. EEMBC was formed in 1997 to develop meaningful performance benchmarks for the hardware and software used in embedded systems. EEMBC benchmarks help ensure predictable performance of embedded processors and systems in a range of applications and disciplines. EEMBC benchmarks are expanding into several important areas focused on the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous driving (e.g. ADAS), and data centers.

One such server, whose existence was first disclosed last September, is a custom-built Power8 CPU-based server — built on its existing 822LC, and dubbed “Minsky” — whose CPU and GPU are hard-wired using Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink interconnect bus. “We actually created a new chip that we call the Power8 NVLink processor,” stated Sumit Gupta, IBM’s vice president for high-performance computing and analytics, in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. “This has a high-speed, NVLink interface embedded in it.  This is a proprietary, private interface, only on our CPU and Nvidia’s new Pascal GPU.  This has enabled us to build a server that has much faster communication between the CPU and GPU. . . This server, because of this interface between the processors, gives us a very big performance advantage.” IBM’s Power8-based S822LC is a 2U, 2P unit built with four CAPI-enabled PCIe expansion slots.  Originally, through its existing partnership with Nvidia, the S822 chassis was optimized to support Tesla-model K80 dual-GPU accelerators.  But Minsky is designed to support Nvidia’s newer Pascal P100 GPUs instead, by way of this proprietary NVLink interconnect. While We’re At It, Let’s Uproot Hadoop Gupta told us he believes Minsky’s advantages will be realized in the field of distributed applications — not just by accelerating the workload on one server, but through a mass acceleration of Minsky servers belonging to combined clusters. He told us the story of an (unnamed) mid-size IBM customer in the business of producing consumer events. The company invested in GPU-accelerated servers, but soon found itself encountering bottlenecks with handling its unstructured data.  Gupta asked what file system was being used, and the response was: HDFS, the cross-volume file system for Hadoop. “I said, ‘HDFS was never built for this kind of throughput!’” Gupta continued.  “We got into a discussion about IBM’s parallel file system, which we invented for the HPC space — GPFS Spectrum Scale.  That company realized it needed to use some of these parallel file systems.  It’s these secondary issues that people aren’t thinking about, when they start on this journey.” It’s a clever argument in favor of a full-stack approach to highly parallel, highly distributed workload development, tightening the bonds between the underlying algorithm libraries, the GPUs, and the CPUs.  So it’s no surprise that Minsky’s unveiling comes in conjunction with IBM’s release of a deep learning AI toolkit, called PowerAI, leveraging GPUs linked to IBM Power CPUs by way of NVLink. “Every retailer, bank, or consumer-facing customer we talk to, and even logistics companies with customer-facing Web sites, are looking at how they can use chatbots. How can they automate their call centers to improve the quality of service?” IBM’s Gupta asked.  “People are looking at how they can take advantage of all the data that’s coming in from social media, from customers browsing websites, from customer purchasing histories.  These new methods that use machine learning and deep learning are becoming extremely effective in enabling customers to take advantage of these use cases.” Parallelism and Profiling IBM says it tested S822LC Minsky servers with 2P 8-core Power CPUs and 4 Nvidia Pascal P100 GPUs, running Toronto University research Alex Krizhevsky’s permutation of image recognition neural network library ImageNet, called “AlexNet,” by way of the popular Caffe framework, using IBM’s newly released PowerAI library.  It’s promising double the performance over the same workload running on 2P 10-core Power S822L servers equipped with 4 Nvidia Tesla M40 GPU accelerators. Meanwhile, for its Pascal P100 GPUs, Nvidia has been promising up to 48 times the performance on some benchmarks versus a standardized equipped 2P Intel 4th-generation Haswell-equipped processor. The reason, Nvidia says, involves the use of high-bandwidth HBM2 memory, which shares the die with the GPU and eliminates the need for GDDR5 video memory on a separate bus. Of course, those benchmarks are using artificial workloads, which in the artificial intelligence space may be too artificial.  There’s an argument to be made that an operating profile for real-world work in the emerging AI space has yet to be determined — for example, picking out the profile of a prospective customer based on. . . shall we say, very delicately, looks. “Nobody expects this to be easy.  I don’t think I’ve spoken to anybody at these [HPC] forums who doesn’t realize this is not an easy task,” admitted IBM’s Gupta.  “In fact, you know it’s not easy, because honestly, there’s no website that you can do this on today.  Not even the born-on-the-Web companies have been able to solve the problem of retail image analysis yet.  So I think people realize these are tough challenges.” But one client told Gupta it had finally evolved to that critical mass-state where it can efficiently and affordably collect, save, and store all the data it’s collecting.  Data lakes now have some respectable, purposeful identity.  But now they need a similarly affordable way to assess what it is that they have. “The data scientist guys don’t want to worry about the infrastructure, making sure the damned software compiles and it scales to a cluster,” he said.  “They want that part of it taken care of, so that they can focus on data science.” Gupta is hopeful that once PowerAI establishes a baseline level of support for AI functionality, developers of all sizes will be able to build on that baseline, as though it were a platform in itself.  Some independent developer somewhere will be able, he feels, to establish himself in the AI space with an implementation of a deep learning library for retail that builds on the accelerated components of PowerAI. IBM’s new framework is now available for download from its deep learning frameworks portal.

(Photo: Stephen Lam/Getty Images) With a lot of criticisms and negative comments in the release of the 2016 MacBook Pro, Apple just proved that they are still the most loved brand when it comes to mobile and technology. According to the report of Slice, Apple's newest MacBook Pro is the most saleable laptop, five days after its release online. As compared to their 12-inch MacBook, its revenue is seven times higher than the latter's launch last April. With the introduction of the latest MacBook Pro, few of the MacBook fans who switched to another laptop brand may have returned, thus, the increase of its sales. The majority of those came from Dell and Asus laptop users. Apple's newest MacBook Pro has generated more revenue than any other laptop this year.- Slice Intelligence https://t.co/KsPWg4UTiq — Thomas Bosboom (@thomasbosboom) November 10, 2016 Aside from the brand, loyal MacBook enthusiasts' continued patronage is brought by its state-of-the-art features and specs like the addition of a touch bar, new graphic chips, enhanced design, louder speakers, etc. Apple declined Intel's integrated Iris Pro graphics and switched to AMD graphics across its new MacBook Pro. In the article of MacRumors, this decision resulted in performance improvements as it delivers expanded external Ultrafine 5k display at 60Hz which many MacBook supporters are waiting for. As explained by Andrew Cunningham of Ars Technica, the latest MacBook Pro is much faster compared to the 2016 12-inch MacBook and its previous models due to the inclusion of the Radeon Pro 455 graphics chip. However, he also said that this is still not suitable for VR and high-end gaming. MacBook Pro's price starts at $1,299.

Image: Gerard McCarthy A researcher and his team at Tyndall National Institute in Cork have made a breakthrough that could enable the use of quantum computers sooner than expected. The breakthrough by the team led by Dr Emanuele Pelucchi, head of epitaxy and physics of nanostructures and a member of the Science Foundation Ireland-funded Irish Photonic Integration Centre (IPIC) at Tyndall National Institute in Cork, could have a serious impact on the future of computing. The researchers at Tyndall have taken a step forward by making quantum dot light-emitting diodes (or LEDs) that can produce entangled photons (whose actions are linked), theoretically enabling their use to encode information in quantum computing. ‘The significant breakthrough by Dr Pelucchi advances our understanding of how to harness the opportunity and power of quantum computing, and undoubtedly accelerates progress in this field internationally’ – DR KIERAN DRAIN “The new development here is that we have engineered a scalable array of electrically driven quantum dots, using easily sourced materials and conventional semiconductor fabrication technologies, and our method allows you to direct the position of these sources of entangled photons,” Pelucchi said. “Being able to control the positions of the quantum dots and to build them at scale are key factors to underpin more widespread use of quantum computing technologies as they develop.” A quantum leap The Tyndall method uses nanotechnology to electrify arrays of the pyramid-shaped quantum dots so they produce entangled photons. “We exploit intrinsic nanoscale properties of the whole pyramidal structure, in particular, an engineered self-assembled vertical quantum wire, which selectively injects current into the vicinity of a quantum dot,” Dr Pelucchi explained. “The reported results are an important step towards the realisation of integrated quantum photonic circuits designed for quantum information processing tasks, where thousands or more sources would function in unison.” Quantum computing is heralded as the next revolution in terms of global computing. Google, Intel and IBM are just some of the big names investing millions currently in the field of quantum computing, which will enable faster, more efficient computing required to power the requirements of our future needs. “It is exciting to see how research at Tyndall continues to break new ground, particularly in relation to this development in quantum computing,” said Dr Kieran Drain, CEO of the Tyndall National Institute. “The significant breakthrough by Dr Pelucchi advances our understanding of how to harness the opportunity and power of quantum computing, and undoubtedly accelerates progress in this field internationally. “Photonics innovations by the IPIC team at Tyndall are being commercialised across a number of sectors and as a result, we are directly driving global innovation through our investment, talent and research in this area,” Dr Drain added.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases Cray Expands Customer Base for Cray Urika-GX System and Previews Upcoming Software Release SEATTLE and SALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Global supercomputer leader Cray Inc. (Nasdaq:CRAY) today announced new customers for the Cray® Urika-GX™ system at the 2016 Supercomputing Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah, and highlighted expanded capabilities for the agile analytics platform coming in December. Cray continues to build momentum for the Cray Urika-GX system, which fuses supercomputing technologies with an open, enterprise-ready software framework for big data analytics. Cray was recently awarded contracts for Cray Urika-GX system from customers specializing in manufacturing, and customer engagement. These new customers include the High Performance Computing Center of the University of Stuttgart (HLRS), and Phizzle – a customer engagement marketing and Internet of Things (IoT) company that enables the ingestion, analysis and reaction to big data in real time. The new contracts follow a previously announced collaboration with Deloitte Advisory Cyber Risk Services to offer threat analytics services powered by the Cray Urika-GX system. “Cray has a long history of partnering with customers as they face complex and evolving analytics challenges,” said Ryan Waite, Cray’s senior vice president of products. “The steady adoption of Urika-GX from a broader set of customers validates the benefits from integrating supercomputing hardware with powerful, open source analytics software like Apache Spark, to face those challenges.

With specs for both laptops closely similar to one another, which laptop is the better option?  ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement There is no denying Microsoft and Apple have been rivals for at least the past three decades. This year is no exception: both companies revealed their new flagship laptops just a few hours apart, with the hope of tempting customers away from the other. Microsoft unveiled the Surface Book i7, a revamped version from last year's flexible laptop with a funny hinge, on Oct. 26. Representing Apple, on the other hand, is the latest MacBook Pro variant complete with a new Touch Bar display right above the keyboard. But which is the better option? Design Microsoft has not changed the physical appearance of the Surface Book i7 model. It still has the matte gray color and dynamic hinge, a spring-like system that folds into itself, leaving a noticeable gap between screen and keyboard when closing the laptop, in which the tech giant takes pride. More importantly, users can completely detach the screen from the keyboard, leaving a 13.5-inch tablet to use, something that the MacBook Pro 2016 does not offer. Meanwhile, Apple slimmed and lightened the MacBook Pro 2016 and added a new Touch Bar feature above the keyboard that changes the controls it shows according to the application currently in use. For example, bookmarks and favorites appear when opening the Safari browser, while editing tools show up when viewing photos. It can also display emoji suggestions or predicted words when typing out sentences. In terms of size, the MacBook Pro is available in 13-inch or 15-inch variants whereas the Surface Book i7 only has the 13.3-inch model. As for the resolution, the former can render up to 2,880 x 1,800 pixels while the latter has 3,000 x 2,000 pixels. Specs and Battery Life Both laptops use Intel's latest 6th generation i7 and i5 chipsets. Both devices use SSD drives and dedicated graphics cards for gaming and video rendering: NVIDIA GTX 965M for Microsoft and Radeon Pro 455 for Apple. In fact, both devices are so alike that it is difficult to exactly pinpoint which performs better straight out. One thing the Surface Book i7 has an advantage over the MacBook Pro is battery life: the former reportedly lasts up to 16 hours while the latter only promises 10 hours of laptop usage. Price To put it mildly, pricing for both laptops is quite expensive. The entry level Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar display costs $1,799 while the 15-inch variant costs $2,399. A 13-inch MacBook Pro sans the feature retails for $1,499. Microsoft's Surface Book i7 starts at $1,899 for the 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage option, while the higher 16 GB RAM and 1 TB variant retails for a whopping $2,999 thanks to a $200 discount. Conclusion Microsoft clearly edges out Apple in terms of pricing. As regards specs too, it would appear that the Surface Book i7 is slightly better with its superior battery life and screen resolution than the MacBook Pro 2016. Of course, there are other things to consider such as software, operating system, and compatibility with other devices. Apple's MacBook Pro would work better with an iPhone or iPad. For those who want more customizability and compatibility options, Microsoft's Surface Book i7 could be a better choice.

Price $1398 AUD > Pricing info Specs Dual-core 3.1GHz Intel Core i7-6500U processor • 8GB RAM • Intel HD Graphics 520 • 256GB SSD • 13.3in 1,920 x 1,080 IPS touchscreen display • 720p webcam • 802.11ac Wi-Fi (2x2 MIMO) • Bluetooth 4 • 2 x USB 3 • USB 2 • HDMI • microSD • 1yr C&R warranty • Windows 10 Home • 325 x 224 x 20.4mm (WDH) • 1.62kg Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Not a great display or battery life, but this 2-in-1’s speed and build quality are rock solid. Dell is in the midst of updating all of its key laptop ranges with a hybrid design of one sort or another, with the Inspiron 13 5000 the latest in line. The concept is simple: a 360-degree hinge allows you to flip the 13.3in screen all the way around, in a Lenovo Yoga-ish way. It looks stunning, with the lightly textured, gunmetal grey chassis adding a touch of class that’s rarely seen on such inexpensive laptops. It might be made out of plastic, but it’s robust and showed few signs of flex when put under pressure. This Inspiron’s compact size is also a better fit for a 360-degree hinge than its 15in sibling (see opposite). With built-in palm rejection, it’s well suited to graphic designers and digital artists who need a touchscreen they can bend to their will.  It’s a shame, then, that the Inspiron 13 5000’s colour accuracy is so poor: our colour calibrator showed its 1,920 x 1,080 display was only capable of showing 58.7% of the sRGB colour gamut. This means you lose out on detail and colour depth. A contrast ratio of 1,220:1 was more promising, capturing a decent amount of shadow detail in darker images, but its low peak brightness of 252cd/m2 makes everything look drab in comparison to the best screens.  It’s still a great laptop to work on courtesy of its excellent keyboard. Every key is tactile and responsive, while the full-sized keyboard uses up almost all of the space available. I had no problems with the touchpad either. Two-finger scrolling proved responsive, and the integrated mouse buttons worked well.  You get a decent selection of ports on the Inspiron 13 5000: two USB 3, one USB 2, HDMI, an SD card reader and 3.5mm headphone/mic jack. Just note the lack of an Ethernet port. Dell’s Inspiron 13 5000 series 2-in-1 laptops come in four distinct flavours. $799 buys a 2.3GHz Intel Core i3-6100U processor with 4GB of RAM and a 1TB hard disk. Choose the $1,099 version and you get a 2.8GHz Core i5-6200U, 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. For $1,299 you can have the same Core i5-6200U, but with 8GB memory and a 256GB SSD. My sample was the top-end model, which costs $1,398 and includes a 3.1GHz Core i7-6500U CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. That’s enough firepower to handle most high-performance tasks. With an overall score of 49 in our benchmark tests, it’s three points in front of Dell’s XPS 13.  Intel’s HD 520 Graphics helped it to 37.5fps in Dirt Showdown at 1,920 x 1,080 with graphics turned down to Low, so you can play older games at a reasonable speed if you lower your expectations. For example, Minecraft never dipped below 30fps at the medium render distance, but bumping it up to 32 chunks caused frequent frame drops. Battery life is no more than mediocre, lasting 5hrs 26mins in our continuous video playback test. That’s with the screen brightness set to 170cd/m2, so there’s room to extend life by dimming the display.  If you intend to watch movies, the dual speakers should impress thanks to their effective amount of bass. The Wave Maxx audio-enhancement tools pre-installed on the laptop are also a real help, but you’ll get the best sound when the laptop’s in kickstand mode with the keyboard facing down. From the design to its surprising turn of speed, it’s a great little laptop for both home and office. It does have some glaring flaws, though, namely display quality and battery life. As with the Inspiron 15 5000, its closest competitor is the 14.1in Lenovo 700 – but I’d pick the Inspiron 13 5000 out of the two. Its smaller dimensions make it a more natural tablet hybrid than the 15 5000, and the keyboard and build quality are top notch.  Related Reviews Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Samsung Galaxy TabPro S Review: Dell Chromebook 13 7310 Review: Dell's XPS 12 is all over the shop Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  dell  |  hybrid  |  inspiron 13 5000  |  laptop  |  review  |  tablet  |  two in one   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Review: the OnePlus 3 is the best phone for its price     Huawei unveils the Huawei Fit – the company's always-on fitness tracker     Xiaomi’s phablet has very little edge     Review: Sony RX1R II     Samsung Galaxy S7 gets the Note7's Always On Display upgrade   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.

20:17 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The proliferation of open source frameworks (Hadoop) for big data analytics is one of the drivers for the High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) market The HPDA analytics market size is estimated to grow from USD 25.71 billion in 2016 to USD 78.26 billion by 2021, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 24.9%. The proliferation of open source frameworks (Hadoop) for big data analytics and the ability of powerful HPC systems to process data at higher resolutions has fueled the growth of HPDA. However, high investment costs and government rules & regulations are acting as the restraining factors for the HPDA market. "Software is expected to be the fastest growing component in HPDA market" The software segment is inevitably gaining traction in the HPDA market owing to the aggressive deployment of supercomputers with high performance computing and advanced analytics in various verticals. The ability to ingest data at high rates and provide analytics in the real-time to create competitive advantage is the driver promoting the HPDA technology. The software market includes programming tools, middleware, performance optimization tools, cluster management tools, and fabric management. "APAC is expected to have the highest growth rate in the HPDA market by region" APAC is estimated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The developing APAC market is poised to grow, as the developing economies are pushing themselves up the analytics edges to be competitive with the developed economies in the world. Higher adoption of supercomputers in China and India with enormous government support is boosting the adoption of HPDA market. China has the fastest supercomputers in the world and would be looking to proliferate further in this burgeoning market.

Is The New MacBook Pro With TouchBar A Good Computer? Nov 14 2016, 3:32 PM 32 diggs Save Share Tweet 'nana Blacklist story Blacklist domain Today, the brand new MacBook Pro with TouchBar, which was unveiled just a few weeks ago, arrives in the hands of the consumer. It's also the day that, evidently, the review embargo was lifted. So, is a computer with a touchscreen worth $1,799? Here's what the reviews say. Is The TouchBar Actually Useful? As its name suggests, the MacBook Pro with TouchBar comes with a thin multi-touch LED screen where the function keys used to be. Gimmick or not, the TouchBar's ability to display context-sensitive actions for whatever application you're using is one of the few hardware interface experiments in the PC industry. But does it actually work? According to The Verge's Jacob Kastrenakes it does... almost: The Touch Bar is often used like a menu, rather than a quick set of controls. Having those menu options exposed so clearly can be helpful at times — I’m bad at finding formulas in Keynote, for instance, and the Touch Bar makes them easy to access — but mostly it’s not. These apps don’t need more menus; they need better context for people just starting out in them, and a streamlined way for experienced users to get stuff done. [The Verge] Ars Technica's Andrew Cunningham points out that the utility of the TouchBar lies squarely in the hands of the developers. Sure, it works in Apple's own apps, but outside of that you're likely to forget the TouchBar even exists: The ultimate utility of the Touch Bar is going to depend entirely on the apps you use and, to a lesser extent, how you use your computer. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. [Ars Technica] Based on the impressions of CNET's Dan Ackerman, who seems to really enjoy the TouchBar, at best it'll make your life a little easier here and there but won't totally change the way you use a computer: Having spent some serious hands-on time with the Touch Bar version of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, and testing its capabilities with a wide range of apps, it feels like a tool that can enhance your computing experience, but won't revolutionize it. It does less than a full touchscreen might, but Apple has found a way to use it to cut down on keystrokes, streamline tasks and add additional levels of fine control. [CNET] The Port Situation Is A Hassle Perhaps you've heard some frustrated criticisms of Apple's Decision to equip the MacBook Pro with just four USB-C ports. There is no MagSafe charging port. There is no DisplayPort. There is, as the gaming bros over at Razer pointed out, no SD card slot. Just four USB-C slots and a whole mess of dongles. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern explains, like the loss of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the switch to USB-C is necessary in the long run, but annoying today: USB-C is a wonderful port. A faster, single type of port for connecting chargers, hard drives, phones, monitors? It’s the dream. Today, though, it’s a dongle nightmare. Until the entire tech industry catches up, you’re stuck dragging around pricey, flimsy adapters to connect everything. Apple has slashed USB-C adapter pricing for now, but it should have included that $9 USB-C to USB adapter in the box [The Wall Street Journal] The Keyboard Is A Bit Odd But The Speakers Are Good Apple completely redesigned the MacBook Pro to be both thinner and lighter. This quest for doing more with less has it's winners and losers, however. To save space, Apple opted for its shorter-travel butterfly key design, originally found on the MacBook. For Endgadget's Dana Wollman, who was very familiar with the older, softer keys, they new butterfly design took a few weeks to stick: Though Apple claims the butterfly mechanism allows for more even button presses, my key strikes would sometimes fail to register, leading me to make typos and forcing me to go back and reenter my long password a second or even third time. By now, though, after some two-odd weeks of testing, I'm typing at a faster clip. I still sometimes screw up my passwords, but my emails and first drafts (including this review!) are mostly clean. I've gone from merely tolerating the new keyboard to actually appreciating it. [Endgadget] Somehow, the thinner design brought us better speakers? According to Macworld's Susie Ochs, they're on-par with a Bluetooth speaker: What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. [Macworld] It's Powerful Enough A major gripe within those who have an eye for hardware specs is that Apple neglected to include Intel's newest processor, their fifth-generation Broadwell CPU, and instead opted for the fourth-gen Haswell. A curious omission for what Apple calls it's most powerful MacBook yet. Still, practically speaking, not being on the bleeding edge doesn't seems okay? It's fine, says Fast Company's Harry McCracken: Given that some of Apple's most demanding professional users are fretting about these machines' processors and RAM capacities, should those of us who don't need tippy-top-of-the-line performance be concerned? I'll leave benchmarking to experts such as the folks at AnandTech, but these Macs have more than enough horsepower for non-superhuman computing tasks; even though Apple didn't use Intel's latest processors, it called on technologies such as high-speed solid-state storage to keep things fast. [Fast Company] Ultimately, It Might Be Good To Just Wait A TouchBar developers have yet to quite figure out, an I/O port standard that's still in its infancy, a slightly underwhelming choice of processor — there are a few teething issues with the new MacBrook Pro. And for a minimum $1,799 entry fee, well, that's an iffy proposition. WIRED's David Pierce suggests that, like the original iPhone, it might be better to just wait for the second go-round: Do you desperately need a new laptop right this second? If not, wait. Run your current (and probably still excellent) machine into the ground, then buy a new one. In a year or two USB-C accessories will be everywhere, developers will have figured out what the Touch Bar is good for, and Apple may even give the Pro spec bump.

Humanity News provided by Equal Access International Nov 15, 2016, 12:00 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Equal Access International, an innovative non-profit creating positive social change for millions of underserved people across the developing world, today announced it is the recipient of the 2016 Tech Award in the Microsoft Education Category. The award recognizes Equal Access for its dramatic expansion and significant global impact since first being named a laureate in 2003. Equal Access will receive a $50,000 cash award at the Tech Awards Gala on November 17 to further its programs which reach more than 137 million people in 21 languages in nine countries across Asia and Africa. Since its inception in 2000, The Tech Awards, sponsored by Applied Materials, Inc., are considered the "Oscars" of Silicon Valley. To mark the award's fifteenth anniversary, former laureates were invited to compete again in their respective categories with the judging committee selecting the "best of the best" Tech Award laureates who continue to address the world's most challenging problems. "This award means so much to our worldwide staff across Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan, who leverage the power and reach of interactive media, innovative technology and community action to inspire the voices, stories, and movements driving positive change when our world needs it most," said Ronni Goldfarb, Equal Access President and CEO. "We are thrilled to be recognized for our work."   Dan'l Lewin, Corporate Vice President of Technology and Civic Engagement at Microsoft Corp, said, "It is an honor to further recognize Equal Access International for its life-changing work, which has successfully scaled beyond the initial 2003 program launch in Nepal. It has provided the ideal mix of innovative communications technology and direct community engagement to produce lasting education and social change that is beyond impressive."  Equal Access Programs and Impact Areas Equal Access previously won the 2003 Tech Award in Education for providing life-changing education on women's and girls' empowerment and HIV/AIDS prevention to 10,400 Nepalese living in remote and marginalized regions of the country. Overcoming barriers of illiteracy and poor infrastructure, Equal Access launched a pioneering educational satellite radio platform/distribution system providing original, locally-produced programming to low-cost receivers in remote villages for the very first time. Today, Equal Access has replicated this model, expanding impact across nine countries in Asia and Africa where they implement large-scale country programs in six inter-related areas ranging from Youth Life Skills, to Women's and Girls' Empowerment to Peacebuilding and Civic Engagement. Last year, more than 67 million people listened, viewed, participated and benefitted from Equal Access programming. And more than 102,000 people participated in community engagement activities. Over the years, Equal Access has continued to develop new, innovative platforms to reach beneficiaries in ways they prefer, including mobile and online platforms and TV programs delivered via satellite, YouTube and mobile apps. Additionally, Equal Access provides annual organization metrics that demonstrate continued global impact, found at http://www.equalaccess.org.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 4:27 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Artificial Intelligence Computer Hardware High Performance Computing (HPC) Comments Microsoft's CNTK (Cognitive Toolkit) is one among many platforms that trains computers to learn, and it's getting an upgrade. CNTK drives the Microsoft services Cortana and Skype language translation, and it boasts more than 90 percent accuracy in speech recognition tasks. Microsoft will soon release an upgraded CNTK toolkit, and one hardware maker wants to ensure the toolkit works best on its hardware. Nvidia is partnering with Microsoft to optimize its GPU development tools for CNTK. The companies have created a set of deep-learning algorithms and libraries that will speed up CNTK to perform AI tasks like image and speech recognition on GPUs. Deep-learning tools like CNTK are sandboxes in which developers can create a model for computers to solve a particular problem. The ultimate objective is to build a well-trained model that can accurately perform a specific task, such as shuffling through loads of medical data to diagnose a disease. Based on input, researchers are continuously modifying models and tweaking parameters. One such tweak optimizes neural networking connections for better A.I. capabilities and for scaling the training model over more GPUs and servers. The training of computer models can run for days and require intense computing horsepower. GPUs power deep learning for companies like Google and Facebook, and Microsoft is allowing some customers to test GPUs as part of its Azure cloud service. The updated CNTK tools will run faster on Microsoft's Azure N Series cloud offerings, which run on GPUs based on Nvidia's older Kepler and Maxwell architectures. The updated CNTK tools could be bought on-premises with Nvidia's DGX supercomputer, which costs $129,000 and has eight Tesla P100 GPUs based on the latest Pascal architecture. Nvidia has been working closely to optimize its GPU deep-learning libraries for the upcoming CNTK release, said Ian Buck, vice president for accelerated computing at Nvidia. GPUs from Nvidia already work on CNTK with existing libraries, but the new framework will provide a big performance upgrade. There is a 7.4 fold improvement in deep-learning training times across eight GPUs in a system, Buck said. Buck declined to comment about when the new tools would be released. Nvidia has made improvements in tools like CUDNN, which provides the libraries and algorithms for GPU-based deep-learning. CUDNN is a core underlying technology of CUDA, which is Nvidia's parallel programming framework. There are other deep-learning frameworks like Google's Tensor, Theano, and the open-source Caffe, which excels at image recognition. Companies like Intel and IBM have forked those frameworks to work best with their hardware. Nvidia's GPUs already support most of the deep-learning frameworks, but CNTK now has an edge. Google has come out with its own inferencing chip called Tensor Processing Unit, designed to improve deep learning results. Google can afford to build its own hardware because it deploys deep learning across on a larger scale, but it could be expensive for smaller companies to deploy deep-learning systems; instead they can turn to cloud services.
