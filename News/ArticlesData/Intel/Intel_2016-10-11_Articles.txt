(Courtesy of Intel Corp.) Jeff BarkerContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun "Why the Phelps face?" the swimmer is asked in new ad for Intel. Intel tapped Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps to star in ads for the computer processor maker, including one featuring the return of the scowling "Phelps face" popularized on the Internet during the Rio Games. Phelps and actor Jim Parsons of "The Big Bang Theory" collaborate on the spots promoting Intel-powered computers. The idea is that Phelps, the world's most decorated Olympian, is frustrated by his slow computer. "The spots titled 'Faster Processing' and 'Phelps Face' feature Jim Parsons and Phelps using an old, slow computer," Intel says on its website. "Phelps' frustration is visible as the computer just cannot keep up." "Phelps Face" refers to the Baltimore native's expression before a race with South African Chad le Clos. Phelps was captured scowling as le Clos paced and shadow-boxed. As he pitches Intel in that spot, Phelps is wearing a headset and hooded warmup just as he was before that race. "Why the Phelps face?" Parsons asks. Michael Phelps joins Ravens, runs out of M&T Bank Stadium tunnel Sean Welsh The Ravens haven’t exactly found the same electricity with their pregame introductions since No. 52 retired.

The commercials will begin airing Oct. 17 during the Late Night Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing How much additional performance does Intel’s Kaby Lake refresh deliver? How much additional performance does Intel’s Kaby Lake refresh deliver? By Joel Hruska on October 6, 2016 at 10:15 am Comment Earlier this year, Intel announced it would no longer operate according to the tick-tock model that drove its product introductions for almost a decade. Instead, it would deliver on a P-A-O cadence. New process nodes would debut first, followed by a new architecture, followed by a further optimization of the process node. Kaby Lake is the first product Intel has formally delivered on this cadence, and there have been questions about how the company’s latest spin on 14nm would compare to its previous efforts. PC World has done a deep-dive on this topic with three Dell XPS laptops that are nearly identical, save for their choice of CPU. This type of comparison is as close to a best-case scenario as you can get when comparing mobile hardware — manufacturers often make decisions about thermal solutions and throttle points that can result in wide variation between systems with identical specifications. This is even more true today as companies cut thickness and integrate features into smaller packages, and it makes these types of comparisons more difficult than their desktop counterparts. We recommend reading the full PC World review if you want specifics on various workloads and comparison areas. But the broad conclusion is that Kaby Lake delivers a noticeable performance improvement to both CPU and graphics workloads. The Core i5-7200U (2.5GHz base, 3.1GHz Turbo) is roughly 10% faster than the Core i5-6200U (2.3GHz base, 2.8GHz Turbo). Battery life has improved by roughly 14% in hardware-accelerated video workloads — unless you test using the 10-bit HEVC 4K workloads that Skylake couldn’t fully decode in hardware. In that case, battery life is 3.5x better. Image and testing by PC World Kaby Lake offers roughly the same amount of relative improvement over Skylake that AMD’s Carrizo offers compared with its earlier Kaveri. Both CPU manufacturers delivered an update that dramatically improves power consumption and battery life in specific scenarios, with a general level of improvement in the 7-15% range depending on the specific application. The difference, apart from AMD’s lower level of performance, is that many of AMD’s initial Carrizo systems were handicapped by poor OEM designs and single-channel memory. AMD’s Carrizo refresh, codenamed Bristol Ridge, is supposed to be better than its predecessor in this regard, but HP and Lenovo only began shipping Bristol Ridge a month ago and detailed benchmarks aren’t available yet. AMD has previously claimed Bristol Ridge will offer a 10-15% performance improvement over Carrizo as well. With Intel serving up the same level of improvement in Kaby Lake, it won’t really change competitive positioning between the two companies. AMD’s APU business is currently stuck in an awkward spot. Zen’s launch next year is expected to be a major event, and Zen CPUs should offer significantly better performance and power efficiency compared with Intel’s current lineup. Exactly how much better is still unknown, but AMD doesn’t need to beat Intel across its entire product family and at every price point to compete much more effectively. Zen APUs aren’t expected until later in 2017, which means AMD will have to flog its Carrizo-derived hardware for 9-12 more months before new products are finally available. As for Kaby Lake, its ~10% increased performance and improved battery life probably aren’t a reason to upgrade from Skylake. But if you have older mobile hardware based on Sandy or Ivy Bridge, you might see real improvements on all fronts.

The Falcon 8+ is an integrated system including the UAV, the Intel Cockpit controller, and the Intel Powerpack battery system.  Intel said the drone's autopilot is driven by three redundant sensors designed to compensate for electromagnetic fields, strong winds, and other factors.In fact, the whole system has failsafes in place, with redundancy across the electronic system, battery power, communications, and all sensors. The Falcon 8+ replaces the previous AscTec Falcon 8, which was originally developed by Ascending Technologies, a German company purchased by Intel earlier this year. The Falcon 8+ is set to be available for pre-order in North America starting in November, but pricing has not been announced.

Intel this week unveiled its first branded drone intended for industrial inspection, surveying, and mapping. The Falcon 8+ builds on the AscTec Falcon 8 system from Intel subsidiary Ascending Technologies. The ready-to-fly drone captures detailed images (accurate down to the millimeter) to detect and prevent damage to infrastructure. "Intel is setting a new standard for commercial-grade drones," said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group. The Falcon 8+'s V-form octocopter provides full electronic system redundancy, including batteries, communication, and sensing. And, like its predecessor, the drone features high-precision GPS, exchangeable integrated payloads, and market-leading capabilities. "Operators will have tremendous opportunities to generate valuable aerial precision data," Walden said. //Related Articles GE's Raven Drone Can Detect Gas Leaks The company also tipped the "sophisticated" Intel Cockpit, a redesigned mobile ground station (with integrated water-resistant tablet) that allows operators to plan and execute complex missions. Plus, there's a new joystick for single-hand flight control. The Intel Powerpack, meanwhile, powers the Falcon 8+ drone and the Cockpit; the smart batteries feature automatic balancing, storage mode, charging, and LEDs that display remaining juice. In August, Intel announced Project Aero, a platform on which developers can build any kind of drone they can conceive. The playing card-sized device offers the storage, communications, and I/O capabilities needed for any drone.

Look no further with our best 2-in-1 Ultrabook list. What’s the best 2-in-1 ultrabook in 2016? If you ask a dozen different people you’re likely to get a dozen different answers, but on the whole you want to keep an eye on devices that are able to pack serious specs into a small space, and put them all behind a display that you wouldn’t mind looking at for more than a few hours a day. Ultrabooks are made to be both power efficient and flat out powerful, and when you add a touchscreen into the mix getting that balance just right is no easy task. This is why Intel verifies that any laptop calling itself an ultrabook needs to have a minimum battery life of 9.5hrs and boot from sleep in 0.5 seconds or less, among dozens of other strict requirements. For this list, we made sure that all the ultrabooks chosen had at least a 256GB SSD for storage, 8GB of RAM, and an Intel Core i7-5500U processor or better. So what’s the best 2-in-1 ultrabook of 2016? For our money (and yours), the #1 pick Microsoft Surface Book combines all the core features you’d want out of a 2-in-1 with a level of polish and design precision that’s simply unmatched by any other contender in the industry today. Best 2-in-1 Ultrabook 2016   Microsoft Surface Book HP Spectre x360 Acer Switch Alpha 12 Rank #1 - Editor's Choice/ Best 2-in-1 Ultrabook #2 Pick #3 Pick Amazon Rating Screen Size 13.5" 13.3" 12" Display 3000 x 2000 1920 x 1080 2160 x 1440 Battery Life Up to 12hrs Up to 12hrs Up to 8hrs Touchscreen CPU 2.4GHz Intel Core i5-6300U 2.4GHz Intel Core i7-5500U 2.40GHz Intel Core i7-6500U RAM 8 GB DDR3 8 GB SO-DIMM 8 GB LPDDR3 Storage 256GB PCIe3.0 SSD 256GB SSD 256GB SSD Weight 3.48 pounds 2.8 pounds 1.87 pounds Price $1,590 $1,141.49 $899 Buy Now Buy Now Buy Now How We Choose the Best 2-in-1 Ultrabook To find our picks for the best 2-in-1 ultrabook, we considered a number of various factors that were included (but not limited to): how fast the processor was, how much RAM/type used, the solid-state drive speed, the mechanism used to connect (or disconnect) the keyboard and display, as well as the comfort of the keyboard and whether or not the ultrabook included its own stylus. More often than not, 2-in-1’s will skimp on the quality of the keyboard with the assumption that people will be using them as tablets half the time, so they’ll build them to only take half the wear and tear over the product’s lifetime. Read More: What Is an Ultrabook? With all these factors in mind, it wasn’t hard to reach the Microsoft Surface Book as the obvious winner in this category. It easily deserves the #1 spot thanks to its highly customizable spec sheet, not to mention that it essentially invented the category when it first debuted as the plain old “Surface” four years ago. Why You Should Buy a 2-in-1 Ultrabook Although 2-in-1 convertible laptops are about as common as regular laptops these days both in popularity and availability, 2-in-1 ultrabooks are made for a very specific type of road warrior. If you’re someone who does a lot of on-site work in places where it may not be easy to set down a laptop (think construction site or medical office), a 2-in-1 ultrabook is the preferred choice thanks to its light, slim profile and long-lasting battery. Intel themselves need to approve all devices that want to attach the “ultrabook” logo to their name, which means an extra vetting process which ensures you only get a 2-in-1 with the highest standard of quality around. Convertible laptops are notorious for breaking at the hinge when you flip between modes, breaking when you drop them, or breaking just if you give them a funny look, so having the ultrabook certification is just one more way to be sure you won’t have to call the warranty department after only a few weeks of ownership. If your last 2-in-1 busted or you’re just looking for an upgrade, it could be time to consider picking up one of the best 2-in-1 ultrabooks in 2016! #1 Pick  Microsoft Surface Book/Editor’s Choice The Surface Book represents the best of Microsoft’s engineering team in a single device. Price: $1,590.00 | Features: 2-in-1 convertible tablet, 13.5″ 3000 x 2000 screen, 128GB onboard SSD WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Surface Book is a workhorse of an ultrabook that transforms into any kind of machine you want it to, right when you need it the most.  If we’re going to start this list off, it might as well be with the 2-in-1 ultrabook that launched the whole trend in the first place: the Surface. Microsoft has gotten a lot of flack in the past over their proprietary Surface line of notebooks and 2-in-1’s, but perhaps uncharacteristically of the company, now they’ve actually listened to that feedback and incorporated it into their core design philosophy. The resulting product was what is easily the one of the best 2-in-1 ultrabooks on shelves today, the Surface Book. Lightning quick and quality-built, the Microsoft Surface Book proves that you don’t need to only be a laptop person or a tablet person to enjoy the benefits from the best of both worlds. The Surface Book is endlessly customizable with pretty much any configuration you could think of available for sale, but to hit a nice middle ground, we recommend the 256GB SSD, Intel Core i5 processor, and 13.5″ PixelSense 3000 x 2000 touchscreen display. If you’re looking for something that can game this build also has a 1GB Nvidia GPU (unspecified chip), which definitely isn’t enough to run something like Battlefield 1, but could still do just fine with lighter games like a MOBA or Diablo III.  The Surface Book doesn’t win the #1 spot just for its specs or the stylus or its keyboard, but it’s the combination of all its precision-engineered parts that bring everything together into the best 2-in-1 ultrabook on shelves now. View on Amazon #2 Pick HP Spectre x360 13.3″ The HP x360 is a stylish, well-built addition to the Spectre lineup of laptops Price: $1,141.49  | Features: 13″ 1920 x 1080 display (UHD available), 256GB SSD, 12-hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Spectre x360 is the Surface Book for buyers on a budget. If you’re one of the millions who can’t stand the idea of owning something that Microsoft made themselves (and we wouldn’t blame you for it), fear not, there are still other options in the best 2-in-1 ultrabook market available to choose from. Namely, the HP Spectre x360. HP has had a rough go of it lately, but the company never stopped producing high-quality laptops and convertibles like those in the Spectre line, and the x360 is no different. Aside from its actuating hinge that lets you quickly swap between laptop to tablet-mode and back again, the x360 takes all the things that made the original Spectre great and improves on them in every way imaginable. Although the specs are fairly par for the course (2.4GHz Intel Core i7, 256GB SSD, 8GB SO-DIMM DDR3 RAM, etc), what really sets the x360 apart is its revolutionary geared hinge system, which creates a 100% flush folding mechanism between the two modes. This means when you’re running the x360 in tablet mode it really feels like a tablet, and when it’s in laptop mode, it feels like a laptop instead of some bastardized mashup of the two. If need a tightly engineered machine that offers the complete package in 2-in-1 ultrabooks, look no further than the HP Spectre x360. View on Amazon #3 Pick  Acer Switch Alpha 12 If you want a light 2-in-1 with extreme versatility to boot, look no further than the Acer Switch Alpha 12 Price: $899.00  | Features: Liquid-cooled 2.4 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB LPDDR3 RAM, 512GB SSD WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Acer Switch Alpha 12 is a laptop with actual liquid cooling onboard, need we say more? This list has 2-in-1 ultrabooks that can convert into a tablet, double as a writing surface, and double as their own home theater…but what about one that actually has its own onboard liquid cooling system? You heard right, the Acer Switch Alpha 12 isn’t just one of the first 2-in-1’s to have mobile liquid cooling installed at stock, it’s one of the first laptops to feature it period. With the help of Acer’s proprietary LiquidLoop cooling system, the Switch Alpha 12 is able to quietly run an Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM and a 12″ 2160 x 1440 display without slowing you down or heating up your lap during intense gaming (or productive work) sessions. The Aspire Switch Alpha 12 uses many of the same design aesthetics that were first made popular by Microsoft’s Surface and refines them even further, including the detachable keyboard and rubberized kickstand. This makes it simple to swap between tablet and laptop mode on the fly, and with this much power, you could even dock the Switch into a monitor and use it as your mobile desktop in a pinch. View on Amazon Most Important Features Weight With a 2-in-1, weight may not be as important of a feature as you might think, given that you might only find yourself lugging around half of the entire unit on a particular day. That said, how a 2-in-1 balances its weight between the bottom and top half of the ultrabook is extremely important. Too top-heavy and you might find it tipping over if you open the screen too wide. Make sure you look at both the weight of the screen/tablet surface compared to the full weight and subtract from there to avoid top-heavy units. Battery life As is the case with every ultrabook, how long the battery can last on a particular 2-in-1 has to meet the minimum requirement set by Intel themselves. In general this rule is 8hrs or more on a single charge, though the company has been known to make an exception or two based on the company and the device they’re putting out. That said, touchscreens inherently use more battery since they need to detect extra input. If you’re trying to save every drop of juice you can, make sure you’re plugged into the keyboard and using the ultrabook in laptop mode to stretch past that 8hr mark. Display Speaking of touchscreens, no 2-in-1 would be complete without the option to go touchscreen-only, so it’s imperative that your next ultrabook have a bright, vivid, and most importantly – responsive, display. Read all the available reviews on the unit you want to buy, and check for any instances where the reviewer says the screen wasn’t responsive enough in their testing scenarios. This is an immediate red-flag to avoid that choice and move on. Price On the whole, 2-in-1 ultrabooks are priced competitively with their 1-in-1 counterparts, but this isn’t always the case. If you don’t think you’ll be using the 2-in-1 functionality at least a few times a day, you’re better off saving the extra scratch you’d spend on a touchscreen and put it to use for better specs overall instead. Mistakes or Things to Avoid Buying a 2-in-1 with a weak hinge: Speaking of using the 2-in-1 feature a lot, perhaps the most critical component of all on a proper convertible ultrabook is the hinge. This is the piece that connects and disconnects the keyboard from the screen/system, and if you use it often, it needs to be able to put up with a lot of punishment over the years without showing any signs of stress. The second the hinge breaks, all you’ll be left with is an overpriced heavy tablet. Not getting a tablet/laptop instead: The market for 2-in-1 ultrabook owners is actually a lot smaller than you might think. Yes, it’s handy to have an “ultra” powerful tablet that goes wherever you do, but it’s also a much heftier investment than say, a regular old tablet like an iPad or Nexus. Unless you do a ton of work that requires a touchscreen, a high-performance processor, extremely long battery life and the addition of a dedicated keyboard, you’re probably better off with a tablet or regular laptop/ultrabook instead. Which Best 2-in-1 Ultrabook is Right for You And the winner for the best 2-in-1 ultrabook that’s right for you is…all of them! Because the list of 2-in-1 ultrabooks released in 2016 is so small, you can be sure that no matter which model you inevitably go with, it’s going to live up to the high standards set by Intel and followed through on by top quality manufacturers like HP, Acer, and Microsoft. The Microsoft Surface Book is a solid pick if you want to acutely customize the exact specs you want out of a 2-in-1 since it has so many available options and specs lists to choose from, while the HP Spectre x360 or Acer Switch Alpha 12 are better for ultrabook users who prefer devices that are laptops first, and tablets second (but don’t have any preference between the two). No matter which one you eventually choose, you can be sure there’s a best 2-in-1 ultrabook out there for you!

Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Videos About en de es fr it nl pt The VICE Channels Share Tweet Motherboard Motherboard Watch Sections Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Latest Videos Documentaries Interviews Machines Discoveries Space Futures Gaming Earth Follow Motherboard Newsletter A 'Cognitive Healthcare System' is Changing Medical Practices in Remote Areas Written by Joseph Neighbor October 12, 2016 // 12:02 PM EST Copy This URL In rural communities throughout the developing world, a doctor can be nearly impossible to find without a long, prohibitively expensive journey to a city. Because of this, many people around the globe have a difficult time accessing crucial healthcare services. For example, in India’s villages, many fall victim to preventable diseases, according to the Ministry of Health, while two-thirds lack access to critical medicines. This was the problem a team of engineering students in Pune, India, set out to solve. Their project, IoT Vaidya, is a “cognitive healthcare system” that links rural patients with doctors, wherever they might practice, using sensors and cloud technology. Recently, IoT Vaidya won the Intel® Ultimate Coder Challenge for IoT, in which five teams were given an Intel® IoT Developer Kit and eight weeks to design an innovative commercial IoT solution. Motherboard spoke with team co-founder Mahavir Dwivedi about their winning project and the healthcare challenges facing impoverished rural communities in India. Motherboard: Can you tell me a little about your background, and how you met up with your team? Dwivedi: I graduated in electronics engineering from Pune University in India last July. Since my sophomore year, I’ve been working on projects which could hopefully turn into real commercial products. Arun Kumar was a classmate of mine; we have done several projects together. He has special interests in robotics and machine learning, and also just graduated this year. Milind Deore is our mentor. He works with CISCO as a network engineer. He has more than a decade of experience in hardware and software. Beyond the technical approach, he’s guided us towards projects that can be launched into the market. A series of sensors transmit patient information using cloud infrastructure for remote diagnosis by medical professionals. How did you come up with the idea for IoT Vaidya? Before participating in the Intel® Ultimate Coder Challenge, we had been to various hackathons and entered a few competitions. Though our performance was fair, we never could take those projects to the next level. We decided we wanted to work on something that could be useful to society, which is how we came to focus on healthcare. It’s a real issue here in India. After doing a substantial amount of research, we learned that though the market is gearing up for a biometric wearables revolution, countries like India still suffer from a critical shortage of doctors. The situation is particularly bad in rural areas. 70% of the Indian population has access to less than 20% of physicians, 10% of the specialists, and 5% of the diagnostic equipment. The situation is not much different in other developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Thus, we had a problem to solve. We decided to build a standalone cognitive health monitoring system, IoT Vaidya, which provides real-time diagnoses to patients, and connects them with doctors and specialists using cloud infrastructure and telemedicine-enabling technologies. For a name, we chose to use the Hindi term for doctor: “Vaidya.” How does it work? The project uses biomedical sensors to acquire a patient’s vitals, like blood pressure and temperature, which are then sent to the cloud where they can be accessed by a physician. This way, a doctor working far away, in any corner of the world, would be able to diagnose a patient’s problem. We have also written machine learning algorithms in the cloud for a very basic analysis of the data, so that instant feedback can be given back to the patient regarding preventive measures to be taken. Machine learning algorithms aid in diagnosis. How long did it take to develop? This was not the first competition we’ve entered using this healthcare-focused solution. We won a previous competition, the Eclipse Open IoT Challenge, with this same project. However, in that case, we were not given Intel boards, so we used open source technologies, like Arduinos. You can use those boards to build prototypes pretty easily, but in order to bring something to market you need certain things only the big players can provide, since they’re more acceptable and tested. So we brought that prototype to the Intel® Ultimate Coder Challenge for IoT, which is when we got Intel-backed software and hardware, like the Intel® Edison board and Intel® IoT Developer Kit. It took us around six weeks to import our previous work on to Intel platforms, and come up with the further developments. What programming languages did you use in writing the software? We didn’t limit ourselves to any one particular language or platform. As this was only an eight-week competition, it was not possible for us to write each and every bit from scratch. So we developed our solution using various open-source libraries and frameworks. In general, we used Python for writing scripts on Edison, C++ for writing Arduino programs, and JavaScript on the cloud. What was the most challenging part of the project? The most important part of our project was the sensors. The Intel® IoT Developer Kit included some amazing sensors from Grove, but it was never going to be enough for us to build a healthcare monitoring solution. So we included our very own. We consulted doctors to get acquainted with the type of data they required for primary diagnosis of a patient, especially for common things like heart disease. All the sensors we considered using had to be non-invasive, so that infections could be avoided. Ultimately, we settled on four: galvanic skin response, temperature, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram. What's the next step in developing this project? During the last six months, we participated in various competitions and developed the proof-of-concept of our product. Now, we are collaborating with other healthcare startups, and have started working on taking this concept to the clinical trials stage. We are also working on our algorithms to deliver more accurate diagnoses to patients. It’s my hope that this will prove useful not only in India, but in rural areas lacking basic health care throughout the world. Topics: Intel, sponsored Contact Motherboard by email.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Asrock preps 21 motherboards for a dip into Kaby Lake by Wayne Manion  11:00 AM on October 12, 2016 Asus spinoff ASRock has followed its progenitor company in releasing BIOS updates adding support for the upcoming Kaby Lake CPUs. Firmware updates for 21 of ASRock's existing Intel 100-series LGA 1151 motherboards add support for what the company dubs "Next Generation" Intel Core processors. ASRock's press release conspicuously avoids the terms "Kaby Lake" or "seventh-generation Core," but the BIOS updates doubtless add support for the new CPUs. The products of Intel's "optimization" phase of its 14-nm tri-gate manufacturing technology are expected to hit the desktop market in early 2017. The firmware updates are not limited to high-end Z170 boards. Entry-level H110, B150, and H170 receive updates as well. The full list of supported motherboards can be found here.

HP adds Intel Kaby Lake chips, edge-to-edge screen to latest Spectre x360 laptop Posted Oct 12, 2016 by Stefan Etienne (@stefanetienne) 0 SHARES Next Story FourKites raises $13 million to track trucks on the road for customers like Staples HP just unveiled its latest laptop built around Intel’s Kaby Lake platform. But this update adds more than just a new processor to the HP Spectre x360 laptop. Some of the other tweaks lean more towards aesthetics on the 13.3-inch laptop, including a slimmer profile by removing 2mm of thickness (now 13.8mm), the new HP logo, an infrared camera that enables Windows Hello authentication and an edge-to-edge display that sadly supports only one resolution: FHD (1080p). HP retained the 360 degree hinge from previous generations. By tightening the design and beefing up some of the specs with enough battery to match, HP is trying to convince consumers that it’s more than just an alternative to the Macbook Pro, but a unique system that’s capable in its own right. Similarly, to how the XPS 13 brought life back to Dell (and sent waves through the review industry for being a great laptop), HP is trying to push the x360 to its limits. It could gain respect in the public eye by not only having a 360-degree hinge, but looking good, charging fast and having the latest chips. On the side, two new Thunderbolt 3 ports have been added. These are disguised as USB Type-C jacks, allowing the upcoming flurry of USB-C devices will have a native, high-speed place to connect. It’s a trend that most PC manufacturers are adopting and is welcomed. A bigger, 57.8Wh battery with fast charging (90 minutes to 90% charge) will power the faster NVMe SSD standard (over last year’s SATA tech), which also is getting a size increase up to 1TB. HP is offering the new Spectre x360 today, starting at $1,049.99. The entry-level model only nets you a Core i5 processor, but a Core i7-7500U upgrade option exists (clocked at 2.7 GHz, up to 3.5 GHz). In the coming weeks, I’ll get my hands on a unit and will report back on whether or not these changes make for a viable convertible laptop/ultrabook. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase HP Software Founded 2015 Overview HP Software is the software segment of HP and has been named by Software Magazine as the 3rd largest software company in the world in total software revenue.

Reprints Reprints Most Popular Intel has a new explanation for the famous scowling "Phelps face" from last summer's Olympics – inadequate processing power. That's the basis for a new series of ads pairing the world's fastest swimmer with the world's slowest computer, and with Jim Parsons of "Big Bang Theory" and Intel fame. Mr. Phelps' scowl was originally captured on camera as his rival Chad le Clos of South Africa warmed up by shadow boxing in an apparent effort to distract or intimidate him before August's 200-meter butterfly competition in Rio. Mr. Phelps won anyway, and the face became a social media meme. Intel hopes to ride some ripples from that #PhelpsFace wave in new ads from McGarryBowen breaking online this week and on TV Oct. 17 during "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" on CBS. The new ads back Intel's recently launched Seventh Gen procesor. The idea originally came during a different Olympic moment, said Intel Chief Marketing Officer Steven Fund, when Mr. Phelps was "watching himself swim, looking at the image through a very old computer. And we came up with the idea of the world's fastest swimmer on the world's slowest computer." Intel reached out to Mr. Phelps through his agent during the games, shot the ad and related social media content shortly thereafter, and, Mr. Fund said, "Got on air I think before anyone else has done anything with him post-Olympics." Mr. Phelps was already a fairly prolific endorser for, among others, Under Armour, Omega and 800razors.com (an online razor retailer he's also an investor in). Mr. Fund, himself a former global marketing director on Procter & Gamble Co.'s Gillette, saw him as a good fit for Intel as well. The message is basically the same one Mr. Parsons has been delivering: It's time to upgrade your computer. And Mr. Parsons has been so effective, Intel had no interest in walking away from him for the new ads either. With a PC processor market share of more than 87%, something that beats even his alma mater Gillette in razor blades, Intel's primary focus is growing the PC category rather than market share, Mr. Fund said. Over recent years, people have been waiting longer to replace old PCs, he said. "But actually this past year PCs have stabilized, and there was in fact just data published by IDC that shows PCs have grown for the first time year over year." Indeed, both IDC and Gartner data showed the North American PC market growing in the second quarter after five quarters of declines. "I'd like to say most of it is the marketing," Mr. Fund said. "The Parsons campaign is our best advertising ever. We test everything at Intel. It's got great breakthrough. It's very clear on message, and persuasion metrics are very strong." He declined to disclose spending, but said the new Phelps-Parsons effort will get significant weight both online and on TV. Intel's in-house Agency Inside has joined McGarryBowen in creating social content for the broader effort, with OMD handling media.

Unlike hobbyist drones, the Falcon 8+ system is meant for a range of commercial applications including industrial inspection, surveying, and mapping. It also features the triple-redundant AscTec Trinity autopilot system, which Intel says can provide "detailed images down to millimeter accuracy, offering valuable structural analysis that detects and prevents damage to infrastructure." The foundation for the Falcon 8+ is the German-made AscTec Falcon 8, which Intel now owns after acquiring Ascending Technologies in January. At the time, Intel said it bought the German drone maker for its auto-pilot software, algorithms, and sensors, which work in concert with Intel's 3D depth camera RealSense. These technology components are now coming to life inside the Falcon 8+ to give Intel a boost in the booming drone market, which is estimated to have total addressable value of more than $127 billion, according to a report in May by PwC. The industrial drone space, which Intel is targeting with the Falcon, has an estimated value of more than $45 billion just in itself. The thriving drone market prompted Intel's $60 million investment last year in Yuneec Aviation, a Hong Kong-based firm known for products including the single-seat electric E-Spyder aircraft and the Typhoon multi-copter series. It also spurred the chipmaker's September acquisition of Movidius, makers of specialized computer sensing and vision technology. "Drones are an important computing platform for the future, and Intel is positioning itself at the forefront of this opportunity to provide the compute, sensor, communications, and cloud integration for the growing drone ecosystem," said Josh Walden, VP and GM of Intel's New Technology Group. "Intel is focused on continuing to create innovative new technologies and to lead in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) segment -- especially in the commercial space." Intel did not reveal pricing or availability details of the drone, but odds are it won't come cheap.

Read More In spite of the weight drop, the new model packs a larger 57.8W battery, which along with fine-tuning for Intel's Kaby Lake processors will offer up to 15 hours of battery life, according to HP. It has also added an infrared camera to the device, bringing support for Microsoft's Windows 10 Hello facial login. Dual-array mics have also been optimized to support Cortana's voice-control features, while there are now four rather than two speakers. The laptop also features a backlit keyboard, two USB-Type C ports with Thunderbolt 3 support and one USB-Type A 3.0 port. The Spectre x360 laptop will be available with Intel's new generation i5 or i7 processors, solid state storage of up to 1TB, and up to 16GB of RAM. It will be available on October 12 starting at $1,050. The refreshed 13.3-inch ENVY laptop is a handsome piece of hardware in a metal finish, but lacks the finer trimmings of the Spectre x360. It's also $200 cheaper. At 14mm thick and weighing 3.15lbs, the ENVY is now actually thicker and heavier than its predecessor but, perhaps offsetting this, a bigger battery offers up to 14 hours of battery life, equal to four more hours. It features dual speakers, a backlit keyboard, two USB 3.0 ports, and one USB Type-C port. The laptop will be available with new generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, up to 1TB solid state storage, and up to 16GB RAM. It will also be available with a QHD display, if customers want to add touch. The ENVY will go on sale on October 26, starting at $850. And, just ahead of Microsoft's rumored Surface all-in-one launch in the next fortnight, HP has introduced its ENVY all-in-one with a 27-inch QHD display. Its camera with IR support also enables Windows Hello. This will be available in October, starting at $1,299.99, with up to 256 GB solid state storage or a two terabyte hard disk and sixth-generation Intel i5 or i7 quad-core processors. $300 (or less) laptops for work and play SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 5 NEXT PREV Read more about the latest laptops The best Linux laptop: The 2016 Dell XPS 13 HP updates ProBook 400 series with five new business laptop models Six months with the Surface Pro 4: Patches, lappability, and battery life are key Join Discussion Powered by Livefyre Add your Comment Related Stories Mobility Samsung gives Black Friday sneak peek of laptop, Galaxy tablet deals Mobility Snapchat confidentially filed for IPO: Report Mobility Apple to offer two 5.5-inch iPhone models in 2017: Report Mobility Google launches PhotoScan for iOS, Android to turn print into digital photos × Thank You Please review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription I agree to the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and Video Services Policy.

Comments By John Ribeiro Follow IDG News Service | Oct 12, 2016 3:47 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Robotics Computer Processors IT Industry Emerging Technology Comments Intel has introduced a company-branded commercial drone, the Falcon 8+, for North American markets, with the aim to lead in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market, particularly in the commercial segment. The chip maker has been looking at new opportunities for its silicon and other technologies outside its traditional markets like PCs, more so after its lackluster performance in the smartphone market. It has already dabbled in the consumer drone market through Yuneec's Typhoon H, which uses Intel's RealSense computer vision platform for intelligent obstacle navigation. Intel also introduced the Intel Aero Platform for developers to build their own drones. The opportunity for Intel is that many countries, including the U.S., are slowly liberalizing rules for the use of commercial and consumer drones. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration announced rules in June for the commercial use of drones, but its provisions, such as a line-of-sight restriction on the use of the UAVs, fell short of industry demands for permission to fly multiple drones beyond line-of-sight under control of a single operator. Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich heads an FAA advisory committee to advise it on policy measures going forward for the integration of unmanned aircraft systems in the national airspace. The total addressable value of drone powered applications in all applicable industries is estimated at more than $127 billion, according to a report in May by PwC. The industry with the best prospects for drone applications is infrastructure, with total addressable value of just over $45 billion, according to the study, which bases its estimate on the 2015 value of businesses and labor in each industry that may be replaced by drone-powered applications. Intel has been making a number of investments to boost its capabilities in drones. It said in January it was acquiring Ascending Technologies, a designer of drones with auto-pilot software in Krailing, Germany. Last month, the chip maker said it would acquire Movidius, a designer of low-power and high-performance SoC (system-on-a-chip) platforms for accelerating computer vision applications, which supplies chips to drone makers like DJI. The Intel Falcon 8+ builds up on the AscTec Falcon 8 from Ascending Technologies, and is the first Intel-branded commercial drone, wrote Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, in a blog post. The V-form octocopter, with full electronic system redundancy covering batteries, communications and sensing, is outfitted for industrial inspection, surveying and mapping for professionals and experts, according to Intel. The Falcon 8+ is powered with AscTec Trinity technology, which is a triple-redundant autopilot with three redundant inertial measurement units that compensate for external influences like electromagnetic fields or strong winds. It also comes with a redesigned tablet-based mobile ground station called Intel Cockpit, with a joystick for single-handed flight control and a water-resistant user interface, and Intel Powerpack smart batteries as the power supply. The UAV, which measures 768 x 817 x 160 millimeters and has a take-off weight of 2.8 kilograms, “provides detailed images down to millimeter accuracy and gives valuable structural analysis that helps users detect and prevent further damage to infrastructure,” Walden wrote. The Intel Falcon 8+ system was announced Tuesday by the company at the 2016 INTERGEO drone conference in Hamburg. No details on pricing and availability were provided.

The Falcon 8+ system is a complete package designed for "industrial inspection, surveying, and mapping," and is built around an octocopter manufactured by Intel subsidiary Ascending Technologies The drone's rotors are arranged in AscTec's patented V-formation, and the craft can reach speeds of up to 35 miles per hour — faster than most amateur drones. Its makers promise all sorts of features designed to appeal to professional pilots, including back-up batteries and communication systems built into the drone itself. The system also ships with the Intel Cockpit, a weatherproof controller with twin joysticks and an integrated Intel tablet, with the whole system ready to fly right out of the box. The Intel Cockpit (top) and Intel's Falcon 8+ drone (bottom). (Image credit: Intel) This is just the latest data point in the story of Intel's burgeoning drone hobby. The company acquired Ascending Technologies, a German manufacturer of commercial drones, back in January, and then later this year bought Movidius, a maker of specialized computer vision chips used by both quadcopters and Google's Project Tango. Intel also manufactures its own chips and camera systems for drones based on its RealSense tecnhnology and is a major investor in Chinese dronemaker Yuneec, the primary rival of industry behemoth DJI. That's certainly a varied list of interests, but as indicated by the Falcon 8+, it seems Intel is primarily focused on commercial applications. Unlike the hobbyist market, where DJI controls 70 percent of sales, the industrial sector is not yet dominated by any one company. DJI and Yuneec both make their own commercial drones, but so do bigger companies like Sony. Just because it's not going up against DJI, doesn't mean Intel isn't flying into some crowded skies.

Intel has unveiled its first fully Intel-branded drone, dubbed the Falcon 8+. It’s designed for industrial jobs, like on big construction sites where it might take a human hours to walk around to complete a field inspection. The Falcon 8+ weighs only six pounds and flies faster than most hobby drones on the market, able to reach speeds up to 35 miles per hour. This isn’t Intel’s first foray into drones. The company partnered with Ascending Technologies, which it later acquired, to refine its 360-degree depth-perception cameras for collision avoidance. The cameras are now used in the commercial AscTec Falcon 8, the predecessor to Intel’s 8+, as well as Yuneec’s Typhoon H drone, which is also intended for commercial or professional hobbyist drone pilots. The drone is controlled with a waterproof cockpit equipped with a joystick and tablet, which is much more robust than consumer drones that interface with smartphones. Unlike with hobbyist drones, where DJI already accounts for 70 percent of the market, the commercial and industrial drone scene doesn’t yet have a single dominant drone maker. 3DR, which once touted itself as the leading drone company in the U.S., is now completely switching to building drones for commercial applications. And other drone makers, like Yuneec, Kespry and DJI all have commercial-grade offerings, too. It may feel odd to see Intel not just churning out chips and microprocessors anymore, but the company has been hard at work building all kinds of gadgets in recent years besides drone technology. In 2014 Intel acquired Basis Science and released a smartwatch with the company, but that watch was recalled this August after several accounts of the wearable burning people’s wrists. And the same month, Intel shared its new virtual reality headset, Project Alloy, but no shipping date has been announced. Intel never became as dominant a player in the smartphone game as it is in home computer components. But with home computer sales in a steady decline in recent years, the company has been looking for ways into new devices, and one way to do that is to put its brand on new products to advertise its technology — in this case, not only to consumers but other drone makers, too. Amazon and Google have been branding their own consumer products as well. Still, full hardware systems aren’t what Intel is known for. And if its complete ready-to-fly drone doesn’t take off, the company may still find its depth-sensor technology inside other drone makers’ machines, and that’s not a bad position to be in. Here’s a video of Intel’s collision avoidance system helping a drone navigate through a wooded forest.

It’ll do that with its new Intel Falcon 8+ drone system, which is getting its official unveiling today at the 2016 INTERGEO drone conference in Hamburg. The Intel Falcon 8+ is something of a next-generation follow up to the AscTec Falcon 8. Meant for a range of commercial applications including industrial inspection, surveying, and mapping, the Falcon 8+ drone offers full electronic system redundancy, along with what Intel and AscTec are calling “best-in-class sensors.” When those sensors are combined with the waypoint automation systems present on the Falcon 8+, Intel says the drone is capable of providing “detailed images down to millimeter accuracy, offering valuable structural analysis that detects and prevents damage to infrastructure.” However, the Falcon 8+ is only one part of the overall package here, as the drone also comes with Intel’s Cockpit controller. Water resistant and – judging by the images Intel is sharing of this thing – seemingly built to take some abuse, the Cockpit pairs with an Intel-based tablet to give drone operators an easy way to plan, execute, and monitor flights, capable of live streaming in up to 1080p. Finally, the Falcon 8+ ships with the Intel Powerpack, which comes equipped with a storage mode, automatic balancing, and a set of LED lights to indicate battery charge. Unfortunately, Intel didn’t share details on how long users can expect the Powerpack to last while it’s powering the Falcon 8+. The Falcon 8+ drone system will be launching next month, but Intel has yet to announce any kind of pricing information for the package. Considering what’s included in the system and the fact that Intel is explicitly targeting commercial applications with this release, though, it probably isn’t a good idea to expect the Falcon 8+ to come in on the lower end of the pricing spectrum.

Comments By Agam Shah Follow IDG News Service | Oct 11, 2016 10:48 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Data Storage Servers Data Center Enterprise Applications Computer Processors Comments After years of being offered as separate technologies, storage and memory are beginning to merge. It's already happening, for example, with 3D Xpoint, a technology from Intel and Micron that can serve as memory, storage, or both. Now, a new consortium, called Gen-Z, is out to ease the transition to this new class of storage and memory in computers. It's creating a new specification and architecture that will make it easier to add new forms of non-volatile memory to computers. Gen-Z will have a new connector, fabric and data transfer protocol. One goal is to create an open standard so new forms of memory can communicate with processors and accelerators in a coherent manner. Gen-Z will also work with SSDs like QuantX from Micron. Data transfer speeds for the new specification will be tens to hundreds of gigabytes per second, much faster than the speed of the upcoming PCI-Express 4.0, which offers 32GBps. Gen-Z's data-transfer speed will be finalized by the time the specification is released at the end of this year. The new architecture will be targeted at servers and data centers first; it's not certain whether it will come to PCs. Usually, server technologies ultimately trickle down to PCs. Gen-Z consortium members include top server companies IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Dell and Lenovo, and storage and memory vendors Samsung, Seagate, Micron, Western Digital and SK Hynix. Sitting out of the consortium is Intel, which hasn't always played well with other hardware makers on industry standards. The chip maker has nothing to lose by joining the open organization, but seemingly wants to protect its own server technologies. The Gen-Z architecture and technology can be used both outside and inside the server, said Robert Hormuth, chief technology officer for servers at Dell EMC. At its highest speed, Gen-Z could be connected as a point-to-point bus in a server enclosure. It could also be used to connect servers, storage and memory arrays in a rack, Hormuth said. In a way, Gen-Z is designed for the data centers of the future, where memory, storage and processors will be pooled in separate boxes. Today, servers come with storage, memory and processing in one box, and that's a limitation. It will be possible to decouple them into separate boxes with Gen-Z as a connector. Larger pools of storage, memory and processing can be dedicated to each discrete box. That will help applications like SAP HANA, which relies on in-memory processing. New forms of DRAM and flash storage replacements like MRAM (magnetoresistive RAM), RRAM (resistive RAM) and PCM (phase change memory) are under development, and Gen-Z will make it easier to add those technologies to servers.  But memory experts expect DRAM to last for up to a decade, and DDR5 is already under development. But Gen-Z faces challenges. Intel accounts for more than 90 percent of server chip shipments today, and could block the adoption of Gen-Z. Consortium members like ARM and IBM are trying to break that dominance, but have failed. If the specification does gain adoption, however, it could play a role in breaking Intel's server dominance. Gen-Z said all hardware makers are welcome, and it wouldn't cost Intel anything to join. Intel declined to answer questions on why it wasn't joining Gen-Z. "We have offered high-performance coherent interconnects and industry standard memory, I/O, and accelerator interfaces on our CPUs for decades. This provides our customers with the best combination of choice, performance, and total cost of ownership," an Intel spokesman said in an email. The industry-standard technologies Intel is referring to are now aging and being replaced by faster I/O, memory and storage technologies. But considering that Intel dominates servers, it is also driving technology adoption. Intel is also releasing new storage, memory and I/O technologies for servers, which are all proprietary. Gen-Z is an open specification, and will be compatible with 3D Xpoint, which will form the basis for Intel's upcoming Optane storage and memory products. But Intel is trying to protect its own OmniPath technology, a proprietary architecture and interconnect, which Gen-Z will compete against. Intel is also pushing silicon photonics in order to wire up servers in data centers. Aside from Intel, all major server, storage and memory makers are banding together to make Gen-Z work. A lack of cooperation between Intel and server makers like Dell and HPE on Gen-Z could create a stalemate of technology adoption in servers and the computing industry at large.

Image: wavebreakmedia/Shutterstock Siliconrepublic.com looks at a number of major tech companies as the battle to narrow the gender gap in the workforce continues to take priority on Ada Lovelace day. Hundreds of years after Ada Lovelace’s birth, the world is only recently coming around to celebrating her impact on modern society. Widely regarded as the world’s first ‘computer programmer’, Lovelace’s fingerprints are all over the modern, digital age. The daughter of renowned poet Lord Byron, Londoner Lovelace was born in 1815 and quite quickly excelled at maths. Working with famed inventor Charles Babbage, occasionally referred to as the father of the computer due to his work on the difference engine, Lovelace’s translation of some of his work lead to some early programming language. She received little fanfare during her life, but as computers and their importance continued to prove stronger and more obvious, Lovelace has been celebrated to a greater degree – often as a way of highlighting the female impact on programming. Here we look at some of the major tech companies operating around the world, and how they’re trying to narrow the gender gap in their workforces. Accenture The Accenture diversity report for 2015 appears to show, overall, that the company is doing significantly better than many tech companies, with 35.8pc of its employees being women. Looking at an executive level, its breakdown on gender lines appears to be relatively similar to non-executive roles, with women taking 31.3pc of executive-level roles. However, a considerable majority of its executives are white (63.3pc). Intel The latest Intel diversity report shows an increase in the number of women and minorities in employment, but not as big an increase as would have been hoped. Last year, Intel announced a $300m fund to tackle its diversity problem, with company CEO Brian Krzanich describing it as a “bold statement” at the time. Intel’s 2015 report showed women globally made up 51.9pc of its non-technical workforce, and 20.3pc of its technical workforce. With more detail in its US operations, females represented 24.8pc, up an impressive 5.4pc on 2014. The US technical workforce stood at 20.1pc female, up 5.8pc on 2014. However, its overall representation of women among its US staff has increased by only 0.6pc in the past year, while the number of women in its newest recruits has actually fallen by 0.1pc since 2015. Apple Apple’s global workforce currently consists of 32pc women, up 1pc on last year. Women hold 23pc of technical positions – up 1pc from a year ago – and 28pc of leadership positions. Apple also said in its annual diversity and inclusion report that it had closed pay gaps over the last year. Google “Women now comprise 31pc of all Googlers, and we’ve seen strong growth of women in technical and leadership roles,” said Google in this summer’s report. “Similar to last year, one in five of our technical hires in 2015 were women, helping bring the total number of women in technical roles from 18pc to 19pc. Additionally, women now hold 24pc of leadership roles across Google—up from 22pc.” Facebook In July, Facebook issued a ‘diversity update’ that showed gradual improvements in hiring and retention scenarios at the company. In the US, 27pc of leadership roles are currently taken up by women. However, hiring rates were at 29pc in the past year which brought that original 27pc up from 23pc a year previously. Globally, 33pc of Facebook’s entire operation is made up of women, one of the higher figures in the tech industry. Amazon 39pc of Amazon’s overall employees and 24pc of its management workforce are female. “A review of the compensation awarded in 2015 at Amazon – including both base and stock – resulted in women earning 99.9 cents for every dollar that men earn in the same jobs,” said the company.

Co. Ltd. How this chip giant is adopting a strategy that has worked very well for a fellow chip maker. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Oct 11, 2016 at 8:21AM Image source: Intel.  Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and contract chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) are the two largest manufacturers of logic semiconductors (in other words, chips that aren't memory) in the world. Intel's business model has traditionally been to focus on designing, manufacturing, and selling its own products (mainly high-performance processors for personal computer and data center applications) on the most advanced technologies available to it. TSMC, on the other hand, manufactures all kinds of chips for an extremely wide variety of customers and applications across a range of manufacturing technologies -- from cutting edge to technologies that first went into production more than a decade ago.  Both business models have been wildly successful, and as of writing, both TSMC and Intel sport very similar market capitalizations ($155 billion for TSMC, $182 billion for Intel). That being said, there is one way Intel appears to be trying to mimic TSMC. Some background on Intel's prior strategy Historically, Intel's game plan with respect to chip manufacturing technology has been to develop a new manufacturing technology and then move the bulk of its shipment volumes to that new technology as quickly as possible. The idea behind this strategy is actually quite simple. Intel says each successive manufacturing technology generation delivers a lower cost per transistor (a chip is made up of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of transistors), so it makes sense from an economic perspective to do this. Additionally, newer manufacturing technologies offer better performance/power characteristics, which helps make products more appealing. Despite all of this, based on both disclosures from Intel as well as leaks surrounding Intel's future products, it would appear that the company no longer intends to pursue the strategy of "moving as much volume over to the newest manufacturing technology as quickly as possible." How Intel is changing gears -- and why During the first half of 2018, I expect Intel's product line to look something like this: Category Product Name Manufacturing Tech. Low-cost PC Gemini Lake 14-nanometer Ultrabook/2-in-1 PC Cannon Lake 10-nanometer High-performance notebook Coffee Lake 14-nanometer Mainstream desktop Coffee Lake 14-nanometer High-end desktop Skylake-X 14-nanometer Server/data center Skylake-EN/EP/EX 14-nanometer Data source: BenchLife.info. Note that Intel will have only transitioned one product line (albeit a high-volume one) to its 10-nanometer technology; the rest of the company's product stack will be manufactured in some variant of the company's 14-nanometer technology, which first went into mass production in the second half of 2014. I don't expect Intel will transition the bulk of its microprocessor volume to 10-nanometer until the first half of 2019. Then, after that, I would expect Intel to repeat that strategy by transitioning its ultra-low-power products to 7-nanometers while keeping the bulk of its processor shipments on some variant of its 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Why is Intel doing this? I believe the answer lies in the fact that Intel's claims of lower cost per transistor are normalized for manufacturing yields. That is, those cost-per-transistor figures assume a similar level of technological maturity between the newer manufacturing technology and the older-generation technology. However, the reality is that Intel seems to be facing increasing difficulties in ramping its latest manufacturing technologies up at high yield rates. For some product segments (e.g., anything in which battery life is critical), Intel really needs the power-saving benefits of newer manufacturing technologies, so the company has little choice but to transition to those new technologies, regardless of yields. However, some products aren't as power-sensitive (e.g., desktops), so Intel can afford to do what it's doing with its upcoming Coffee Lake part and simply implement a newer architecture in a more mature manufacturing technology. This has the effect of keeping a large portion of its chip shipments on a more cost-effective technology, which helps to balance out the negative margin impact from transitioning some of its products to newer manufacturing technologies. Moreover, with a large base of revenue coming from "mature" technologies, Intel can more quickly advance key performance/power-sensitive product lines to next-generation manufacturing technologies while minimizing the impact of those products to overall gross profit margins. This is exactly how TSMC does it One of the reasons TSMC has been able to so quickly transition to newer manufacturing technologies is precisely the fact that it has so much highly profitable business on older manufacturing technologies to pick up the slack, as one can see below: Image source: TSMC. Even today, less than a quarter of TSMC's revenue comes from shipments of chips on its 16-nanometer and 20-nanometer technologies combined. This means even if TSMC is taking it on the chin with respect to the margins on those technologies (and TSMC has indicated that it takes a while for its latest technologies to achieve margins in line with the corporate average), the remaining 77% of its revenue can more than buoy overall gross profit margins. The investment takeaway At the end of the day, Intel's job is to build best-in-class products so that it can keep its average selling prices and market share in key product segments as high as possible. In some of its product segments, rapid adoption of newer manufacturing technology isn't imperative, but in others, it's absolutely critical. By being more selective about the manufacturing technology on which it builds each of its products, Intel can improve its competitive positioning across the board, ultimately helping it maximize its revenue and profitability.

The prices below include VAT. PRICE £699 ($799) £1,679 ($1,949) £1,789 ($2,179) You've got to hand it to Alienware. Despite bearing the brunt of l33t gamer criticism since the Dell buyout in 2006—after all, Alienware machines have tended to resemble something from 12-year-old's high school sketch book—the company has ploughed on, creating increasingly sleek laptops and desktops. Its latest, the squat, mid-size tower dubbed Aurora, is the most desirable Alienware machine yet. Taking cues from the company's gargantuan Area 51, the Aurora sports a surprisingly compact form factor, restrained (for Alienware at least) aesthetics, and a price that's not far off a self-build. It even has decent cooling performance. For the first time in a long time, if a tech-shy relative or PC gaming newbie asks whether or not an Alienware desktop is worth it, you can finally say yes. Standing 472.52mm (18.6 inches) tall, a mere 360.5mm (14.19 inches) deep, and 212mm (8.35 inches) wide, the Alienware Aurora is smaller and wider than your average gaming desktop. Which, given the move towards smaller systems that are just at home in the living room as they are in an office or bedroom, is no bad thing. Indeed, this is probably the first Alienware you could place in a living room, in full view, and not receive cold, hard shame from a loved one. That's partly thanks to the Aurora's flat front panel, which is finished in a sturdy matte black plastic up top, with a non-threatening piano black grille underneath. Older models were somehow both curvier and more angular all at once, which led to some questionable aesthetics. That said, there's still a light-up, RGB LED alien-head power switch, but you can turn it off if you prefer a more subdued look. The Aurora has a unique look that quickly grows on you. [That's the Ars UK office, incidentally -Ed.] The Aurora has a unique look that quickly grows on you. [That's the Ars UK office, incidentally -Ed.] The Alienware head power switch is illuminated, but the lighting can be turned off. On the front panel are four USB sockets, and headphone and microphone jacks. The Aurora's feet. The other side of the Aurora has vents for the graphics card. The Aurora's rear IO, including a lot of USB sockets. The sleeker styling continues with the side panels, which feature a soft grey finish, and the same tri-LED light bars that appear across the Alienware range. The panels aren't flat, and actually arch out from the front panel somewhere, but they look good, neatly avoiding the bulging effect that many PC cases with a similar design suffer from. The left panel also features air intake vents for the graphics card(s) inside. The top of the Aurora features the same glossy grille as the front, as well as a 120mm exhaust fan. If you opt for the all-in-one liquid cooling solution, the radiator mounts here alongside the fan. The asymmetrical top panel also houses a useful carry handle, which makes lugging the Aurora around to LAN parties (they're still a thing, right?) much easier. And at an average weight of 14kg (32lbs), depending on the configuration, it's just about possible to lift it with one hand too. Unfortunately, the reasonable weight comes at the expense of build materials: the entirety of the Aurora's external case is made of plastic. It's a good, solid, quality plastic, but when so many other high-end desktops are being built with premium materials like aluminium and glass, the plastic is a letdown. Indeed, when removed, the side panels make that horrible hollow, rattling sound so reminiscent of pre-built PCs from the '90s. Yes, it's upgradable At least the side panels are easy to remove. While the Aurora might be an off-the-shelf gaming PC, Alienware has made it easy to get inside. On the rear of the case is a plastic handle that, when pulled, ejects the vented side panel revealing a tightly packed interior and a unique layout. Where most PCs have a top- or bottom-mounted power supply, the Aurora saves space by situating the power supply above the motherboard. Just next to the side-panel lever are two sliding switches that unlock the PSU, allowing it to swing up and out from the case, cables still attached. This gives you unfettered access to the CPU-cooler and socket, memory slots (there are four, with two populated by default), and PCIe slots. There's room for two full-length graphics cards, although using two means giving up access to one of the smaller 4X slots. There's an M.2 slot for PCIe-based NVMe storage like a Samsung 960 Pro, two 2.5-inch tool-free sleds for standard SSDs, and a single 3.5-inch hard drive slot, which sits just under the PSU. These should provide enough storage options for most users, though it isn't a great setup for anyone looking to store vast amounts of data. Pull this lever and the side panel pops off. Pull this lever and the side panel pops off. The power supply is uniquely mounted above the motherboard. It sits on a hinge that flips out, giving you access to all the internals. With the graphics card out you can access the M.2 slot and SATA sockets. The RAM, GPU, and M.2 SSD removed. The flip-out PSU in all its glory. Another look inside. This particular system came with an all-in-one liquid cooling system. The SSD and RAM that the Aurora uses. The one thing you can't do is replace the motherboard. It's standard proprietary Dell fare—although it does appear close to mATX size—with little in the way of easy access. Cable management is good though, with cables neatly tied into position along the sides of the bare steel case. This particular configuration comes with a modular 850W power supply, but Alienware pre-wires any extra cables you might need into their relevant positions. There are spare SATA power connectors near the 2.5-inch bays, for example, and there's an extra PCIe power connector, should you wish to add another graphics card. With such a unique configuration, you might be wondering how the Aurora handles airflow. The good news is that despite the location of the PSU, I didn't experience any throttling problems. The 120mm fan at the front pulls in cool air, with the top-mounted radiator and fan exhausting air out of the case. Meanwhile, the (blower-style) graphics card sucks in cool air from the grilles on the side panel. There isn't a removable fan filter on the grille, which means you've got to lug the whole side panel around in order to clear out any dust. I also wonder how well the Aurora would do with an air cooler (as is featured in certain configs) instead of the all-in-one. I suspect overclocking would be out of the question.

The chip is significant as "the industry’s first 14nm FPGA," but not only that - it is based upon a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 processor with integrated HBM2 in-package, using Intel HyperFlex architecture. At IDF16, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich described the Stratix 10 as "a beast," in reference to its performance and density. It is boldly claimed that the Stratix 10 "will revolutionize the performance of data centres and networking infrastructures". The new FPGA is expected to enable service providers, data centres, cloud computing and storage systems "to satisfy their insatiable demand for higher computational capabilities, lower latency, greater system flexibility and increased power efficiencies". Intel broke down the advances and appeal of the new Stratix 10 into handy bullet-point chunks as follows: 2X the core performance and over 5X the density compared to the previous generation. Up to 70 per cent lower power than Stratix V FPGAs for equivalent performance. Up to 10TFLOPS of single-precision floating point DSP performance. Up to 1TBps memory bandwidth with integrated High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM2) in-package. Embedded quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 processor. FPGAs could be of particular utility value in the data centre, thinks Intel. Their ability to be "reconfigured in milliseconds to accelerate individual tasks," can provide significant improvements in performance and power efficiency over new and changing workloads. In bandwidth-intensive applications, such as delivering triple-play traffic, Stratix 10 FPGAs can enable an efficient, bandwidth-rich infrastructure. For further detailed information on the Stratix 10 you can download the white paper (PDF), and/or watch the Introducing Stratix 10 FPGAs and SoCs, and the Stratix 10 Architecture videos.

Many people are taking notice of this new wave of innovation – and the impact it could have at both a consumer and corporate level. Even Her Royal Highness has addressed the matter, introducing changes which enable driverless cars to be insured under ordinary policies in the Queen’s speech earlier this year. The UK government has also demonstrated the country’s commitment to furthering the development of the driverless car economy. This summer, a major consultation was launched to support automated vehicle technologies and smooth the path towards automated cars being used successfully on British roads. >See also: The government and automotive industry must not risk neglecting the security essentials in their push for innovation The government and automotive industry must not risk neglecting the security essentials in their push for innovation. Doing so could risk not only the success of these new technologies, but also user safety. Intel Security has reported that connected cars are the third fastest-growing technological device after tablets and phones. While the regulatory changes and consultations implemented thus far demonstrate a level of forward thinking that could deliver a huge boost to the UK economy, security must also be considered. As new technology is adopted, cybercriminals constantly attempt to identify new methods to exploit any potential vulnerabilities for financial gain. With the world’s connectivity continuing to grow, the threat landscape continues to expand. Through live demos, Intel Security has proven that it is possible for ransomware attackers to reach their victims through vulnerabilities in auto-entertainment systems in modern vehicles, leaving the driver unable to operate their car unless they pay a ransom. Late last year, Intel began developing the Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) in conjunction with founding members Aeris and Uber. Forming a collaboration of the top security and automotive industry talent worldwide, the board aims to keep one step ahead of cybercriminals and secure potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. While innovation around internet connectivity in vehicles has enabled the addition of exciting new features, including real-time telematics, smart intersections and autonomous driving, it does open up a new avenue to lucrative hacks for cybercriminals. Built-in security solutions must be factored in from the start to ensure that next-generation cars can operate safely at their full potential, even within a potentially malicious operating environment. Security by design The consolidation and interconnection of vehicle systems requires an intentional, proactive security design. As a result, vehicle security needs to begin at the very start – in the design phase. Foundational principles taken from related industries, such as defence and aerospace, can be utilised. These include designing secure systems from hardware to the cloud with identified best practices and technologies for each particular building block and defence-in-depth, a process similar to the layers of protection analysis (LOPA) methodology used for safety and risk reduction. Security by design should also consider areas such as secure boot, trusted execution environments, message authentication, tamper protection, isolation of safety critical systems, network encryption, data privacy, behavioural monitoring, anomaly detection, and shared threat intelligence. Automotive security must not just start with design, but should move through to the production and operation stages. By implementing best practices throughout production processes, design components can be correctly incorporated and linked back to the properties outlined in the secure design. This can offer customers confidence in the security of the platform. Key best practices here include code reviews, continuous validation of security assumptions, component and system-level penetration tests, inbound and outbound materials processes, maintenance and upgrade plans, and a feedback loop for continuous learning and improvement. Secure transport Threat analysis and risk assessment must continue once cars are on the road. Old vulnerabilities can be patched and new ones can appear – the risk of an attack can even increase over time. Both consumers and manufacturers can feel confident if detailed incident response plans are in place in case a newly discovered vulnerability or security breach arises. Using techniques such as over-the-air software or firmware patches and upgrades enables manufacturers to quickly remove vulnerabilities and significantly reduce recall costs. In addition, threat intelligence aids the identification and understanding of potential criminal business models, enabling businesses to prioritise threats and their associated risks while implementing an appropriate incident response. The success of these operational measures requires secure chains of trust to be built into the vehicle, designed to last throughout its lifetime. >See also: The future of driverless cars and data security Automotive security best practices today are a combination of product safety and computer security. . In addition to ensuring cyber attacks are difficult to execute, preventive and mitigation techniques must be in place to detect and correct vulnerabilities quickly before too much damage is done. Ultimately, the Automotive Security Review Board aims to help create an environment in which cars can self-heal – detecting malicious intent, withstanding attacks and performing self-repair where necessary. With increased collaboration between the automotive industry, standards organisations and security experts, this vision can become a reality.   Sourced from Raj Samani, CTO EMEA, Intel Security Related Topics connected cars Security Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular Teenager admits hacking TalkTalk Ignorance is not bliss when your data has been hacked or stolen Why objective testing is critical to the super-fast 5G future The future of smart power in the smart city Work from anywhere with cloud document management The path to manageable data Wine cellar, swimming pool and a treehouse: Inside Zoopla’s new office The smart nation: Singapore’s masterplan Turning big data into high-class insights Rolling into the digital age: inside Rolls-Royce’s tech transformation Products Information Age Magazine Since its launch in 1995, Information Age has been regarded as one of the most respected technology titles in the B2B realm.

Lenovo knows a thing or two about building great business laptops, and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga is no exception. Fusing Intel’s Skylake processors with a 14in WQHD display, this hybrid is designed to flit between laptop and tablet modes with ease – and with a dash of style to boot. Not that the ThinkPad X1 Yoga draws attention to itself. Encased in sheets of matte-black carbon fiber, bar the small pinprick of red afloat in the centre of the keyboard – yes, there’s still a TrackPoint, this is a ThinkPad after all – the X1 Yoga is relentlessly monochromatic. There’s still something reassuringly utilitarian in its simplicity. And crucially for a 14in laptop, it’s thin and light. Weighing 1.27kg and measuring a slender 16.8mm thick, it’s lighter than many 13.3in laptops. What’s more, it’s MIL-SPEC rated for toughness. The combination of carbon fiber and a metal skeleton make for a business laptop that’s ready to handle considerable punishment. Hybrid trickery By far the X1 Yoga’s greatest talent is that its hybrid trickery doesn’t come at the expense of usability. Unlike the Microsoft Surface Pro 4, say, it’s a great laptop that just happens to turn into a king-sized tablet. Yes, it’s heavy by tablet standards, but even here it has several advantages over some of its peers, not least that the stylus docks invisibly into the X1 Yoga’s right-hand side. When there, it silently charges, but if you happen to exhaust its battery then Lenovo claims a 15-second charge will provide up to 1hr 40mins of use. In truth, it’s hard to find anything to moan about. The backlit keyboard offers the usual ThinkPad quality and, as the X1 Yoga has a 14in chassis, it’s every bit as spacious and comfortable to type on as a desktop keyboard. Personally, I’d still rather have a touchpad with discrete buttons, but Lenovo’s buttonless touchpad is reliable, and you can always resort to the touchpoint if you prefer. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga is more than a superb laptop, though. Tilt back the screen and the solid yet flexible hinge allows you to fold it through 360 degrees and use it in stand, tent or tablet modes.  In tablet mode, the X1 Yoga is in its element. Pull the small stylus out of the right-hand edge, and the matte finish across the display gives a lovely feel to everything from writing to sketching or annotating documents. It’s the most responsive tablet I’ve ever used – and that includes the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – with the Wacom active digitiser and pen technology providing a perfect blend of sensitivity and accuracy. OLED surprise The most unusual twist in the X1 Yoga’s specifications is perhaps the one you’d least expect in a business laptop: that 14in touchscreen also comes in an optional OLED version. Our review unit had the standard IPS touchscreen, but if the OLED panel is up to these standards then expect pure brilliance. The 2,560 x 1,440 panel is so crisp and vivid that I briefly wondered if I was looking at a fake laptop. Desktop icons are suspended on an inky black and colours look gorgeously vibrant. For a while, I wondered if I actually had the OLED model in front of me. Run through the numbers and there’s little to complain about. The panel covers 96.9% of the sRGB colour space, hits a maximum brightness of 296cd/m2, and has a solid – if not class-leading – contrast ratio of 916:1. The clincher here, however, is colour accuracy; not only has Lenovo ensured that the X1 Yoga reproduces almost all the colours you could want, it also delivers the correct shades. An average Delta E of 1.37 is good by any standards, and the maximum deviation of 3.55 isn’t bad at all. The only shortfall is the panel’s inability to delve down into the most intense blues, which is barely noticeable.  Here is a business laptop that’s equally at home with colour-critical applications as it is Excel, which is something of a rarity. Turn of speed  No corners have been cut in the performance department. You get your choice of dual-core Core i5 or Core i7 Skylake processors, stretching up to the 2.6GHz Core i7-6600U in this review unit.  With 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM as standard, you can upgrade that to 16GB on the high-end models for $200. Factor in the choice of everything from bog-standard 128GB SSDs to encrypted Opal 2 drives, right up to blazingly fast 512GB NVMe drives, and you can configure models from $2,299 to almost $4,400. I didn’t find the X1 Yoga wanting for performance. This isn’t especially surprising. With a top-of-the-range Core i7, 8GB of RAM and a ridiculously fast 512GB Samsung NVMe SSD inside, you wouldn’t expect this laptop to be slow. The SSD produces read and write speeds that are super- impressive, sequential read speeds tickling the 2,000MB/sec mark, while write speeds still nudge just over 1,000MB/sec. Boot Windows 10 Pro from cold and it’s mere seconds before you land on the desktop. Oddly enough, the Lenovo didn’t perform quite as brilliantly as I expected in our benchmarks. An overall score of 39 puts it a whisker behind the Dell XPS 13 I tested, which contained Intel’s slightly slower 2.5GHz Core i7-6500U processor. I have a sneaking suspicion that Lenovo’s more aggressive power management might be the issue here.  Having used the ThinkPad X1 Yoga in practice, though, I’m confident this laptop will coast through most tasks without blinking. I’d recommend the 16GB of RAM upgrade if you’re a fan of OS virtualisation, but other than that the specification on test here is a match for most people’s needs. Battery life is respectable, too. With the screen brightness set to 170cd/m2 and Wi-Fi off, the X1 Yoga was able to play a movie constantly for 7hrs 55mins. Use a more aggressive power plan, reduce the screen brightness (even 85cd/m2 is fine for most indoor environments), and you’ll be closing the lid and heading home for the day before having to dig the charger out of your bag. Connectivity and security When it comes to connections, it’s probably easier to begin with what’s missing: USB Type-C. While you could argue this isn’t a big loss for a business laptop – and it’s still far from essential on consumer devices – it’s a connector that you may come to miss in time. But that’s the limit of my criticisms of the X1 Yoga’s connection options. There are three USB 3 ports, a OneLink+ port for adding Lenovo’s various optional docking stations, and you get both HDMI and mini-DisplayPort outputs, too. Factor in the fingerprint reader just beneath the keyboard and the X1 Yoga ticks all the right boxes. This review unit, which is currently the priciest pre-configured model on Lenovo’s site, also partners an Intel 802.11ac Wi-Fi chipset with a Sierra Wireless EM7455 LTE modem that supports the fastest mobile broadband speeds going (up to 300Mbits/sec to be precise). However, you can swap the mobile broadband for an Intel WiGig module, which opens the door to high-speed wireless docking stations. Or you might prefer to drop down to the $2,899 configuration, which loses the mobile broadband and goes one rung down the CPU ladder: it includes a i7-6500U chip, not the i7-6600U we tested. Verdict Lenovo has produced some amazing devices in recent times, so it’s no surprise to see it waltz in and do what it does best: produce another brilliant business hybrid. It isn’t cheap – even in its most modest specification, the X1 Yoga is a cool $2,299 – but you most certainly get what you pay for. The screen is large enough to use all day without yearning for an external monitor; everything from the keyboard to the stylus is faultless; there’s a three-year on-site warranty; and the performance is strong enough to please all but the most demanding users.  Factor in the flexibility on offer and it’s nigh-on unbeatable. If you’re in charge of the IT department, order yours now. If not, start begging the person who is.  Related Reviews Review: Lenovo ThinkCentre X1 Review: Asus Transformer Book Flip TP200SA Review: the HP Spectre x2 can't beat the Surface Pro 4 Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Dishonored 2 blinks back into our hearts Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  convertible  |  hybrid  |  lenovo  |  pc  |  review  |  thinkpad x1 yoga   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Samsung: When the giant trips     Review: HP ZBook Studio G3     Intel's new 600p series NVMe drives get a fantastic price     Adata launches Ultimate SU800SATA 6Gb/s3D NAND SSD     What we know about...

The prices ranging from slightly mad to properly certifiable. As in the past, it falls to motherboard makers to wine and dine consumers to refreshed X99 platforms; which is doubly hard since many “old” X99 motherboards can support Broadwell-E processors with a simply BIOS update. That being said, the refresh-cycle at this level of computing just makes no sense, since those buying X99 based systems often are tech-savvy enough to know that a refresh offers limited performance benefits. That being said, ASUS being ASUS are always ready and willing to dole out some top level motherboards to help make even the most discerning buyer push rationality aside to purchase this R10 000 or $600 ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 motherboard. I’d like to kindly thank ASUS South Africa for sending me a complete sample system from which this motherboard review is derived. If the X99 STRIX Gaming and RAMPAGE V Extreme had a baby If the Rampage V Extreme and X99 STRIX motherboard had a baby, the ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 would be it. The Rampage V Extreme released as a Haswell-E motherboard built for overclocking, but the X99 STRIX Gaming, with all its RGB and “gaming” focus was conceived as their “gaming” Broadwell-E X99 motherboard.  It seems fitting, then, that ASUS positions this Edition 10 (signifying 10 years of producing Rampage motherboards) as their top tier X99 motherboard for breaking records with “overclocking and gaming innovations”. Combining both overclocking and gaming features into a motherboard will be appreciated by enthusiasts, although it seems a bit of a kick in the nuts to Overclockers as ASUS are charging more for an X99 motherboard with one crucially missing overclocking nicety—the venerable OC Panel II, which happens to be bundled in the cheaper  ASUS Rampage V Extreme. But it’s got RGB LED lighting, and that somehow qualifies an extra R2000. Cynicism aside, there are some extra features bundled in that make up that R2000 extra, such as better audio and a dedicated Supreme HiFi DAC bundled with the motherboard. It’s something I could not test personally as the review system I got never included it, however the research I’ve done does seem to sing its praises as a worthy replacement for the PC Panel. That being said, a lot of the function on the OC panel have been moved to the motherboard itself. The look of the motherboard, in all black, does look immaculate and sexy. Unlike the Rampage V Extreme, ASUS borrowed from their STRIX X99 Gaming and has gone stark raving mad about RGB LEDs. Although RGB lighting on an X99 motherboard is tantamount to neon lighting under fast cars, ambiance does play a part in the computing experience. ASUS have produced a beautiful example of RGB lighting that makes you stare in bewildered awe. The RGB control can control each section with RGB lighting, so the I/O, audio, PCI-Express clips, ROG logos, PCB, and rear panel. If you have an ASUS STRIX Graphics card with LED enabled lighting, you can also sync the system with the graphics card, or vice-versa. Other than the omission of the OC Panel and inclusion of the DAC, there are still far too many features for me to state here (which you can see here) but there are important bits to cover. Since it’s the star of the ASUS line-up, there are no immediate compromises made. There are a total of four PCI-Express 3.0 X16, which can be used in various configurations. Bear in mind, since NVIDIA are only rolling around with official support for Pascal 2-way SLI support, it falls to AMD and CrossfireX to officially populate each slot on the Rampage V Edition 10. As for memory support, the Rampage V Edition 10 supports quad-channel memory up to DDR4 3333MHz (OC) and XMP 2.0. Storage is taken care off with 10 SATA 6GB/s ports, as well as 1X U.2 port with PCIe X4 NVME Storage and a 32GB/s M.2 slot located behind the 24-Pin power connector. The rear I/O port is also chock-full of features as you get 4 3.0 USB ports, 2 USB 3.1 Type A ports and two USB3.1 Type C ports. Dual Intel RJ-45 LAN ports and WiFi Antenna jacks means your bandwidth needs are well catered for (not that it means anything in South Africa with our sub-par infrastructure). We also get your regular Clear CMOS and USB BIOS Flashback button with your dedicated USB BIOS Flash port. For those with software-less keyboards (an anomaly for some spending over R10 000 for a motherboard) you also have your dedicated keybot USB port. Audio is take care of by Realtek ALC1150 powered SupremeFX 8- Channel High definition audio. Related:   ASUS ROG STRIX GTX 1080 OC Review: Aura-inspiring Software & BIOS Diving into the BIOS of an ASUS motherboard presents you with a familiar layout and theme, although I would have thought ASUS would have at least given a special black “Edition 10” theme instead of the stock standard “Red/Black/Grey” of the RoG standard. The BIOS of modern ASUS motherboards are well laid out, although I fear most of the uninitiated will feel a bit lost navigating the plethora of options and tweaking ASUS has provided. EZ Mode would be the place those new to extreme motherboards as it has a few basic overclocking profiles to load up, but for those wanting total access to all the nuts and bolts ASUS have painstakingly created for you, Extreme Tweaker is where it’s at. There are voltages to be tweaked, frequencies adjusted and multipliers to play with on top of all the really esoteric options that pro-overclockers can tweak to squeeze out more performance. ASUS has even gone to the trouble of analysing each core on the CPU to tell you which one is the best performing on the chip (denoted by an asterisk), which means a higher clock can given to that specific core. There are a few more options relating to the multitude of features present in the motherboard, although one of the better features I’ve seen is the memory overclocking presets. ASUS have provided a detailed list of pre-configured memory timings, voltages and frequencies for specific RAM and IC. Other RoG boards also do this (such as my personal ASUS Gene VIII board) but without actually doing some deep research or removing heatsinks to check the RAM modules, you can’t actually determine if you have Samsung memory, Hynix or Micron. On the Rampage V Edition 10, ASUS has added an ingenious IC analyser. Once you follow the steps to determine the type of RAM you have, you can apply the appropriate preset to your memory. Very nifty. Once into Windows, there are also Windows-based tweaking that makes overclocking in Windows dead easy. One can use the solid AI Suite 3 to control even more of your hardware. We have options ranging from basic charging or transfer speeds for devices, all the way to per core or GPU overclocking or determining the CPU VRM Switching frequency for deep tweaking within an OS environment. It’s quite intensive but for the plug and play types you can get the system to create basic fan control profiles or use the one-click 5-Way Optimization by Dual Intelligent Processors 5 to automatically find a stable overclock for your CPU and appropriate fan profile. There is a variety of software included as well, like AURA for RGB lighting, MemTweakIT, GameFirst IV, TurboV Core, KEYBOT II, HomeCloud and Hystream as well as a handful of others not mentioned here; it’s a lot, so visit the website to check the full list. Performance Obviously I took the manual approach to testing the overclocking chops on the 6900K processor, upping the default 3.2GHz to a solid 4.4GHz clock speed. The test system sent by ASUS was the exact same system used to test the ASUS ROG GTX 1080 STRIX OC GPU reviewed earlier this week: Asus ROG Rampage V Edition 10 Motherboard Intel i7 Broadwell-E 6900K @ 4.4GHz 32GB (4x8GB) Corsair LPX DDR4 2133 (13-15-15-28) Corsair Force LE 256GB SSD Cooler Master GX II 650W Cooler Master Nepton  120XL Windows 10 X64 NVIDIA WHQL 372.70 Related:   Alienware Interview at rAge 2016: Eye-Tracking, Government Bureaucracy and Bring Your Own Dell   Overclocking proved to be extremely rewarding with the ROG Rampage V Edition 10, and even my uninitiated X99 hands were able to bring the monstrous i7 6900K to a 4.4GHz overclock with ease. The OC Zone on the motherboard is essentially the OC Panel integrated onto the motherboard, with MemOK to reset a bad memory overclock, an LED Post Code Debugger display as well as your usual Start/Reset buttons. For the more enthusiast inclined, there is an LN2 Jumper, Slow Mode switch, Retry Button, Safe Boot button, voltage read out points and boot device LEDs. There are even switches to disable PCI-Express slots and memory DIMMS, to really assist troubleshooting very quickly. I barely made use of any of these features, but for those in competitions, saving time troubleshooting is the difference between first and last. Something special that only seems to be supported on the Rampage V Edition 10 is ASUS Thermal Control tool, which essentially tries to manage your overclock depending on the temperature and applications you are running. For instance, a high AVX load (editing, video conversion etc) stresses all the cores and may lead to temperature and stability issues. Conversely, a gaming load can be a lot less intensive on the CPU and result in a bit more thermal headroom to overclock the chip a bit further. So, ASUS Thermal Control manages your overclock in the background, increasing your overclock when under specific loads, while decreasing it and managing temperatures when doing strenuous loads. If there was a single issue I had with the board, it was the placement of the M.2 Slot and the proximity of the first PCI-Express 3.0 slot. First off, if you have any graphics card slotted into the first slot, removing or adding an M.2 device is impossible with a longer graphics card. The second issue is that the top most PCI-Express 3.0 slot is far too close to the heatsink and the clip pretty much touches it. Removing a graphics card there was not as carefree as it should be. Otherwise, layout and spacing was excellent; anyone who populates this motherboard enough to make it seem cramped deserves a slow-clap. If you’d like to see what gaming benchmarks are attributed to the motherboard, have a look at the ASUS ROG GTX 1080 STRIX OC review earlier this week. This slideshow requires JavaScript. To give the extra bit of overclocking and benchmarking capabilities, I’d like to point to the way this motherboard’s memory presets can help boost scores and claim those extra HWBot points. Unlike 3DMark Firestrike Ultra, the increase in CPU and memory performance does little to affect the overall score. However, within 3DMark’s Time Spy DX 12 benchmark, the increase in memory bandwidth has an affect in CPU and overall scores—a testament to how efficiently the DX 12 API makes use of extra CPU–centric computational resources and bandwidth.

It may seem easy and fun to make one, but combining your features and genetics together presents a very expensive trip to the hospital, and subsequent 18 years. However, it’s an investment in their and your future, which initially is expensive, but over time will pay it back eventually. The extended metaphor comparing the ROG Rampage V Edition 10 to a baby, however ghastly, is meant to ease you into the idea that buying something made up from two different motherboards (X99 STRIX and Rampage V Extreme) is an expensive endeavour—but one that will reward you in time as you spend time with it, be it in intense workloads, benchmarking or gaming. Share this: Twitter Reddit Facebook WhatsApp Google More LinkedIn Pinterest Telegram Pocket Conclusion It’s a massive cost to get one of the most feature rich benchmarking and gaming boards on the market, one not many can stomach, but for those willing and able to use it properly, it offers you the means to make the highest performing X99 platform to date.

Who knows, but Qualcomm's designed a modem for it Freeze on refrigerants heats up search for replacements Chinese giant Tencent is dipping a toe into the open-source world, with its own hot-patch system for Android apps. As it notes at its newish GitHub repo, its Tinker hotfix framework “supports dex, library and resources update” without the user having to restart the app. It's targeted at app developers: they add the plugin to the build environment for a project's root; edit the build.gradle for the project; make some mods to the apps' subclasses, and make the application itself a subclass of TinkerApplication. Tencent's devs say they have made support for Android Studio Proguard automatic, and Tinker “will also generate the multiDex keep Proguard file for you”. Tencent is following another well-known Chinese developer into the open source world. In September, Baidu published its deep learning models on GitHub. Its other contributions include a file system and an “internet-scale” database. Tinker is Tencent's second public project so far. The company behind WeChat has also offered up a suite of test automation tools, QTAF, with drivers for iOS and Android. Given that it's often described as “secretive”, it will be interesting to watch how Tencent – which in September was nominated as Asia's largest company by market capitalisation – responds to the more boisterous world of open source software. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Baidu Research grills AI models on deep learning Tool aims to reduce machine-training time Baidu peddles PaddlesPaddles, floats open source AI tech Deep learning suite with Python front end China's Google clone Baidu also open-sources its AI blueprints Joins Google and Facebook in trying to grab market share IBM's AI guru leaps over to Brit biz benevolent.ai Drug discovery is benevolent business 4 Comments Baidu tech chief: AI smart enough to take our jobs, not our lives.

That's according to an Australian National University (ANU) survey that's mostly been written up from the press release but which The Reg has considered a little more deeply. The full report, here, lists out the questions from page 24 of the PDF. It finds (“don't knows” are excluded from the reporting) that two-thirds of Australians think the data retention regime is justified and one-third do not. Just one-quarter of respondents could correctly identify Australia's defence budget as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) – around two per cent – with 65 per cent putting the figure at five per cent, 10 per cent, or more than 10 per cent (and 10 per cent panicking that we're spending less than a single per cent). Worry about being caught up in a terrorist incident (which in Australia is a little more likely than having a Galaxy Note 7 catch fire in a pocket) is a near-even split, with 45.5 per cent of Australians “very” or “somewhat” concerned that they or a family member will be a victim of a future attack in Australia; 54.5 per cent aren't worried. The public seems distinctly confused about what to do on the topic of terrorism: 55.7 per cent of the respondents believe the government “could do more” about it; but not if it's going to cost more, because an even higher proportion – 59.7 per cent – believe the government is spending “about the right amount of money” on anti-terrorism measures. Returning to attitudes to data retention, this observation, on page eight of the report, is telling: “When framed as a trade-off between civil liberties and national security, 46 per cent of Australians believe counter-terrorism measures have not gone far enough to protect the country.” In other words – a detail that's missed in the Australian National University's canned statement – the people conducting the survey acknowledge the importance of framing, when considering questions of civil liberties versus national security. The report is the result of a random phone survey of 1,200 respondents, with an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 per cent. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 4 Comments More from The Register Data retention grants still not flowing to Australia telcos Carriers still in the dark about how much they'll get or when ahead of April 2017 deadline 7 Comments IT analyst: Oz census data processed as plain text Data appears to be encrypted in transit, but not at rest 20 Comments Australia's IBM-assisted Census fail burned AU$30 MEEELLION How to spend $10 million A DAY fixing a web site 12 Comments Australia's online Census collapses, international hackers blamed 'Four attacks' on SoftLayer-hosted service 17 Comments IBM botched geo-block designed to save Australia's census Bureau of Stats says spooks signed off IBM's plan, but Big Blue mucked something up 38 Comments Australian national census fails in the IBM cloud UPDATE Online form goes down hard ... and stays down 38 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Google’s Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. had at the end of last year a total of 74,505 employees, about one-third fewer than Microsoft Corp. even though their combined stock-market value is twice as big. Photo-sharing service Instagram had 13 employees when it was acquired for $1 billion by Facebook in 2012. Hiring in the computer and chip sectors dove after companies shifted hardware production outside the U.S., and the newest tech giants needed relatively few workers. The number of technology startups fizzled. Growth in productivity and wages slowed, and income inequality rose as machines replaced routine, low- and middle-income, human-powered work. This outcome is a far cry from what many political leaders, tech entrepreneurs and economists predicted about a generation ago. In 2000, President Bill Clinton said in his last State of the Union address: “America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology.” His economic team trumpeted “the ferment of rapid technological change” as one of the U.S. economy’s “principal engines” of growth. The gap between what the tech boom promised and then delivered is another source of the rumbling national discontent that powered the rise this year of political outsiders Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. The tech-powered disappointment is subtler than the anger caused by the crushing impact of China’s import invasion and the perceived failures of government institutions like the Federal Reserve in guiding the economy. Instead, it stems from the idea that Americans expected larger economic gains from these amazing new machines and the companies that created them, not a widening between the haves and have-nots. “There is a growing sense of frustration that people haven’t seen the progress that their parents and grandparents did,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist whose work has chronicled how technology widens the income gap between rich and poor. “That frustration spills into the political arena.” In 1997, Time magazine named computer-chip maker Intel Corp.’s chief executive, Andrew S. Grove, who died in March 2016, as “Man of the Year.” Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos won in 1999. Companies spent billions of dollars reprogramming their computers for the Year 2000 bug, and profitless dot-com startups won giant valuations from optimistic investors.© David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News The bursting of the dot-com bubble in early 2000, the recession in 2001 and deepening globalization proved to be turning points for the tech economy and its broader impact on American prosperity. U.S. tech companies accelerated the reshuffling of their supply networks to China and elsewhere in Asia, places filled with growth potential and cheap labor. Hardware makers concentrated production overseas to supply U.S. and foreign computer makers. After rising through the 1990s, total employment at computer and electronic firms in the U.S. sank to 1.03 million in August 2016 from 1.87 million in 2001, according to Labor Department statistics. Employment at semiconductor makers fell by half to 359,000 in the same period. In the 1990s, Micron Technology Inc. was a successful example of how far the tech industry reached beyond its nexus in Silicon Valley. Based in Boise, Idaho, Micron was founded by Idaho farmers and businessmen, including the late billionaire J.R. Simplot, who supplied McDonald’s Corp. with most of its frozen french fries and had “MR SPUD” license plates on his pickup truck. Micron’s workforce quadrupled to 18,800 between 1994 and 2000, with the growth overwhelmingly in the U.S. The company fought with Japan in the 1980s to restrict imported memory chips and protect its U.S. base. These days, Micron is a case study in how technology companies have exported jobs to other countries. As of 2013, the most recently disclosed data, Micron had 11,300 workers in the U.S., down from 14,000 in 2000. The company’s non-U.S. workforce surged to 19,600, mainly in China and other Asian nations, from 4,800. Securities filings show that the percentage of employees at Micron who were in the U.S. shrank to 37% from 74% in the same period. The company stopped disclosing the annual percentage in 2014. A Micron spokesman says much of the growth outside the U.S. came from acquisitions. “What we’re doing is replacing more resources there to support the growing customer base—both the multinationals that are leveraging the low labor-cost areas in China, in particular, as well as the indigenous Chinese manufacturers,” Mike Sadler, Micron’s head of sales, told analysts in 2014. He is now Micron’s strategic chief. The Semiconductor Industry Association says semiconductors remain a big U.S. business and are America’s third-largest export, trailing cars and aircraft. Apple Inc. followed a similar path. Co-founder Steve Jobs made it a mission early in his Apple career and after creating NeXT Inc., another computer maker, to revitalize U.S. manufacturing. Macintosh computers rolled off the line at an Apple factory “like a Holiday Inn toaster turns out toasted bagels,” says Brent Schlender, who co-wrote a biography of Mr. Jobs. By the time Mr. Jobs died in 2011, Apple made nearly every one of its products outside America, largely in Asia. Apple halted U.S. manufacturing in 2004 and didn’t resume until 2013, when it began producing Mac Pro personal computers in Austin, Texas. Apple says it employs about 80,000 workers in the U.S., or two-thirds of the company’s overall workforce. About half the U.S. employees have retail jobs. An Apple spokeswoman says it is “creating jobs in new industries like the App Economy,” or apps developed for the iPhone, and is “a major contributor to U.S. manufacturing” by buying American-made components and materials. Mr. Schlender, the Jobs biographer, says it made sense to assemble the iPod outside the U.S. when production began in 2001. “The components were hard to make, and putting them together was a labor-intensive job because everything was so small,” he says. “You had to piece it together by hand.” The computer-hardware exodus spread. International Business Machines Corp., the company that turned computers into a big business, was born in Endicott, N.Y., and built its first factories there. From 2001 to 2015, though, employment in computer and electronics manufacturing in surrounding Broome County fell about two-thirds to 3,055 jobs. Warehouses and transportation companies scooped up some laid-off workers at salaries of less than half those paid in high-tech manufacturing, says Christian Harris, an analyst for the New York State Department of Labor. American tech workers are getting a smaller piece of the economic pie created from what they produce. As of 2014, employee compensation in computer and electronic-parts making was equal to 49% of the value of the industry’s output, down from 79% in 1999, according to the Commerce Department. While other tech jobs have been created in sectors such as software publishing, that growth is smaller than the losses in tech manufacturing. Since 2002, the number of technology startups has slowed, hurting job creation. In a 2014 study, economists Javier Miranda, John Haltiwanger and Ian Hathaway said the growth of tech startups accelerated to 113,000 in 2001 from 64,000 in 1992. That number slumped to 79,000 in 2011 and hasn’t recovered, according to the economists’ calculations using updated data. The causes include global competition and increased domestic regulation, says Mr. Haltiwanger, an economics professor at the University of Maryland. Another problem is that fewer tech companies have gone public, which can enrich early employees and spawn more jobs as companies grow. Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business, says there were 548 initial public offerings of technology-related companies from 2001 to 2015. From 1990 to 2000, by contrast, 1,853 went public. The latest generation of hot tech startups has attracted a mountain of venture-capital funding and gigantic valuations, led by Uber Technologies Inc., which was worth $68 billion as of June. The influx of wealth has created more prosperity in Silicon Valley but exemplifies the economic polarization rippling through America. WhatsApp had more than 450 million users world-wide when Facebook bought the messaging service for $19 billion in 2014, turning founder Jan Koum into a billionaire several times over. At the time of the acquisition, WhatsApp had 55 employees. Economists call the phenomenon “skill-biased technical change.” The spoils of growth go to those few people with skills and luck and who are best positioned to take advantage of new technology. The five largest U.S.-based technology companies by stock-market value—Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Facebook and Oracle Corp.—are worth a combined $1.8 trillion today. That is 80% more than the five largest tech companies in 2000. Today’s five giants have 22% fewer workers than their predecessors, or a total of 434,505 as of last year, compared with 556,523 at Cisco Systems Inc., Intel, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft in 2000. Amazon uses 45,000 small robots at about one-third of its U.S. warehouses to automate order processing. The robots look like bread boxes on wheels, lifting modular shelves stuffed with products and carrying the shelves to workers who pick out pieces. An Amazon spokesman says the company has added about 200,000 employees since it began using the robots in early 2012. Amazon has 268,000 employees world-wide. Robots aren’t dexterous enough yet to identify different sized-packages, pick the right ones and place them safely in boxes, says Mr. Brynjolfsson, the MIT economist. That is the fundamental skill in warehousing. Researchers now are trying to automate that part of the job, too. In coming decades, machines are likely to replace new forms of routine work done by humans. From 1991 to 2001, the number of secretaries declined about 35%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of textile and apparel workers fell 37%. For a long time, those with bachelor’s degrees in science seemed to be safe from automation-related layoffs because their cognitive knowledge was tough for computers to duplicate. Less-educated workers who dispense personal service, such as home health aides or masseuses, also seemed safe. Harvard University economist David Deming estimates that the hollowing-out of work spread to programmers, librarians and engineers between 2000 and 2012. As much as $2 trillion worth of human economic activity could be automated away using existing technologies, such as Amazon’s robots, in coming years, consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates. Knightscope Inc., based in Mountain View, Calif., makes robots that serve as night watchmen. About three dozen are on patrol, including at shopping malls, corporate campuses such as Microsoft’s in Mountain View and the new home arena of the Sacramento Kings. Knightscope clients pay $7 an hour per robot. “Robots don’t complain,” says Stacy Stephens, a Knightscope co-founder and vice president of marketing and sales. “There’s no pension. And there’s no worker’s comp,” he adds.

Russian spy ship ‘Yantar’ (Project 22010) has been loitering in the vicinity of undersea cables in Eastern Med. She left the area of Turcyos-2 cable early on 10th October 2016 and headed south toward IMEWE cable where she arrived at 1700hrs UTC and held station. She searched there until 16th-17th when she moved north again to the vicinity of the UGARIT undersea cable between Syria and Cyprus: View plots with cable overlays: Steffan Watkins HERE New analysis of the search pattern and speeds near the IMEWE cable suggests that she is deploying some large vehicle, either one of her manned submersibles or a large ROV (remote Operated Vehicle) such as Ellipse (Эллипс) or Krylo (Крыло): Position data from Steffan Watkins (Twitter) She has made a series of extremely slow parallel runs on approximately a NNE-SSW line. These runs are usually at less than 1kt which is far slower than would be required for towed sonar. Additionally they are usually preceded by lengthy pauses suggesting a comparatively large vehicle being put into the water. And the ship often remains stationary for very long periods suggesting maintenance, or that the hosted craft (mini-sub or ROV) is active on the sea floor in a single position. Or is rising or sinking very slowly. An ideal gift for Christmas - Covert Shores 2nd Edition. A world history of naval Special Forces, their missions and their specialist vehicles.

It is described variously as a ‘Special Purpose Ship’ and an ‘Oceanographic vessel’ which is a euphemism for a spy ship. She can host two deep submergence submarines for undersea engineering missions. These missions are thought to include cable cutting, laying of bugs and related intelligence missions. The two submersibles are the 3-man pr.16810 "Rus" (AS-37 Russia) and pr.16811 "Consul" (AS-39 Consul) which can dive to 6,000m (20,000ft). The crew are housed in a strong spherical chamber in the center and it is equipped with hydraulic manipulators.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Specialized processors might reignite performance scaling, but they’ll also change the nature of computing forever Specialized processors might reignite performance scaling, but they’ll also change the nature of computing forever By Joel Hruska on October 4, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Modern CPU scaling has largely flatlined, thanks to a combination of scaling challenges, intrinsic limits to silicon performance, and a general shift in the market towards lower power devices. Chip designers who want to continue to push the limits of what computers are capable of need to look to specialized architectures and custom designs. That was the message at the Linley Processor Forum according to Linley Gwennap, principle analyst at the Linley Group. Dean Takahashi covered the event for VentureBeat and reports that Linley’s comments dovetail with the industry trends we’ve seen emerging over the last few years. Companies like Nvidia are marketing their chips as ideal for deep learning and AI calculations. Intel purchased the FPGA manufacturer Altera and has built its own specialty coprocessor hardware, dubbed the Xeon Phi. From IBM’s TrueNorth to Qualcomm’s heterogeneous compute capabilities in the Snapdragon 820, a number of companies are attacking performance problems in a wide variety of ways. Self-driving cars, drone deliveries, and even chatbot AI could transform computing as we know it today  — but not without fundamentally changing how we think about computers. Unintended consequences, industry trends, and power consumption For most of the past 40 years, the story of personal computing was, well, personal. Desktops and laptops were positioned as devices that allowed the customer to rip music, explore the Internet, write, work, game, or stay in touch with family and friends. In the beginning, the hardware that enabled many of these functions was mounted in separate expansion slots or installed in co-processor sockets on the motherboard. Over time, these capabilities were either integrated into the motherboard and CPU socket. Channel I/O and FPU coprocessors went away, as did most independent sound cards. Dedicated GPUs have hung on thanks to intrinsic thermal issues, but on-die graphics solutions from AMD and Intel have improved every single year. There was a simple, virtuous cycle at work: The computer industry collectively delivered faster hardware, consumers bought it, and developers took advantage of it. The initial end to CPU clock scaling went nearly unnoticed, thanks to the widespread availability (and superiority) of dual-and-quad-core chips compared with their single-core predecessors. This cycle has been repeated in smartphones and tablets, but we’ve already seen signs that the rate of improvement is slowing. To demonstrate, here’s a graph of Apple iPhone single-core CPU performance in Geekbench 2 and Geekbench 3. We split the data into two sections to capture how the various iDevices compared over time, and to capture the shift from GB2 to GB3 when the latter became available. We’re using Apple because that company has spent more resources on improving its single-core performance than the various Android SoC developers, which tend to prioritize higher core counts. From 2008 to 2012, single-core CPU benchmark scores in Geekbench 2 increased from 141 on the iPhone 3G to 1602 on the iPhone 5. That’s a nearly 12x improvement in just four years. From 2012 to 2016, Apple’s single-threaded CPU performance improved from 699 to 3500. While this still represents excellent scaling, the net improvement is roughly 5x  — less than half the level of scaling we saw from 2008 to 2012. There are a number of reasons for this. Apple’s CPU designs are maturing and process node shrinks often don’t offer the same degree of improvement. But the other explanation is thermal — smartphones and tablets have hard TDP limits that prevent them from scaling upwards indefinitely. The slideshow below steps through some of the major advances in computing from the 1950s through the present day. How cloud computing changes the equation These limitations drive research in two different, seemingly contradictory outcomes. On the one hand, we’ve seen the smartphone industry integrate sophisticated sensors, DSPs, and other specialized co-processors to provide additional functionality without increasing power consumption. At the same time, there’s been a huge push towards the idea of cloud computing. Whether you’re riding in a self-driving car, conversing with a chatbot, or searching the web, companies like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia have been jumping on the specialized processor bandwagon. IBM has TrueNorth, Google has TensorFlow, and we’ve written about other alternative architectures and methods for solving complex problems at multiple points at ET. AMD is the only company that’s really shipped an integrated programmable device with specialized hardware and heterogeneous compute support — and there are no publicly available HSA applications in-market that we’re aware of. As AMD’s issues demonstrate, the problem with pushing specialized new architectures into the consumer market is that there’s little reason for developers to take advantage of them, and therefore little reason for consumers to take interest. This classic chicken-and-egg problem is only worse now that consumers hold on to PC hardware for longer and longer periods of time. If you don’t upgrade, you don’t get the general performance or battery life improvements baked into newer hardware, much less any specialized acceleration equipment. Instead of trying to nudge products out into the market and then encourage broad adoption, Microsoft, Google, and other companies are building their own data centers in-house and applying their own expertise directly to hardware. That’s not to say the trend is entirely in one direction — Microsoft’s HoloLens depends on a custom-built HPU, or Holographic Processor Unit. But hardware like the HPU may be more of an exception than the rule, particularly considering that the device costs $3,000 and is explicitly marketed to developers. Microsoft’s HoloLens. Image by EETimes There are practical advantages to bringing hardware development in-house. It’s much easier for a company to tweak an algorithm or experiment with new features or data analysis when it doesn’t have to worry about pushing that update out to thousands of customers. Desktop PCs and some laptops could handle the heat output from custom microprocessors, but nobody wants an FPGA in a smartphone. Giving the customer what they want means keeping portable devices thin and light, particularly since battery scaling historically hasn’t kept pace with existing computing power. Move those workloads to specialized cloud databases, and you can deliver the services customers want without waiting on developers to take advantage of features. When Microsoft began integrating FPGAs into its data centers, it was able to tweak algorithms constantly rather than trying to push those updates out to consumer hardware or otherwise take advantage of specialized fixed-function hardware. This trend isn’t all upside, at least not if you prefer the existing model that puts premium performance in the hands of individuals who invest a relatively limited amount of money in hardware. By keeping advances in software tied to hardware running in custom data centers, Google, Facebook, and other companies can also keep their algorithms and intelligence proprietary and strictly off-limits. If you want to run an open-source operating system today, there are a wide range of choices with varying degrees of openness, some of which rely on no closed-source code. There’s no real equivalent in the realm of AI — no Cortana or Siri-equivalents, at least not yet (there are some projects underway). The other risk in this kind of model is that it truly makes Internet connectivity essential — and that means it pushes more people towards carrier plans that often have no basis in objective reality when it comes to per-GB costs for data. But it also suggests a future in which computing performance continues to advance, provided certain issues related to network scaling, cost, and availability can be overcome. It could help drive down the long-term cost of computing devices, but the current carriers in the US have data plans that will soak up any one-time savings in long-term fees. Moving away from the personal and into the cloud could restart scaling and allow manufacturers to deliver much faster experiences than they can today. But the hardware that drives said experiences may never be available to common consumers. Whether this is a good thing depends on whether you think widespread availability and low cost were key drivers of the computer revolution or merely temporary factors that are no longer necessary.

According to McAfee Most Sensational Celebrities 2016, a search for Sonakshi Sinha + Torrent results in a 21 per cent chance of connecting to a malicious website. Searches for the actress overall had a risk percentage of 11.11 per cent. The global study, published by Intel Security, explores how hackers use pop culture icons like Bollywood celebrities to generate risky search results, exposing fans to viruses and malware. The report found that Gen-Y stars including Sonakshi Sinha, Tiger Shroff, Arjun Kapoor, Shraddha Kapoor, Kriti Sanon and Alia Bhatt comprised 50 per cent of the top 10 list for 2016. Priyanka Chopra, who was the most sensational celebrity for 2015, is down to No 7 spot this year with 7.56 per cent risk percentage. "This years list saw major changes as younger (Gen-Y) movie celebrities are making their presence felt in the top 10 list," the report said. Farhan Akhtar ranked second in the list (racing from No 11 in 2015) with 9.56 per cent risk percentage, followed by Kareena Kapoor at No 3 (from No 10 last year) (8.67 per cent) and Tiger Shroff and Arjun Kapoor jointly at No 4 and 8.44 per cent risk. Shraddha Kapoor ranked at the fifth spot, down from No 2 in 2015. With the increasing penetration of broadband, consumers rely on internet to find more information like award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more, leaving them vulnerable. "...hackers can take advantage of consumer interest around several facets of Bollywood cinema news and entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information," it added. Venkat Krishnapur, head of R&D operations for Intel Securitys India Development Centre, said cybercriminals are increasingly targeting consumers who access information on-the-go, without considering the potential security risks online around celebrity interest. "We at Intel Security remain committed to creating a positive online experience by educating and protecting the Indian consumers," he added. The report said users must be aware of clicking on third party links and ensure they use web protection that notifies them of risky sites or links before they visit them. Also, they should be cautious when searching for torrent as this term appeared to be, by far, the riskiest search term. "Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. It?s best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available," the report said.

Intel officials have cited drones as an important growth market for the chip maker, and the company has been aggressive in getting its technologies—including silicon and software—into devices from other companies. Now Intel is rolling out a drone of its own, with the company's name not only on components inside the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), but also on the outside. At the InterGeo 2016 show this week, Intel officials unveiled the Falcon 8+, the company's first branded drone. It builds off the work done on the Falcon 8, a commercial drone developed by Ascending Technologies, a startup that Intel had worked with before buying it earlier this year. The octocopter is designed for industrial and commercial work, including inspection, surveying and mapping, and comes with a broad range of capabilities and a sophisticated control unit. "Drones are an important computing platform for the future, and Intel is positioning itself at the forefront of this opportunity to provide the compute, sensor, communications and cloud integration for the growing drone ecosystem," Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group, wrote in a post on the company blog. "The system provides detailed images down to millimeter accuracy and gives valuable structural analysis that helps users detect and prevent further damage to infrastructure. Operators will have tremendous opportunities to generate valuable aerial precision data." The drone market—for both consumers and business users—is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. In a recent report on the general state of aviation in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) predicted that by 2020 about 4.3 million UAVs will be sold to consumers, and another 2.7 million will be sold to businesses for commercial use. The FAA is trying to get out in front of the trend by developing regulations regarding drone operations. Intel and Qualcomm have been among the most aggressive chip makers in the drone space. Intel has worked with and invested in drone makers like Yuneec—whose Typhoon H uses Intel's RealSense 3D camera technology to help navigate and avoid obstacles—and Ascending, which had rolled out the AscTec Falcon 8, which also includes Intel products. Intel also offers the Intel Aero Platform that gives developers the foundation on which to build their own drones. The chip maker also is partnering with AT&T to test drone capabilities and has put on nighttime displays where a hundred drones are launched into the sky and operated by a single pilot. In addition, CEO Brian Krzanich chairs an FAA advisory board that will help the agency create regulations for drones. Drone developers initially targeted the consumer space, but now more of the systems—such as the AscSec 8—are making their way into the commercial market. Now comes the Falcon 8+ from Intel. The new UAV reportedly can travel  up to 35 mph, and includes Intel's Powerpack for longer battery life—up to 26 minutes at a time—and the AscTec Trinity technology, which officials described as a triple-redundant autopilot that includes measurement capabilities that make up for external pressures like electromagnetic fields or strong winds. The drone is controlled via the Intel Cockpit, which uses an Intel-based tablet (most other user faces are based on smartphones), which company officials said makes for easier operation. The controller is water-resistant, features a joystick and supports live views of up to 1080p resolutions.           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul NXP Unveils New Technologies for Autonomous Vehicles                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

By Erico Guizzo Posted 7 Oct 2016 | 19:45 GMT Photo: Intel TurtleBot powered by Intel Joule module at the Intel Developer Forum in August. I really enjoy my TurtleBot. I haven’t programmed it to do anything very useful, like bringing me coffee, but it’s still a lot of fun: It lets even a n00b like me explore and learn a bit about ROS, or Robot Operating System, the influential software platform used by a growing number of robotics researchers and companies around the world. My kids seem to like the TurtleBot, too. It’s now decorated with “Frozen” stickers and a drawing of what I assume is Elsa’s face. Now, after nearly three years, ElsaBot needs an upgrade. In addition to a new battery pack, I’m considering replacing the Asus netbook that powers the robot. Something smaller, more powerful, and less ugly would be great. Looking at what other TurtleBot owners have done, I think one option to consider is picking one of the many ARM-based systems that support ROS—Qualcomm’s Snapdragon, Nvidia’s Jetson, or even a Raspberry Pi. At only $35, a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 looks particularly enticing, although the install documentation looks particularly frightening (n00b, remember?). For a little more money, there’s the TurtleBot 2e project, based on a Qualcomm DragonBoard 410c ($75), but again, the installation looks quite complex. Image: Intel The Intel Joule 570x development kit includes a 64-bit, 1.7 GHz quad-core Intel Atom processor, 4 GB RAM, 16 GB eMMC memory, 4K video capture and display, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, USB 3.0, and other interfaces. The compute module itself (the silver rectangle above) is about the size of two quarters side by side; the rest of the dev board is used for I/O ports. Yet another option I’m looking into is Intel’s Joule [right], a new computer board aimed at robots, drones, AR/VR, computer vision, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The board has impressive specs, including 4K video and support for Intel’s RealSense depth camera. The only bad thing: This thing is pricey! The high-end version, the Joule 570x, is on sale for $370. So, yeah, you can get 10 Raspberry Pi boards for the same amount. Clearly, the Joule is not designed for your average DIY project; Intel says it’s for developers, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs who are working on high-performance applications and want to get products to market fast. It plans to introduce the Joule 550x, a less expensive version, as well as stand-alone Joule modules, later this year. OH SNAP! A few weeks ago I saw a short YouTube video showing a Joule-powered TurtleBot. It turned out to be part of a demo that Canonical, the company behind the Ubuntu Linux operating system, prepared for the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) in August. To find out more about that project, I spoke with Michael Benz, the Canonical engineer who set up the TurtleBot for the event. Benz says that, for a device like Joule, you’d want to use Ubuntu Core, also known as Snappy, a stripped-down version of the full Ubuntu OS that offers more speed, stability, and security. And to run applications on Snappy, instead of conventional app installs, you’d use so-called snaps. “Snaps are self-contained packages, so they have everything they need to run on top of the OS,” he explains. “Snaps are self-contained packages, so they have everything they need to run on top of the OS. [For a ROS app] the snap would run a dependency check and pull in every ROS piece needed and bundle all in a package”—Michael Benz, Canonical For a TurtleBot application like the one he developed for IDF—the robot drove within a tape-delimited area while streaming video to a nearby computer—the snap would “run a dependency check and pull in every ROS piece that it needs and bundle all in a package,” Benz says, adding that the snap would be Ubuntu release-independent. This month, Canonical is expected to release an Ubuntu Core image for Joule (images are already available for other devices). Benz is also planning to put his IDF demo as a snap on Ubuntu’s public snap store. “So you’ll get the entire ROS operating system as well as my Python code and that will install as a snap,” he says. This seems really interesting for robotics. If developers can create ROS apps as snap packages, it could become much easier for users to run—and update—apps on their robots without having to go through complex installations and worry about dependencies, libraries, and so forth. Indeed, some developers are already experimenting with this possibility, and the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF), which maintains ROS, seems to have plans for a ROS snap store. “You’ll be able to write, share, and run ROS-based Snappy apps for your favorite robots,” they wrote in a blog post last year. Could this help make ROS more accessible to those who are not command-line ninjas or computer science PhDs? I sure hope so. Which brings me back to my TurtleBot. I still haven’t decided what to do about its computer. But apparently there are some 2500 TurtleBots out there in the world, so if you own one and have upgraded it, I’d love to hear what compute module you’re using. Also, ROSCon 2016 is starting tomorrow, so hopefully we’ll get an update on the ROS snap store, other ROS-supported devices, and much more. And on a TurtleBot-specific note, we’re expecting some exciting news! Evan, who also loves his TurtleBot (he apparently takes Trevor everywhere) will be there to cover everything. Stay tuned!

(Courtesy Clayton Christensen) Share Written by Oliver Staley Obsession The Office October 12, 2016 If you’re sick of hearing about disruption, blame Clayton Christensen, who introduced the concept into business jargon. Christensen is possibly the most influential management thinker in Silicon Valley. His 1997 book, The Innovator’s Dilemma, was embraced by Intel’s Andy Grove, quoted by Steve Jobs, and called one of the six best business books ever by The Economist. In it, Christensen introduced his theory of disruption, which explains how established, successful companies leave themselves vulnerable to competition from upstarts by abandoning the lower end of the market. Transistor radios, for example, were sold cheaply to teenagers and eventually overtook the expensive, high-quality vacuum-tube radios that once dominated the market. A more recent example might be AirBnb’s assault on the hotel industry. Riding the success of his ideas, Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, has published several more books exploring innovation, established a nonprofit think tank (the Clayton Christensen Institute), and launched consulting and investing firms. He’s also faced criticism, like this New Republic piece decrying how disruption has become an odious cliche. In his latest book, Competing Against Luck: The Story of Innovation and Customer Choice, Christensen, with co-authors Taddy Hall, Karen Dillon, and David Duncan, tries to explain why some products are successful and so many are not. The difference is based on what he calls the “jobs to be done” theory. Customers, he says, aren’t really interested in products or services themselves but in what they do. When people have a need, that’s a job to be done; products or services are simply “hired” to solve them. Innovative companies focus on developing products that do the jobs customers want, no matter what form they take. Netflix, for example, succeeds because the job to be done is entertainment, and it does the job by mailing DVDs and producing TV shows—two very different ways to be hired for the same job. (HarperCollins) Quartz interviewed Christensen by phone about his new theory, how it fits into his theory of innovation, and why he regrets using the term “disruption.” Quartz: Why did you call your book “Competing Against Luck?” It seems like the real competition is not luck but a company’s own flawed understanding of its product and its customers. The reason we chose that was every time a company puts a new product into the market, they’ve done their market research as best they can and they believe it will be successful, but the data shows that, gosh, somewhere around 20% will be successful and 80% won’t and they thought the other 80% would be successful.  “I just had a sense that it’s not a crap shoot, that there’s more predictability to innovation than the data shows is possible.” Is it just intrinsic to innovation that you can’t predict in advance whether your product will be bought by the customer or not? I just had a sense that it’s not a crap shoot, that there’s more predictability to innovation than the data shows is possible. A key element of unpredictability is the customer is very unpredictable but the job is very stable over time, and that brings predictability to innovation. If you understand the jobs to be done, you’re actually competing against companies who still believe it’s just a crap shoot. How does the jobs-to-be-done theory fit into your more established disruptive-innovation theory? They seem to nest together. At its core, disruption is a theory about competitive response. If I have a new innovation I want to introduce into the marketplace, I want to predict if competitors in that market are going to ignore me or going to fight me. The theory of disruption helps you understand that quite well. But in many ways, it’s not a manual for how to grow or how to predict what customers want. [Jobs to be done] is the second side of the same coin: How can I be sure that competitors won’t kill me and how can I be sure customers will want to buy the product? So it’s actually a very important compliment to disruption. If you organize your company around a job to be done, it’s actually a lot harder for a new entrant to disrupt you, because most disruptive companies just have my product versus your product, and mine’s cheaper than yours. Jobs to be done is actually good protection for companies worried about being disrupted. Your book mentions an example of product that no one really needed and therefore wasn’t successful—Segway, which no one hired to do a job. I wonder if there’s an inverse: how do you account for things that no one thinks they need but turn out of be very useful or desirable. Facebook strikes me as product that no one thought they needed, but is now indispensable to many of us. Does the theory allow for the truly innovative, outside-of-the-box ideas that no one thought they needed?  “Jobs to be done is actually good protection for companies worried about being disrupted.” The vast majority of products organized around a job to be done were discovered by chance, by customers who realized they had a job to do, and realized there’s something they had to do the job—and they talked about it, and other people said, “Oh gosh, I have that same job to do and I didn’t realize I needed this product to do that job until I happened upon it.” We discover jobs to be done, we don’t develop them or consciously iterate toward them. In the book, we’re tying to say, now that you understand the idea, there’s a methodology that will help you identify these jobs. You’ve got to keep your ear to the ground, because you’ll happen upon the job. How about really hard-to-define traits, like taste and style? Can a clothing designer at the high end apply jobs-to-be-done theory to color, for example? Or are there some things that are beyond the reach of the theory? I think you’re right. I cannot apply the concept of disruption to choices of preference. It doesn’t have anything to say about preference. Thank goodness. Have you been surprised by the reaction to your disruption theory, by how it has taken hold, and by the backlash? There are criticisms that are very important. Never does a theory just pop out in complete form. But rather, the first appearance of the theory is half baked. Then it improves when people say, it doesn’t account for this, or this is an anomaly and it doesn’t explain that. It’s very important to have people willing to criticize it for that purpose. What we didn’t anticipate, and what in many ways was a fault of mine, was that the term disruption has so many different connotations in the English language, that it allows people to justify whatever they want to do as, “Oh, this is disruptive,” and they don’t ever read the book. The population of people where the fewest have read the book are venture capitalists. They are arrogant and smart and why do they need to read something? [Princeton psychologist] Daniel Kahneman has this book Thinking Fast and Slow, and in the language he uses, there is type 1 activity and type 2 activity. What a brilliant idea, because it forces you to go back to see what is type 1 or what is type 2. Instead of calling it disruptive and sustaining innovation, if I had called it type 1 innovation and type 2 innovation, it would have forced all of these people who have misused the term to read another paragraph. But as someone who knows a lot about branding, you might want to be associated with this powerful brand of disruption. I have never wanted to be famous.

First up for a refresh is the HP Spectre x360, which was conceived as a convertible rival to the MacBook Air. That device is now thinner and lighter than ever, dropping 2mm in girth to measure just 13.8mm in girth, as well as slimming down to just under 1.3kg in weight. There's improvements under the hood, too, with the 2016 Spectre x360 packing Intel Core i processors based on the chip maker's 7th-generation Kaby Lake architecture. Configurations start at Core i5 backed up by 16GB of RAM, and you can fit it with up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. There's a handful of other new-gen features, like a pair of USB-C ports and an integrated Full HD webcam to complement the 1080p touchscreen display, plus a claimed improvement in battery life. The new Spectre x360 is starting to land is select regions immediately (October 12) with pricing set at $1,049. We'll let you know when a UK-specific tag is confirmed, but expect an RRP in the region of £899. Related: Best cheap laptop deals The Envy 13 has also been rebooted. Like the Spectre x360, it'll now feature Kaby Lake-based Intel Core i5 or i7 processors with up to 16GB of RAM and as much as 1TB of PCIe SSD storage. While actually chunkier than before at 14mm in depth and 1.4kg on the scales, it'll pack a significantly upgraded battery that HP claims will now last for up to 14 hours (compared to 10 hours on the previous model). There's also the option to upgrade the standard Full HD touchscreen to either QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800 pixels) or UHD (3,840 x 2,160 pixels). The refreshed Envy 13 will be available from October 26, starting at $849 with UK-specific pricing to be confirmed – we'd expect to see an RRP of around £749. Lastly, HP also unveiled a new 27-inch Envy AIO PC, which packs Nvidia GTX 950M graphics, older 6th-gen Intel chips, and a QHD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) display, and a 27-inch Envy 4K monitor. These products will arrive later in October and in December, respectively. Of course, how these products perform in the flesh remains to be seen – we're looking forward to putting them through their paces as soon as possible.

At their introduction, in the latter half of last decade, they gave Apple serious competition, but cost-cutting and brand expansion eventually made the Envy name all but meaningless. Recently, HP has made efforts to get Envy back on track. It has gradually improved the quality of Envy across the board, and in July the company released the HP Spectre, a tour-de-force of hardware and design. Now, HP is keeping the pedal of progress firmly pressed down with a major update of its entire product line. HP Spectre x360 The largest update comes to one of HP’s oldest Envy systems, the HP Spectre x360. As with earlier iterations, the x360 is a 2-in-1 device with a folding hinge. The new model, though, is significantly smaller. Thickness is down to 13.8 millimeters, from 15.9mm, while weight is down to 2.85 pounds. Its overall profile is smaller, too, thanks to a new edge-to-edge, 13.3-inch, 1080p display. Like Dell’s XPS 13, this design makes the overall footprint more similar to a 12-inch laptop. Big changes have also come to the battery. It’s now a massive 57.8 watt-hour unit, and HP quotes battery life of up to 15 hours. That’s a very long time, and as is always true of manufacturer figures, it’s probably a best-case scenario. Given the battery’s size, though, we expect good things when the x360 hits the road. Other updates include an edge-to-edge keyboard with 1.3mm of travel, a wider glass touchpad, four front-facing speakers, two USB 3.1 Type-C ports (joined by one standard USB), 7th-generation Intel Core processors, and PCI Express solid state drive with capacity of up to 1TB. Though it carries the name of its predecessor, this is a huge update. It’s basically an all-new laptop, and among the thinnest in its category. A number of configurations will be available. The most affordable, with a Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, will run you $1,049. You should be able to purchase it immediately from HP’s online store. HP Envy 13 HP has also updated the Envy 13, the “standard” laptop cousin to the x360. Its update is less substantial, as the Envy 13 doesn’t gain an edge-to-edge display. However, it has received many updates under the hood. Battery life is, once again, the most important. It has the same 57.8 watt-hour battery found in the x360. That means battery life, with the 1080p display, is up to a quoted 14 hours. Its predecessor promised only 10 hours, at most. Screen options for the 13.3-inch display include 1080p and, unlike the x360, a 2,560 x 1,440 panel. The Envy 13 also has front-firing speakers, designed to improve audio quality in real-world use. Inside, the Envy 13 has been updated to the latest 7th-generation Intel Core processors. It can handle up to 16GB of RAM, and PCI Express solid state drives up to 1TB (with a small, 128GB SATA SSD available in the most basic model). There’s just one USB 3.1 Type-C port, but it’s joined by two regular USB 3.0 ports. Pricing will start at $849 for the Envy 13 with a Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM, a 128GB solid state drive, and 1080p display. A variety of additional configurations will join it, but HP didn’t detail their prices ahead of release. You can buy the new Envy 13 on HP’s online store starting on October 26. HP Envy All-in-one 27 Next up we have another huge re-design with HP’s Envy All-in-one 27. Again, though it shares a name with a previous model, the new edition is entirely different. HP has opted to put the hardware powering the new Envy All-in-one 27 inside the base, rather than behind the PC. This makes the display strikingly thin, with bezels that are only 9.5 millimeters wide on the sides and top, and 11.1mm at the bottom. Resolution comes in at 2,560 x 1,440, and HP boasts that the display can render 99 percent of the sRGB gamut. It also has a Blue Light Filter, to cut down on wavelengths of light that keep you restless late at night. Front-facing speakers are again in attendance. Here, they’re designed in partnership with Bang & Olufsen. The sound bar is actually in the base, and is controlled by a unique audio dial, something you almost never see on PC desktops, all-in-ones, and laptops. Intel hasn’t released 7th-generation processors for desktops yet, so the base processor is a Core i7-6700T. The system has 16GB of memory, a 128GB PCI Express solid state drive, a 1TB SATA hard disk, and GeForce GTX 950M graphics with 4GB of GDDR5 memory. Connectivity includes four USB 3.0, one USB 3.1 Type-C, and HDMI-out/in. The latter is important to note. Many all-in-ones don’t have HDMI-out, so they can’t be used with an external monitor. The configuration listed above will be available at retail on October 16 for $1,599. Two additional configurations will also be available online. One, priced at $1,249 and available November 2, will drop down to a Core i5 processor, and cut the solid state drive, as well as ditch the Nvidia graphics chip. That’s probably a model you’ll want to avoid. The second, priced at $1,699 and available October 12, double the capacity of the solid state drive to 256GB, and the hard disk to 2TB. That’s a great upgrade, considering it’s only $100 more than the base configuration. HP Envy 27 Display Last up we have the new HP Envy monitor. It takes a similar design approach to the Envy 27 All-in-one, ditching the former look, which had speakers on each side of the display, for a thin-bezel aesthetic. The 27-inch display looks very similar to that on the all-in-one. However, it receives an important upgrade – 4K resolution, along with AMD FreeSync technology support. The monitor’s IPS panel supports refresh rates of up to 60Hz. The U.S. version of the display also has versatile connectivity, thanks to its use of a USB Type-C port which can connect to other devices and deliver up to 60 watts of power. For example, you could plug your HP Spectre 13 into the monitor to use it as a second display, and charge the Spectre 13 at the same time. Other ports include HDMI 1.4 and HDMI 2.0. Surprisingly, the Envy 27 Display is not that expensive. It will retail for just $499, and be available on December 4.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware Intel Kaby Lake Support On All Asus 100 Series Motherboards Confirmed By Keith May Posted 1 month ago 112Shares Share Tweet Submit With the upcoming launch of Intel’s Kaby Lake line of processors for the mainstream market there have been many questions regarding motherboard and chipset support. With the rumored 200 series chipset coming the launch has left people wondering if we’ll see support for the Kaby Lake coming to the 100 series since they share the same 1151 pin socket.  MSI has already stepped out and made a positive announcement, now who else?  Good news, at least for Asus owners looking to upgrade from their Sky Lake CPU to a newer Kaby Lake CPU are in luck.  A simple UEFI update will bring all of these motherboards up to spec to support all of the upcoming chips.   Doing the update is simple enough and can be done either though a USB drive in the UEFI or can be done within Windows.  These BIOS updates can be found today via their update tab on the ASUS website.   Instant compatibility with next-generation Intel Core processors All ASUS 100-series motherboards that include the ASUS USB BIOS Flashback feature allow users to apply UEFI BIOS updates with ease. For other ASUS 100-series motherboards the necessary UEFI BIOS update takes just one click in an easy-to-use Windows-based BIOS updater application, ASUS EZ Update, which is available to download from the ASUS website. Users keen to take advantage of the power of the next generation of LGA1151 Intel Core processors should visit product support page via www.asus.com and download the relevant UEFI BIOS version today. The following ASUS 100-series motherboards can be updated for compatibility with the latest Intel CPUs: Advertisement A future BIOS update will further improve performance and functionality.     The Kaby lake architecture constitutes the “Optimization” stage of Intel’s PAO cadence. Kaby Lake is looking to improve on what Sky Lake has already laid the foundation for.  One of those improvements is in efficiency that has allowed for higher clock speeds at the same TDP level, something greatly beneficial to those who would like a faster speed processor but lack the confidence in overclocking the CPU themselves.

On Monday, the Open Connectivity Foundation and the AllSeen Alliance announced they would merge under the OCF name. The two groups include companies such as Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, and Haier -- possibly a critical mass of IoT component and product makers. OCF's scope even extends beyond home IoT into some industrial technologies. The internet of things depends on objects talking to each other, so standardization is important to making IoT easier to use and driving down prices through large-scale manufacturing. But efforts at interoperability started out by going in different directions. The fiercest rivalry was between the AllSeen Alliance, backed by Qualcomm and Microsoft, and the Open Interoperability Consortium (OIC), founded by Intel, Samsung, and others. Each had its own way for devices to discover and learn about each other. Now that the two groups are merging, there’s a greater chance that any given IoT product will be able to talk to others without using a hub or relying on cloud-based software. The merger won’t close down the open-source projects started by the two groups, AllJoyn for the AllSeen Alliance and IoTivity for OIC. Those will continue, both of them under The Linux Foundation. But the projects will collaborate to support future versions of the OCF specification with a single IoTivity implementation, the groups said in a press release. Current AllJoyn and IoTivity products will be interoperable and backward compatible, they said. The two groups were on a path to common ground as soon as the OCF was formed in February. The new organization incorporated all members of OIC as well as some other companies, including key members of AllSeen. Microsoft said at the time all Windows devices would natively interoperate with the OCF standard. Analysts predicted a couple of years ago that the fragmented world of IoT standards would come together in time. But consolidation hasn’t yet reached the point where consumers can buy any device and feel confident it will work with all their other connected gear. Other mergers and partnerships are also helping to create order in IoT. The Thread Group has made deals with the ZigBee Alliance and other groups to make their application platforms run on its networking stack. Pairings between companies like Cisco and IBM may make it easier for enterprises to build IoT platforms.

Clear Linux Continues To Maintain Slight Graphics Lead Over Ubuntu 16.10 Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 11 October 2016. Page 1 of 4. 16 Comments Back in April I did tests showing how Intel's Clear Linux distribution showed much potential for HD/Iris Graphics performance, something that intrigued many Phoronix readers since Clear Linux would generally be seen as a workstation/cloud/container-optimized Linux distribution and something with not much emphasis on the desktop or gaming. Those earlier tests were with Ubuntu 16.04, bur with Ubuntu 16.10 coming out this week, here are some fresh tests of Clear Linux and Ubuntu Yakkety Yak on an Skylake HD Graphics system. For curiosity sake, I ran some fresh Ubuntu 16.10 vs. Clear Linux (10820) benchmarks on the same Core i5 6600K system with an MSI Z170A GAMING PRO motherboard, 16GB DDR4-2133MHz memory, and 256GB TS256GSSD370S SSD. The mid-range i5-6600K is equipped with HD Graphics 530. Ubuntu 16.10 makes use of the Linux 4.8 kernel, X.Org Server 1.18.4, xf86-video-modesetting, GCC 6.2.0, and Mesa 12.0.3. Unfortunately Mesa 12.1 didn't make it thus for Yakkety Yak is just OpenGL 4.3 support rather than OpenGL 4.4 (officially, or unofficial 4.5 extension completion too). So in addition I also tested Ubuntu 16.10 when switching to Mesa 12.1-dev via the Oibaf PPA. Additionally, I did a secondary run of the Mesa 12.1-dev stack when switching to the Xfce version of Ubuntu 16.10 to complement the Unity 7.5 desktop numbers. Clear Linux currently ships with the Linux 4.8 kernel, GCC 6.2.0, and Mesa 12.1-dev. So the versions aren't vastly different between Ubuntu 16.10 and Clear Linux, but keep in mind Clear uses CPUFreq over P-State by default plus carries an assortment of other patches and optimized configurations with its default package set. All of these benchmarks were carried out in a fully-automated manner using the Phoronix Test Suite.

So when they approached me to review one of their Titan VR10 machines equipped with an nVidia GTX 1080, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Today, PC gaming is within easy reach of more gamers than than ever before. With the likes of Origin, uPlay and STEAM, games can be bought, downloaded and played in less than an hour in many cases. Component prices are also more competitive today. A mid range CPU can typically accompany a modern next-gen graphics card such as a GTX 1060, and allow you to play games with visual settings turned up at 1080P. This review will focus on the product itself, rather than delve into technical frame rate analysis of games and run benchmarks. I am doing it this way for a number of reasons, chief of which is the abnormal nature of the component pairing in this system. The GPU is top end, but the CPU and motherboard won't be fully realising the GTX 1080's potential. Although they will run games just fine. A system like this might give those on a budget an idea of what to expect, or those who already have a similar system, and just want to increase graphics horsepower. "GeForce GTX 10 series is built to meet the demands of next-generation displays" - OcUK The Titan VR10 ForceBox is advertised as a system geared for nVidia's Geforce 10 series graphics cards. During this review, I will be focusing on overall observed system performance, as well as performance during gaming and CPU/RAM utilisation. The games I will be testing are Doom (2016), Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (2015), and Alien: Isolation (2014). All three of these games are known for their graphical quality, as well as how taxing they can be at their respective ultra graphical settings at 4K resolution on lesser graphics cards. 4K is the focus here. A GTX 1080 is no slouch, and I wanted to see how it could handle games at a resolution of 4096x2160. Specifications Case Phanteks Enthoo Evolv Power supply Kolink KL-600 CPU Intel Core i5-6400 (2.7GHz, boost @ 3.2GHz) RAM 2x 4GB Team Group 2400MHz (DDR4) Motherboard Asus H110I-Plus miniITX (Intel Skylake) Core connectivity 4x USB2.0 (rear), 2x USB3.0 (rear), 2x USB3.0 (front) mic, line-in, speakers out, Gigabit LAN, HDMI, VGA, DVI Graphics Inno3D GTX 1080 8GB Founders Edition (HDMI, DVI, 3x DisplayPort) Sound On-board 7.1 HD Storage (OS) Kingston V300 120GB SSD Storage (data) Seagate Barracuda 1TB HDD OS Windows 10 Price as specced £1285 (International shipping costs will vary) The price might seem expensive at first glance, but when the individual component prices are broken down, it makes much better sense. The GTX 1080 (£619), i5-6400 (£179), and the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv (£99) account for £897 alone. once you add an OS, HDD/SSD and other extras, it all adds up. As I have already mentioned, the GTX 1080 does seem an odd pairing with the rest of the system specs. The motherboard only allows for 8 PCI Express lanes where the GPU can handle 16, so the full potential is immediately limited here. And I predict some CPU bottlenecking might be at play in some games. I have never heard of Kolink before, a quick search shows that they appear to make cheap PSUs, the KL-600 retails at under £40, for example, and no reviews for them appear to be online which doesn't fill me with confidence. Make of that what you will, but my personal preference would be to switch the PSU out for a well regarded one. As an example, a Corsair CX600M is also 80 Plus Bronze certified, and outputs 46A on the +12v line with a max power rating of 552W. The KL-600 above is 37.5A with 450W. Having said that, after some further digging, I found that Kolink are the people behind Noctua, and as many of you will already know, Noctua make some top quality products. Build quality and features The VR10 uses the Phanteks Enthoo Evolv mATX case. I have only ever heard good things about Phanteks, so was pleased to see that my expectations for a high quality case were easily met. The panels are nicely textured, tapping them results in a confident noise rather than a hollow reverb as often found on cheaper cases. There is a single 180mm intake fan, with vents and mount points for additional fans at the back and top. Removable dust filters for the front and PSU intakes are also included. In usage, I found the single intake to be sufficient, as there are plenty of exhaust vents for ambient heat to escape in such a case design. Both the i5 and GTX 1080 are power efficient components, and there wasn't a great deal of heat generated in any condition. Cooling was certainly nothing to worry about. During gaming, the fans ramp up and became slightly more audible. During normal desktop use, or when watching videos, the VR10 was near silent, making for an excellent system to either work, or be entertained without a whirring distraction. The UEFI BIOS shows a healthy amount of information about the status of the system. At an ambient room temperature of just over 23 degrees, the CPU temp showed a steady 29 degrees until a game was fired up, at which point it rose to the mid 40s. The 1TB HDD is hidden away under the SSD bracket. It is quite hard to get to from the main side panel without removing the SSD. Although for easy HDD access, you can remove the other side panel and use the HDD release pinch instead. The system builders at Overclockers UK did a fine job of hiding away any messy cabling. Even on the other side, cables were tied down securely with the built-in velcro fasteners. This makes cleaning relatively easy, as dust will collect on even the most filtered of cases out there. The green LED strips are not part of the Phanteks case, but instead have been added by Overclockers UK. They provide a green glow through the front panel openings, and there is no way to control brightness, so they could become annoying if the PC is placed on top of a desk and is being used in dim lighting. I also found that removal of the front dust filter was problematic due to the way the LED strips had been taped onto it. The strips could have been secured a different way I feel, perhaps on the front panel itself, or from inside the case, as the light would still shine through the dust filter mesh. Performance DOOM id Tech 6 powers the latest shooter, and it is absolutely beautiful. Although when standing up close to some textures, they can look a little fuzzy on a 65" display at 2160P resolution. regardless, performance was a constant 60fps. I could not unlock the framerate on Doom sadly, and Vsync was off. At least it is good to know that with every setting turned to maximum, the game never once flustered on the GTX 1080 and i5-6400 combo. This was in the default OpenGL mode. I found that Doom's Vulkan mode to be too buggy to give a confident verdict. WOLFENSTEIN: THE OLD BLOOD Even though Wolfenstein isn't as luscious as Doom, it still offers good paced action and quality graphics all the same. However, the performance was just not up to scratch with Doom. On average, I was pulling 35-45fps at 2160P with 4x antialiasing . Dropping this to 2x resulted in slightly improved performance, but I was unable to maintain a solid 60fps. Dropping the resolution to 1440P, or lowering the graphical settings was the only way to ensure a minimum of 60fps with this game. I wanted to see if the i5-6400 was holding the GTX 1080 back, so had Windows performance monitor running to track CPU usage. High utilisation can be seen, and the reason for the low minimum framerate was clear. ALIEN: ISOLATION The space bound scare-a-thon hit 85fps in many instances, and always stayed above 60fps. Like Doom, every setting was maxed. This game is the oldest of the three, but is easily just as stunning visually, and in most cases, has a greater level of texture detail up close. Conclusion As a gaming PC, then, the ForceBox VR10 is very good. two out of the three games I played on it at 4096x2160 gave at least a constant 60fps with all graphics settings set to maximum. Sadly, games with a strong focus on CPU power to maintain a higher minimum framerate will show the flaw in mating a high end GPU with a lower end CPU. I should comment on just how quiet the VR10 is during gaming, I was able to enjoy the spooky ambience aboard the Sevastopol in Alien: Isolation, without being distracted by fan noises. The VR10 is not without faults of course, the Kolink PSU raises questions, the LED strip placement needs to be revised, or perhaps even removed entirely. And while it looks nice, I can't help but feel the Enthoo case would look even more elegant with no lighting. The x8 PCI Express lane also limits the full potential of the GTX 1080. In desktop applications, from browsing the web, to managing files and running applications, the VR10 performed as I'd expect from this spec. Although at times I could feel that the i5-6400 perhaps wasn't as snappy at multitasking applications at the kind of speed that I'm used to on an i7 system. Consulting the VR10 product page, I notice that there is no i7 option. The highest that can be selected is the i5-6600. Overall, I was mostly pleased with the gaming performance of the VR10. it does what it says on the tin, and does it quietly. Unlike many other pre-built gaming computers out there, it doesn't look like the helmet of a Power Ranger either. It would be nice to see more choice when configuring a VR10 PC. A selection of compatible motherboards and power supplies for each budget bracket would make it perfect. The Kolink KL-600 may be good, or it may be bad. There isn't enough information out there to confirm, and with such an expensive graphics card in such a system, I'd rather take the side of caution and replace it with something proven. I am happy to give the VR10 with GTX 1080 a rating of 8. A couple of points must be knocked off due to the limited component options offered.

News & Analysis Specs Pave Roads Around Xeon Two groups prep data center interconnects Rick Merritt 10/11/2016 08:30 AM EDT 3 comments NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. – Two separate groups today debut new 25 Gbit/second processor and memory interfaces for data center systems. Their common goal is to provide a more open alternative to what many expect Intel plans with its Xeon processors, Altera FPGAs and 3D Xpoint memories. The Gen-Z consortium is defining a bus based on the Ethernet physical layer for next-generation memories. The Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (CCIX) will use the PCI Express Gen 4 PHY for its CPU-to-accelerator link. The groups aim to create de facto standards that let any ARM, IBM Power or x86 processor link to any accelerator chip or any of an emerging handful of storage-class memories. Both groups got their start about a year ago. After Intel bid to acquire Altera last June, processor makers started approaching Xilinx about designing alternative cache-coherent interfaces to its FPGAs, and Xilinx proposed merging the efforts. Similarly, work on Gen-Z was fueled by Intel’s suggestion at its annual developer conference last year that its 3D Xpoint memories will need a new systems interface. Intel has yet to detail its plans for a 3D Xpoint interface. So far it is saying it will use a combination of its proprietary Quick Path Interconnect and PCIe to link its Xeon processors and Altera FPGAs.

Who knows what Intel will do with these new standards. I have a feeling Intel is going to be stubborn and stick to their "If we didn't create it then we won't use" mentality but I hope I'm wrong about this. I hope that Intel does finally come around and use these standards in future processors and I want to add Nvidia to this. I hope they adopt both standards.

I assume that this work is an extension of the memory centric architecture we've all been reading about lately. So now there are third parties involved in developing these high-speed interconnects between CPU, accelerators, memory, and FPGAs. Intel owns the CPU (and at least one FPGA solution) so are we to expext that at some point Intel will take these third party developed interconnects and build an SoC that contains all these bits and pieces?

Mark Williams hits the Labs and compares the best of the best. Reviews in this Group Test - Recommended - Asus ROG Rampage V Edition 10 - Best Value - ASRock Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming i7 Gigabyte GA-X99-Designare EX - Recommended - MSI X99A Xpower Gaming Titanium Intel’s High End Desktop (HEDT) range, while aimed at computing enthusiasts, also targets big business and enterprises needing powerful workstations. As such the HEDT platform needs to be supported for longer periods of time as companies like having stable platforms they can get a good return on investment with. This means the lifecycle of the HEDT platform, currently in the form of the X99 chipset, is about three to four years instead of the typical one or two years on mainstream platforms and is also the reason why you’ll find Xeon and registered memory compatibility along with consumer Core i7 and unregistered memory support on this one platform. To keep performance relevant over that time scale, Intel committed to supporting two generations of CPU for each HEDT platform allowing drop in CPU upgrades. For the previous X79 chipset that was Sandy Bridge-E then Ivy Bridge-E CPUs. For the current X99 chipset it’s Haswell-E followed by Broadwell-E. With the Broadwell-E CPU not long out, it marks the second half of the X99 platforms lifespan, and with the improved CPUs now available the platform can hit its full performance stride especially now that Intel have a ten core hyper-threaded monster to shove into it, in the form of the i7 6950X. As it has been about two years since X99 launched, motherboard manufacturers have taken the CPU refresh as a cue to refresh their X99 board offerings, with an eye to include new tech that wasn’t around in 2014. We test four of the top offerings, one from each manufacturer, aimed at gamers and enthusiasts to put through their paces. How we tested. It was harder than you’d think! With Intel introducing its new Turbo Boost 3 tech with Broadwell-E, we wanted to test this functionality along with the big claims motherboard manufacturers constantly make about their beyond DDR4-3000 memory support. Basically we wanted to have XMP and Turbo Boost 3 both enabled and working at the same time during our tests. However, as you’ll read in each review, it wasn’t as simple as that in most cases. Often enabling XMP resulted in Turbo Boost 3 simply not working until some other BIOS settings were tweaked. XMP on one board caused continuous rebooting, on another a particular benchmark consistently failed, and one simply ignored Turbo Boost 3 altogether, by design! So, using Intel’s top of the line i7 6950X we benchmarked each board with a 4x8GB DDR4 kit with its DDR-3200 XMP profile enabled along with Turbo Boost 3 enabled in BIOS along with the OS level Intel driver installed to facilitate the boosting of single or lightly threaded tasks to 4GHz on a single core. Each benchmark was then run three times, including one run with the driver disabled just in case it actually hurt performance, which it did in a few scenarios, then recorded the best result of the three runs. In the end only one board could do this with no other setting changes other than enabling the XMP profile. Read on to find out which. CONCLUSION  Performance wise the Asus board walks away with first place in all but one test, establishing yet another reason why it is able to command the premium price that it does. Here’s where it gets murky though, despite MSI coming a pretty convincing second place, Gigabyte’s BIOS issues and subsequent use of a beta BIOS to work around them resulted in a CPU that ran at 3.4GHz in multithreaded tasks (100MHz less than the others) meaning Gigabyte’s results aren’t very representative of their true performance. Judging by the Gigabyte boards memory speed tests, they are more likely around MSI’s performance capabilities. The ASRock offering gets a technical bronze medal thanks to Gigabyte’s issues, however it is well deserved. It won the 7-zip benchmark and came outright second in the y-cruncher tests, while not being far behind the leaders in all the other tests, except for the memory speed test where it was markedly slower. But, with a future BIOS update perhaps memory compatibility can be further improved, removing this problem. Having to manually set DRAM frequencies and OC profiles to provide XMP + Turbo Boost 3 compatibility could well be a cause too. From a price/performance perspective MSI is clearly the best option of the four, a solid second place performer combined with a lovely looking BIOS that eventually ended up the best for XMP + Turbo Boost 3 compatibility. As long as you don’t want flashy RGB lighting it’s the stand out choice.

"The Perimeta virtualized SBC (vSBC) can easily replace legacy systems without sacrificing any functionality or performance while giving operators an easy and flexible way to deploy this advanced network function in their cloud," said Carsten Rossenhövel, EANTC's managing director. "Whether deployed to facilitate plain SIP traffic in a network or for complex call handling in VoLTE environments, we found that the Perimeta vSBC meets typical service provider performance requirements." The tests, commissioned by Intel® under the Intel Network Builders Program, included both call signaling and audio stream processing and evaluated Perimeta's ability to assist in troubleshooting and to provide high-availability clustering. The comparison between the virtualized and appliance-based capabilities included evaluations of both OpenStack and VMware-based deployments. In evaluating security characteristics, Perimeta was found to effectively limit call rates when overloaded, and also to maintain baseline call signaling performance when subjected to DDoS attacks. Test Highlights EANTC cited the following as a result of the tests: Consistent, identical functionality when compared to legacy Perimeta SBC appliances Highly valuable alarm, event logging and call analysis when used in conjunction with the Metaswitch Service Assurance Server (SAS) Stable performance and reliable operation in overload conditions Ability to handle as many as 700 signaled calls per second and 78,000 simultaneous media sessions with no measurable difference in terms of QoS for both signaling and media compared to appliance based SBCs Verification of high availability "We are extremely pleased with the results of the EANTC testing, which demonstrates yet again the superior performance of our leading Perimeta vSBC, as experienced by our growing customer base of global service providers in real-world deployments," said Micaela Giuhat, vice president of product management at Metaswitch. "The virtualized Perimeta SBC offers providers clear advantages over proprietary or legacy COTS-based deployments, decreasing the time to revenue and providing compelling cost savings."

Performance-Boosting HiZ Support Lands For Intel's Mesa Vulkan Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 7 October 2016 at 04:13 PM EDT. 1 Comment Intel's "ANV" Mesa Vulkan Linux driver now has basic support for HiZ, an important performance feature. A while back I wrote about Intel Vulkan driver HiZ patches that were on the mailing list while today they were merged into Mesa Git -- in time for next week's feature freeze for the next Mesa mailing list. So far Hierarchical-Z is only implemented for basic cases, but in those basic triangle-type Vulkan demos there is about a 15% performance boost and around a 30% performance boost for the demos making use of fast depth clears. For now the HiZ ANV Vulkan implementation probably won't translate into any real performance gains for Linux's current Vulkan games: Dota 2 and The Talos Princple, but nevertheless great to see the basic support hitting Git. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud Reviews MacBook review MacBook review By Kane Fulton Laptops and netbooks  Apple's rosier MacBook brings nippier performance Shares 1. Introduction 2. Specifications and features 3. Performance and benchmarks 4. Verdict Recommended Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict Apple has given the MacBook's performance a much-needed boost, and it helps OS X zip along much better. Its critical flaws remain, but the 2016 version is less of a risk than it was last year. We just wish it was a bit cheaper. For Gorgeous Rose Gold color Improved performance Terrific design Great speakers Against Single USB-C port No price cut? Controversial keyboard Did you buy the 12-inch MacBook? I did, but not because I wanted one. No: the laptop I really wanted was a new MacBook Air, or even a redesigned 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro with a sleeker chassis. Of course, neither came. And like many other Air fans, I realised that another year was to pass by without Apple's best laptop getting an upgrade. So I bought the next best thing. The MacBook is all about compromise. With more pixels than the Air, its display allows me to be more productive on the move and slinging it into a backpack almost feels like cheating. While no powerhouse (editing 4K images on it is slightly painful), it handles basic tasks with ease. One year later, Apple has refreshed the MacBook with Intel's sixth-generation Skylake processors while introducing faster storage, memory and graphics for the same price. The most interesting change is on the outside: a new Rose Gold finish that genuinely makes me consider owning a shiny pink laptop for the first time. Gender stereotypes be damned. But despite its upgrades, the new MacBook is not the MacBook Air replacement that rumors once again predict will arrive this summer - it's the same unique, dazzling and challenging laptop as the one that launched one year ago. Only faster, and with longer-lasting battery life. A new processor, coupled with faster internal storage, memory and graphics has brought tangible improvements to the MacBook's performance. You'll still have to somehow manage with a single USB-C port, bolting on adapters and connectors to equip your FrankenMac with vital extra limbs. And if you didn't get on with its super-shallow keyboard, your fingers will remain as unconvinced as they were before - especially during long typing sessions. The MacBook brings more megahertz, and I'm not talking about clock speed. Recent developments Since Apple introduced the Rose Gold-tinted MacBook earlier this year, macOS 10.12 Sierra has shaken the featherlight laptop to its core. Featured as an automatic download, the operating system introduces Siri to Mac for the first time ever as well as Auto Unlock, which allows users to log in using a tethered Apple Watch.  See how the MacBook compares to Microsoft's Surface Book Moreover, rumors of a MacBook 2017 have already begun to circulate. Several patents have suggested, for instance, there may be a future MacBook refresh featuring mobile LTE connectivity. That being said, many patents don’t see the light of day beyond initial filing. Meanwhile, the latest round of MacBook Pros has made this fantasy of fingerprint authentication a reality, thanks to the onboard Touch Bar in certain models. And, as Jony Ive has promptly declared, these are only the first steps in Apple's new direction. Big money Mac Some people expected Apple to discount its refreshed MacBook to sweeten the deal. It didn't. The entry-level model still costs £1,049 ($1,299 or AUS$1,999), around $50/$73/AUS$99 more than the 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro. If the cost remains too high for you, then consider picking up last year's version from Apple's refurb store. While the 2016 refresh is technically the better machine, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two when undertaking low-level tasks such as surfing the web or typing up documents in Pages. At the time of writing, the entry-level version is on there for £749 (around $1,108 or AUS$1,457) alongside eight other models of varying specs and price. First reviewed: April 2015 Gabe Carey has also contributed to this review ABOUT THE AUTHOR Kane Fulton Kane has been fascinated by the endless possibilities of computers since first getting his hands on an Amiga 500+ back in 1991. These days he mostly lives in realm of VR, where he's working his way into the world Paddleball rankings in Rec Room.

You can also get it with a seventh-generation Core i5 or i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. HP As for HP’s new Envy all-in-one, it has a 27-inch quad-HD IPS touchscreen, with a 4K option is coming soon. You'll find a 9.5mm bezel, a pedestal design, Intel’s latest Core i5 or i7 processors, and an optional Nvidia GTX950M graphics card. HP is also updating its Envy Display. It's now a 27-inch 4K monitor with an IPS panel (178-degree viewing angles and 99 percent sRGB color gamut). It comes with plenty of ports, too. HP The new HP Spectre x360 will be available sometime in October starting at $1,159, while the new Envy 13 will cost $849 and the Envy all-in-one will start at $1,249 when they launch this month. HP also said the Envy Display will launch in December for $499.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Your next car may be the most powerful computer you own Your next car may be the most powerful computer you own By David Cardinal on October 5, 2016 at 10:00 am Comment Mobile computing originally meant laptops, then smartphones. Increasingly, though, new cars are powerful computing platforms — and starting to pack more compute power than laptops and even desktops. That trend is set to explode with the introduction of more-extensive automated safety features and self-driving options. Stuffed with CPUs, GPUs, cameras, sensors, and networking hardware, cars are driving the state of the art in many technologies. In particular, the growing use of cameras, and AI-inspired software to analyze their captured video in real time are driving an explosion in compute power found in cars. Beyond the backup Camera: Bird’s eye-view and more Most of us are familiar with the soon-to-be-mandatory backup cameras that provide an invaluable aid for getting in and out of parking spaces and driveways. But high-end vehicles now feature quite a few more cameras, in front to scout traffic and detect lane lines, on the sides to help them avoid other vehicles, and all-around to provide a very cool “bird’s-eye” view of the car and its surroundings. While the sensors in these cameras are typically fairly standard, the systems require a lot of innovation in image processing to make them effective. For example, Infiniti’s bird’s-eye, 360-degree, simulated view stitches together images from four ultra-wide-angle cameras (on the side mirrors, grille, and license holder) and then corrects the substantial distortion to provide a more-or-less natural-looking view of the car from above. This makes it much easier to park accurately and to maneuver in tight spaces, as you can see in this promotional video: Even the now commonplace backup cameras are getting upgraded, thanks to the availability of more computing power and an assist from machine learning software. Many of the image processors coupled to these cameras are now augmented with object recognition to help prevent collisions with pedestrians, and some are integrated with rear cross-traffic sensors as well. Silicon vendors have been racing to outdo each other with auto-specific application processors and architectures — easily visible by attending an Embedded Vision Alliance event. Mobileye, the leading provider of both after-market and OEM camera-based vehicle safety systems, has both a custom vision processing chip, the SeeQ2, and board, the EyeQ2, inside its 500-series add-on vehicle safety cameras. Interestingly, the system’s image sensor is only VGA resolution, but it features very-high dynamic range, to allow for operation in tricky lighting conditions. In parallel, Intel has just snapped up vision chip startup Movidius, with automotive expected to be a key market for its high-performance, low-power, Myriad family of chips. Xilinx wants to provide the silicon to be the eyes, ears, and much of the brain of your future car The after-market Mobileye systems only serve to warn the driver, and aim to provide at least two seconds of advance notice of a potential accident. Cameras tied into automated safety systems have the additional need to accurately estimate object distances in addition to their position and motion, since they directly control braking and possibly other car functions. This is often accomplished by aligning the images from multiple cameras and using software to compute the depth of objects based on the disparity of where they appear in each camera’s image. However, that approach is far from foolproof. Most of the time there is at least one additional radar or lidar that has its data fused in real time with the vision data to achieve better results in a wider-variety of conditions. Cameras for style and fun In the future, cameras may take on even more roles. For example, Tesla and other auto manufacturers have proposed that the requirement for side-view mirrors be relaxed to allow low-profile cameras to do the job. Coupled with an internal monitor, the result would be a more aerodynamic profile for the car, especially helpful for range-hungry electric vehicles. Also, look for dash cams to become more common as a factory-installed option instead of only as a consumer add-on. In the meantime, user-installed dash cams don’t have to be just about safety and recording accidents. Waylens’s new Horizon dash cam will couple with an OBD2 connector to provide you with action-cam-like footage of your adventures overlaid with car performance data. Radar and lidar used to augment machine vision While cameras are currently the only way to perform certain important functions like tracking lane lines, for other tasks like collision avoidance, they aren’t always the best solution. They can be fooled by some high-contrast scenes (which may be what happened in the now infamous Florida Tesla crash), can’t always estimate the distance to other vehicles or objects accurately, and don’t do well in poor weather. For that reason, almost all autonomous vehicle projects also feature one or more non-visual ways to “see” objects in the world around them — typically either radar or lidar. Tesla has just shifted its primary sensing system from its Mobileye-designed cameras to its in-vehicle radar, after a heavy investment in advanced signal processing to help keep the radar from getting confused by metallic objects and other edge cases. Many current “self-driving” car projects, including Google’s, rely on lidar, which is harder to fool, but so far is still larger and more expensive than radar or cameras. Velodyne, the leading maker of automotive lidar, expects prices to continue to fall, though. So expect to see at least some use of radar, and eventually lidar, in nearly every new car in a few years. An exception to the typical use of radar or lidar for autonomous vehicles is Nvidia’s DAVE2, which essentially taught itself to drive using a neural network trained in the cloud using only camera data from real cars, and accompanying time-synced steering data. While its goals, so far at least, are much more limited, and research-oriented, than those of the car companies, it’s impressive that it’s able to drive correctly on a variety of roads after just a few months of learning, and using only vision input. A supercomputer in your trunk Whether an augmented car only uses cameras, or fuses their output with other sensors, a tremendous amount of data is collected, that needs to be analyzed and acted on in real time. In addition, vehicle telematics, GPS, and map data all need to be integrated for any truly autonomous car. All that data requires quite a bit of horsepower to process. While the main training of the AI systems used for self-driving can be done in the cloud on massive computing clusters, the car itself needs to both run the resulting neural network (or other resulting algorithm) in real time, and also adapt to changing conditions, possibly incorporating new training data that is cloud-sourced from other drivers. Almost every autonomous vehicle project now includes some type of support for learning from all of its vehicles as they drive and gather performance and map data — like the one Nvidia and TomTom just announced. The low-end CPU that controls your engine, or your entertainment system, isn’t up to the task of automatically navigating your car through traffic. The result has been innovation in what are essentially portable supercomputers. Nvidia’s Drive PX 2 is showing up at the high-end in fully-autonomous test vehicles (others like the Google cars have several traditional computers crammed into their trunks). Nvidia has now released a compact, low-power, version of Drive for basic automated safety functions, while its larger siblings are designed for more-complex autonomous applications. When most of us think of computing in our car, we think about the infotainment system — which in itself has become quite a technology hotbed. But increasingly, the real computer power in your car will be used for the AI-assisted, vision and spatial sensing systems that help you to drive, or help the car to drive you. Just like the once-far-fetched idea of using your car battery to power your house has become a possibility with Tesla’s battery systems, it may be that at some point you’ll be running your high-end games on your car’s GPU while it sits in the garage, and streaming them to your TV.

The Verge has the news. “The new Spectre x360 maintains the outgoing version’s ability to rotate the display behind the keyboard, but it has a narrower design thanks to its edge-to-edge display. The new model is a full 11.8mm narrower than before and now has a quad speaker array.” HP updates its Spectre x360 with an edge-to-edge screen and bigger battery https://t.co/ztzcKxvgV7 pic.twitter.com/2JqHK0GHi1 — The Verge (@verge) October 12, 2016 The article adds that HP says the Spectre x360 can now last for up to 15 hours between charges (a 25 percent improvement) thanks to its larger battery and improved efficiencies throughout the system. It will also be housed with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor. However, many of the commenters after the article are rather suspicious of HP’s latest offering. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFsulBe_NiY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> “Hope they fix overheat issues in x360 and crappy drivers (but maybe I should blame Intel). It was first of my notebooks that hang right out of the box. But ash and silver version is very beautiful indeed,” says BelikovSergey. “My x360 was great (though I never actually used it as a tablet; I just enjoyed the heft it had as a laptop), then 1 year later it stopped charging. Stopped working with the adapter plugged in… It’s the last HP I’ll ever buy,” claims Fueledbygin, adding that HP wanted to charge him $300. The original x360 has been a huge hit for HP. Laptop Magazine gave it four stars. “The HP Spectre x360 13t is a premium 2-in-1 with the looks and performance to back it up. Its sexy chassis (especially in black and gold), accurate screen, powerful audio and strong performance make it an Editors’ Choice pick. We just wish the bottom ran cooler.” The review especially praised the quad-HD display and the powerful speakers. CNET also gave the HP Spectre x360 four stars. “Two years running, the HP Spectre x360 offers incredible value for the money. Its slim, premium aluminum frame houses a speedy processor, comfortable keyboard and touchpad, plenty of full-size ports, a beautiful touchscreen and a surprising amount of battery life under the hood,” claimed critic Sean Hollister, adding that the only downsides are the fact that it’s a little chunkier than the competition (the new version fixes that), and that the glossy screen can produce distracting reflections. The Dell XPS 13 is currently the hottest Windows laptop. [Image by Daryl Deino] Regarding Windows laptops, it’s obvious that the HP Spectre x13 is going after the market’s top 13-inch laptop, the Dell XPS 13. Dell’s laptop, which has an edge-to-edge 3,200 x 1,800-pixel display (better resolution than the x13), has been called a “MacBook killer,” a “MacBook Air killer,” and even a “MacBook Pro killer.” Those who are planning to buy an XPS 13 may want to hold off for just a little bit. The Next Web reports that Dell is turning their hit laptop into a tablet convertible. “Dell has confirmed to TNW that it’s refreshing the XPS 13 with a convertible design. The laptop appears to be keeping the edge-to-edge ‘InfinityEdge’ display that was its claim to fame, which means Dell will probably have to work some software magic to keep your fingers from activating the display all the time in tablet mode.” Apple will likely update its MacBook Pro line at the end of October. [Image by Bryan Thomas/Getty Images] Then, there are the new MacBook Pros rumored to be coming out at the end of October. According to BGR, Apple’s new notebooks will have a secondary touchscreen display. Other sources say the new Pros will be thinner, lighter, and more powerful. Thanks to HP, Apple, and Dell, this holiday season will be great for consumers looking for a new laptop.

Cesar Leon) VIEW ORIGINAL NORTH FORT HOOD, Texas-- Soldiers from the 369th Sustainment Brigade recently completed their final phase of training here, in preparation for deployment to Kuwait. During the unit's post-mobilization training at Fort Hood Soldiers took part in a Mission Readiness Exercise that resembled a recent "Warfighter" exercise the brigade headquarters took part in at Fort Carson, Colorado, earlier in the year. The difference? Refinement of their skills to better prepare the unit for how things are done in Kuwait. The purpose of the Warfighter is to train Soldiers how to perform their duties in a combat environment. However, the MRX, conducted by First Army Division West and the United States Army Reserves 75th Training Division at Fort Hood, focuses on skill refinement and what units will encounter while deployed to Kuwait. "They have Soldiers here (Fort Hood) from the current unit that are there (Kuwait) now to give some real world things that are going on there now," said Warrant Officer Claudiann A. Atkinson, 1st Sustainment Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, about the MRX. Atkinson also emphasized the importance of the MRX because of how it gives the unit materials and experiences they need to be familiar with the areas they are going to so when they get there it's a more familiar place. The importance of the training at Fort Carson, Indiantown Gap, and Fort Hood was not lost on the Soldiers of the 369th, especially those new to the ranks. "As a newer Soldier to the unit, and the Army in general, our training was essential," said Spc. Kyle Beckley, an Intelligence Analyst for the 369th Sustainment Brigade. "The training provided life-like simulations in a tactical environment that helped me acclimate both to my duties as an Intel Analyst, and also as a member of the team," Beckley added. When the 369th Sustainment Brigade's MRX kicked off there were some bumps in the road. As with any team or organization each section needed to find their rhythm and get in sync to work towards the end goal of becoming a cohesive team. "I feel as unit you are better at the end of training then at the beginning," said Atkinson. "Initially there were some synchronization issues and some sections didn't really completely understand their roles and responsibilities," she added. "From then until now there has been a drastic change," added Atkinson. "Everyone needs to understand their roles and responsibilities and they need to communicate together if they want to complete the mission effectively." The intent of all the training the unit has conducted over the past year is to help prepare them for the mission ahead. Over the years things like political climate change making it difficult to train for every possible condition or scenario. But that doesn't make training less important. "You need to be prepared because every war is going to be different, you can't train the same way that you did for your first deployment that you are going to do for this deployment. It is not always going to be the same. That is why this training is so important," said Atkinson. At the end of the day readiness is the key to success and the Soldiers of the 369th feel they are ready to take on the challenge and are confident in their abilities to succeed. "Our team proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are ready, willing and able to stand in the wake of real world events and adjust, adapt, and overcome anything that presents itself," said Sgt. 1st Class Charles Tomsella, assistant NCOIC, Current Operations Assistant. Soldiers also completed training they didn't complete during the unit's pre-mobilization training conducted at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, August 8-27. Soldiers qualified on their assigned weapon and also completed counter-IED training.

ARB_enhanced_layouts Lands In Mesa Git, Rounds Out OpenGL 4.4 For RadeonSI Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 12 October 2016 at 02:15 PM EDT. 42 Comments The work by Nicolai Hähnle on finishing up the GL_ARB_enhanced_layouts extension for Gallium3D is now in Git. This officially marks RadeonSI done with OpenGL 4.4 and is effectively done with OpenGL 4.5 although the new version string is yet to be advertised. With today's Git, ARB_enhanced_layouts is enabled for RadeonSI, LLVMpipe, and Softpipe drivers, alongside the existing Intel Mesa i965 DRI driver support. The Nouveau NVC0 driver also has patches available to make use of this code too, it just hasn't been merged to Git as of writing. ARB_enhanced_layouts was the last extension needed for OpenGL 4.4 while all OpenGL 4.5 extensions are already done with RadeonSI. As explained previously, while OpenGL 4.5 extensions are done, OpenGL 4.5 isn't being exposed at this time since the driver hasn't yet officially passed the Khronos conformance test suite for OpenGL 4.5 compliance. The Intel driver is in a similar boat with being "done" with OpenGL 4.5 while it only officially advertises OpenGL 4.4 for the moment. These latest Mesa changes will be found in Mesa 13.0 due out in November. 42 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

(Michelle Brence/The Oregonian) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 12, 2016 at 11:15 AM, updated October 12, 2016 at 4:22 PM comments Tech companies have contributed nearly $900,000 to the fight against Measure 97, which would impose a new 2.5 percent tax on many companies' sales inside the state. Half that money comes from Comcast, whose cable subscription revenues would presumably be subject to the tax. But many of the state's other big tech names are contributing, too, reflecting concern that the measure would function differently for them than it would for other companies. Tech donations to oppose Measure 97 Opponents have raised $17 million to fight Measure 97. Supporters have raised $7.5 million. Tech companies have contributed nearly $900,000 to the campaign against the tax initiative; no big Oregon tech names have donated to the campaign to win passage. Here's a list: Comcast: $465,000 Jive Software: $100,000 Amazon.com: $75,000 Intel: $50,000 CenturyLink: $50,000 Oregon Cable Telecommunications Association: $50,000 Act-On Software: $25,000 Navex Global: $20,000 Consumer Cellular: $10,000 SureID: $10,000 Jay Haladay (former CEO of Viewpoint Construction Software): $5,000 Frontier Communications: $5,000 New Relic: $5,000 Smarsh: $2,500 Cloudability: $2,500 Voyager Capital: $500 Measure 97 would produce $3 billion a year, which supporters say could revive Oregon education funding and provide other key social services. The initiative's authors say they wrote the initiative to hit out-of-state companies doing business in Oregon. But a provision of existing state law, applied to software companies under Measure 97, appears to tax software companies on all their sales – wherever they take place. That's prompted a rare outcry from Oregon tech companies, which are usually silent on the big issues facing the state. Contributors to the campaign against Measure 97 include tech giants like Intel and Amazon, as well as much smaller, homegrown tech businesses like Portland startup Cloudability. (No big names in Oregon tech appear among the campaign contributors supporting the initiative.) Gov. Kate Brown, a supporter, has said that if Measure 97 passes, the Legislature should amend it so software companies and service businesses are treated the same as other Oregon companies under the law. The measure's backers welcomed Brown's proposal. And Rep. Phil Barnhart, chairman of the House Revenue Committee and another Measure 97 supporter, told The Oregonian/OregonLive he expects lawmakers would approve such an amendment. It's impossible to know for sure, though, just how lawmakers would respond as they grappled with the measure's broad implications during the next legislative session. Software stands out under Measure 97 because Oregon corporate taxes generally apply only to sales that take place inside the state. There's an exception, though, for service businesses like software. In that case, the tax is levied based on where the service is produced – even if companies sell their final products in another state or another country. The effect of the tax hike on Oregon's biggest companies – Intel and Nike – will be tiny. That's because they aren't software companies, and because their sales inside the state are relatively small. Still, concerns about the initiative go beyond software. Oregon tech finds its voice in tax fightVeteran Silicon Forest finance executive Ray Link, now on the board of Electro Scientific Industries and other big Oregon tech companies, warns it could make it more problematic to do business in the state. "An example is a company that makes test equipment in Oregon for the Oregon semiconductor industry," he wrote in an email. "This company will see a 2.5 percent increase in costs whereas a smaller out of state competitor company will not. The Oregon-based company will have to absorb the added cost to remain competitive." Tigard-based Consumer Cellular reported $620 million in sales last year, providing cell phones and wireless service to more than 2 million customers across the country. It makes many of its sales over the phone to customers of its big retail partner, Target. Chief executive John Marick said Measure 97 could pose a significant threat to his business, because it's not clear whether the initiative would count those national phone sales as in-state transactions subject to the new tax. "If it gets determined that those sales are in Oregon, then we're in big trouble," he said. Additionally, Marick said that he expects Consumer Cellular's suppliers – smartphone makers like Apple – will pass along the tax to the Tigard company on the phones it buys wholesale. His company has contributed $10,000 to the campaign opposing Measure 97. It's probably true, Marick said, that Oregon business was too slow to propose its own plan for overcoming shortfalls in state revenue. Though that needs to be addressed, he said, Measure 97 isn't the right way to go about it. "Our hope would be that it doesn't pass but that it creates the momentum where we say: OK, we need to do something (else)," Marick said. Correction: Jive Software donated $100,000 to the campaign, not $10,000 as this article originally reported. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

IOT Journal RFID Journal RFID Journal ESPAÑOL RFID Journal BRASIL RFID Journal EVENTS RFID Journal AWARDS RFID CONNECT Does One Fewer IoT Standards Equal One Step Closer to Interoperability? On Monday, two groups that have spent the past few years developing competing open-source communication standards for Internet of Things devices announced that they will merge. But there is still plenty of reconciliation to do before consumers can enjoy interoperable IoT devices—if they ever do. By Mary Catherine O'Connor Tags: Consumer, Devices, Open Source, Smart Home, Standards, Technology PDFEmailPrintDefinitionsSave Article Oct 12, 2016— This week opened with big news in the Internet of Things standards community: The Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and the AllSeen Alliance, two groups that have been developing separate open-source frameworks for standardizing the means by which IoT products communicate with each other and connect to networks, have merged. The two organizations' boards have approved a merger under the OCF name and bylaws, which effectively means that AllSeen Alliance is being made part of the OCF. As part of the merger, the two groups will create a unified version of their frameworks—OCF's IoTivity framework, and AllSeen Alliance's AllJoyn framework—both of which use open standards designed to enable connected devices and applications to communicate with each other through a common language, regardless of what operating system or networking protocol they each use. The goal is that by integrating the framework software into the firmware running in two connected devices, they could interoperate—so that, for example, a motion sensor made by company A could tell the light bulb made by company B to turn on when it senses motion—and could do so locally, without relying on an internet connection. Such framework-compliant devices would communicate either directly with each other, via common radios, or via gateways containing multiple radios. The AllSeen Alliance has arguably gotten more done than the OCF—there are 25 AllSeen certified products on the market—while the OCF's framework is younger and it only last week announced that it has opened its first certification labs. Qualcomm and Intel have been the driving forces behind the AllSeen Alliance and OCF, respectively, and the two groups bring with them member bases of around 200 companies each—though there is a good amount of overlap between those member lists. Through the merger, the OCF board of directors now includes representatives from AB Electrolux, CableLabs, Canon, Cisco Systems, GE Digital, Haier, Intel, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics and Technicolor SA. But the news of the two groups merging is not a total surprise, since Qualcomm became a member of the OCF back in February, at which time it said it planned to contribute to both frameworks. (Microsoft and Electrolux also joined the OCF at that time, which coincided with the renaming of the Open Interconnect Foundation to the OCF.) Journalist Stacey Higginbotham, who claims to have sources close to the merger, characterizes it as more of a disbanding of the AllSeen Alliance. She views this as a loss for consumers because the AllJoyn framework is more mature than the OCF's IoTivity. Until IoTivity supports backward compatibility to AllJoyn, she says, the IoT community will still be without a blueprint for industry-wide interoperability. And while progress toward interoperability is slow, new smart-home platforms are emerging at a steady pace. So while on the one hand, two prominent open-source interoperability platform providers have joined forces, on the other, we've got an increasingly crowded marketplace for personal-assistant products for smart-home applications that come with their own, siloed, communications platforms. There's Amazon's Echo device with Alexa, and now Google has introduced a competing product called Home, which uses Google's Weave communications protocol (built on Google's Brillo operating system for the IoT), and now there are rumors that Apple may soon release a personal-assistant product of its own, to showcase its Home interface for iOS10. Until and unless Apple, Amazon and Google decide to join the OFC or in some other way pledge to make their products interoperable with other smart-home products in the market, a merger between the AllSeen Alliance and the OCF does not do much, on its own, to stem the issues around product interoperability in consumer-facing IoT products. Mary Catherine O'Connor is the editor of IoT Journal and a former staff reporter for RFID Journal. She also writes about technology, as it relates to business and the environment, for a range of consumer magazines and newspapers.

The new Envy 27 all-in-one, Envy 13.3 laptop and Spectre x360 convertible marry slim, attractive designs with high-end performance. Envy AIO 27 Like a high-end television, HP envisions the Envy 27 as the focal point of a large family room. That means it has been designed to stand out, rather than blending into the background. All of the computing hardware, which would usually sit in the all-in-one's display, has been integrated into the base for a slimmer 4K IPS 27-inch screen. And there's a Bang & Olufsen sound bar built into the design, too. Buyers are able to choose from the latest generation quad-core Intel i5 or i7 processors supported by up to 16 GB of DDR4 system memory. For those keen to play the latest games without annoying lag, there's an optional Nvidia GTX950M graphics card coupled with 4 GB of GDDR5 video RAM. Users are able to connect up another display using an HDMI output, or plug in an optical media player or laptop to use the all-in-one as a dumb monitor. USB-C connectivity has also been built in, along with a bunch of USB 3 connectors. Storage is handled by a hybrid SSD/HDD system, with options stretching up to a 256 GB/2 TB combination. Available from this month, pricing will start at US$1,299. Envy 13.3 Designed to blend high-end design with a reasonable pricetag, the 14-mm (0.55-in) thick Envy 13.3 is actually slightly thicker than the model it replaces. According to HP, that's a trade-off worth making, because it allows space for a bigger battery, which offers 14 hours on a single charge. The new Envy 13.3 makes use of a special fast charger to replenish that battery to 90 percent capacity in just 90 minutes. Depending on the spec chosen, the 13.3-inch screen is either a regular full-HD panel or a touchscreen QHD display, both of which stretch from edge-to-edge for a clean look. When it's open, the hinge of the screen props the keyboard up at a more natural typing angle, which should please people who don't like the flat, chiclet keyboards on modern laptops. Solid state storage up to 1 TB is available, and the range-topping Envy 13.3 gets 16 GB of RAM along with an Intel i7 processor. Lower spec models will be powered by an Intel i5. All variants of the laptop come with a USB-C port, along with two USB 3.0 outlets. The Envy 13.3 will also be available this month, pricing kicks off at $849.99. Spectre x360 The Spectre x360 is a refined take on the folding concept it launched last year, with a bigger battery offering up 15 hours on a single charge, and optimized software for use with the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. The new x360 is slimmer than the model it replaces, too. A new display shaves 10 mm (0.4 in) from each side, and the redesigned hinge makes the new 13.8 mm (0.54 in) body ever-so-slightly thinner than before. HP has also managed to lighten the load by 160 grams (0.35 lb). Solid-state storage up to 1 TB is available and, despite its svelte design, the new HP convertible includes two USB-C ports and a regular USB 3.0 connector. The x360 is available from today, prices start at $1,049.99.

It's Easy To Play With The RADV Radeon Vulkan Driver On Ubuntu 16.04 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 12 October 2016 at 10:10 AM EDT. 6 Comments Now that the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver is part of mainline Mesa, it's increasingly easy to experiment with this unofficial, open-source Vulkan driver on rolling-release distributions and through third-party package archives/repositories. One of the popular choices for Linux gamers and enthusiasts on Ubuntu, the Padoka PPA, has added support for building the Radeon Vulkan driver with its most recent update over the weekend. The Padoka PPA is now building its Mesa packages with support for the Radeon Vulkan (RADV) driver to complement the existing Intel Vulkan (ANV) support. The Mesa Git code continues to be built against LLVM 3.0 SVN for the best AMDGPU LLVM back-end support too. Thus Ubuntu users can simply do apt-add-repository ppa:paulo-miguel-dias/mesa && apt update && apt dist-upgrade. Easy as that! This package archive is still important for users running the soon-to-be-released Ubuntu 16.10 since it's unfortunately stuck to Mesa 12.0 and it's not shipping Vulkan support by default. Check out my RADV benchmarks from last week plus some NVIDIA Vulkan comparison numbers and I'll be working on some fresh Linux Intel/Radeon/NVIDIA Vulkan benchmarks in the days ahead. 6 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

We'll be giving away 3 SSDs altogether: 512GB and 1TB versions of the recently launched OCZ VX500 SATA SSD, and a 512GB OCZ RD400 NVMe M.2 SSD. So if you like free stuff and are in the United States, don't hesitate to enter. Meanwhile our Ask The Experts session was a big success, so thank you to everyone who submitted questions for OCZ to answer. In case you missed it, here's a recap of the questions that were answered. What, if anything, has Toshiba done with the Indilinx IP/engineers? Is there a Barefoot successor (i.e. a high performance controller) in the works? Back when we acquired Indilinx it really was somewhat early days in terms of manufacturers developing their own controllers and firmware to not only push the envelope in performance but also to try and take advantage of the latest NAND nodes when it came to driving both capacity and cost improvement. I'm sure you and all the readers here remember how expensive per GB SSDs were just a few years ago, and by bringing the Inidlinx team and IP in house we were able to drive development that positively impacted performance and cost to make SSDs more accessible to consumers. Today the Indilinx team and IP have been completely integrated into our R&D team which also includes the team located in Oxford UK, which was originally acquired from PLX. This combined team is the group that was responsible for creating the Barefoot 3 controller, that is still being used today in our Vector 180 SATA SSD. Over the years the team has continued to develop and enhance the firmware as well, which is why we were able to leverage the BF3 controller for so many different product lines and generations. These engineers are a big part of why we also became part of Toshiba over two years ago, and are now working on next generation controllers and firmware for both enterprise and client SSDs. As part of Toshiba the team now also realizes two major benefits, first the early and complete access to next generation NAND from Toshiba which enables for optimization for future NAND technologies, and second the additional resources. For example all those hardware and firmware engineers here in California are now part of our still growing Toshiba America Storage Research & Design Center (SRDC) which is based in Folsom, CA. and we are continuing to invest in R&D. While I can't go into too much detail on what they are working on I can say that the team is indeed developing next-gen controllers that will be utilized in the Toshiba-OCZ brand for consumers. When VX500 will be available in America and in Europe? Will it replace Trion 150 in pricing anytime soon? We just launched the VX500 Series but it is available now in North America and will be available in Europe this week as well as stock makes its way to our distributor and reseller partners. Here in the US you can find the VX500 at e-tailers now, for example: Newegg: http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&Description=OCZ+VX500&N=-1&isNodeId=1 Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-OCZ-VX500-256GB-VX500-25SAT3-256G/dp/B01LYVB7F8/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1475770873&sr=8-4&keywords=OCZ+VX500 Though many SATA SSDs are pushing the value envelope and using TLC and 3D NAND (ours included) we still saw the need for a mid-range SSD that provides strong performance and endurance for mainstream users. This is why we engineered the VX500 Series with higher endurance MLC NAND, and optimized the firmware for write-intensive environments. Because the VX500 utilizes MLC NAND it is going to be more performance and endurance oriented than the TR and TL Series SSDs, which both make use of TLC NAND, and we also bundle it with data migration software. The extra endurance enables us to provide a 5 year warranty on the VX line as well. So while we will try and make the VX500 as accessible as possible to consumers the build costs are higher with MLC and users can still expect the TR and TL lines to be the more aggressively priced lines for more value oriented consumers. What do you guys see as the most important aspect to focus on for making a successful SSD: Capacity, Performance, Price The importance of all 3 of these factors has shifted over the years with things like controller limitations, SATA 3 saturation, and manufacturing technology affecting each of them. Obviously all 3 of those need to be in balance to have a well-rounded product, but every product focuses on 1-2 of those aspects at the expense of the other(s). Certainly with OCZ and Toshiba now being best buds, you guys have more ability than ever to be able to pick and choose what the tech specs of your drives are and really push the envelope in any of those 3 areas and so it'll be exciting to watch OCZ products over the next few years! In addition to those 3 areas, reliability and quality are also areas we focus on, to ensure that the customers have a great experience when using a Toshiba-OCZ product. We really see price to have a direct correlation to capacity as the die capacity continue to increase. As you'd stated, with SATA bus saturating, for the SATA space we are more focused on bringing affordable SSD product to the market, migrating customers from conventional hard drive over to solid state technology. We are currently more focused on pushing the performance envelop on the NVMe platforms as there is much more head room. What do you see in the near future (next 1-5 years) for NVMe/ PCIe/ SATA and other interfaces? What kind of longevity technologies are expected in the near future (next 1-5 years)? The initial concept work on NVMe began back in 2009, with the 1.0 specification released in 2011. Although NVMe drives were piloted in some OEM applications, we really didn't see consumer adoption begin till last year and not really take off until this year. So yeah, propagation of new standards takes quite a bit of time (see: DDR3/4, USB-C, Thunderbolt, etc.) In the immediate future (1-5 years) NVMe will still be ramping up and hitting its stride. In terms of the next 5 years, NVMe was specifically architected for generic non-volatile storage, not just NAND. So the working group tried to future proof it for whatever next generation storage technologies come down the line in the hopes that we can continue to use it rather than have to start this whole standards body process from scratch again. So I see NVMe taking over as the dominant interface going forward, with minor iterations on the specification. The other bump will be to PCIe gen. 4, but still running NVMe. What do you consider to be your target markets? Do you have plans to offer higher capacity PCIe drives for workstation type applications? Our target markets have changed over the years, but I'm pleased that we are now getting back to our enthusiast consumer roots. Today the target market for the Toshiba-OCZ brand is focused on end-users, and especially performance oriented users. While we have previously serviced OEM and enterprise markets those customers are being driven by the core Toshiba side of our business. The Toshiba-OCZ branded products are being developed specifically with end-user platforms, applications, and workloads in mind. For us Workstation customers absolutely reside in our enthusiast and power user target market. In terms of future PCIe solutions we not only plan to offer higher capacity drives for workstation type applications we are already developing them. Our RD400 M.2 PCIe/NVMe SSD was among the first 1TB M.2 drives that was readily available for end-users, and the RD400 found a lot of homes in the systems of both gamers and workstation users. With the latest Toshiba NAND we will be driving the density 2TB and beyond with the next generation PCIe SSDs. Are there plans to support TCG OPAL + IEEE 1667 in the future? It is marketed as "eDrive" (Encrypted Drive) by Microsoft for Bitlocker and also supported in both Linux and Windows by open source tools provided the Drive Trust Alliance https://www.drivetrust.com/apps/ Simple answer is yes; adding e-Drive support is something we are looking into for our SSDs, and by extension our software user tools. What is the number one problem with failed SSDs, does it have to do with NAND wear, or is it controller/firmware issues that caused the drive to lock itself in a panic mode state, and not accepting any commands from BIOS to identify the drive anymore? I will say that i rarely have seen SSDs fail due to NAND wear. This doesn't mean there aren't any. Thankfully, the percentage of people that would put a client drive in a high-end, high traffic server is miniscule.  The latter scenario you have described is something we have seen. As a result, we've worked with engineering and end users to understand better what has occurred at the time of failure so that we can make corrections where appropriate. What does OCZ see as the future/successor of current 2.5” SATA drives? Their high capacity is nice, but SATA III less so. M.2/PCIe drives are fast, but their capacity is limited. Is it U.2? Or do we stick with SATA 3 for longer? I think you actually answered your own question, the only value 2.5" SATA III drives currently provide are capacity, cost, and socket adoption. So once NAND density can provide affordable high capacity in an M.2 form factor and more motherboards in consumers' hands have M.2 slots, 2.5" SATA will start to fade rapidly. That point is probably sooner than people realize, within the next few years. In terms of U.2 it has its applications, but will be relegated to more of a high end niche while M.2 dominates the market. Both form factors currently utilize the same interface, so there's no base bandwidth difference. U.2's main advantage is surface area, which provides benefits to capacity and thermal management. The disadvantages compared to M.2 are cost and cabling. As noted above, NAND density will hit a point where an M.2 can provide sufficient capacity in that form factor. I know, I know, you can never have enough capacity, but from what we've seen there's effectively a price ceiling consumers are willing to pay for their storage. OCZ actually had one of the first 1TB drives on the market back in 2011. It cost around $1,300 and we sold, well, let's say not as many as we had hoped. The 1TB segment didn't really take off until 2 years later when Crucial released a 1TB m500 for $500, then it started flying. Of course there are always going to be the enthusiasts for whom money is no object, give me the best possible, but in general it seems customers don't want to be spending more on their storage than their graphics cards. So keeping that in mind, as long as we can fit enough capacity up to that price ceiling in an M.2, the value proposition for a U.2 starts to get less appealing. Now thermals are the other advantage U.2 has, it's definitely easier to cool that bigger surface area. And better cooling can improve performance, either by operating in a higher power envelope or by limiting the instances of thermal throttling. But while instances of thermal throttling on M.2 can be demonstrated in bench testing, it happens much less frequently in real world workloads. (Protip: once motherboard manufacturers realized putting the M.2 sockets directly under the main GPU was not the best idea, things got a LOT better.) So we can eek out a bit more performance on a U.2, but it's going to cost a non-trivial amount more than the M.2: added connector cost, cables, heatsink, bigger PCB, more NAND packages, etc. Making a number up, let's say $50 more for a drive that thermal throttles less frequently, but otherwise is the same capacity and performance as an M.2. The last factor is that despite Intel's best efforts we still don't have wide adoption of native U.2 sockets on consumer motherboards, you're plugging into a U.2 > M.2 adapter anyways. So I definitely think there's a potential enthusiast niche for a high end U.2 and we may still productize one eventually, but it would be a much smaller market segment than M.2. Also, most of the reviewers and system builders I've talked too much prefer M.2. It's a cleaner look, less cabling to run and less use of the drive bays either means better small form factor PCs or better airflow and watercooling room. I'd love to hear what OCZ have as their silver bullet against Samsung SSD's. Samsung just look like a behemoth waiting to take over the entirety of the SSD market. Say it ain’t so, OCZ! Tell us what you've got that'll make yours the SSD to buy. Long answer short, there really isn't a silver bullet per-say. We do respect the competition and it's certainly a good thing for consumers that there are multiple providers in the space. While there is no easy answer here we do have a strategy, and at the highest level that is to really focus on the real needs of end-user consumers. We often get the question, after OCZ was acquired by Toshiba why did we keep the "OCZ" brand? It was all a matter of focus. Today OCZ is a sub-brand of Toshiba and the team was not only kept intact but was given additional resources in which to improve quality, reliability, and invest in developing next generation products specifically with performance oriented end users in mind. Our team has tried to stay nimble in this fast moving market, keeping that innovative DNA, while being able to leverage all that being part of a FAB has to offer. An example of all of this coming together was the recent launch of our RD400. Rather than just launch a M.2 module we wanted to specifically service the complete spectrum of end users and offered it in both standalone module and AIC PCIe/NVMe versions. This gives end users the flexibility to adopt the product even if their platforms/desktops did not have a M.2 slot. It also enables end-users to leverage the product now, depopulate the drive from the AIC adapter, and use it in a mobile platform in the future. We thought about how we could really develop products that were not only fast, but were easy to use now and in the future by our customers. Combine all that with the fact that Toshiba makes some of the highest quality NAND in the world, and that we are able to develop products with complete access to those future storage technologies, and we believe we can create compelling solutions. We were born from the consumer market,and while we know that the competition is fierce, we also believe that if we develop products that really address the needs of our valued end-users such as yourself then we can compete. Any 2TB or 4TB SSDs in the pipeline? Yes! Our pipeline has some very exciting products, and among them are higher density offerings! So far it seems like drive manufacturers have kept bringing down SSD prices by increasingly utilizing TLC NAND. Now that TLC is so prevalent, what’s the next shift to bring down prices further? Larger die capacity will continue to drive the $/GB down, and as already seen in some of our products, going DRAM-less also helps in reducing the drive cost especially for the lower capacity drives (120GB-240GB). System on Chip where the controller and flash are integrated into single package also reduces cost on the silicon, as well as reducing PCB size and cost. What are your thought on 3D XPoint? Do you guys see this as competition to your business or do you see it as a separate category? We're still waiting to see how the 3D XPoint stuff turns out, but based on the presentations Intel has provided thus far it seems to be positioned as a separate tier of storage between DRAM and SSD, leaning more towards expanding the DRAM pool. I believe it'll more directly compete with NVDIMM technologies in the enterprise space. But I guess we'll find out! How do you see PCs in 5 years’ time? Dominated by Laptops or some other (possibly new) form factor? The distinction between RAM and Storage becoming blurred or completely removed? What's the vision you're building towards? I think 5 years is still a very short amount of time (see my answer on how it took longer than 5 years just to get NVMe out), so by then more of the same. Laptops and convertibles (I'm currently answering all these off my Surface) will dominate the workplace and a lot of homes. Desktop PCs will stick around for content creation and gaming (PC masterrace, yo), but laptops/convertibles and tablets are starting to get powerful enough to handle the bulk of what people traditionally used PCs for (my mom uses her ipad more than anything else). I think the rise of mobile is interesting and we've invested into BGA SSDs for that reason, but phones as primary computing devices are still a ways off. We'll need to see how Xpoint and other future storage technologies shake out, but its doubtful DRAM ever goes away completely. It may just shrink and get integrated into SoCs so it becomes less visible, but there's still a role for it. For years, conventional wisdom has suggested that SSDs are not suitable for long term storage of data. With SSDs increasing in size and declining in price, consumers will certainly not think twice about buying SSDs for long term storage. Do the warnings concerning the integrity of data in untouched files over the period of years still hold for modern SSDs? Yes, data retention on unpowered SSDs is an unfortunate side effect of how NAND is architected. Kristian wrote about it some here when one of the scare articles came out: http://www.anandtech.com/show/9248/the-truth-about-ssd-data-retention The JEDEC standard for client SSDs requires drives to retain data unpowered for 1 full year once the endurance has been exhausted. This can be affected by temperature and it was that realization that prompted the scare a year ago. As a manufacturer we always insist on the importance of maintaining proper backups, it's just a necessary factor of life. But to answer your long term storage question, I would not recommend SSDs for long term storage, no. What we see are the media for storage shifting down along the traditional hierarchy, with SSDs taking over the main computing storage slot traditional hard drives occupied, and hard drives shifting into the long term storage slot where tape has been dominant. For example, a few years ago the conventional wisdom was to have a small SSD as your OS drive and a larger HDD for media and other data storage. Today my personal setup is an NVMe drive as my OS (*cough*OCZ RD400*cough*), with a 1TB TLC drive as my Steam folder (something, something, TR150), and then all my large files sit on a 4TB NAS. I then have both cloud and external drive backups. So data retention isn't something I ever worry about in my personal life because if I ever leave my PC off for over a year I'm probably dead (and want my data/browser history gone!) and most of my files are on my NAS and backups anyways. Will we see NVMe drives eventually reach price parity with current SATA/AHCI drives? Does the increasing capacity of SSDs make power loss protection any more important? Absolutely, yes, NVMe drives will hit price and capacity parity with current SATA drives at which point SATA will fade away. This will probably happen sooner than people think, within a few years. In a pure technical sense, as the capacity of an SSD increases so does the size of the mapping table so it's logical to think power loss protection becomes more important. There are two approaches to handling unexpected power loss: increasing the hold up time the drive has to clean up and safely shut down by adding capacitors, or improving the robustness of the firmware and decreasing the amount of work that needs to be done during this additional hold up time, reducing the amount of additional capacitance required. I unfortunately can't go into too much technical detail here as this strays into special sauce territory, but think of similar work and techniques done on the filesystem level like journaling, write verification, and increasingly sophisticated error correction. We tackle the problem from both ends, so the presence, or lack thereof, or large power loss protection capacitors are not necessarily indicative of how robust a drive manages unexpected power loss. In fact, if you check your SMART data you're likely to see some amount of unexpected power losses recorded you didn't even notice. Funnily enough, the trend in the datacenter space is not build in any additional power loss protection on the drive level, but to push the cost down as much as possible and build in redundancy at higher levels. Relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/1737/ How do you see your SSDs holding up in the event of a catastrophic, electronic destroying solar flare? Also, would you have any preservation suggestions to keep data contained on one of your SSDs intact so that it can be put into a time capsule and eventually figured out when rediscovered by a different hypothetical civilization centuries later? And lastly, are you working on SSD solutions to replace eMMC in tablets? Heh, interesting question. I can't honestly say we've generated a catastrophic solar flare in the test lab, but as long as the drives are not physically fried it would depend on how many bits got flipped. The drives are designed with multiple error correction checkpoints in the datapath specifically to catch silent errors from bitflips, so I guess it depends on your definition of "catastrophic". :) In terms of the long term storage I touched on this somewhat here: https://forums.anandtech.com/thread...iveaway-with-ocz.2487888/page-2#post-38507023 But no, due to how NAND functions I don't believe SSDs in their current state are suitable for crazy long term storage like time capsules. In the timeframes you're suggesting even HDDs will have their issues. There are optical discs explicitly designed for archival purposes, but I'll confess to not being an expert on storage in the millenia scale, sorry. Maybe try this? http://www.popularmechanics.com/tec...hard-drive-the-first-immortal-storage-medium/ And yes, earlier this year at CES we demoed an NVMe BGA SSD. These are perfect for mobile applications and much, much faster than eMMC or UFS. http://www.anandtech.com/show/10546/toshiba-announces-new-bga-ssds-using-3d-tlc-nand With a refresh of the Vertex line (VX) will we see the Vector line refreshed soon as well to replace the Vector 180? We tagged the VX500 with the homage to the Vertex name as it slots in quite well as a mainstream product. We envision the Vector brand as a higher end, enthusiast product. The rub is that I believe SATA is shifting towards a value market, it's hard to get excited about squeezing a few more IOPS out of an enthusiast SATA product when we're both bus constrained and massively faster NVMe drives are already here. Why pay a price premium for AN AWESOME SATA drive that nets you a few % points of performance when you can buy an NVMe drive for not a whole lot more and get 5x the performance? We're already seeing the NVMe market split into both high end, and cheaper NVMe, so I feel this is the segment that's going to get a lot more exciting, while SATA becomes cheap bulk storage. The RD400 was branded to recall the RevoDrive line that's been our PCIe hallmark, so that leaves the Vector brand in an odd position. That said, Vector hold a special place in my heart as the original Vector was the first product I solo managed and launched, so I'm gonna have to find some way to bring it back.

Reply Ryan Smith - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link No. We just like giving stuff away.=) Reply hojnikb - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link Could you make it international next time ? It sux for us in EU :) Reply DanNeely - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link The need to comply with ~180 counties different sets of laws make doing international contests legally much more expensive. Unlike Bob's Tech News Blog Purch is too big to just ignore the law and hope no one calls them on it; unfortunately they're also nowhere near large enough to actually afford the team of international lawyers needed to host a near global contest. A few countries on the US Enemies list are out of the question if doing business there, and Quebec charges fees high enough and has other notional consumer protection laws that almost no one not doing a contest specific to the Canada is willing to put up with them. (Thus protecting Quebecois from being allowed to win swag from abroad.) Reply HollyDOL - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link He who really wants looks for solutions, he who doesn't looks for excusses. Reply DanNeely - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link So are you recommending they double the number of ads and/or run much more obnoxous ones to hire an international legal team, or that they break laws all over the planet and hope none of the countries that they work in, travel to trade shows in, or travel through while commuting between the former and home decide to care and arrest them in the airport? Reply HollyDOL - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link Tbh they should at least manage major audience countries like Canada, UK, Australia and perhaps India as AT has (or at least used to have) big audience there. Including none at all and excusing that on this or that is just plain 'cba' attitude. Reply Bullwinkle J Moose - Thursday, October 06, 2016 - link PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE "DO NOT" send me any OCZ SSDs I Love the 10 year Warranty on my Samsung 850 Pros I LOVE the fact that they can Copy and Paste files to and from the same SSD TWICE as fast as the older 840 Pro and almost 32 times Faster than the old Vertex I had When will Anandtech start testing Internal throughput anyway? Speed tests to and from "modern" SSD's are all about the same for SATA3 drives but internal speeds "to and from the same drive" differ quite remarkably Disclaimer: 840 and 850 Pro's were tested using XP-SP2 on SATA2 using IDE protocol in order to directly compare the speeds with OCZ Vertex 1 & 2 drives which are no longer available for testing on newer hardware Do the internal speeds of the new OCZ drives come even remotely close to the new Samsungs? Will they ever have a 10 year warranty? Will you have to give them away or can you actually sell them as well? Sorry, I just had to LOL Reply bigboxes - Friday, October 07, 2016 - link Send me his. Reply Bullwinkle J Moose - Sunday, October 09, 2016 - link Maybe the questions were too hard? Lets try again.... Is it more embarassing to have "experts" that cannot answer a few questions, or "experts" that refuse to answer them?

Trading activity is likely to be somewhat subdued, however, with traders reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the release of the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting. The minutes of the meeting may attract more attention than usual, as last month's decision to leave interest rates unchanged was far from unanimous. Reflecting division within the central bank, Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren voted to raise rates by a quarter point. U.S. stocks fell sharply on Tuesday amid a pullback in oil prices and a rough start to the third quarter earnings season following Alcoa's (AA) weaker than expected results. The major averages opened lower and declined steadily until late trading before moving sideways around the lower levels. The Dow Industrials lost 200.38 points or 1.09 percent before ending at a 2-week low of 18,129, the S&P 500 Index ended down 26.93 points or 1.24 percent at a 3-week low of 2,137 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,247, down 81.89 points to 1.54 percent. Twenty-six of the thirty Dow components ended the session lower and one stock ended unchanged, while the remaining three stocks advanced. Merck (MRK), UnitedHealth (UNH), Intel (INTC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP) and Boeing (BA) were among the biggest decliners among the Dow components. The market witnessed broad based weakness, with gold, housing, semiconductor and biotechnology stocks spearheading the losses. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are inching up $0.02 to $50.81 a barrel after sliding $0.56 to $50.79 a barrel in the previous session. The previous session's pullback came amid the release of the IEA's monthly oil market report, which showed an increase in OPEC production in September. Some price drag also came from profit taking following Monday's rally. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold for December delivery is currently trading at $1,254.40, down $1.50 from the previous session's close of $1,255.90. On Tuesday, gold fell $4.50. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.91 yen compared to the 103.51 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Tuesday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1023 compared to yesterday's $1.1054. Asia Most Asian markets retreated, tracking the weak lead from Wall Street overnight. The Singaporean and Japanese markets led the retreat in the region, although the South Korean and Taiwanese markets notched modest gains. The Japanese market retreated as the yen sell-off stalled. The Nikkei 225 Index opened lower and moved roughly sideways for the rest of the session. The index ended down 184.76 points or 1.09 percent at 16,840. Food, retail, textile, chemical, pharma, resource, financial, real estate, export and utility stocks all came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index also languished below the unchanged line, although amid some volatility. The index ended 7 points or 0.13 percent lower at 5,555. Material, IT and energy stocks were among the worst hit, but financial, healthcare, telecom and real estate stocks found some strength. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 23,407, down 142.47 points or 0.60 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite ended down 6.75 points or 0.22 percent at 3,059. On the economic front, data released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that core machinery orders fell 2.2 percent month-over-month in August, smaller than the 4.6 percent drop expected by economists. Annually, orders rose a better than expected 11.6 percent. The results of a survey by Westpac showed that confidence among consumers in Australia rose in October, with the corresponding index rising 1.1 percent to 102.4. Europe European stocks opened lower and showed volatility in early trading. The major averages in the region are currently in the red. In corporate news, gold miner Fresnillo reported higher third quarter gold production and said it is on track to meet its fiscal year production guidance. On the economic front, the German Federal Statistical Office reported that wholesale prices in Germany fell at a slower annual rate in September, with the 0.3 percent drop the slowest since July 2013. A report released by Eurostat showed industrial production in the euro area rising more than expected in August, both sequentially and year-over-year. France's inflation doubled as initially estimated in September, final data from statistical office Insee showed. Consumer prices advanced 0.4 percent annually, faster than the 0.2 percent increase seen in August. This was the fastest growth since October 2014, when inflation was 0.5 percent. U.S. Economic Reports Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George is scheduled to give a speech about payment systems at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's Annual Payment Symposium at 9:40 am ET. The speech will be followed by an audience Q&A. The Treasury Department is set to announce the results of its auctions of 3-year and 10-year notes at 1 pm ET. At 2 pm ET, the Federal Reserve is due to release the minutes of the September FOMC meeting, when the Fed chose to stand pat. Stocks in Focus Shares of Ericsson (ERIC) are likely to come under pressure in early trading after the mobile networking company warned its third quarter results will be significantly lower than expectations. Cybersecurity company Fortinet (FTNT) may also see early weakness after lowering its guidance for third quarter earnings and revenues. On the other hand, shares of Voxx International (VOXX) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the consumer electronics company reported a second quarter profit compared to a year-ago loss. PC makers are likely to be in focus after Gartner announced that worldwide PC shipments totaled 68.9 million units, a 5.7 percent year-over-year drop. This marked the 8th consecutive quarterly decrease. Lenovo was the leader of the pack, as it increased its market share to 20.9 percent from 20.2 percent in the year-ago quarter, although unit shipments fell 2.4 percent. HP Inc. (HPQ) grew its shipments by 2.3 percent and increased its market share by 1.6 percentage points to 20.4 percent. Dell also saw market share and unit shipment growth. Apple (AAPL) saw a 13.4 percent slump in shipment growth and lost share. Nasdaq announced that Shire (SHPG) will become a component of the NASDAQ-100 Index and the NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index prior to the market open on October 19, 2016. Packaging Corp. of America (PKG) announced an agreement to buy substantially all the assets of Columbus Container for $100 million in cash. With the deal, the company expects its containerboard integration levels to increase by over 30,000 tons. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Top Stories European Shares Seen Extending Gains Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Asian Markets In Positive Territory Japanese Market Advances UPS Strike Could Put Wrench In Holiday Shipping Find McRib With Your Phone Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Obama's Job Approval Rating Jumps To Four-Year High Americans Optimistic Trump Will Improve The Economy Tech CEO Threatens To Shoot President-Elect Trump Giuliani Reportedly New Favorite To Be Secretary Of State Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags <<Previous        61 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Facebook Says Stops Allowing Ads To Target Ethnic Groups United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Erickson Says Bankruptcy Court Approves Interim DIP Financing Sumitomo Electric Starts Operation Of CPV Power Generation Plant In Morocco Allianz Group Q3 Profit Climbs; Confirms 2016 Operating Profit Outlook NTT H1 Profit Up, Sales Down; Lifts FY Profit View, Cuts Sales Forecast Bechtle Q3 Profit Rises; Outlook For Year Adjusted Upwards Innogy 9-month Profit Declines; Confirms Forecast - Quick Facts SIG 4-Month Revenues Rise, LFL Revenues Down; CEO Stuart Mitchell Steps Down Konami Q2 Profit Rises, Revenues Down - Quick Facts ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

This merger will advance interoperability between connected devices from both groups, enabling the full operating potential of IoT and representing a significant step towards a connected ecosystem. The newly merged groups will collaborate on future OCF specifications, as well as the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects. The expanded OCF board of directors will consist of executives from a wide array of leading companies: AB Electrolux, Arçelik A.S., ARRIS International plc, CableLabs, Canon, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., GE Digital, Haier, Intel, LG Electronics, Inc., Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, and Technicolor SA. OCF will now sponsor both the IoTivity and AllJoyn open source projects at The Linux Foundation. Both projects will collaborate to support future versions of the OCF specification in a single IoTivity implementation that combines the best of both technologies into a unified solution. Current devices running on either AllJoyn or IoTivity solutions will be interoperable and backward-compatible. Companies already developing IoT solutions based on either technology can proceed with the confidence that their products will be compatible with the unified IoT standard that the industry has been asking for. The merger is designed to leverage the strengths of each organization. To this merger, the AllSeen Alliance brings its diverse, global membership, proven AllJoyn technology, and millions of AllJoyn enabled products into the market through the AllJoyn Certified program. OCF brings its deep membership roster, formal IoT standards with expertise across multiple vertical markets and cloud-native architecture as implemented within the IoTivity framework. Together, these strengths create an organization that establishes the broad interoperability needed to realize the full market potential for IoT. READ MORE: https://openconnectivity.org/join...

Google has one. Spotify has had one for years. Now Amazon has a music subscription service, too. Like everyone else, Amazon has started selling a $10 monthly service that lets you listen to whatever you want, whenever you want, on any device you want, without ads. But Amazon is also offering two versions of the service that its rivals don’t: An $8-a-month version of the service for its Amazon Prime subscribers, and a $4-a-month version of the service that will only work on Amazon’s line of Echo speakers. (That’s the one we told you about in August. You’re welcome!) Amazon’s entry into the subscription music business would be noteworthy on its own, since Amazon is a giant tech company with big money and ambitions. But the fact that it has broken the $10-a-month barrier for on-demand, ad-free music is the real news here. Digital music services, most recently Apple, have tried pushing the retail price for on-demand music below $10 a month for years, without success. Amazon has done it with a combination of brute force and creative thinking. It got the labels to agree to the $4 service that only works on Amazon devices by telling the labels that it would act as a gateway to more expensive services. And it appears to have launched the $8 service simply by paying up: As far as the music labels are concerned, Amazon owes them as much for each subscriber on the $8 service as it does for $10 subscribers. That is: Amazon is subsidizing the difference. So now we’ll have a real-world test of a theory some digital music executives have argued for years: If you lower the price for on-demand music subscriptions, you’ll sell many more subscriptions, and the music industry will grow overall. Time to find out. Meanwhile, if you’ve played with Spotify, or Apple Music, or any other $10-a-month subscription service, then you’ll know what to expect from Amazon Music Unlimited: It has a catalog of about 30 million songs, and you can call them up on any device, including your phone, anytime you want. You can also download them, so you can play them when you’re not connected to the internet. Amazon But Amazon thinks there are lots of people, including a big swath of its customer base, who have yet to sign up for Spotify, or any other service. It’s most interested in that group. This is the same line of thinking that has allowed Apple to sign up 17 million Apple Music subscribers in the last year, so there may be some merit to that. The other distinction that Amazon is playing up is its music service’s integration with Alexa, its voice-activated AI assistant that powers the Echo. You can still operate Amazon Music Unlimited via Amazon’s desktop and mobile interfaces, but Amazon is really hoping that you’ll spend a lot of time asking Alexa to play something for you. Maybe a specific song, or a playlist based on mood, or a style of music. It strikes me that, as smart as Alexa is, someone who spends a lot of time making playlists or hunting for obscure music will be frustrated by Alexa’s limited command set. But then again, odds are very high that kind of person already has a subscription music service. Two other notes: Unlike Apple Music and Tidal, Amazon isn’t launching by promoting special access to megastars like Taylor Swift or Beyonce. Instead it has the same basic catalog that every other service has. But Steve Boom, who runs music for Amazon, says the company isn’t opposed to the idea of exclusives. Amazon Prime used to create all of its media services as value-adds for Amazon Prime: You paid $100 a year for fast, free shipping, and you also got goodies like free videos. But lately it has begun offering add-ons to Prime. Last year, it started selling subscriptions to services like Hulu and Showtime as add-ons to its video service, and now it is selling a monthly music service. recode_divider More From Recode LinkedIn’s CEO says the U.S. cares too much about four-year college degrees Where we choose to work is a big deal, office designers Yves Behar and Ryan Mullenix say Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime LinkedIn’s CEO says more than five million jobs will be lost to new tech by 2020 Dropbox is all in on collaborative work, COO Dennis Woodside says TaskRabbit is generating operating income in every city it’s in Trending Google’s Diane Greene says the singularity won’t arrive in her sentient lifetime No satire: The stars of HBO’s ‘Silicon Valley’ say they got ‘cucked’ in an LA bar Marc Benioff says companies buy each other for the data, and the government isn’t doing anything about it Philz Coffee can’t pay baristas $25 an hour, but it can help make their lives better Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: ‘Without Twitter, you wouldn’t have President-elect Trump’ More in Trending Newsletters Recode Daily Top stories of the day.

[x] Win a Gigabyte GTX 1070 G1 Gaming Bundle [x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: Laptop Systems Monitors News 2 HP updates its premium PC portfolio in time for Xmas by Mark Tyson on 12 October 2016, 10:01 Tags: Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qac7ty Add to My Vault: HP Inc. has unveiled an updated range of devices to bolster its premium consumer PC line ahead of Xmas. New and refreshed devices offer 'beautiful', thinner and lighter designs, with new processors, and extended battery life. The updated Premium Consumer Portfolio includes both portables, and an AiO and display for your home. HP Spectre x360 According to HP this is its most successful premium laptop and now the firm has improved it in several ways. To start with, it will now last for up to 15 hours of battery life, that's a 25 per cent gain over the first gen x360. The battery life improvement is down to a combination of moving to Intel's latest 7th gen processors and fitting a larger 57.8W battery. Another significant improvement to the x360 comes in the slimming and trimming of its dimensions. HP's new micro-edge display bezel design trims almost 10mm from each side of the screen, and a new hinge design helps HP take 2mm off the x360's thickness – down to 13.8mm. This laptop also weighs less now; it was previously 1.45Kg, now it weighs 1.3Kg. Other highlights of the second generation Spectre x360, as listed by HP, are as follows: The new dual fan design optimizes thermals to ensure the device runs cool during demanding activities 7th Generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors Options with up to a 1TB PCIe SSD for fast performance and plenty of space to store high resolution videos and photos HP TrueVision FHD Webcam with 12% wider field of view, great for web chats. A FHD IR camera supports Windows Hello Facial Log-In for secure, easy log in without typing a password. HP Fast Charge to recharge the batteries to 90 percent capacity in just 90 minutes The HP Spectre x360 is expected to be available October 12, 2016. HP.com and BesBuy.com starting price at $1,049.99 HP ENVY Laptop HP's premium yet affordable laptop refresh again gains big in the battery life stakes. The new 13.3-inch model extends its battery life by four hours to a total of 14 hours away from the mains. This updated device is powered by a choice of 7th gen Intel Core processor. The new ENVY laptop is slightly thicker and heavier than the previous generation – but its still very portable at only 14mm thick and 1.43Kg. The ENVY Laptop is equipped with an elevated hinge design for an improved typing angle, plus a backlit keyboard as standard. HP Inc. provides display choices such as FHD, QHD with touch, and UHD. Your portable entertainment needs are enhanced by stereo B&O tuned speakers. HP Inc. listed the following specification highlights: Two USB 3.0 ports, including one dedicated to sleep and charge, and one USB Type-C port 7th Generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors Up to a 1TB SSD PCIe provides fast response times when opening or moving large files Up to 16GB RAM HP Fast Charge up to 90 percent in 90 minutes The HP ENVY Laptop is expected to be available on HP.com and select retailers on October 26, 2016 starting at $849.99. HP ENVY All-In-One 27 The HP ENVY All-In-One 27 is based around a 27-inch diagonal QHD display with Technicolor Colour Certification. In this new version HP has moved the computing power into the base which allowed it to slim down the display thickness to 15mm. Also in the base is a sound bar with four Bang & Olufsen tuned speakers. Other key features of the HP ENVY All-In-One 27 are as follows: Powerful processing options available, including 6th Generation Intel Core i5 and i7 quad-core desktop Optional discrete NVIDIA GTX 950M graphics card with 4GB GDDR5 video for blazing fast 3D gaming performance Hybrid storage options include up to a 256GB SSD and 2TB HDD to give customers faster performance and plenty of storage for digital media collections USB Type-CTM port with Thunderbolt 3 support HDMI-out to connect to a second monitor or to project to a TV HDMI-in port for connecting a laptop to take advantage of the ENYV AIO 27’s beautiful display The HP ENVY All-In-One 27 is expected to be available on HP.com and select retailers in October 2016 starting at $1,299.99. HP ENVY Display This monitor uses a 27-inch diagonal 4K IPS panel with a micro-edge bezel. Content is said to look 'breathtaking' on this monitor partly due to its sRGB colour accuracy, which exceeds 99 per cent. Connectivity options include a Display Port, HDMI and USB-C. The USB Type-C port can also charge your PC or mobile device with up to 60 watts of power. The HP ENVY Display supports AMD FreeSync. The HP ENVY 27 Display is expected to be available on HP.com and select retailers on December 4, 2016 starting at $499.99.

The video ad tech company Unruly, whose mobile ad formats help advertisers connect more effectively with audiences across the web, has moved into Dow Jones's offices in New Delhi and Mumbai. Unruly, acquired by News Corp last year, employs 300 people across 20 locations worldwide. The company, which has unique tools that help brands spread their videos, has run video campaigns in India since 2007, delivering until now, over 130 video campaigns for brands such as Diageo, Intel, and Unilever, remotely from its offices in Europe, North America, and Singapore. The move marks the video tech platform's continuing investment into the APAC region. According to a recent Unruly survey, Indian consumers like ads more than other consumers in the world, with 62 per cent of viewers saying they like seeing ads for products and services they like as compared to the global average of 28 per cent. Phil Townend, Unruly's chief commercial officer, APAC, says, "India is the next frontier in digital advertising growth. Unruly is perfectly placed to help Indian advertisers as they begin to shift ad dollars away from traditional channels and into digital. Our evidence-based approach to video content testing and amplification minimises risk and increases certainty for leading advertisers in the Indian market. Our mobile formats, distributed through our viewable video SSP UnrulyX, also help advertisers connect more authentically, intimately, and effectively with audiences across India." Vijay Kunduri, Unruly's commercial director for ASEAN and India, and who is leading the launch, adds, "We've been laying the ground for the full launch for over a year, making sure that all our tools, services, and products have been customised especially for the Indian market. Unruly's unique end-to-end video content marketing and distribution solution fills a much-needed gap in the market." The Unruly Future Video Survey also found that while Indian audiences are very receptive to online video ads, user experience and control are key factors. As per the findings, Indians are more likely to want to be in control of video ads than the global average. While the global average is 62 per cent, 71 per cent Indian consumers say they want to be able to control when the ad starts to play and close it whenever they want. As for ad blocking software, 83 per cent Indian consumers would consider using it. While 53 per cent consumers want to block ads because they think there are too many, 52 per cent want to do so as they are sick of seeing the same ad over and over again. Kunduri adds, "Unruly uses polite outstream formats to engage, not enrage consumers. This is particularly vital in a market where the vast majority of viewers want to be in control of ads and the majority of people are watching ads on their mobiles." 22SHARES Follow afaqs!

The Japanese carmaker also managed to become the first Asian company and only carmaker to reach a top-five spot on the list, with Interbrand estimates placing Toyota’s brand value at US$53.58 billion (up 9% from last year). Only Microsoft, Coca Cola, Google and Apple are ahead of the carmaker. Moving further down the list is Mercedes-Benz, which occupies the ninth spot with a brand value of US$43.49 billion. This is followed by BMW, which took the 11th spot (USD$ 41.535 billion), ahead of McDonald’s, Disney, Intel, Facebook and Nike. The 21st most valuable automaker brand is Honda, with a brand value of US$22.106 billion, besting the likes of Pepsi, Ikea and Zara, despite a 4% decline from 2015. Ford meanwhile, took the 33rd spot, followed by Hyundai (35), Audi (38), Volkswagen (40), Nissan (43), and Porsche (50). Click to enlarge As for carmakers in the second half of the top-100 list, Kia took the 69th spot, followed by Land Rover (78) and MINI (88). Making its first entry into the Interbrand ranking is Tesla, occupying the last spot with a brand value of US$4.011 billion. To be included in Interbrand’s Best Global Brands, a company must meet several terms, where at least 30% of its revenue must come from outside of the its home region. Furthermore, the brand must have a significant presence in Asia, Europe, and North America as well as broad geographic coverage in emerging markets. There must also be adequate publicly available data on the brand’s financial performance, and any economic profit must be expected to be positive over the longer term, delivering a return above the brand’s cost of capital. Lastly, the brand must have a public profile and awareness across the major economies of the world.   Originating from the corporate world with a background in finance and economics, Gerard’s strong love for cars led him to take the plunge into the automotive media industry. It was only then did he realise that there are more things to a car than just horsepower count.   Related Stories All 30 Comments Ms Check Pick on Oct 12, 2016 at 4:16 pm Yeah,world’s ‘most valuable car brands except Malaysia’..to be exact.Surprisingly Honda is in the list.Must be a great contribution of Malaysian support.As usual,Malaysian won’t follow others as we value our own appreciation towards honest and generous company,not by popularity on other countries.UMW and TMC Japan,change your attitude on marketing your product as we Malaysian dare and brave enough to be different than the rest of the world to not supporting you.We value our hard earned money more than you know it.

If not, Protong can’t survive to beat with other company & that’s why goverment increase tax to make it more expensive than Protong. Without help from goverment, Protong already gulung tikar long time ago. That’s why goverment give 1.5 Billions to cap ayam company. Perodua will still survive because under Daihatsu/Toyota plus they still doing better without goverment help. If Protong not exist long time ago, all the car in Malaysia become cheaper.

Both laptops gain larger batteries and design updates, while the x360 gets an overhaul that includes a smaller footprint and a new edge-to-edge display. In addition, HP is updating its Envy all-in-one with a refreshed design and Intel’s latest processors. The new Spectre x360 maintains the outgoing version’s ability to rotate the display behind the keyboard, but it has a narrower design thanks to its edge-to-edge display. The new model is a full 11.8mm narrower than before and now has a quad speaker array. HP says the Spectre x360 can now last for up to 15 hours between charges, a 25 percent improvement, thanks to its larger battery and better efficiencies throughout the system. It also has the ability to recharge its battery up to 90 percent in 90 minutes. The Spectre x360 can be outfitted with a seventh-generation Core i5 or Core i7 processor, up to 16GB of RAM, and up to a 1TB SSD. It will be available starting this month for $1,159 and up. HP Envy 13 HP The new Envy 13 isn’t as svelte as the Spectre, but it’s not as expensive either. It is made of aluminum and magnesium and can be outfitted with a full-HD or quad-HD display, with the latter also available as a touchscreen. HP says it fitted a 28 percent larger battery in the new Envy, which gives it up to 14 hours of battery life. (It also has the ability to charge up to 90 percent in 90 minutes.) The Envy 13 will also be available with seventh-generation Core i5 and i7 processors, up to 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. It will start at $849 when it is available later this month. HP Envy all-in-one HP Over in the desktop world, HP’s new Envy all-in-one has a 27-inch quad-HD IPS touchscreen (HP says a 4K option is coming later), 9.5mm bezel on the top and sides, and pedestal design with the computer in the base and the monitor suspended above. It has Intel’s latest Core i5 or i7 processors and can be had with an optional Nvidia GTX950M graphics card. HP will be selling the Envy all-in-one this month starting at $1,249. HP Envy display HP Finally, HP is also updating its Envy Display, a 27-inch 4K monitor. It features an IPS panel with 178 degree viewing angle and 99 percent sRGB color gamut. For ports, it has dual HDMI, dual Display Ports, and a USB-C port for peripherals. HP says the Envy Display will be out this December for $499.

Reuters/Eduardo Munoz A Windows 10 event has been announced by Microsoft and it will be held in New York City on Oct. 26. Even though it is uncertain whether the company will launch any device on that day, rumours are rife that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be unveiled along with a new Surface desktop. Previous reports had speculated a 2017 release and that’s also possible if the company wants Intel Kaby Lake processors to be included in the device. A photo posted by a developer revealed a possible 2016-2017 calendar for Microsoft. It looks like a Surface device is “coming soon” in 2016 and three devices in 2017. As ZDNet reported in July, at least one Surface product must be unveiled this year. However, some sources claim that Microsoft may present upgrades to the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book 2 or reveal an AIO desktop. There’s also another reason why the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may be unveiled in 2017. It is the Windows Redstone 2 update that is not expected before spring of 2017, writes PCAdvisor. The Kaby Lake processors are reportedly being shipped to manufacturers and Microsoft may take its time to ensure that the Surface Pro 5 receives the Kaby Lake processor and the Redstone 2 update. Microsoft is also expected to end production of Surface 3 by the end of 2016. Hence, it will make room for a new model. There are also rumours circulating about the Surface Pro 5 specs. The Surface Pro Pen may be upgraded with a rechargeable battery that can charge wirelessly when attached to the device. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may also be available in 2K and 4K screens. The basic model may come with a 16GB RAM capacity. USB Type-C port is also expected. These ports will help in faster battery charging and data transfer.

DRM Driver Changes Sent In For Linux 4.9, Sadly No Changes For Nouveau Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 11 October 2016 at 06:24 PM EDT. 20 Comments David Airlie a short time ago submitted the Linux 4.9 DRM subsystem update, including the much sought after open-source Direct Rendering Manager driver improvements. There's a lot of good stuff in here, but sadly the Nouveau changes look like they're going to have to wait until Linux 4.10. Highlights for the DRM updates in Linux 4.9 include: AMDGPU gets Virtual Display Support, improved GPU reset support, PowerPlay for Iceland GPUs, pre-initialized VRAM buffer support, a GTT code rework, UVD/VEC power-gating for Carrizo and Stoney hardware, and a fun experimental feature... Experimental Southern Islands support! But like the GCN 1.0 support, this GCN 1.0 AMDGPU support needs to be enabled at compile-time via a new Kconfig switch. Not for a while will AMDGPU support GCN 1.0/1.1 GPUs by default rather than the mature Radeon DRM driver. See my early GCN 1.0/1.1 AMDGPU benchmarks from the DRM-Next code for those with Radeon HD 7000 series and similar hardware that may want to try running this experimental functionality. The Intel DRM driver has its usual wide assortment of fixes and improvements including DMA-BUF implicit fencing, memory management improvements, frame-buffer compression fixes, vGPU improvements, better DisplayPort dongle support, and more. The Raspberry Pi VC4 DRM driver meanwhile has CPU/memory overhead reduction during 3D rendering and other improvements. When it comes to the smaller DRM drivers, the Mediatek DRM code has AAL + GAMMA engine and temporal dithering support, iMX has color space conversion support, Rockchip has Panel Self Refresh (PSR) support as well as RK339 VOP/CRTC support, Freedreno MSM has explicit fence FD support, Etnaviv has GC3000 support, and the Sunxi DRM driver has Allwinner A33 support. Sadly, there are no Nouveau DRM driver changes included with this Linux 4.9 pull request... This is especially sad as the initial Nouveau "Boost" support was expected to land. Of no open-source NVIDIA driver changes, David Airlie commented, "there is no nouveau work in this tree, as Ben didn't get a pull request in, and he was fighting moving to atomic and adding mst support, so maybe best it waits for a cycle." Thus due to atomic mode-setting work and DP Multi-Stream Transport (MST) work, it doesn't look like any Nouveau changes will come for Linux 4.9 but rather all the work be postponed to Linux 4.10. The complete pull request with all the DRM driver changes can be found via this kernel mailing list message. 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

While you were sleeping: Alcoa results fall short Oct. 12 (BusinessDesk) – Wall Street dropped after Alcoa kicked off the US earnings season with quarterly results that missed estimates and an outlook that fell short of expectations. “Alcoa is always the first off and seen as a bellwether for industrial demand,” Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at St. Louis-based EverBank, told Bloomberg. “People need to see strong earnings, especially with the thought that rates will start moving higher. The environment for companies is going to get less accommodating. The drivers today and going forward are going to be earnings.” Shares of Alcoa sank, trading 10.6 percent lower as of 2.04pm. “You are coming up against very low expectations, which means the bar is already low,” Adam Sarhan, chief executive at Sarhan Capital, told Reuters. “If you can’t match those expectations, then investors are going to quickly move to the exit.” Wall Street weakened. In 2.11pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index retreated 1.7 percent. In 1.56pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1.4 percent. The Dow fell, led by slides in shares of Merck and those of Intel, recently down 2.9 percent and 2.8 percent respectively. Shares of Apple bucked the trend, eking out a 0.2 percent gain, as rival Samsung Electronics said it stopped production of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smart phone. “This is the first time that I have seen a product recall go this badly wrong,” financial analyst Richard Windsor said in a note to clients, Reuters reported. “When it comes to the damage that it will do to Samsung’s brand, we are in uncharted territory.” Also bucking the trend were shares of Tyson Foods, trading 1.2 percent higher as of 2.17pm in New York. The US meat company agreed to buy a 5 percent stake in Beyond Meat, a producer of plant-based protein. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed. “We’re enthusiastic about this investment, which gives us exposure to a fast-growing segment of the protein market,” Monica McGurk, Tyson Foods’ executive vice president of strategy and new ventures, said in a statement. “It meets our desire to offer consumers choices and to consider how we can serve an ever-growing and diverse global population, while remaining focused on our core prepared foods and animal protein businesses.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the session with a drop of 0.5 percent. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index and Germany’s DAX Index each slid 0.4 percent, while France’s CAC 40 Index gave up 0.6 percent. The British pound weakened, recently trading 1.8 percent weaker against the US dollar after sliding as low as US$1.2090 earlier in the day, as Bank of England policy makers exacerbated concern the UK’s negotiations to exit the European Union will further hurt the currency. “The sentiment on sterling is closely tied to expectations of hard Brexit,” Georgette Boele, a currency and commodity strategist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, told Bloomberg.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Intel Falcon 8+ UAV takes to North American skies by Bruno Ferreira  12:41 PM on October 11, 2016 It's pretty hard to read the news these days without hearing about drones. However, most of the news are about amateur-level drones, or commercial offerings for relatively simple tasks. Intel's latest effort aims to fly a little higher than that, though. Meet the Intel Falcon 8+ System UAV, a V-shaped octocopter packed with redundant systems, announced today at the Intergeo conference in Hamburg. Intel says the Falcon 8+'s electronics systems are fully redundant, and that the drone includes "automated aerial-sensing solution" and a triple-redundant Ascending Technologies Trinity autopilot system. The Falcon 8+ UAV is apparently targeted at aerial imaging and data collection jobs, as evidenced by the millimeter-accurate ground sample distance (GSD) of its camera system. According to Intel, all the avionics and gear in the Falcon 8+ make it an excellent candidate for structural analysis jobs. The drone itself is only a part of the package, though. The aptly-named Intel Cockpit serves as a control station for the UAV and includes a tablet computer for flight planning and monitoring. The Cockpit is water-resistant and looks rugged enough to our eyes. (We'd also wager that with a little work, it can made into a totally-awesome arcade joystick.) The Falcon 8+ is targeted at the North American market and is a successor of Ascending Technologies' Falcon 8 drone. Intel snapped up AscTec back in January and has apparently made good use of the company's technology. Intel offered no price for the UAV system, but we'd wager this falls squarely into drone-monitored, "if you have to ask" territory.

We’ve got some initial coverage of all of those products here at HotHardware if you’d like some additional background on the full line-up, including hands-on video of the latest ZenBook and smartwatch. However, we couldn’t wait to dive in a little deeper with the ZenBook 3 for a couple of reasons. First off, the ZenBook 3 is the first Ultrabook to hit the lab built around Intel’s brand-new Kaby Lake-based 7th Generation Core series processors. If you’re unfamiliar with Kaby Lake, it is the follow-up product to last year’s Skylake, and features improved responsiveness, a beefed up multimedia engine, and it's built with a refined 14nm process that improves clocks and overall power efficiency. For a deeper dive on Kaby Lake, check this out. The ASUS ZenBook 3 The ASUS ZenBook 3 also happens to be one of the thinnest and lightest Ultrabooks to hit the market, but despite its diminutive form factor, it is packing some sought after amenities like a NVMe PCIe SSD, 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO Wi-Fi, a backlit keyboard, and Windows Hello-compatible fingerprint reader -- at least on the Core i7-based model. We’ve got the rest of the ZenBook 3’s main features and specifications listed below if you’d like to inspect more of the particulars. On the pages ahead we’ll dig in a little deeper to see just how well this bleeding edge Ultrabook behaves with some benchmarks and battery life tests, and we'll explore the user experience as well. ASUS ZenBook 3 Specifications & Features CPU Intel 7th-generation Core i7-7500U, Intel 7th-generation Core i5-7200U Display 12.5in (16:9) LED backlit Full HD (1920x1080) anti-glare, with 72% NTSC gamut ultra-thin 7.6mm bezel / 82% screen-to-body ratio Operating system Microsoft Windows 10 Pro / Windows 10 Home Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Main memory 16GB LPDDR3 2133MHz or 8GB LPDDR3 1866MHz Storage 512GB PCIe x4 Gen 3 SSD or 256GB SATA SSD Connectivity 802.11ac Wi-Fi Camera VGA Webcam I/O ports 1 x combo audio jack, 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C (Supports display output and power delivery) Audio 4 x high-quality speakers (2 x full-range, 2 x 5-magnet bass drivers) with ASUS SonicMaster Premium technology and Harman Kardon tuning Security  Touchpad-mounted fingerprint scanner (UX390UA-XH74-BL) Battery 40W lithium-polymer, 6-cell battery AC adapter Output: 20V DC, 2.25A, 45W, Input: 100 -240V AC, 50/60Hz universal Dimensions 296 x 191.2 x 11.9mm / 11.65 x 7.53 x 0.47 inches Weight 910g/ 2lbs with battery Models and Pricing ZenBook 3 UX390UA-XH74-BL - $1599, UX390UA-DH51-GR - $1099 The ZenBook 3 Will Be Offered In 3 Colors - Rose Gold, Royal Blue, and Quarts Grey The ASUS ZenBook 3’s specifications read like a premium Ultrabook’s should. There will initially be two version of the ZenBook 3 on the market, one packing a Core i7-7500U, 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 RAM, and a 512GB SSD, and another with a Core i5-7200U, 8GB of 1866MHz RAM, and a 256GB SSD. The form factor is identical between the two systems, as are the 12.5” FullHD display, keyboard, touchpad, and other features. The only “gotchas” with the ZenBook 3 – at least for some of you – will be ASUS’ choice of IO and the lack of wired network connector. ASUS almost went “full-Apple” on us and equipped the ZenBook 3 with only a single USB-Type C connector, though there’s a headphone / microphone jack on-board too. Although some of you probably won’t mind, having to use a dongle to plug in a device with a full sized USB connector, use the HDMI output, or charge the ZenBook, while also having a USB device attached, this single connector will be a hindrance for some. On the plus side, ASUS includes the aforementioned dongle with the ZenBook 3, along with a warranty card, a basic user’s manual, and an attractive folio carrying case, with magnetic latch. A lightweight, relatively small wall-wart type charging adapter is included as well, of course.

In this afternoon’s (11 October) Budget for 2017, Finance Minister Michael Noonan, TD, outlined an expected reduction in capital gains tax (CGT) from 20pc to 10pc up to a limit of €1m in chargeable gains. Cosmetically at least, this sounds similar to the UK’s rate but is, in fact, still very far removed. “I will review the €1m lifetime limit in future budgets. All other aspects of the relief remain unchanged,” Noonan promised. ‘If they were going to do something that small I would have preferred if they increased the cap beyond €1m rather than simply reduce the rate on the first million’ – BRIAN CAULFIELD “This is pretty minimal,” said Caulfield, a partner at leading $9bn Silicon Valley venture capital firm, Draper Esprit. “If they were going to do something that small I would have preferred if they increased the cap beyond €1m rather than simply reduce the rate on the first million.” He pointed out that if an entrepreneur sold a company for £10m in the UK, that entrepreneur would pay £1m in tax. However, if you made a €10m gain from the sale of a company in Ireland, you would qualify for 10pc up to a limit of €1m in chargeable gains. This means the tax on the sale of a company is reduced from 33pc down to 31pc in Budget 2017. “Which is pretty meaningless compared to the UK where you would pay three times less tax.” Caulfield is an established entrepreneur and was an early investor in Movidius which was recently sold to Intel for a reported $300m. Prior to being a venture capitalist, Caulfield sold Exceptis Technologies, an electronic payments company, to Baltimore Technologies in November 2000 for US$26m. Six years later, he sold Similarity Systems, a data quality company, to IT giant Informatica Corporation for US$55m in cash. Caulfield also served as interim CEO of Belfast mobile cloud firm Aepona. Intel acquired that company for US$120m in 2013. Caulfield last year slammed the reductions to CGT in the Budget of 2016 as derisory. Time is running out as Irish entrepreneurs eye the UK Caulfield said that while he noted Minister Noonan’s intention to review the €1m cap, the timing is a disappointment. He also said it was disappointing that plans to review Ireland’s policy towards share-based remuneration of employees and plans to introduce an SME-focused, share-based incentive scheme are being shelved until next year. ‘It is not a flood but it is definitely happening’ – BRIAN CAULFIELD “It is being kicked to touch for another year, that is a disaster and disappointing for so many companies. “They say they are working on it but it could be 2018 which means yet another year and I’m not even sure if the present Government will last that long. Where will it leave us if we have another election in the meantime?” Caulfield said that on the bright side, the decision to increase the earned income tax credit for self-employed workers and directors of companies by €400 is a step in the right direction. But it still falls far short of the €1,650 tax credit for PAYE workers. Caulfield warned that Irish start-ups locating in the UK to avail of more beneficial and realistic tax treatment is no mere threat. “It is not a flood but it is definitely happening. “There is no question that Brexit might slow it down a bit but Irish start-ups are also attracted to the UK EIS scheme which makes early-stage capital much more readily available in the UK. “There are definitely companies choosing to go to London rather than set up in Dublin for these reasons,” Caulfield warned.

If you've been waiting anxiously to play Skyrim on your PS4 or Xbox One, the time is almost here. Bethesda announced yesterday that the upcoming remaster has gone gold, which means it should be on time for its release later this month. Pass the Meadâ¦ Skyrim Special Edition has Gone Gold! More info: https://t.co/zDbwR4xOnO pic.twitter.com/q3J8kWLP6r— BethesdaGameStudios (@BethesdaStudios) October 10, 2016 Alongside that news, Bethesda also announced the system requirements for the PC version of the Special Edition, and they're quite modest. Here's the rig you need: Minimum requirements OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit version) CPU: Intel i5-750/AMD Phenom II X4-945 RAM: 8 GB HDD: 12 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GTX 470 1GB / AMD HD 7870 2GB Recommended requirements OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit version) CPU: Intel i5-2400/AMD FX-8320 RAM: 8 GB HDD: 12 GB Video Card: NVIDIA GTX 780 3GB / AMD R9 290 4GB Obviously, these requirements are a bit steeper than what you needed to run the original when it launched in 2011, but they're still pretty middle-of-the-road these days. Remember, if you own the Legendary Edition of Skyrim (on Steam), or the base game and all the DLC (on Steam), you'll receive the new Special Edition free of charge (on Steam). If you're a console player, you're probably more interested in how big the install will be. For PS4 players, it will be 20 GB in North America, and 33 GB in Europe. Xbox One owners will need 17 GB in North America, and 25 GB in Europe. The Skyrim Special Edition is set to release on October 28 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

By SueChang Markets reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks on Tuesday posted their biggest percentage drop since early September after aluminum giant Alcoa Inc.’s results cast a shadow over the broader market as third-quarter earnings season got under way. A stronger dollar and a retreat in oil prices also hurt sentiment. Alcoa AA, +1.99%  shares skidded 11% after the company reported results that missed expectations. That is the biggest daily percentage drop for the stock since Aug. 8, 2011, according to FactSet data. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.75% slid 26.93 points, or 1.2%, to close at 2,136.73, with all of its main sectors finishing in the red. Health-care and materials sectors were the biggest losers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29% dropped 200.38 points, or 1.1%, to end at 18,128.66. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.10% fell 81.89 points, or 1.5%, to close at 5,246.79, dragged down by heavy losses in biotech stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, -0.60% tumbled 3.8%. Both the large cap and the blue-chip indexes posted their worst percentage declines since Sept. 13, while the Nasdaq had its worst day since Sept. 9. Ryan Larson, head of equity trading at RBC Global Asset Management, said “disappointing earnings from Alcoa” factored in the slump. Some analysts also pointed out that rising expectations for a rate increase in December are pushing up the dollar as well as Treasury yields. “The odds are now around 68% the Fed will increase rates in December. This in itself is weighing heavy on equities for we all know [that] the markets fall with any hints of a change in monetary policy,” said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management Inc. Putin supports OPEC deal at energy summit(1:35) Russian President Vladimir Putin will support international efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit oil production. Frank Cappelleri, an executive director at Instinet LLC, said today’s sell-off is important to monitor in the “days and weeks ahead” for a worrisome long-term trend, and with the S&P 500 having closed below 2,140, the index may find buying interest emerging as it nears the 2,115-2,120 range. The dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.14% , rose 0.7% to 97.65, from 96.92 seen late in New York on Monday. Check out: This chart offers the best explanation why the stock market is diving “This [dollar strength] is starting to make life difficult for U.S. stocks, but hopefully earnings season will jolt the S&P 500 out of its current grinding range,” said Chris Beauchamp, IG’s chief market analyst, in a note to investors. In other currencies, the pound GBPUSD, +0.3051%  marked fresh losses after media reports of leaked government papers that predict the country stands to lose £66 billion ($81.1 billion) a year in tax revenue in the event of a clean break with the European Union, or a “hard Brexit.” Opinion: Is this ‘bone-chilling’ indicator really saying ‘sell’ stocks?

On Monday, oil rallied on bullish comments from Saudi Arabia’s energy minister and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Major oil producers are meeting in Istanbul to try to lay the groundwork for a definitive deal to cap production. Goldman Sachs warned clients that if a production deal isn’t reached in Vienna next month, oil prices could plunge to $43 a barrel. Economic reports and Fed speakers: There was no major economic data on tap Tuesday. Speaking in Australia earlier, Federal Reserve of Chicago President Charles Evans said the U.S. economy is on a sound footing and he wouldn’t be surprised by a December interest-rate hike, Dow Jones Newswires reported.

In the early 1990s, after Microsoft’s famous divorce from IBM, the software company decided to go it alone and develop its own operating system. Windows 3.x became the de facto standard for the PC desktop, while the IBM rival OS, OS/2, failed to gain much traction. But as PC chips became faster and Intel’s first proper 32-bit processor, the 80386, saw success, Microsoft embarked on a project to get into server computing, the domain of the Unix machines. Meanwhile, in Helsinki, a 21-year-old Finnish student, Linus Torvalds, began working on an operating system that could take advantage of some of the advanced features that 80386-powered PCs had to offer, such as the 32-bit instruction set and paged memory. The PC became so successful because it represented the so-called industry standard architecture, on which operating systems and application software could run. But as it became more complex, more and more device driver software was needed to connect sound cards, display adapters and network ports. And all of this software needed support. According to Percival, Windows NT server had as much of a challenge as Linux in supporting the range of hardware the operating system could support. “Microsoft did a very good job on certification,” he said. Similarly, companies such as Red Hat and SuSE created Linux distributions, which were certified to run on specific hardware. Percival added: “One of the reasons that businesses jumped in was because Red Hat produced a range of certified devices.” Read more about enterprise Linux Businesses can deploy a mix of Linux server software offerings to take advantage of the cost and flexibility benefits of open source. Systems administrators who manage Linux in the enterprise can use these tips to keep the operating system – and the business – humming along. Although it started out as an alternative to Unix, Linux has evolved into a robust enterprise operating system. Without the world of open source and Linux, we would not have the kind of scale to run a cloud. While many supporters argue that cost should not be the main reason for choosing open source, Percival said: “Imagine trying to use a Tandem NonStop system to run Netflix. You would never afford to buy it.” In the past, a premium server like NonStop would be used when extremely high availability was a priority. Such systems were very expensive. Today’s IT architectures achieve high availability at a much lower price point by using large numbers of commodity Linux servers instead of one highly resilient box. So, for the enterprise, Linux has provided a low-cost base platform on which to run large internet applications, mainly as an alternative to proprietary Unix systems. Hot patching In a blog post earlier this year, Forrester analyst Richard Fichera described how hot patching was now available on SuSE Linux, giving the OS a level of maintainability usually available only on mainframe systems. In the post, he predicted this would become a standard feature of the Linux kernel. “It is almost certain that a future release of the 4.x kernel will contain production-ready hot patch as a standard feature, placing the burden on the Unix providers to prove they can keep up with Linux,” he said. According to Fichera’s blog, neither Oracle (with Solaris), IBM (Aix) or HPE (HP-UX) have developed equivalent capabilities in their respective versions of Unix. What is also interesting is that Linux was also pitted against Windows, and some organisations, such as the city of Munich, made public commitments to move to open source, even running desktop Linux rather than Windows PCs. This is something that Linux distributor Ubuntu continues to push, said Jane Silber, CEO of Canonical, which supports Ubuntu. “While the cloud runs almost entirely on Linux, we think the desktop remains an important focus for Linux innovation, too,” she said. Enterprise focus To compete with Windows and commercial Unixes, Linux has had to become more palatable to business. Thanks to the efforts of organisations such as SuSE, Red Hat and many others, Linux is very much a part of the enterprise. Their efforts, and the licensing frameworks from the GNU Foundation and Apache Software Foundation, have paved the way to making open source and Linux powerful forces in modern computing. Jonathan Bryce, president of OpenStack, said: “OpenStack has followed a similar path to Linux and we learnt from Linux.” Specifically, said Bryce, in the mid-1990s, Linux was a very tech operating system, but from 1999 there were commercial efforts to make it accessible and trusted by enterprises. It not only replaced Unix servers, but has also been used when Windows servers failed. Dave Rosenburg, senior vice-president at the Linux Foundation, said: “Whenever there was a dead or dying Windows box, we used to put Linux on it. Our web servers were pretty low-powered machines, but they had 100% uptime on Linux. The Windows NT server would fall over within four hours.” Who would have thought, 25 years ago, that Linux would cement itself as the de facto standard for running highly scalable cloud infrastructure in state-of-the-art datacentre computing? Linux has clearly come a long way, and in doing so, it has established open source as a sound alternative to commercial software, suitable for the smallest to the largest organisations on the planet.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → October → Dividend Growers Took Center Stage During Q3 Dividend Growers Took Center Stage During Q3 Clark Capital Management October 12, 2016 0 Comment By Maira Thompson, Clark Capital Senior Portfolio Manager One of the biggest contributors to market performance this year continues to be historically low-interest rates. The result has been positioning across fixed income markets and equity sectors in an effort to benefit from the current environment. In the first half of 2016, the “bond proxy” sectors such as Telecom and Utilities dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 Index until the 10-year Treasury hit a low of 1.36% in July. Since the July 8th low, the subsequent rise in yields combined with Federal Reserve comments about a possible December rate hike propelled investors out of bond proxy sectors into more growth-oriented sectors such as Technology. Historically “dividend growth” companies demonstrating earnings growth, strong free cash flow and rising dividends have been resilient in a rising interest rate scenario. Numerous studies point to the last eight Fed fund hikes where “dividend growers” experience strong performance compared to dividend non-payers, cutters and companies that don’t consistently increase their dividend. See chart below.   The U.S. bull market continues to forge ahead looking beyond the negative S&P 500 earnings projection for this quarter of -1.1% which would be the sixth negative quarter in a row. In the fourth quarter, we believe greater stability in the dollar and oil prices should help corporate earnings beat lowered expectations. This quarter we noted a slower pace of several shareholder-friendly policies such as share buybacks and dividend growth rates. Despite the shift away from share buybacks, the Materials, Industrials, Financials, Technology and Energy sectors are projected* to accelerate their dividend growth along with stronger growth prospects with improving revenues. As the search for yield continues into the end of the year, investors may be rewarded with S&P earnings finally turning positive and higher dividends in growth-oriented sectors. Three of the four top gainers in the Dow Industrials over the past three months were Technology stocks with relatively high dividends – Apple, Intel and Microsoft – while the lowest returns were found in ExxonMobil, McDonalds and Walt Disney. For the quarter, the strongest sectors in the Navigator® High Dividend Equity portfolio were Technology +12.4%, ­Financials +4.0% and Industrials +3.6%, and the weakest were Utilities -6.8%, Telecom -6.6% and Staples -3.3%. Stocks purchased during the quarter included PPG Inc, Microchip Technology, Morgan Stanley, Kinder Morgan, IBM and sales were Kimberly Clark, Lyondell, Wyndham Worldwide, Public Storage and Disney.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → October → Dividend Growers Took Center Stage During Q3 Dividend Growers Took Center Stage During Q3 Clark Capital Management October 12, 2016 0 Comment By Maira Thompson, Clark Capital Senior Portfolio Manager One of the biggest contributors to market performance this year continues to be historically low-interest rates. The result has been positioning across fixed income markets and equity sectors in an effort to benefit from the current environment. In the first half of 2016, the “bond proxy” sectors such as Telecom and Utilities dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 Index until the 10-year Treasury hit a low of 1.36% in July. Since the July 8th low, the subsequent rise in yields combined with Federal Reserve comments about a possible December rate hike propelled investors out of bond proxy sectors into more growth-oriented sectors such as Technology. Historically “dividend growth” companies demonstrating earnings growth, strong free cash flow and rising dividends have been resilient in a rising interest rate scenario. Numerous studies point to the last eight Fed fund hikes where “dividend growers” experience strong performance compared to dividend non-payers, cutters and companies that don’t consistently increase their dividend. See chart below.   The U.S. bull market continues to forge ahead looking beyond the negative S&P 500 earnings projection for this quarter of -1.1% which would be the sixth negative quarter in a row. In the fourth quarter, we believe greater stability in the dollar and oil prices should help corporate earnings beat lowered expectations. This quarter we noted a slower pace of several shareholder-friendly policies such as share buybacks and dividend growth rates. Despite the shift away from share buybacks, the Materials, Industrials, Financials, Technology and Energy sectors are projected* to accelerate their dividend growth along with stronger growth prospects with improving revenues. As the search for yield continues into the end of the year, investors may be rewarded with S&P earnings finally turning positive and higher dividends in growth-oriented sectors. Three of the four top gainers in the Dow Industrials over the past three months were Technology stocks with relatively high dividends – Apple, Intel and Microsoft – while the lowest returns were found in ExxonMobil, McDonalds and Walt Disney. For the quarter, the strongest sectors in the Navigator® High Dividend Equity portfolio were Technology +12.4%, ­Financials +4.0% and Industrials +3.6%, and the weakest were Utilities -6.8%, Telecom -6.6% and Staples -3.3%. Stocks purchased during the quarter included PPG Inc, Microchip Technology, Morgan Stanley, Kinder Morgan, IBM and sales were Kimberly Clark, Lyondell, Wyndham Worldwide, Public Storage and Disney.

The solution acts like virtual fibre by extending GPON networks with twisted pair or coax within multi-dwelling units (MDUs) and single-family households (SFUs). The new reference design leverages Sckipio's breakthrough dynamic time assignment technology (DTA), which provides up to 1Gbps of broadband access in either direction. The solution also supports reverse power feeding from Microsemi to make it easy to implement in many environments including at the door, at the floor, in the basement or outside the residence. Sckipio's solution uses a very thin management layer for G.fast allowing operators to keep their existing GPON management layer and to extend it with a separate G.fast management layer. This speeds up the FTTH rollout by avoiding costly and time consuming IT integration of new management protocols into existing management frameworks. The joint reference design was build in conjunction with Intel and Microsemi, offering OEMs the fastest path to deployable single-port DPUs. The solution will work within an existing Intel-based GPON management infrastructure. "Sckipio is opening up an entirely new use-case for G.fast," said Teresa Mastrangelo, Principal Analyst, Broadbandtrends. "By combining DTA and unmanaged G.fast, Sckipio makes it effortless to add G.fast to any GPON network." About Sckipio Sckipio, the leader in G.fast, develops award-winning, standards-compliant G.fast modems used to enable ultra-broadband access and mobile backhaul. Sckipio partners with more than 30 companies globally on G.fast and is one of the leading contributors to the ITU-T standard. For more information about Sckipio, visit our website at www.sckipio.com.

How much progress has there been since Ada Lovelace Day began in 2009? Ada Lovelace. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images Olivia Solon in San Francisco Tuesday 11 October 2016 04.00 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 11 October 2016 08.33 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger This article is 1 month old It is eight years since journalist and software activist Suw Charman-Anderson founded Ada Lovelace Day, aiming to raise the profile of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and celebrate their achievements. The day is named after Lord Byron’s daughter Ada, a mathematician who worked with Charles Babbage to create and program the world’s first general purpose computer, the analytical engine, creating the precursor to modern programming. On Ada Lovelace Day, here are seven other pioneering women in tech Read more Eight years is an age in Silicon Valley – so how much tech progress has there been in tech companies themselves since Ada Lovelace Day began in 2009? “We are trying to effect cultural change,” Charman-Anderson told the Guardian. “But you don’t change culture overnight. Equality is here, but it’s not evenly distributed. Some technology companies are doing a grand job. Other companies need to work a lot harder. “I don’t think merely knowing how many women there are in the boardroom gets to the heart of what we’re trying to achieve. It’s not just a surface parity of the same number of men and women in certain job roles – it’s really a foundational parity where girls and boys can grow up and be anything, and that’s not seen as unusual,” she said. One key area of concern for Charman-Anderson is the rise of misogyny online. “We’ve seen a ramp-up over the last few years of online abuse, although I don’t think there would be this backlash if we hadn’t made progress.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. Photograph: tearlel/HM Passport Office What does this progress look like in Silicon Valley? “It’s varied. Intel is spending $300m on diversity, and Apple $50m, but none of the Silicon Valley giants are anywhere near parity in terms of women in their overall workforce, and not even hitting 20% women in tech roles,” Charman-Anderson said. She points out that many of the large companies have internal networks to support, mentor and champion female employees but that more could be done. “Women leave tech for a variety of reasons, such as not seeing opportunities for advancement, hostile male culture, feelings of isolation – it’s not that they want to leave to have a family, as is often assumed,” she said. “These sorts of cultural problems can be solved much more quickly than we can train up a new generation of girls and women, but I don’t think this part of the problem is being taken seriously enough.” Ada Lovelace, trailblazer of science, brought to life in exhibition Read more Here is a snapshot of the gender divide as taken from tech companies’ diversity reports: Facebook Facebook tops the technology industry diversity league tables, with a workforce made up of 33% women and 67% men. However, the figure is just 17% women in technical roles. The company points to a broader problem with education in the US, where only one in four high schools teach computer science. Apple Apple’s US workforce consists of 32% women as of June 2016, compared with 27.7% in 2014. Within technical roles, that figure is 23%. The company is slowly shifting the dial, with women accounting for 37% of new hires across all roles over the 12 months ending in June 2016. Google According to Google, 31% of its employees are female versus 69% male. However, only 19% of Google’s technical roles are held by women. Google says this is slowly changing with progressive hiring policies – 22% of new technical hires were women. Twitter It’s the same story for Twitter, whose staff is 70% male and 30% female across the board, but men account for 90% of technical roles. In August 2015, the company set goals to change the ratio by the end of 2016 to have 35% women across the company and 16% in technical roles. Microsoft Of Microsoft’s 116,000 employees, 73% are men and 27% are women as of 2015. As with Facebook, women make up only 17% of technical roles. Attempts to become more gender-balanced don’t seem to be working – the company had a higher proportion of female staff (29%) in 2014.

Business Market report: Bid war for chip designer piques City's Imagination Jamie Nimmo Tuesday 11 October 2016 11:22 BST Name in the frame: Samsung was named as a potential buyer of Imagination Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Amid Samsung’s firefighting, Liberum analysts were fuelling speculation that smartphone chip designer Imagination Technologies might be a takeover target. Tech behemoth Apple, for which Imagination designs graphics chips, walked away from talks with Imagination in March. But the Takeover Panel’s rule which prevents companies from coming back to the table for six months has expired, leaving Apple free to reopen talks. The £24 billion takeover of chip-designer ARM Holdings by Japan’s SoftBank suggests Apple could face a scrap for Imagination, according to Liberum’s Janardan Menon. “We believe Imagination is an attractive and desirable acquisition target for a variety of companies in the broader technology sector,” the analyst said. He added that potential buyers include web giant Google, smartphone heavyweights Samsung and Huawei, and chip-makers Intel, Qualcomm, Spreadtrum, CEVA and  MediaTek. Tsinghua, which bought a stake in the company this year, was also named as a potential suitor. Menon suggested SoftBank’s pricey deal for ARM could be pave the way for more expensive takeovers. The speculation, along with higher forecasts on the back of stronger demand for the iPhone7 and a weaker sterling, boosted the shares by 16.75p, or 6.6%, to 271.75p — their highest level since 2013. The FTSE 100 flirted with record highs, up 11.29 points at 7108.79 — above its highest closing price by around five points, but just below the intra-day record. The market became more confident that struggling Pearson, up 8p at 820.5p, can avoid a profit warning when it reports on third-quarter trading next week. Investment bank Jefferies lent its support to the textbook publisher today, arguing that the shares look “cheap”. Victrex surged 129p, or 8%, to 1751p after a “good finish to 2016” for the high-performance plastics manufacturer’s car and plane parts business and a robust trading performance from its oil and gas division. Though the company said it was in line with expectations, JPMorgan said it was surprised Victrex managed to meet its targets. In a further sign that mining majors are turning their attentions back to junior explorers, Savannah Resources struck a new deal with Rio Tinto that will allow the pair to start work on their heavy minerals sands projects in Mozambique. Savannah rose 0.18p, or 4%, to 4.25p. Audioboom, which hosts a podcast show by comedian Romesh Ranganathan called Hip Hop Saved My Life, dipped 0.09p to 2.41p despite revealing that revenues in the third-quarter exceeded the total generated in the entire first six months of the year.

World-class performance. Surprisingly, not obscenely expensive. Tired Fan reaches ungodly loudness under load. Still beastly in size. Screen is chintzy and relatively low in resolution. Screen has some quality issues. Buy It Now   |  AVADirect How We Rate 1/10A complete failure in every way 2/10Sad, really 3/10Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10Downsides outweigh upsides 5/10Recommended with reservations 6/10Solid with some issues 7/10Very good, but not quite great 8/10Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10Nearly flawless 10/10Metaphysical perfection At 7.8 pounds and more than a whopping 1.7 inches thick, this 15.6-inch laptop (1920 x 1080 resolution, no touchscreen) strains the limits of portability but sports the latest PC hardware. Inside you’ll find a sixth-generation Skylake Intel Core i5 CPU, 16 gigs of RAM, a 1TB traditional hard drive and a 256GB SSD, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 for the graphics. As impressive as those specs are, the P750GM2-G can support up to 64GB of RAM and a full hard drives of any type. A bevy of ports keeps you connected: three USB 3.0 ports, a USB 3.1 Gen 2 port, one USB 2.0 port, Ethernet, a Thunderbolt 3 port, two MiniDisplay ports, and an HDMI output. There’s an SD card reader too, but no optical drive, which apparently even gamers can now do without. But with all these plugs and ports, if you can’t find a way to hook up all your peripherals, it’s time to invest in a desktop. Machines like this are of course all about performance, and the P750GM2-G easily outscored every notebook I’ve tested. The machine beat every benchmark (gaming or mainstream), typically by 10 to 20 percent and sometimes more, and breezed through high-end gaming tests and rendering lifelike 3-D content. The screen lacks the resolution to properly test 4K content, but everything was seamless at its native 1080p. Although the screen offers ample brightness, some may decry the lack of 4K resolution. (Upgrade to 3840 x 2160 pixels for just $84.) That said, I did notice some brightness irregularities on the review unit, namely light leaking around the upper LCD bezel. It was quite noticeable in spots when the screen was supposed to be dark. Power User Most gaming rigs don’t have the battery life to get you much further than the distance from your house to the LAN party, but the AVA boasts 2.5 hours of run time. That’s surprising and impressive, though functionally the battery is limited to 2 hours and 15 minutes. Once it hits the last 10 percent, it emits a loud, shrill beep that overrides any Windows settings. Allow it to sound in public at your own risk; it’s the type of thing that might prompt someone to call security, thinking a bomb is about to blow. The fan is loud, too. The slightest load activates it, and it sounds like a jet taking off. It’s almost certainly necessary, given the high-end components, but that doesn’t make it right. When you can hear it over the fan, audio quality is loud and crisp. The touchpad is a smooth operator (including, oddly enough, a built-in fingerprint reader), but the keyboard is mushy and unsatisfying despite the brilliant backlighting. It’s interesting and instructive to consider this machine against the last AVADirect machine I reviewed, the P375SM that is now three years old. That ultra high-end rig has long held records across the board in my testing database, as one would expect from a $3,500 laptop. Since then, AVA has trimmed the chassis by nearly 2 pounds and half an inch while significantly boosting performance. And it cut the price in half—this test unit costs $1,870—putting gaming rigs like this within reach of the mass market. Nicely done. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

"The Perimeta virtualized SBC (vSBC) can easily replace legacy systems without sacrificing any functionality or performance while giving operators an easy and flexible way to deploy this advanced network function in their cloud," said Carsten Rossenhövel, EANTC's managing director. "Whether deployed to facilitate plain SIP traffic in a network or for complex call handling in VoLTE environments, we found that the Perimeta vSBC meets typical service provider performance requirements." The tests, commissioned by Intel® under the Intel Network Builders Program, included both call signaling and audio stream processing and evaluated Perimeta's ability to assist in troubleshooting and to provide high-availability clustering. The comparison between the virtualized and appliance-based capabilities included evaluations of both OpenStack and VMware-based deployments. In evaluating security characteristics, Perimeta was found to effectively limit call rates when overloaded, and also to maintain baseline call signaling performance when subjected to DDoS attacks. Test Highlights EANTC cited the following as a result of the tests: Consistent, identical functionality when compared to legacy Perimeta SBC appliances Highly valuable alarm, event logging and call analysis when used in conjunction with the Metaswitch Service Assurance Server (SAS) Stable performance and reliable operation in overload conditions Ability to handle as many as 700 signaled calls per second and 78,000 simultaneous media sessions with no measurable difference in terms of QoS for both signaling and media compared to appliance based SBCs Verification of high availability "We are extremely pleased with the results of the EANTC testing, which demonstrates yet again the superior performance of our leading Perimeta vSBC, as experienced by our growing customer base of global service providers in real-world deployments," said Micaela Giuhat, vice president of product management at Metaswitch. "The virtualized Perimeta SBC offers providers clear advantages over proprietary or legacy COTS-based deployments, decreasing the time to revenue and providing compelling cost savings."

Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 12, 2016 at 6:45PM The Mac isn't doing so hot right now. Image source: Apple. The latest estimates are out on the state of the PC market. Spoiler alert: The market is still stagnant. Both Gartner and IDC have put out their most recent best guesses, and global shipments fell either 3.9% or 5.7%, depending on who you ask. This isn't surprising considering the age and maturity of the global PC market. I generally prefer IDC's numbers, so let's see what the market researcher has to say. Vendor Q3 2016 Worldwide Units Growth (YOY) Lenovo 14.5 million (3.2%) HP Inc. 14.4 million 3.3% Dell 10.8 million 6.2% Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) 5 million (13%) ASUS 4.7 million 5.2% Others 18.6 million (13.2%) Total 68 million (3.9%) Data source: IDC. Figures may not sum due to rounding. YOY = year over year. Lenovo remains the market leader, and the rest of the usual suspects are there. However, there is an important trend worth discussing: Apple got crushed...again. Do you see what happens when you don't refresh the Mac lineup? Do you see what happens? For many years, Apple enjoyed touting that it was continuously gaining share each quarter, as Mac unit volumes outperformed the broader market. The Mac either grew more, or declined by less, implying share gains. This is now the second consecutive quarter where the Mac underperformed the broader market, implying share losses. In Q2, Apple's unit volumes fell 8.3%, compared to the broader market's 4.5% decline, according to IDC. For what it's worth, Apple's official reported numbers show its Mac units fell 11% in the second quarter. Apple's Mac lineup has become stale, though, with the expected result of cooling demand. Some Macs haven't been updated in years, and the ones that have been updated recently don't have the latest and greatest Intel processors. The 27-inch iMac 5K is the only Mac with Skylake chips, a chip family that was launched in 2015. The good news is that Apple is widely expected to be launching new Macs in just a matter of weeks, which will likely bring its computers up to speed. Hopefully, demand will pick back up if and when that happens. Responding to a customer email last month, CEO Tim Cook said to "stay tuned." We're also seeing Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continue to make inroads in the educational market. IDC notes that Chromebooks expectedly had another "banner quarter in the K-12 market" (Gartner's figures do not include Chromebooks). Of course, Apple also addresses the educational market with iPads as well as Macs, but neither can compete with Chromebooks on price. The expected October event can't come soon enough -- and it'll be just in time for the holiday shopping season.

LibreELEC 8.0 "Krypton" to Be Based on Kodi 17 Media Center, Linux Kernel 4.8 GO LibreELEC 7.90.007 Alpha milestone available for testing now Oct 12, 2016 21:25 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  On October 11, 2016, the LibreELEC development team announced the availability of a new Alpha pre-prelease version of the upcoming LibreELEC 8.0 "Krypton" operating system based on the latest Kodi Media Center software. The new Alpha build, LibreELEC (Krypton) 7.90.007, is the seventh in the series, and it brings you the third Beta of the forthcoming Kodi 17 "Krypton" media center announced last week. Of course, this means that all the bug fixes and improvements implemented in Kodi 17 Beta 3 are also present in the LibreELEC 7.90.007 Alpha version, along with various other enhancements made by the team since the previous Alpha build. "LibreELEC (Krypton) 8.0 preview builds continue with v7.90.007 containing Kodi v17.0-beta3 which is starting to focus less on big changes and more on bug fixing," reads the announcement. "Amlogic audio also makes a leap forwards thanks to @kwiboo and @longchair from the RasPlex and Plex Inc. teams completing Amlogic kernel changes that allow hardware auto-detection capabilities in Kodi to “just work” without hacks." Another interesting change implemented in the seventh LibreELEC 8.0 Alpha milestone is a function injected into the settings add-on, which allows you to submit important log files to a paste online service if you want to help the developers fix issues in the operating system. Under the hood, LibreELEC 7.90.007 Alpha uses Linux kernel 4.7.6, iMX6 kernel 4.4.19, linux-amlogic 3.14 kernel, and Nvidia 340.98 proprietary driver. LibreELEC 8.0 to support Intel Baytrail 32-bit EFI booting There are many interesting features coming to the final LibreELEC 8.0 "Krypton" release, besides Kodi 17 media center, which is also dubbed "Krypton," and the new Alpha adds HK RTC shield support on Odroid C2 SBCs, support for the WeTek Play 2 (S905) device, DRI/Glamour support for AMD Radeon graphics cards, as well as initial support for Intel Baytrail 32-bit EFI booting. While you can download and test drive the LibreELEC 7.90.007 Alpha release for your devices, the development cycle will continue with a new Alpha build and a few Beta versions, which promise to add support for the recently released Linux 4.8 kernel. The final release of the LibreELEC 8.0 "Krypton" operating system should be available in the coming months. #LibreELEC 7.90.007 Alpha#LibreELEC 8.0#Kodi 17#RasPlex#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Qt 5.6.2 Toolkit Officially Released with Almost 900 Improvements and Bug Fixes Based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the Release Candidate of Black Lab Linux 8.0 Is Here GNOME 3.22 Desktop Environment Gets Its First Point Release, Brings Improvements Black Lab Linux Goes Commercial Due to Lack of Funding, netOS Discontinued Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    LibreELEC 7.90.007 Alpha released Other Linux Distros openSUSE Linux: The new and improved SUSE Linux operating system, a community-driven distribution LFA (Linux For All): A 64-bit only Linux-based operating system that features four desktop environments Salix OS Xfce Live: A Live Linux distribution based on Slackware Linux and featuring the Xfce desktop environment Tails OS: An open source live Linux operating system focused on Internet privacy and anonymity 4MLinux Core: A core version of the 4MLinux operating system aimed for building your own distro NethServer: A beautifully engineered server oriented operating system based on the CentOS Linux technologies Black Lab Linux: An Ubuntu-based Linux operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Reader comments Ubuntu Budgie Is Now an Official Ubuntu Flavor more on: Ubuntu Budgie i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Impact Venture Capital will also host a large-scale global venture summit event this year in California at the new Golden 1 Center, widely recognized as the most high-tech arena in the world. The firm will make investments alongside corporate venture groups in early stage information technology startups, with a focus on software and data analytics, and a commitment to serving one of four “global challenges”: security and government; energy and transportation; agriculture and health; and education and media. To highlight this new investment thesis, Impact will host the “Impact Global Venture Summit”, an annual event scheduled for November 14 [th] in Sacramento. Alongside event partners AT&T and the Entrepreneurs Organization, Impact Venture Capital’s event will provide a platform for dozens of high caliber tech companies to showcase their products and services in a venue designed to highlight their capabilities to an audience of angel investors, venture capital firms, and corporate venture groups. Doll, Ball, and Crawford have a long work history of co-investing and corporate portfolio management and share a strong global professional network in the startup and venture capital industries. Doll has spent nearly four decades in venture capital, having previously started the industry’s first fund focused on telecommunications technology at Accel. He later founded Doll Capital Management (DCM) and helped grow it to $3 billion of capital under management. DCM is widely recognized as the first Silicon Valley venture firm to enter China successfully. Doll’s firm has had extraordinary investing success, including investments in more than 20 startups that have attained valuations in excess of $1 billion. A regular on the “Midas List” which recognizes top performing VCs in the industry, Doll also served as Chairman of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and was on the Board of DirecTV for five years through its acquisition by AT&T for $49 billion. “After attempting to retire a few times, I’m excited to get back in the game and build a new firm that has the potential to impact the lives of billions of people,” said Doll. “When you have the opportunity to work with two energetic and smart investors like Eric and Jack, why would you ever want to sit on the sidelines?” Ball previously served as the Treasurer for Oracle Corporation, helping to manage $50 billion in assets. In his role as Treasurer, Ball was named one of the top 100 influencers in the US financial markets. He later served as CFO at C3 IoT and was the founder of Targhee Ventures where he invested in 18 startup companies. Crawford previously managed Velocity Venture Capital and co-invested alongside of both Doll and Ball in a number of promising startups. Operating primarily inside California’s technology triangle (bounded by San Francisco, San Jose, and Sacramento), Velocity Venture Capital has a long history of investing in early stage companies including the first round investment in Soft Machines, recently acquired by Intel for $270 million. For the last seven years, Velocity has been running innovation programs for startups, graduate students, and corporate venture groups from across the U.S. Both Ball and Crawford are graduates of the Kauffman Fellows program, an elite venture capital executive education program that provides two years of professional development to 40 selected Fellows each year. “I’m thrilled to see two alum in Eric and Jack partner with a VC legend like Dixon Doll,” said Phil Wickham, Executive Chairman of the Kauffman Fellows program. “These two were peer-selected leaders of their cohort, and I’m confident that their team will have great success as they work with Kauffman’s global network of venture capitalists and corporate venture groups.” “Access to the knowledge, professional networks and financial capital of venture investors is the lifeblood of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Without it, most startup founders lack the resources they need to scale and grow their ideas into the next generation of great American companies,” said Bobby Franklin, President and CEO of NVCA. “We congratulate the team at Impact Venture Capital on a successful launch and wish them luck as they start this journey.” About Impact Venture Capital Impact Venture Capital is an investment firm focused on early stage information technology startups, with a focus on software and data analytics, and a commitment to serving one of four “global challenges”: security and government; energy and transportation; agriculture and health; and education and media. The firm has California investment offices in Burlingame and Sacramento. Dixon Doll (founder of DCM Partners and former chair of the NVCA), Eric Ball (former Treasurer of Oracle Corporation), and Jack Crawford (serial entrepreneur and founding partner of Velocity Venture Capital) serve as the firm’s General Partners. For more information, please visit: impactvc.com About Impact Global Venture Summit Impact Venture Capital, in partnership with AT&T and the Entrepreneurs Organization, will host the Impact Global Venture Summit on November 14, 2016 at the new Golden 1 Center in Sacramento.

NVM technology is electrically programmable. It is also erasable when there is a need to make changes in a particular location within the storage device. Other than programming, erasing and storing, the technology also has the ability to retain changes even in the instance of power outage. Additionally, NVM utilizes user-configurable technology, and it does not require periodic memory refreshment unlike the volatile memory. Some of the examples of NVM are flash memory, Hard disk, and magnetic tape. The NVM is widely used in data centers and consumer electronics, which enhances the data transfer speed and prevent data loss. The ever increasing demand for faster access and low power consumption memory devices has been the major factors contributing to the wide spread adoption of NVM majorly in consumer electronics, automotive and healthcare sectors. Nevertheless, low write endurance rate and limited storage capacity would be factors that would restrain the market growth. Despite restraining factors, the demand for NVM, mainly in flexible electronics and innovation of advanced storage technologies such as 3D XPoint, MRAM, SONOS, and NRAM would be opportunities for the growth of the market. The report highlights the adoption of Non-Volatile Memory in North America. Based on the type, the Non-Volatile Memory market is segmented into Electrically Addressed, Mechanically Addressed and Others. Electrically Addressed segment is further divided into ROM, NVRAM and Other Memory. Mechanically Addressed segment is further divided into Hard-Disk Drive, Optical-Disc Drive, Magnetic Tape, Millipede memory and Holographic data storage. Other Non-volatile memory types are FRAM, Zero-RAM, Nano-bridge and Molecular which are discussed in this report. Based on the application the market is segmented into Enterprise Storage, Healthcare Monitoring, Consumer Electronics, Automotive Application, Industrial and Others. The Verticals highlighted in this report include Telecom & IT, Healthcare, Automotive, Energy & Power, Manufacturing Industries and Others.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Andrea Peterson October 12 Follow @kansasalps   (Olivier Douliery/European Pressphoto Agency) After facing an unprecedented wave of cyberattacks against private and public organizations during his presidency, President Obama thinks about digital threats like a public health crisis, he said in a Wired Magazine interview published Wednesday. Instead of approaching cybersecurity as a traditional battle, he thinks about defending systems as if preparing for a pandemic. He said: Traditionally, when we think about security and protecting ourselves, we think in terms of armor or walls. Increasingly, I find myself looking to medicine and thinking about viruses, antibodies. . . . What I spend a lot of time worrying about are things like pandemics. You can’t build walls to prevent the next airborne lethal flu from landing on our shores. Instead, what we need to be able to do is set up systems to create public health systems in all parts of the world, click triggers that tell us when we see something emerging, and make sure we’ve got quick protocols and systems that allow us to make vaccines a lot smarter. This metaphor lines up with mantras that many security experts have been repeating for a long time: Do everything you can to avoid a breach — but know they are basically inevitable, and be prepared to detect and fight back when they happen. Detect problems as soon as you can, and share the intel so other people can fend off the same sort of attack. The medical comparison works when you put it in the context of a single person’s immune system and institutional responses to outbreaks; definitely get the vaccine — but know that vaccines sometimes fail, and your immune system can't always fight off everything, so have treatments available; detect outbreaks early so you can treat them, and coordinate to research vaccines to stop the disease from spreading. However, some experts say that line of thinking isn't a perfect fit. “The health-care model is always dangerous, because it leaves you passive and reactive,” said James Lewis, a senior fellow focused on cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Diseases are a natural phenomenon, but cyberattacks aren’t, he added. “Your opponents are actual people who are nimble and can change tactics to respond to defensive measures much faster than the flu,” Lewis said. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

2016, 12:17 ET Share this article BROOKLYN, Oct. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Elite teams from seven universities won finalist slots in the ninth annual Embedded Security Challenge (ESC). The oldest and largest hardware hacking competition in the world, ESC is also the most difficult event at New York University Tandon School of Engineering's annual Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) games for students. The event, founded in 2008 by NYU Tandon Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Ramesh Karri and his students, is a cornerstone program of NYU's hardware security group. Part of NYU Center for Cyber Security and comprising researchers at NYU Tandon and NYU Abu Dhabi, the group has become a leading force in microchip security.    Continue Reading Finalists in the 2015 CSAW Embedded Security Contest brought their research as well as programmable computer boards to see if they could hack into an example of what may well become the next generation of voting systems, protected by homomorphic encryption. The ESC for the first time includes the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). Finalists will travel to IIT Kanpur or NYU Tandon to compete before a panel of security experts during CSAW (November 10-12, 2016). The seven finalist teams are: Grenoble INP-ESISAR (France) Team members: Cyril Bresch, Adrien Michelet-Gignoux, Thomas Meyer, Laurent Amato Mentor: David Hely Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur Team members: Manaar Alam, Vidya Govindan, Sarani Bhattacharya, Debapriya Basu Roy Mentors: Rajat Subhra Chakraborty, Debdeep Mukhopadhyay Indian Institute of Technology Madras Team members: Prasanna Karthik, Patanjali SLPSK, Gnanambikai Krishnakumar Mentor: Chester Rebeiro Pennsylvania State University Team members: Nolan Betts, Eric Pauley, Andy Luo Mentor: Swaroop Ghosh The University of Central Florida (Orlando) Team members: Orlando Arias, Dean Sullivan, Heather Lawrence, Kelvin Ly Mentor: Yier Jiin The University of New Hampshire Team members: Sean Kramer, Zhiming Zhang Mentor: Qiaoyan Yu The University of Texas at Dallas Team members: Tri Minh Cao, Danqing Liu Mentors: Jeyavijayan Rajendran, Yiorgos Makris The ESC tournament employs a "red team, blue team" format that mimics real-world attacks. This year's challenge was designed by a team of top NYU security faculty and students mentored by Assistant Professor Michail Maniatakos and Nektarios Tsoutsos, a computer science doctoral candidate studying under Maniatakos at NYU Abu Dhabi. The contest requires the competitors to defend against one of the most common security bugs: memory corruption, by which a hacker subverts a microchip by changing critical data in its memory. The teams will attempt to enhance a basic chip design so that memory corruption can't harm the system. "The Embedded Security Challenge at CSAW is not just about academic bragging rights," said Karri. "Because the attack and defense models and ideas that ESC generate apply to the real world — real scenarios, real technology, and real threats — they can be used to generate security tools for the chip design process and tactics for defending against theft of chip design and sabotage during fabrication."  The preliminary event required teams to design their own vulnerable computer programs, show how to exploit those vulnerabilities, and offer hardware defensive techniques to prevent such attacks. The ESC judges are Ryan Craven, program officer, Cyber Security Division, Office of Naval Research, U.S. Navy; Xiaofei Guo, senior security researcher, Security Center of Excellence, Intel Corporation; Antonis Stampoulis, senior software engineer/programming languages researcher, Originate NYC.; and Michael Locasto, senior computer scientist, SRI International. Sponsors for CSAW 2016 are: Gold Level — U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Trendy Micro, and Palo Alto Networks; Silver Level — IBM, Google, Kroll, Bridgewater; Bronze Level — Navy Civilian Careers, NCC Group, Raytheon, Facebook; Supporting Level — Bloomberg, Cubic, Intel, National Security Agency, Optiv, Sandia National Laboratories, U.S. Secret Service, EY, and The Ruth & Jerome A. Siegel Foundation; Contributing — Cigital, ACSA, Altera. About the NYU Tandon School of Engineering The NYU Tandon School of Engineering dates to 1854, when the New York University School of Civil Engineering and Architecture as well as the Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute (widely known as Brooklyn Poly) were founded. Their successor institutions merged in January 2014 to create a comprehensive school of education and research in engineering and applied sciences, rooted in a tradition of invention, and entrepreneurship and dedicated to furthering technology in service to society. In addition to its main location in Brooklyn, NYU Tandon collaborates with other schools within the country's largest private research university and is closely connected to engineering programs in NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai. It operates business incubators in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn and an award-winning online graduate program. For more information, visit http://engineering.nyu.edu.

Source: Grab Media Alibaba is developing the VR Pay system to make shopping easier. It will allow customers to shop without having to remove the headset to get their payment information. This allows them to continue shopping without breaking the VR experience. The VR Pay system  can also recognize a person’s voice to verify their identity. When it comes to authorizing a payment, users of the system can use different head movements, stare at a certain space or take other actions to confirm the purchase. Ant Financial was holding a demonstration of the VR Pay system on Wednesday. It operates Alipay, which is China’s largest online payments service. The group said that payment system will make VR more of a tool and less of a toy. It is currently planning for a commercial release by the end of the year, reports Reuters. VR is a hot topic as many tech companies move to embrace the technology. Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) will be releasing its own VR headset, the PlayStation VR, for $399 on Thursday. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is also working on its own VR headset called “Project Alloy.” However, it hasn’t announced a price or release date for the device, yet. Company’s working on VR have to overcome motion sickness if they want the devices to take off. There have been several cases of players throwing up while wearing headsets. This was the case with several gamers at 2016’s E3 Expo.

In addition to the C5m tablet platforms, RAAFA purchased Xplore desktop docking stations and other accessories to enhance productivity across its five aged-care facilities. The investment in rugged mobile technology from Xplore enabled RAAFA to move their administration requirements from a traditional static 'office' location to a mobile 'on-the-go' system. By providing caregivers real-time access to patient records, they can now document conditions instantly at the point of care, whether this is at the patients' bedsides, in the dining room, leisure area or any other location within RAAFA's environment. According to Craig Burkett, RAAFA CIO: "We have very strict standards to uphold, and Xplore provided the right technology solution and, just as importantly, the right installation. This system eases our administration load, improves accuracy and substantially increases productivity. Not only does it free staff to focus more on their core competencies in caregiving, it provides them with a sense of empowerment in the workplace doing what they were trained to do to the best of their abilities. Ultimately, this translates to better residential care and job satisfaction for our staff." Built for demanding mobile care patient environments that require robust enterprise software compatibility, the C5m rugged tablet leverages an Intel® Core™ i7 vPro™ processor to deliver class-leading speed with lower energy use and extended battery life. The C5m's built-in 802.11ac Wi-Fi®, Bluetooth® 4.0 and 4G technology, along with multifactor authentication features and optional barcode scanner, make it easy to run EHR applications and send secure up-to-the-minute patient information to the entire care team without ever leaving the patient's side. The MIL-STD-810G and IP54 rated tablet is also lightweight, spill resistant, drop tolerant and easily disinfected, so downtime is never an issue. That means more time spent on patient care versus device care. Follow Us Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Make an enquiry First Name Last Name Email Address Enquiry
