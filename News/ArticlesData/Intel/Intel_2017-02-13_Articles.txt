Twitter Facebook Intel ships latest Itanium chip called Kittson, but grim future looms HPE will ship high-end Itanium servers in the second half of the year, and the chip will be supported by HP-UX and OpenVMS Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 15 February, 2017 05:36 - - - - print email Comments Intel's Itanium chip is hanging by a thread, and after more than three years, the company is now shipping the next and possibly final version of the processor, which is code-named Kittson. The chip is now shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which commands a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. InteI considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips. But the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable.

Intel's ANV Vulkan Driver Gets An Important Performance Fix For Broadwell Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 14 February 2017 at 05:30 PM EST. 1 Comment If you are using Intel Broadwell graphics with Mesa's ANV Vulkan driver, the performance should be better for Dota 2 and potentially other workloads. Back in January for the Intel IvyBridge/Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake OpenGL & Vulkan Benchmarks On Linux 4.10 + Mesa 13.1 article, the Vulkan performance on Broadwell was poor relative to the other generations/hardware. While the Core i7 5775C with Iris Pro graphics were much faster than the Core i5 6600K HD Graphics (Skylake) and others with OpenGL, under Vulkan it was barely faster than Skylake HD hardware. Fortunately, the underlying issue appears to have now been corrected. Jason Ekstrand has landed a PMA stall workaround in the ANV driver today for Mesa 17.1-dev Git. This should help Dota 2 with Broadwell graphics hardware by 8~9%, according to Jason. Though with my aforelinked results from January, there's more than an 8~9% slowdown from where the i7-5775C should have been performing, so I guess I'll fire up Mesa Git on that Iris Pro box and see how the performance is now with Mesa 17.1-dev. Details via this commit. The workaround is over 200 lines of new code and isn't CC'ed as a candidate for getting into Mesa 17.0 or older stable series. There is also a PMA optimization for Skylake but it doesn't appear to help the overall frame-rate by much. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 14, 2017 at 5:30PM At Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Feb. 9 investor meeting, the company talked a little bit about chip manufacturing -- arguably, the company's core competency. Though the company didn't dedicate a whole presentation to chip-manufacturing technology, as it has in recent years (apparently the company will be doing an entirely separate presentation sometime in the first half of this year), Intel executive Murthy Renduchintala did take the opportunity to highlight that the company has a three-year lead over competing chip manufacturers. In this column, I'd like to put that claim under the microscope and see if it checks out. Intel's claims Check out the following slide from Intel: Intel logic-cell area competitive comparison. Image source: Intel. The focus of this presentation was on a metric that Intel calls "effective logic cell area" -- essentially, the lower the number, the better. The company claims that its 14-nanometer technology, which went into high-volume production in the first half of 2014, will have had clear leadership in this metric until Intel's competition -- Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) -- release their 10-nanometer technologies in the first half of this year. Intel's chart seems to suggest that those 10-nanometer technologies will offer comparable logic-cell areas to Intel's 14-nanometer technology -- though the chart indicates that Intel's 14-nanometer technology will be slightly behind on this metric. During his presentation, Renduchintala also indicated that he expects that Intel will "continue to maintain a three-year lead, even after [Intel's] competitors release their 10-nanometer plans during the course of this year." Challenging that claim Intel has made a reasonable case for why its 14-nanometer technology is more comparable to competing 10-nanometer technologies than to competing 14/16-nanometer technologies -- at least when it comes to logic-cell area. Intel has also done a good job explaining why its 10-nanometer technology should give the company a significant logic-cell area lead over competing 10-nanometer technologies. Intel's chart also indicates, quite honestly, that its 10-nanometer technology will go into production a few quarters later than competing 10-nanometer technologies. What the chart is missing, however, is information regarding competing 7-nanometer technologies. It's not clear when Samsung intends to go into mass production on its 7-nanometer technology, but TSMC has said that it intends to go into mass production on its 7-nanometer technology in the first half of 2018. Presumably, this technology will be shipping in very high volumes in support of Apple's 2018 iPhone. TSMC is claiming a significant area reduction for its 7-nanometer technology relative to its 10-nanometer technology -- EETimes reports a 1.63 times increase in routed gate density for TSMC's 7-nanometer tech compared to its 10-nanometer tech -- so it seems likely that Intel will have far less of a lead during its 10-nanometer generation than it did during its 14-nanometer generation. More clarity needed At this point, I'm struggling to see how Intel can justify its claim that, in terms of logic-cell density, it will be able to maintain a three-year lead over TSMC, as it looks as though Intel's lead will shrink generation over generation. Intel is expected to do a full day's worth of presentations related to chip-manufacturing technology at some point in the first half of this year. I hope the company will provide more detail about its future technology plans -- both 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer -- as well as, perhaps, a more detailed and comprehensive competitive comparison.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News General Micro Systems Boasts 12x Performance and Density with 1U Xeon® D Red/Black Rugged Rackmount Server/Switch/Router RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif.–()–General Micro Systems, Inc. (GMS) today announced the S1U-MD, a 1U rackmount, multi-domain server and managed Ethernet switch/router based on the Intel® Xeon® D server CPU. S1U-MD boasts 12x the performance of traditional blade-servers, but in one-twelfth the size of traditional systems. Isolating Red and Black domains to ensure security or designing for redundancy is normally accomplished with one full-depth box for each Red and Black domain: 1) two physically separate servers; 2) two separate Ethernet multi-port switches; and 3) two separate routers. Putting this capability into a single, 1U high and 17-inch deep (Short Rack) server blade is another GMS engineering phenomenon in small form factor rugged systems. S1U-MD takes one-twelfth the rack space of a competing multi-domain solution. The S1U-MD has six network functions in one, making it ideal for the Navy’s evolution of secure Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) and Base Level Information Infrastructure (BLII) networks worldwide. S1U-MD targets all rugged rackmount installations, from ships and ground vehicles, to mobile command posts, mission command centers, first responders and airborne C4ISR platforms. The 1U high, Short Rack box does it all. General Micro Systems is trusted at sea, in the air and on land and has been supplying Smart Displays and VME boards to the U.S. Navy for shipboard use for more than three decades, and has applied its extensive knowledge of Naval requirements to the design of the S1U-MD. “We took our successfully deployed and proven SB2002-SW ‚Blackhawk’ multi-domain server from the U.S. Army’s WIN-T battlefield network program and optimized it for rugged, rack-mount applications for the Navy,” said GMS CEO Benjamin Sharfi. “You won’t find a MILS-ready dual 1U server with 28 Ethernet ports anywhere on the planet. No one else could accomplish all this functionality—and ruggedness—in 1U-Short, but we did it.” S1U-MD Technical Specifications Each S1U-MD has up to a 16-core Intel® Xeon® D CPU per server domain and can be powered via 110/220 VAC or 28VDC (“dirty power” per MIL-STD-1275). Each domain’s CPU can support 32 virtual machines (VMs), or 64 VMs per 1U-Short space. There is up to 64GB of DDR-4 at 2133MTS with ECC RAM per CPU domain, and four removable drives per domain with RAID support (plus another for OS boot): total disk storage is 80 TB per domain, or an incredible total 160 TB in the slim 1U-Short rack. Besides the Red/Black separation, a zeroize function (panic-initiated) is available to securely erase all non-volatile storage in each domain—a non-trivial feature designed to avoid a repeat of the Hainan Island incident. For each domain, network connectivity includes an integrated managed Layer 2/3 Ethernet switch with up to twelve 1 Gigabit Ethernet ports and two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports (Fiber or Copper) per domain. Four of the 1 Gigabit ports include Power-over-Ethernet (POE+), supplying up to 25.5W (total) to directly power remote nodes such as sensors and to simplify wiring. The switch handles local routing and virtual LANs and accelerates packet processing to maximize wire speed; the 10 Gigabit ports support inter/intra-rack datacom or WAN reachback. There are two USB 3.0 ports, two USB 2.0 ports and HDMI for a user interface. Additionally, the Intel® Xeon® D CPU allows a full-featured Cisco® IOS® router to be run in one or more VMs in each domain. Cisco’s Embedded Services Router (ESR) series is intended for embedded applications; additionally, Cisco’s 1000V™ Series Cloud Services Router (CSR) running on an S1U-MD VM creates a locally hosted, infrastructure-agnostic “single tenant router” capability, uniquely supported on S1U-MD’s multi-domain hardware. Routing is available on all 1 Gigabit and 10 Gigabit ports for each of S1U-MD’s domains. Like all GMS products, S1U-MD can accommodate additional I/O such as MIL-STD-1553, CANbus, Serial Ports and custom features. The architecture is U.S. Army VICTORY conformant. Application Examples As cyber-security threats grow, the Department of Defense and service branches are hardening worldwide networks. One way to significantly enhance security is by separating secure from insecure networks through Red/Black isolation and Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS). In fact, the Navy’s PEO Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) identifies boundary isolation as a key upgrade for both NMCI and BLII networks. Running SIPRNet (secure) and NIPRNet (insecure) networks in the same 1U space is a perfect example of efficient isolation. Red/Black separation is needed in ground-, shipboard- and airborne-based installations. S1U-MDSW’s low weight and small size make it deployable on many ground, air and shipboard platforms. S1U-MD is also ideal for enterprise/cloud data centers or server rooms where the 12:1 size/weight/power reduction is a smart upgrade by combining the server/switch/router into one domain, and combining two domains into only 1U shelf. Two S1U-MD boxes can be mounted back-to-back in a 1U shelf. S1U-MD multi-domain servers with switches are also ideal for field-deployed, shipboard, airborne reconnaissance, first responder command post vehicles, oil/gas exploration or fault-tolerant/redundant industrial controllers.

The chip is now shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which commands a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. InteI considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips. But the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 13, 2017 at 9:01PM These days, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) forces gamers and other personal computer enthusiasts to make a tough choice when picking out desktop processors. Intel offers PC gamers chips with four incredibly fast processor cores ("mainstream desktop"), and it also offers them chips with between six and 10 processor cores ("high-end desktop"), but each of these cores is much slower than the four-core chips. The six- to 10-core chips also cost much more than the four-core chips do, as well. Although Intel does not provide sales data by individual chip model, I have a strong suspicion that even gamers with very deep pockets often opt for the super-fast quad-core chip rather than go for one of the more expensive chips. Image source: Intel. After all, since most games can't really take advantage of more than four cores, why should a gamer pick a chip with a lot of slower cores when the one with fewer but faster cores for cheaper will enable a superior user experience? This is one of the reasons that Intel's high-end desktop product lineup (the expensive six- to 10-core chips with relatively slow cores) has usually been somewhat of a "niche" among gamers. Going forward, considering a recent announcement from the chipmaker, I believe that Intel's high-end desktop processors will become much more attractive by remedying the problem that I outlined above. Data center first could mean high-end desktop first Intel's previous product development methodology was "personal computer first, data center second." Since Intel's mainstream desktop chips are designed first and foremost as personal computer chips (the same basic designs are used in high performance notebook computers as well as desktop computers), they have historically gotten all the technical goodies first. Indeed, the mainstream desktop chips have generally had Intel's most advanced processor cores built using the company's most advanced chip manufacturing technology. The high-end desktop chips, which are based on the chips that the company designs and sells into the data center, tend to not represent Intel's best -- at least in ways that matter to consumers.  The data center parts have generally been a generation behind in both processor architecture and manufacturing technology relative to the mainstream desktop/notebook processors. Now that the situation is going to reverse going forward, the high-end desktop chips should have the best processor cores and be built using the best manufacturing technology. Once Intel's product development methodology change flows through to products in the marketplace, then I wouldn't be surprised to see enthusiasts and gamers gravitating more to the high-end desktop products, as they will represent Intel's best, while the mainstream desktop chips will represent older, less desirable technology. Potential impact on Intel's business If what I expect to eventually play out does in fact happen, it would probably manifest itself in Intel's financial results as a mix shift to higher-performance/higher-priced gaming products. To the extent that Intel can drive a richer mix of products, the company should see both revenue (same number of units sold, but the ones that do sell are higher priced, on average) and profit improvements (even at fixed gross profit margin, higher revenue means higher gross profit dollars). This transition isn't going to happen overnight, though. Remember that Intel said that its data center products won't take the manufacturing lead from its traditional client personal computer products until it rolls out its third-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Considering that, don't expect Intel's high-end desktop products to become the company's unequivocally best products in terms of core performance and manufacturing technology until, perhaps, the middle of 2019.

In the market for a new gaming laptop? The latest version of the 14-inch Razer Blade now runs a Intel Kaby Lake processor, boasts faster memory, and includes a 4K ultra high-definition screen option. Razer said the seventh-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor achieves "double-digit increases in productivity benchmarks," and paired with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 graphics delivers "the best frame rates available in an ultra-thin laptop." As for size, the new Razer Blade measures just 0.70 inches thin and weighs a little more than 4 pounds. A full HD panel comes standard, but you can opt for the 4K UHD touch screen for added clarity, the first time Razer has offered this option on its 14-inch model. "The Razer Blade sets the benchmark for performance in thin laptops," Razer co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan said in a statement. "More users embraced this flagship computer model in 2016 than ever before, and we are excited to make it even more available worldwide this year. Beyond gaming, it has been really gratifying to see people enjoying the power and portability of the Blade for video editing, music creation, and software development." In terms of specs, the laptop comes with 16GB of system memory (DDR4 running at 2400 MHz), runs Windows 10, and offers up to 1TB of SSD storage. The new Razer Blade Full HD systems are available online now in North America and Europe and in the San Francisco RazerStore, starting at $1,899. The 4K UHD model is expected to launch in the second quarter of the year.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 14, 2017 at 9:00AM Back in April of 2016, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced that it would be implementing restructuring actions that the company said were designed to achieve annual run rate operating expense savings of $1.4 billion. At the time, Intel said that the restructuring was intended to "accelerate [Intel's] evolution from a [personal computer] company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices." A wafer of Intel's 7tg generation Core chips. Image source: Intel. At its Feb. 9 investor meeting, Intel went into much more detail about how it has shifted around its spending. Let's take a closer look. Investment shift year-over-year Intel provided the following chart which illustrates a "bridge" from Intel's 2016 operating expenses to its projected 2017 operating expenses: How Intel's research and development spending is shifting year-over-year. Image source: Intel. This "bridge" shows that Intel expects operating expenses to drop year-over-year due to the spin-off of its Intel Security group (which will now be a stand-alone company called McAfee) as well as reductions in its Client Computing Group (CCG) investment levels. Offsetting those declines, though, is an increase in investment levels in what the company collectively refers to as its "growth businesses" -- Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, and Non-Volatile Solutions Group. Additionally, Intel says it's investing more in Moore's Law, which means that it's boosting its investments in next generation manufacturing technologies. This makes sense because the company's new development methodology calls for the company to continue to enhance existing manufacturing technologies while simultaneously developing next-generation ones -- something that it didn't really do before. All told, Intel is looking at a modest reduction in operating expenses, year-over-year. Some additional detail In addition to the broad year-over-year spending shifts that Intel talked about above, CFO Bob Swan showed an additional slide that gives more insight into how much research and development spending by market segment is expected to shift from 2015 through 2017. How Intel's research and development spending changed by product category. Image source: Intel. Intel is apparently cutting its research and development spending in personal computer processors by 5% in 2017 relative to where it was in 2015. That's not all that much, to be blunt, and I'd imagine the bulk of that shift comes more from accounting changes (i.e. allocating less of its shared operating expenses to the PC segment and more of it to other segments, like the Data Center Group). Data Center spending is expected to be up by 25% in that two-year period. I'd imagine that part of that increase is due to the shared expense allocation, but I also expect that Intel is increasing its investments here in ways beyond simply a reshuffling of expenses. Intel's investments in non-volatile memory -- a business that Intel expects to be a key growth engine in the years ahead -- are going up 40%. Considering that technology strength is critical to succeeding in the non-volatile memory business (better technology usually translates into a better cost structure, allowing a company to more effectively compete at good margin levels), the boost in spending isn't a surprise. The company's investments in mobile are going to be down 55% per the slide. That's not surprising considering that Intel has refocused its mobile business away from trying to build a broad range of platforms to address the broad range of smartphones toward focusing primarily on stand-alone cellular modems, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) being the company's principal (only?) smartphone customer here. And, finally, Intel is expecting a big boost in its investments within its Internet of Things Group. This business has been growing steadily over the last several years and management had indicated that they're making some big bets on new areas like self-driving cars, so a large increase in research and development spending here makes sense -- especially as the odds that those investments will ultimately pay off look good. Intel's sensible spending shifts At the end of the day, these spending shifts are quite reasonable -- the company is feeding those business segments that have been growing and have the potential to continue to grow, and it's cutting back in areas that aren't expected to grow (i.e. PC processors) as well as in areas where its efforts have fallen flat and success appears unlikely (mobile system-on-chip). Intel management is investing for the long-term, which is the right thing to do. However, investments in high technology usually take years to bear fruit, so don't expect these increased investments made today to pay off tomorrow. It'll be a couple of years before we know if Intel's increased investments will ultimately pay off.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected Report: Intel’s 8th gen chips will still use 14nm, will arrive earlier than expected By Joel Hruska on February 13, 2017 at 2:45 pm Comment Last year, Intel announced that it would abandon the Tick-Tock model that had served it for nearly a decade and switch to something called PAO — Process, Architecture, Optimization. The point of switching from a two-step process to a three-step system was to give Intel extra time to roll out its next-generation process nodes, while simultaneously affording more opportunity to eke maximum gains out of each current node. Now, new information suggests Intel may have a product plan that tears up PAO (or at least complicates it) going forward. Analyst Ashraf Eassa claims to have confirmed with Intel that upcoming 8th generation Core processors will use an updated/enhanced variant of 14nm technology yet again — call it 14nm++. Intel was able to squeeze some gains out of Kaby Lake in this fashion compared with Skylake, but they weren’t huge leaps. Image by Anandtech A slide showed by Intel at a recent speech on the future of its data center business confirms this by stating “Data center first to next process node,” Anandtech notes. It also makes the point that enterprise and government spending are only worth a 2% increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) while the cloud services business is expected to grow by 15% from 2017-2021. Still, at first glance, this may seem a foolish strategy. After all, AMD’s Ryzen will debut in the imminent future, and one might reasonably conclude that Intel’s best leap forward is with a strong 10nm chip rather than a third iteration on 14nm. But this misses a larger issue — one we’ve discussed multiple times over the past few years. As node shrinks become more difficult and the advantages of any given node shrink are less and less potent, it can take longer for a company to deliver meaningful advantages. Intel is still pursuing full node shrinks, unlike its competitors at GlobalFoundries, Samsung, and TSMC. These firms won’t offer equivalent gate lengths or feature sizes to Intel until they deploy their 10nm nodes and aren’t expected to match Intel’s 10nm until they hit 7nm. This is why Intel can still plausibly claim to be ahead on process technology, despite using a higher number to describe it. Image by Ars Technica When Intel debuted 14nm, it pushed that technology into ultra-mobile parts first, where the reduction in power consumption and improvement of low-power clock speeds was seen as critical to the company’s ability to compete with ARM. As we’ve recently discussed, the improvements to Intel’s low-power CPUs have been considerably larger than the boosts to desktop performance in an equivalent period of time. AMD, prior to Ryzen, has been stuck in a similar scenario. We may be arriving at a point where it makes more sense to keep older nodes around and to improve process nodes and architecture over several generations than it does to aggressively transition to each new node. Earlier this year, Mark Papermaster of AMD made comments to suggest that AMD would stick to 14nm for multiple product generations. It’s not clear how this will play out or how aggressively the smaller CPU manufacturer will use the strategy. But we could be seeing a similar play from Intel, which has already deployed 14nm across three families of processors (Broadwell, Skylake, Kaby Lake) and may be prepping desktop Cannon Lake chips for a fourth. Other foundry manufacturers have begun referring to certain nodes as “long-lived” (28nm, 14/16nm, and possibly 7nm) while others (20nm, 10nm) are being described as short-term nodes. This differentiation didn’t used to exist in semiconductor technology and it indirectly speaks to what Intel may be driving at: Some nodes are better than others for certain types of semiconductors. 8th-gen chips on 14nm are now expected in the second half of 2017 rather than the first half of 2018 as had previously been reported. This could mean Intel wants to push new hardware to compete with Ryzen sooner than later. Intel might defend PAO as a process with an undisclosed number of steps in the “Optimization” portion, rather than a discrete series of changes that was meant to apply to three, and only three, groups of processors. This interpretation is undermined by how Intel raised precisely zero objections last year when the world+dog described PAO as a three-step process compared with the two-stop pendulum model of tick-tock. We may see multiple process nodes gathered together under the 8th Generation Core banner, with ultra-low-power mobile and data center chips moving to 10nm first, while desktop and high-power laptop processors following at a later date.

One of the benefits of working for a big company is that you get a say in the type of computer you wish to use. I use a Lenovo ThinkPad, while many of my colleagues use MacBook Airs – a decision that requires an opinion piece of its own to understand. Some folk choose Mac minis. They'll take their Mac mini out of their locker and carry it to their 'hot desk' for the day. At the end of each day, they'll unplug it and return it to their locker. I know, it's mind-boggling – and in more ways than you might think. For one, it has been 854 days since Apple's last Mac mini update, or more than two years. In and of itself, the Mac mini's age isn't a problem, as you should generally be able to get at least three years out of a decent computer, and often many more. But what you won't see on any Apple spec sheet is the fact that its 'latest' Mac minis use Intel's 4th-generation 'Haswell' Core processors. These actually launched in July 2014, making the technology at the heart of the device positively ancient, at least in computer chip time. These processors are significantly less efficient and powerful than current-gen Intel CPUs, and even pale in comparison to the 5th-gen kit found in the seemingly abandoned MacBook Air. Compared to the 6th- and 7th-gen kit found in the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro? Don't get me started. Related: Intel Core i processors explained At £479, the Mac mini is the cheapest way to join the excellent macOS ecosystem; even the most expensive Mac mini model 'only' costs £949, which is less than you'll pay for a new MacBook Pro. Yet given its fossilised internals, you won't be making the most of what macOS Sierra has to offer. You don’t get the benefits of a great touchpad, brilliant screen or backlit keyboard. You don’t get processors powerful enough to do multimedia task particularly well, and the cheapest model also comes with just 4GB of RAM, plus you have to attach numerous cables to get the benefit of its desktop form factor. One argument in favour of the device is that it features more ports than all the MacBooks. This is true: it does have a pair of ThunderBolt/DisplayPort connectors and an HDMI port, along with four USB ports and an SD card slot. However, it can’t output to a 4K monitor at more than a juddery 30Hz, making its high-res capability useless for many people. It’s lumped with slow hard disks in all but the most expensive model, which receives a slightly faster “Fusion” drive with a bit of solid state cache. But there’s no high-performance storage anywhere to be seen. What really irks me here is that the Mac mini has the potential to be a fantastic machine. Nowadays, you can quite happily squeeze a proper quad-core Intel processor into a compact PC chassis, rather than the piddly U-series dual cores in the Mac mini. Intel’s Skull Canyon range of PCs, the stylish HP Pavilion Wave and the impressive Zotac Zbox Magnus, are but three examples of what can be achieved in a compact space. To dive a bit deeper, let's use the Pavilion Wave as our example. It's a complete PC that includes a built-in speaker, high-quality design, and components that are substantially faster than the Mac mini. Yet it costs, at most, £730 for 128GB of SSD storage, a 1TB hard disk and a proper quad-core i5 processor from Intel’s sixth-gen range. Plus, it can output 4K at a full 60Hz. All this value from HP, a company that's aggressively pursuing Apple levels of flashy lifestyle kit. Against the odds, it's actually succeeding. Windows 10 may lag behind macOS in terms of ease of use, but HP's PC shows what’s possible in hardware terms. If Apple simply refreshed the Mac mini this year with the latest 7th-gen Intel Core processors, I might see a reason to buy one again. But what the mini really needs is a complete overhaul – a new design and components that match what consumers expect in 2017. Oh, and a nice marketing push from Apple to help me feel better about parting with my hard earned cash. Maybe a 2017 Mac mini update is in the works and being kept remarkably well under wraps. Given that so many people prefer macOS and the Apple brand – and that the Mac mini is, in terms of computers, the easiest way to get on board with these things – it would make sense. Yet given the complete lack of rumours surrounding a Mac mini refresh, I fear for the future of this compact machine. It's a shame because, ultimately, it means that Apple is content with giving you a half-arsed user experience, undermining its great software by continuing to flog slow and outdated hardware. That's why, this Valentine's Day, I've fallen out of love with Apple. Come autumn, I hope Apple helps me open my heart again. WATCH: Laptop buying guide Do you agree with Michael?

I kept it until if could no longer process my yearly tax returns. But the new iMacs had gotten to be more expensive than I wanted to buy. My mom bought my first one as my birthday/Xmas present. A friend who has worked at Apple for years told me about the then, new Mac Mini. I wasted no time buying one. I am now on my second one, the last 2009 model. It may not be the fastest computer on the block, but it works for me most of the time, with some minor disruptions. I love me my Minis. So far, I have heard the 2010 Mini's are the end of the line of Minis. I refuse to accept that. I don't like laptops and their fragility. I also like that should anyone break in and want to steal my computer, they would likely walk right by my Mac mini, as most people don't even know what it is. As much as I like Apple products - I hate their pricing and I am on a budget for electronics, all which have a limited life. I don't know what I will do if Apple does not either continue the Mini, or come up with something equal or better at a lower price than their other computers. My hope is that Apple is not just content selling to smaller businesses, or those who have a lot more money to spend on electronics. Please, please, please. - either bring back my the MacMinis or, at least something equal or better at a fair market price for the budget minded! I want to stay loyal to Apple and I really don't like PC's. I had to use those at work for years and hated them. matt February 15, 2017, 4:42 am There was a recent article on the web that explained apples limited choices for mobile processors. You got to put part of the blame on intel. I'd love to see a Mac mini with a better video then intel , but intel would sue the crap out of you if you sold an i5 with nvidia graphics Edward Lock February 15, 2017, 6:30 am Why buy an overpriced Lemon like "MAC", when you can have a more capable lemon cream pie PC for less than 1/2 the price.WTF?...........puffy cuteness and esoteric purpleness, yea real useful. Bob Forsberg February 15, 2017, 7:35 am MacOS is my system of choice, but Apple's hardware is, as you say "ancient" by computer standards. Apple has transformed into a hand held device company, ignoring those of us using desktop systems. Since Apple lags in hardware manufacturing, they should license MacOS to run on superior and often refreshed, high-end PC hardware. We miss you Steve. itsallgonepearshaped February 15, 2017, 9:05 am I just bought myself an Intel NUC 6th Gen box. Smaller, lighter and faster than my old mac mini server. I'm moving away from MacOS back to windows due to the lack of investment and continually disappointing and constrained hardware. I will keep my Macbook pro for a couple more years as it's one a year old. Not sure about by my iMac 5k, it's a beautiful machine, but runs Windows under bootcamp(which I need for work) like a dysfunctional child. Alex Walsh February 15, 2017, 11:09 am Hackintosh a Gigabyte Brix? From a quick look Sierra is achievable. That's a proper Mac Mini :) Michael Passingham February 15, 2017, 12:24 pm Yeah, Apple is specific about the chips it wants. The most recent MacBook Pros used last-gen Skylake chips because the Kaby Lake chips apple uses (normally with Iris Graphics on board) weren't ready yet. But, all the same, I do think Apple could slap an SSD in, load it up with some more RAM and upgrade to a Skylake chip and lots of people would be happy. jheartney February 15, 2017, 1:20 pm Got tired of waiting for Apple to sell a reasonable mini-tower; I'm building a Hackintosh. (Macintosh owner since 1990; had more Macs than I can count. Apple's innovative DNA died with Steve, and now they're just a money factory.) Roger Randall February 15, 2017, 11:12 pm Um, there are three generations of Minis beyond the 2010 models. 2011, 2012 and the current (crippled) models. I have 4, one is a quad-core i7 that is pretty fast. You can still buy good used models (prices are going up though) and parts are still available. SCSZ February 16, 2017, 12:58 am I've seen that. But I am hoping Apple will change it's mind or make something better which won't cost to much. I don't want to spend money on a later model Mini and then find out a new one is coming out. I will wait 6 months or so, and see what happens.

Expected to launch in the second half of 2017, the Coffee Lake update to the current Kaby Lake processors will offer an expected 15% bump in performance over its predecessor, though it will still be based on the same 14nm process. That this will represent the fourth generation in a row based on the 14nm process may be a sign of Intel's growing troubles in keeping up with Moore's Law, which suggests die sizes would shrink in half every two years. Increasing complexities with the smaller chips have presented significant challenges in allowing manufacturers to keep up with Moore's Law and, indeed, Intel last year abandoned its former tick-tock model of releases based on Moore's Law in favour of a Process-Architecture-Optimisation cycle that spans three years before a shrink in the die size. Coffee Lake will represent a departure from Intel's stated plans for the new release cycle as well, being the fourth generation based on the 14nm process first introduced with Broadwell. Apart from the performance bump, the only other difference between Kaby Lake and Coffee Lake will be the release of a six-core CPU as part of the standard lineup of CPUs, a feature currently reserved for the higher tier Xeon and Extreme Edition lines. While the company also has a range of processors dubbed Cannon Lake based on a 10nm process in the works, there is no release date currently and language from Intel suggests consumers may not see a die shrink for some time to come, as the company may diverge its offerings between enterprise and consumers, offering the former the newer chips first.

This week Intel took the wraps off its new Xeon E7-8894 v4 processor, providing a new top-end chip and breaking a number of performance records in the process. Intel first debuted the 14-nanometer-based Xeon E7-8800 processor family in June 2016 and is now expanding it with increased performance. "Intel continues to push innovation and process improvements with the Intel Xeon processor E7-8894 v4, which has captured several record-breaking results based on key performance benchmarks, including SAP SD 2-Tier, SPECjbb*2015, SPECcpu2006, LINPACK and SAP BW edition on SAP HANA," Intel stated. With the new E7-8894 v4, up to 32 sockets can be connected via a node controller, which enables configurations that can have up to 24 processor cores. The processor base frequency is clocked at 2.40 GHz and can burst up to 3.40 GHz with turbo frequency. The chip also integrates a 60 MB cache as part of its 165W power envelope. Additionally, the chip can support up to 24 TB of memory in an 8-socket system, which is being positioned by Intel for the in-memory analytics market. Intel is also positioning the high-end chip for scale-up workloads, including online transaction processing and large databases. All that power doesn't come cheaply, though, as Intel currently has then E7-8894 V4 listed online with a recommended customer price of $8,898.

But Intel is quietly signalling that PCs shipped during the holiday 2017 season could feature one of two new designs, using either its aging 14nm process or the upcoming 10nm technology. The two new names to add to your Intel vocabulary include Cannon Lake, a 10nm chip that Intel showed off at CES last month, and an unnamed fourth-generation 14nm chip that some are referring to as Coffee Lake. The latter chip is perhaps the most interesting, as it would extend Intel’s 14nm chips to a record four generations, following Broadwell, Skylake, and the current Kaby Lake chip. When Intel added a third 14nm chip 2015, signalling the end of the company’s vaunted “tick-tock” manufacturing process, the industry freaked out. A fourth, then, would be absolutely unprecedented. But Intel already seems to be setting the stage to convince investors and customers that it can manufacture four straight generations of chips on the same 14-nm process without giving up consistent performance improvements—which is what customers care about, after all. Why this matters: At its investor day last week, Intel said that its 8th-generation Core chips—which should include Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake—will deliver a 15 percent performance improvement over Kaby Lake. That’s good enough for most consumers. But enthusiasts have to wonder where the additional performance will come from—and whether it will open the door to AMD’s own rival, Ryzen. There’s also a broader question: if Intel’s being forced into shipping a fourth 14nm chip, will the same scenario play out within the 10nm generation? IDG / Mark Hachman Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich shows off Cannon Lake hardware at its CES 2017 presentation. Here’s how 2017 shapes up Intel hasn’t made a big deal of the fact that it’s pursuing parallel 10nm and 14nm strategies, but both chips have been finally referred to publicly. At CES, Intel showed off a two-in-one running Cannon Lake, later claiming that Intel would ship Cannon Lake chips in 2017. Intel’s plan for a separate 14nm chip appeared in a roadmap slide during its investor’s day last week, titled “Advancing Moore’s Law on 14nm”. That roadmap included an illustration showing that the company tentatively plans to ship those 14nm, 8th-generation Core chips during the second half of 2017, too. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of what some are calling a “split” approach is how Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake are positioned. Intel is believed to be targeting Cannon Lake at more premium niche markets such as low-power ultrabooks, leaving the well-established 14nm process powering Coffee Lake for mainstream notebooks and desktops until the 10nm Cannon Lake comes fully up to speed. That strategy avoids forcing Intel to bet everything on the unproven 10nm process, and allows them to focus on premium, high-margin products, analyst Dean McCarron said—the strategy that helped Intel’s client group grow operating profits by 30 percent even as PC shipments declined in 2016. AMD It certainly looks like this could be the summer of Ryzen. How quickly Intel can steal its thunder with Cannon Lake or Coffee Lake remains to be seen. Generally speaking, here’s how 2017 could shape up in terms of CPU releases: Intel’s Kaby Lake holds sway until about early March, when AMD has said that the Ryzen chip will launch. Sometime near the summer—late May, if history holds—Intel should release its high-end Skylake-E chips for gaming PCs. AMD will ship its Raven Ridge chip for laptops and some desktops in the fall, which is also roughly the time frame to expect Intel’s Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake. How Kaby Lake compares to Ryzen will play an enormous role in AMD’s future. But questions will quickly be raised about how the 14nm chip, Coffee Lake, will shape up, too. You may already be asking this question: If Coffee Lake is Intel’s fourth chip on the same 14nm process, how can it possibly be any faster than its predecessors? This isn’t your father’s process technology Historically, Intel increases its chip performance from product to product in two ways: design and manufacturing. This is the aforementioned tick-tock process; a new change to a chip’s design (tick) is followed by a “process shrink” to an improved manufacturing process (tock). Both methods generate performance improvements. The “tock” is where Moore’s Law enters: the number of transistors in a given area doubles every 12 to 18 months as new manufacturing technologies are developed, giving chips a “free” performance boost. But given that Intel is leaving its manufacturing process unchanged, doesn’t that mean that its “tock” improvements will disappear? Intel Intel revealed its plans to extend 14nm technology through the 8th-generation Core products at its investor conference last week. Not exactly. Over time, both the tick-tock model as well as what it describes has broken down. During the Skylake and Kaby Lake generations, Intel smooshed the “tick” and “tock” together somewhat, tweaking both the design and the process technology simultaneously. Even a descriptive term like “14nm” means has also become more vague. Sources confirmed a tweet by The Motley Fool’s Ashraf Eassa, that Intel is using a manufacturing shorthand to distinguish between Broadwell/Skylake (“14nm”), Kaby Lake (“14nm+”), and Coffee Lake (14nm++). That, plus Intel’s shift to a more three-dimensional FinFET architecture, has made identifying each generation by a gate length even more outdated, added Patrick Moorhead, a former AMD fellow and now an independent analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. “I actually believe that Intel’s 14nm+ is actually closer to other people’s 10nm than they get credit for,” Moorhead said. Intel This is the metric Intel is now pushing to show how its manufacturing is consistently improving: logic cell scaling. In his investor day presentation, Murthy Renduchintala, the head of Intel’s client chip and IoT business, used a different metric in a bid to clear up the confusion once and for all: logic cell area. Under that metric, he said, Intel has steadily shrunk the logic cell by 50% over every two years, and has maintained a steady three-year lead over its rivals. All of this may sound horribly abstract, but the bottom line is this: Moore’s Law has driven the entire computing industry for literally decades. It seems to be slowing down—and in some ways, it is. But Moore’s Law isn’t quite as accurate as it once was, and that inaccuracy masks some of the progress Intel’s making. No easy answer to improved performance Nevertheless, analysts expect that Intel will turn other knobs when improving the performance of a fourth-generation 14nm chip. Since Intel’s roadmap slide confirms that its 8th-generation Core chip runs 15 percent faster than the current Kaby Lake, that implies that Coffee Lake will feature a revised design, analysts say, similar to how the 14nm Kaby Lake chip improves over its 14nm predecessor, Skylake. The “cheap, dirty way” to improve performance involves adding cache memory, McCarron said. “Putting more cache in always solves the problem,” he said. What’s more likely, though, is that Intel will simply combine a number of small improvements, McCarron said, such as running core clocks slightly higher and adjusting power. For his part, Moorhead said that he believed Intel would bet more heavily on improving the integrated graphics engine. “My gut instinct says that it’s a lot of GPU, a little bit of clock [speed], and potentially not a whole lot more instructions per clock” to achieve that 15 percent improvement, Moorhead added. Intel has been quietly working to improve its Iris Pro integrated graphics, and we’d expect that trend to continue. Long gone, then, are the days when Intel dialed up the clock speed to dramatically increase performance. As Moore’s Law slows, Intel will likely take a little bit here, and a little bit there, to gradually push performance higher. So which chip should you buy, Coffee Lake or Cannon Lake? Because of the way in which Intel plans to reportedly split up the two architectures, neither should compete with each directly—at least at first. Remember, Intel’s deliberately delaying its 10nm process as part of its “datacenter first” strategy, giving the 10nm tech a chance to ripen on the vine. Eventually, it seems like Cannon Lake and Coffee Lake collide—and then what? At this point, we simply don’t know.

Vulkan is similar to DirectX 12 and can be used for many applications, but it is most relevant to visual applications like games. Games and VR applications written in Vulkan will work with GPUs integrated into Intel's 7th Generation chips code-named Kaby Lake and 6th Generation chips code-named Skylake. It will also support the Intel HD Graphics 505 GPU in Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake. The support could open the door for Vulkan applications to work on Windows-based virtual reality headsets. Later this year, PC makers like Lenovo, Dell, and HP are expected to release headsets that attach to Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft will launch VR development kits with tethered headsets at the Game Developers Conference, which starts on Feb. 27 in San Francisco. Intel has ramped up graphics capabilities of its integrated Kaby Lake GPUs, making it capable of 4K graphics. Vulkan will exploit the new features for a better gaming experience. It's already possible to run Vulkan games on Windows PCs via drivers provided by Nvidia and AMD, which sell discrete GPUs. But Intel's support for Vulkan is now official, and the previous beta drivers were considered highly unstable. Most Windows games today run on closed-source DirectX 12 technology. The open-source Vulkan has many similar features -- it takes full advantage of the latest GPUs and CPUs for better graphics. It also uses fewer system resources and can generate images faster. It's also easier to port games from DX12 to Vulkan, which succeeds the older OpenGL set of APIs. Porting games from DirectX to OpenGL was considered time-consuming. Some premium smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy S7 also support Vulkan. Games running Vulkan use fewer system resources and preserve battery life in laptops and mobile devices. Vulkan is already seen as a future for gaming on Linux PCs and Steam Machines.

Intel researches tech to prepare for a future beyond today's PCs Intel is investing heavily in quantum computing and neuromorphic chip research as it prepares for the post-Moore's Law era Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 11 February, 2017 04:26 0 - - - - print email IDG Intel realizes there will be a post-Moore's Law era and is already investing in technologies to drive computing beyond today's PCs and servers. The chipmaker is "investing heavily" in quantum and neuromorphic computing, said Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, during a question-and-answer session at the company's investor day on Thursday. "We are investing in those edge type things that are way out there," Krzanich said. To give an idea of how far out these technologies are, Krzanich said his daughter would perhaps be running the company by then. Researching in these technologies, which are still in their infancy, is something Intel has to do to survive for many more decades. Shrinking silicon chips and cramming more features into them is becoming difficult, and Intel is already having trouble in manufacturing smaller chips. Smartphones, PCs, and other devices are getting smaller, faster and more power efficient thanks to Moore's Law, a 1965 observation loosely stating that the number of transistors in a die area would double every two years, causing performance to double while driving down the cost of making chips. Intel has been using Moore's Law as a guiding star to make faster and smaller chips and reducing the price of devices. However, it is widely agreed that Moore's Law is slowly dying, and Intel's manufacturing struggles are growing. For decades, Intel's business has been heavily reliant on its ability to make and deliver chips. But the process is slowing down. Intel used to advance manufacturing processes every two years, and that has now changed to three to four years. One way to resolve that crisis -- which all chipmakers face -- is to completely change the current computing model in PCs, smartphones, and servers. The current model -- known as the Von Neumann approach -- involves data being pushed to a processor, calculated, and sent back to memory. But storage and memory are becoming bottlenecks. The answer is to adopt new models of computing, which is where quantum computers and neuromorphic chips fit in. Quantum computers have the potential to be powerful computers harnessing the unique quality of a large number of qubits to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Neuromorphic chips are modeled after the human brain, which could help computers make decisions based on patterns and associations. Intel has made some advances in quantum computing and neuromorphic chips. But Krzanich's comments lend more credibility to the company's push to look at a future beyond today's computing models. Some short-term answers can resolve the bottlenecks based on Von Neumann model, including Optane, Intel's new form of super-fast memory and storage. It could unite SSDs and DRAM in systems, cutting one bottleneck. Intel is also embracing silicon photonics, which could resolve throughput issues in data centers. Both technologies have researched for more than a decade and are now practical. The chipmaker has lived off the PC industry for decades but is now looking to grow in markets like data centers, the internet of things, automotive and high-performance computing. The new focus is bringing a gradual change to the way Intel makes chips. It's similar to the 1970s, when different types of chips like vector processors and floating point arrays were crammed together for complex calculations. For example, Intel is slapping together two separate functional blocks for applications like machine learning and autonomous cars. Intel envisions FPGAs combining with CPUs in autonomous cars. Later this year, the company will release a chip called Lake Crest, which combines a Xeon server CPU with deep-learning chip technology it picked up through its Nervana Systems acquisition. Intel is also merging an FPGA inside an Intel Xeon chip to carry out machine learning tasks. Intel is expecting a lot of data to be generated by sources like autonomous cars, which will need edge processing for tasks like image recognition, analysis, and map updates. Intel is pushing its wide roster of co-processors to the edge, and that is where the quantum and neuromorphic chips may fit. Quantum computer research is also being done by other companies. D-Wave recently released a 2,000-qubit quantum computer based on quantum annealing, while IBM has a 5-bit quantum computer accessible via the cloud. IBM is also playing with brain-like chips and has benchmarked its TrueNorth chip, which has a million neurons and 256 million synapses. Academic institutions like the University of Heidelberg in Germany, Stanford University, and the University of Manchester in the U.K. are also working on neuromorphic chips. HPE has shown a computer that emulates the human brain, and it intends to adapt ideas from that for servers.

The high-volume factory is targeted to use the 7 nanometer (nm) manufacturing process. It will produce microprocessors to power data centers and hundreds of millions of smart and connected devices worldwide. The announcement was made jointly by President Donald Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House. According to company officials, the completion of Fab 42 in 3 to 4 years will directly create approximately 3,000 high-tech, high-wage Intel jobs for process engineers, equipment technicians, and facilities-support engineers and technicians who will work at the site. Combined with the indirect impact on businesses that will help support the factory’s operations, Fab 42 is expected to create more than 10,000 total long-term jobs in Arizona. “Intel’s business continues to grow and investment in manufacturing capacity and R&D ensures that the pace of Moore’s law continues to march on, fueling technology innovations the world loves and depends on,” said Krzanich. “This factory will help the U.S. maintain its position as the global leader in the semiconductor industry.” America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Brian Krzanich, CEO, Intel Corporation “Intel is a global manufacturing and technology company, yet we think of ourselves as a leading American innovation enterprise,” Krzanich added. “America has a unique combination of talent, a vibrant business environment and access to global markets, which has enabled U.S. companies like Intel to foster economic growth and innovation. Our factories support jobs, high-wage, high-tech manufacturing jobs that are the economic engines of the states where they are located.” Intel is America’s largest high-technology capital expenditure investor ($5.1 billion in the U.S. 2015) and its third largest investor in global R&D ($12.1 billion in 20151), Intel officials said. The majority of Intel’s manufacturing and R&D is in the United States. As a result, Intel employs more than 50,000 people in the United States, while directly supporting almost half a million other U.S. jobs across a range of industries, including semiconductor tooling, software, logistics, channels, OEMs and other manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs. The 7 nm semiconductor manufacturing process targeted for Fab 42 will be the most advanced semiconductor process technology used in the world and represents the future of Moore’s Law. In 1968 Intel co-founder Gordon Moore predicted that computing power will become significantly more capable and yet cost less year after year. The chips made on the 7 nm process will power the most sophisticated computers, data centers, sensors and other high-tech devices, and enable things like artificial intelligence, more advanced cars and transportation services, breakthroughs in medical research and treatment, and more. These are areas that depend upon having the highest amount of computing power, access to the fastest networks, the most data storage, the smallest chip sizes, and other benefits that come from advancing Moore’s Law, a suggestion from experts in the field predicting the number of integrated circuit transistors per square inch has doubled and is likely to increase to the same degree every year.

WD recognizes that enthusiasts and the high-end computing market have moved over to PCIe SSDs to get many times more performance than traditional SATA storage drives. The WD Black PCIe SSDs have sequential read/write speeds of up to 2050MB/s read and up to 800MB/s write with the backing of a nice 5-year limited warranty. Those speeds are pretty impressive, but believe it or not they are on the lower side compared to many of the other NVMe drives on the market, so this is something we’d actually consider an entry-level PVIe NVMe SSD. We might not be making any brownie points over at WD by saying that, but their pricing shows that we thoughts are accurate. WD currently offers the Black M.2 PCIe NVMe series in two capacities; 256GB ($109.99 shipped) and 512GB ($199.99 shipped) at Amazon. Those Amazon prices put the WD Black 512GB drive around $0.39 per GB and that makes it one of the lower price M.2 PCIe NVMe drives on the market today. The Intel SSD 600P series is widely regarded as being the lowest priced NVMe series around and you can get the Intel SSD 600P 512GB for $179.99 shipped, so WD is bringing out the WD Black 512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe drive for $20 more than that particular model. WD appears to offer better performance and a matching 5-year warranty, so the price premium could be justified and that is what we hope to find out in our benchmarks. The WD Black PCIe SSD series uses a Marvell 88SS1093 controller and 15nm TLC NAND Flash by Sandisk. These components help the WB Black PCIe SSD reach sequential speeds of up to 2,050 MB/s read and either 700 MB/s write on the 256GB  drive or 800 MB/s on the 512 GB drive. The 4K Random Read/Write performance (Q32, T4) is rated at up to  up to 170,000 IOPS for 4K Random Reads and either 130,000 IOPS (256GB drives) or 134,000 IOPS (512GB drives) when it comes to the 4K Random Write performance. Write endurance ratings are 80 TBW and 160 TBW for the 256GB and 512GB models respectively, which are on the lower side. The good news is that the WD Black has a lengthy 5-year warranty and 1.75M hour MTTF rating! WD Black M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD Specifications:   Marvell 88SS1093 M.2 PCIe Gen 3 x 4 NVMe Controller – Tri-core CPU architecture 2D TLC NAND Flash – Sandisk 15nm Operating Temperature – 0° ~ 70°C MTBF: 1,750,000 hours 4K Aligned Random Read: up to 170,000 IOPS 4K Aligned Random Write: up to 130,000 IOPS (256GB), up to 134,000 IOPS (512GB) Sequential Read & Write Transfer: Up to 2,050 MB/s Read | Up to 700 MB/s Write (256GB)/Up to 800 MB/s Write (512GB) Low Power Mode PS4: 5.5mW Low Power Mode PS3: 50mW Active Power: 135mW Max Power: 8.25 Watts Endurance: 256GB: 80 TBW 512GB: 160 TBW Warranty: 5-Years WD Black M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD Features:   NVMe 1.2 Protocol Support Security Protocol: TCG Pyrite Security Subsystem Class (SCC) and SSD Password via ATA Pass-through (ATA Security), which provides a mechanism to control access to user data. SLC Caching Technology – non-volatile write cache On-The-Fly Error Handling Mechanism – Page-level striping with distributed parity providing a last line of data protection TRIM Command – helps sustain drive’s high performance over time Dynamic and static wear-leveling – to help extend the life of the SSD Bad Block Management Background Garbage Collection Error recovering using LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) & ECC (Error Correction Code) Minimal write amplification – increases endurance and performance NVMe power management Self-thermal throttling – To avoid cases where the SSD temperature exceeds the products allowable temperature envelope, or where NVMe power management does not throttle down effectively. The drive that we’ll be reviewing today is the WD Black PCIe Gen3x4 NVMe SSD that is 512GB in capacity and sold under part number WDS512G1X0C-00ENX0. We were expecting to see a black PCB on the WD Black PCIe SSD, but WD is sticking with blue for some unknown reason. The WD Black PCIe SSD has a blue PCB! Flipping the drive over you’ll find two more 128-gigabit planar MLC NAND Flash chips and a spot for more memory, but it is not being used. The WD Black PCIe SSD series does not require NVMe drivers to work properly on a PC, but you can manually install other brands NVMe drives if you really wanted to do so. We used the default StorNVMe drivers in WIndows 10, but manually disabled the write-cache buffer. The standard Windows NVMe driver in Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 doesn’t pass the Force Unit Access (FUA) command. FUA commands bypass the DRAM cache on the SSD and write directly to the drives cache resulting in really bad performance. Storage review sites that use AS SSD, Anvil and PCMark (Storage 1.0) may show low write performance due to this. You can do registry hacks to disable FUA or simply turn off Windows write-cache buffer flushing in Windows Device Manager for the storage drive you want to benchmark. Companies like Intel, Samsung and OCZ have released special NVMe drivers for some of their NVMe drivers to remedy this situation. We’ll show you Anvil scores with Windows Write-Cache Buffer Flushing off to show you the performance difference that can be seen by turning this feature off. Let’s take a look at the test system and then jump into the benchmarks. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

More like this AMD strengthens gaming and VR on Linux with graphics improvements 12 things Kaby Lake-based PCs will offer Microsoft sets Windows 10 PC requirements for tethered VR headsets Video Windows 10 Quick Tips: Getting the most from Cortana Intel is bringing more options to improve gaming and virtual reality experiences on Windows PCs with official support for Vulkan APIs (application programming interfaces). Vulkan is similar to DirectX 12 and can be used for many applications, but it is most relevant to visual applications like games. Games and VR applications written in Vulkan will work with GPUs integrated into Intel's 7th Generation chips code-named Kaby Lake and 6th Generation chips code-named Skylake. It will also support the Intel HD Graphics 505 GPU in Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake. The support could open the door for Vulkan applications to work on Windows-based virtual reality headsets. Later this year, PC makers like Lenovo, Dell and HP are expected to release headsets that attach to Windows 10 PCs. Microsoft will launch VR development kits with tethered headsets at the Game Developers Conference, which starts on Feb. 27 in San Francisco. Intel has ramped up graphics capabilities of its integrated Kaby Lake GPUs, making it capable of 4K graphics. Vulkan will exploit the new features for a better gaming experience. It's already possible to run Vulkan games on Windows PCs via drivers provided by Nvidia and AMD, which sell discrete GPUs. But Intel's support for Vulkan is now official, and the previous beta drivers were considered highly unstable. Most Windows games today run on closed-source DirectX 12 technology. The open-source Vulkan has many similar features -- it takes full advantage of the latest GPUs and CPUs for better graphics. It also uses fewer system resources and can generate images faster. It's also easier to port games from DX12 to Vulkan, which succeeds the older OpenGL set of APIs. Porting games from DirectX to OpenGL was considered time-consuming. Some premium smartphones like Samsung's Galaxy S7 also support Vulkan. Games running Vulkan use fewer system resources and preserve battery life in laptops and mobile devices. Vulkan is already seen as a future for gaming on Linux PCs and Steam Machines.

In the initial comparison, Videocardz compared the four, six, and eight core Ryzen models with numbers taken from Toms Hardware. The four core model held the lowest position on the chart with the six core just a few thousand points behind several Intel chips. The eight core model beat out all but the best Intel chips at a stock speed of 3.4 GHz, and fell just short of the Core i7 6950X when overclocked to 4.0 GHz. When compared to the official Futuremark score database, the overclocked eight core Ryzen beat the i7 6950X by about 500 points. On a per core basis, the eight core Ryzen outperforms the i7 6950X and the six and four core Ryzen perform even better. A number of Intel chips were able to convincingly beat the Ryzen chips on a per core basis, with the i7 7700K overclocked to 4.8 GHz reigning supreme. At a cost of $389 for the eight core Ryzen and $1700 for the i7 6950X, AMD can certainly offer a tremendous amount of bang for your buck.

The launch of the chips has been confirmed by Intel and the parts will launch in the second half of 2017. We have to wonder what’s going on over at Intel at this point, the chipmaker has been talking up that vaunted 10nm process tech, getting us all excited, and then going back to the 14nm process that it has used on parts gong all the way back to 2014. Broadwell, SkyLake, and Kaby Lake processors all used the 14nm process. The Intel Kaby Lake Refresh with the more powerful Core i7-7740K or Core i7-7770K CPU is expected this summer and will also be using the 14nm process. Rubbing salt in our wounds even more is the fact that Intel had promised 10nm chips in 2017 back in January. Despite Coffee Lake keeping the same build process, Intel is saying that the new chips will give a 15% performance boost over the predecessor chip. It is thought that the Cannon Lake data center chip running 10nm build process will land before the consumer parts that we all want. Another little tidbit is that the Cannon Lake parts are expected to be built at the Arizona Fab 42 that has been pulled back into action. PC fans aren’t the only folks disappointed by the lack of 10nm chips, smartphones expected to be running chips with 10 nm tech under the hood are going without as well. At least most are, Samsung has apparently gobbled most of the 10nm chips out there for its Galaxy S8 smartphone. Before you fret too much over any potential lost performance with Coffee Lake not getting 10nm process tech, check out our Core i7-7700K Kaby Lake review and see what Coffee Lake will improve on. Basket of Winning ✓ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ LMAO uroshi I don’t see where is all this incredible change, performance CPUs stay on 14nm, power sensitive ones go on 10nm. I think this was more or less known for a while. Apparently the 10nm process is not an upgrade regarding attainable frequencies and mostly gives just a decent power reduction in comparison to the 14nm process. Give them some time to think it over and I am sure they will manage to solve the issue and most probably call the refined process 7nm. We will soon know when the so called 7nm processes of the other foundries come to market (more or less comparable to Intel’s 10nm).

DOWNLOAD Intel Security Mends Cybersecurity Fragmentation with Unifying Strategy February 14, 2017February 14, 2017 by CloudBuzz 23shares Offering Integrated and Automated Solutions, Expansive Partner Ecosystem, Advanced Architecture with Cross-Industry Collaboration SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 14, 2017 – Today Intel Security outlined a new, unifying approach for the cybersecurity industry that strives to eliminate fragmentation through updated integrated solutions, new cross-industry partnerships and product integrations within the Intel Security Innovation Alliance and Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA). “Transforming isolated technologies into a cohesive security system is without a doubt the most daunting challenge facing practitioners today,” said Chris Young, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Security Group. “The battle against our adversaries cannot be fought alone; it will take people, products, organizations and industries working together to eliminate the fragmentation of security through automation, partnerships and unified architectures.” The workforce shortage facing the cybersecurity industry makes it increasingly difficult to hire and retain employees. These scarce resources make it harder to maintain a coherent security architecture to prevent damage from and minimize the cost of emerging threats while embracing the potential of new open source, digital, cloud and security technologies. Our research and customer discussions have underscored the need for trusted partners that work cooperatively to reduce the burden of fragmented technologies and help organizations stay focused on securing their business assets and productivity. With this in mind, Intel Security is pleased to announce several new product integrations and updates, new industry partnerships and increased open source and standards-based collaboration that will strengthen the effectiveness of cybersecurity infrastructure across the industry’s largest open ecosystem. Integrated Solutions At the heart of a unified strategy for cybersecurity is the need for integrated solutions that tie into the enterprise’s framework to address top-of-mind challenges. Intel Security announces new and updated solutions that do exactly that: McAfeeâ Enterprise Security Manager (ESM) 10 and McAfee® Virtual Network Security Platform (vNSP). With the high cost of detecting and resolving cyberattacks, the need for SIEM solutions that are intelligent and intuitive has never been greater. The newly released McAfee ESM 10 joins an expanded McAfee® Foundstone™ security operations center (SOC) services portfolio to help security analysts to be far more effective. New capabilities include: Intuitive and Collaborative User Interface: A new user interface reflects extensive incident management workflow usability testing, delivering on increased efficiency, faster and more effective threat detection and response, and the ability to manage multiple incidents within the same dashboard. Contextual Threat Intelligence: Significant advancements have improved ongoing contextual threat intelligence and immediate access to critical threat data to identify, scope and orchestrate responses to emerging attacks. Trusted Expertise Offerings: Foundstone threat researchers (i.e., Intel Security’s expert security consultants) can now augment staffing as part of a virtual SOC offering, adding expertise, capacity and coverage to supplement existing enterprise capabilities and extending the Foundstone services lifecycle SOC portfolio. The need for advanced malware protection within the public cloud environment calls for integrated virtual solutions. McAfee® vNSP now extends virtual network protection to Amazon Web Services* (AWS) cloud and OpenStack* cloud deployments, with new simplified multi-cloud licensing, easily protecting virtual networks. New capabilities include: Virtual Network Protection for Public Clouds: McAfee vNSP is an industry-leading solution that protects AWS workloads from attacks like zero-day, bots, malware and application-level DOS with both detection and protection mode. It integrates seamlessly with AWS Auto Scaling to deliver a fully scalable security solution with a single pane of glass. Virtual Network Traffic Inspection for Private Clouds: vNSP continues to add support for multi-hypervisor platforms, which now includes VMware® ESX®, VMware NSX™ and OpenStack cloud with its best-of-breed next-generation IPS. Security Operations can now manage their public and private cloud security from a single network security management console giving them full visibility. Cloud-Based Threat Analysis: New integration with McAfee® Cloud Threat Detection allows McAfee® Network Security Platform (NSP) to easily and efficiently augment existing inspection capabilities with sophisticated cloud-based malware analysis. Ecosystem Momentum and Cross-Industry Collaboration  Transforming fragmentation requires the industry to work cooperatively to build meaningful integrations. Today, the Intel Security Innovation Alliance, the industry’s premier technology partnering program, announces 15 new partnerships, bringing the total number of partners to more than 135 globally. Over the past year, 35 partners have integrated or planned integrations with the McAfee Data Exchange Layer (DXL), the industry-endorsed communication fabric, providing real-time interaction between applications. Since announcing the OpenDXL initiative – an open industry standard for all developers to increase integration flexibility, simplicity and opportunity – Intel Security has expanded its commitment to open source and community adoption. Today, Intel Security is publishing more open source software on github.com/opendxl to further reduce high-integration complexity and cost, and replacing lengthy manual and repetitive processes for enterprises. These advancements include: New Integrations: New open source connectors for McAfeeâ Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and McAfeeâ Active Response (MAR) let applications easily use these tools to search endpoints and query and set file reputations, simplifying the process of querying endpoints within the enterprise environment to just 20 lines of code. Expedited Availability: Responding to customer demand, Intel Security has expedited availability of the OpenDXL Python client, which is now available for organizations to download, develop and deploy with confidence. For demonstrations of technology integrations using OpenDXL, visit the Intel Security booth at #N3801 – North Hall of the Moscone Center. New Capabilities: New OpenDXL connectors for McAfeeâ ePolicy Orchestrator® (McAfee® ePO™) platform APIs enable easy, fast options to apply policies, tag systems, move groups and trigger actions within the industry-leading security platform. The new capabilities open up the most frequently used capabilities of the McAfee ePO platform web APIs, and permit more applications to leverage centralized and efficient management with a lightweight integration process. New Partnerships: With the goal to improve cybersecurity efficiencies and maximize protection, 15 new companies have joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance: Absolute Software*, Bay Dynamics*, Cyphort*, DFLabs*, Digicert*, Dropbox*, io*, Fireglass*, Kaspersky*, Opswat*, Radware*, SailPoint*, SAS Institute*, SS8 Networks* and ThreatConnect*. Intel Security also announced that it is now sharing and consuming advanced threat intelligence through the Cyber Threat Alliance Platform (CTAP) and that it has a plan to further integrate CTAP with its products. CTAP is a platform that scores and shares threat intelligence among members of the Cyber Threat Alliance. Shared CTAP Indicators of Compromise help Intel Security and other CTA members detect and better understand new, emerging attack campaigns. This allows CTA members to more quickly protect their customers’ systems. As announced earlier today by the Cyber Threat Alliance, it is now formally incorporated as an independent, 501(c)(6) entity, with a president, board of directors and permanent standing committees. It is generously funded by the founding members – Intel Security, Fortinet*, Palo Alto Networks*, Symantec*, Check Point* and Cisco Systems*. Each founding member has committed $1 million over the next two years to the success of the Cyber Threat Alliance.

Transcript: My fellow Americans, This week our hearts are with the people of Louisiana and Mississippi. Families have lost their homes, businesses, and livelihoods after devastating tornadoes swept through many, many communities.  My administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want. We’re going to take care of them. It’s remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives. That is the beauty of the American spirit – there’s nothing like it. There is a great spirit all over the country – and that spirit is what we will need to rebuild America to, as I have said so often, Make America Great Again. On Tuesday, I was pleased to host at the White House the CEO of Intel, who announced that Intel will invest $7 billion dollars in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona – creating thousands of new American jobs. That’s what we want, new American jobs, and good jobs. Intel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies. In fact, we are in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and businesses.  We want to make it much easier to do business in America – and that’s what we are going to do. We are going to make it also much harder for companies to leave.  They’re not just going to say bye-bye and fire everybody. There will be consequences. I want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world – but we can’t do that if we don’t stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete.  Every hour of every day, my Administration is focused on creating jobs for our people and I mean good jobs. More jobs, better jobs, higher-paying jobs – that’s our mission. This week, I also met with Sheriffs and Police Chiefs from across the country.  I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement – and so too will our great new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. My administration is committed to your security, which is why we will continue to fight to take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorists, radical and dangerous extremists from ever entering our country.  We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people. We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow. We will defend our country, protect our Constitution, and deliver real prosperity for our people. God bless you, God bless America. Have a great week.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel Optane-branded solid-state drive for data… Intel Optane-branded solid-state drive for data centers spotted in leaked specs By Kevin Parrish — February 10, 2017 11:43 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Intel's Optane-branded products aim to speed up PCs by merging the speed of system memory and the storage capabilities of NAND memory. The first Optane-branded product released by Intel may be a solid-state drive for data centers. The news arrives by way of leaked specifications for the P4800X Series SSD stuffed onto a PCI Express add-in card. It will have a 375GB capacity, promising the read/write performance of standard system memory (DRAM) and the storage capabilities of NAND flash technology. That’s the big selling point of Optane products: The merging of the two DRAM and NAND technologies. Optane is based on 3D XPoint technology jointly developed by Micron and Intel, which stacks memory cells vertically rather than horizontally, like standard SSDs and flash drives. This enables more storage capacity and better performance due to 3D XPoint’s vertically designed checkerboard design. Here are some of the specs for the unannounced Optane SSD: Sequential read speed: Up to 2,400MB per second Sequential write speed: Up to 2,000MB per second Random 4KB IOPS read speed: Up to 550K per second Random 4KB IOPS write speed: Up to 500K per second Latency (typical) Read/Write: <10 microseconds Security: AES 256-bit encryption supported Mean Time Between Failures: 1,000,000 hours Endurance Rating: 30 drive writes per day 12.3 petabytes written Form Factor: PCIs 3.0 x4 half-height, half-length, low profile Operating system support: Windows Server 2016 / 2012 R2 Windows 8.1 / 10 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7 / 7.0 / 7.1 / 7.3 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4 / 12 SP1 UEFI 2.3.1 Intel’s Optane products will reportedly have excellent performance with a queue depth of one. A queue depth is essentially the number of commands that the SSD’s controller queues at the same time. Typically, tests show that the performance of an SSD is rather poor when only one command is queued in the controller whereas performance greatly improves when 32 commands are queued. That huge performance gap supposedly isn’t the case with Intel’s Optane drives. Intel first revealed its Optane products during the CES 2017 technology show in January. They were in the form of sticks that connect to an M.2 slot on a PC’s motherboard. Offering 16GB and 32GB capacities, they aim to speed up PCs with hard drives installed by putting the most-used files on the speedier Optane drive to provide SSD-like performance. More: Intel’s 48-thread, 24-core Xeon superchip will cost nearly $9,000 The two Optane products on display at CES falls under the company’s Optane Memory group for storage caching in HDD-based systems. The leaked P4800X Series drive falls under its Optane SSD umbrella providing drives with more than 120GB of storage capacity. Optane will also include DRAM products that are crammed into PCs just like memory sticks. We reached out to Intel for further comment about the leaked Optane SSD specs, but just like the company’s recent eighth-generation Core processor tease it dangled in front of Twitter users, Intel is remaining tight-lipped about the leaked Optane drive specs. Bribing Intel didn’t help us gain additional information either. On a mainstream level, the take from all of this Optane talk is that systems will get a huge performance boost from these 3D XPoint-based products. We expect to hear more from Intel in the coming weeks.

Barefoot Networks' Tofino chip could help provide x86-like flexibility with ASIC performance. By Keith Townsend | February 14, 2017, 4:00 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/Baks It seems as if software has eaten the world, except for network hardware. Feature enablement is frustratingly slow in the network device space. For example, it took major network vendors approximately four years to add VXLAN support to mainstream routers and switches. VXLAN makes perfect sense for the integration of virtualized networks and physical networks. Even with the agreement of major vendors such as Cisco and VMware, the rollout trailed the business drivers for years. The primary challenge is the ASIC-based approach used by the network industry. Barefoot Networks looks to eliminate the inflexibility of ASIC-based device design while maintaining performance via their new Tofino chip. ASIC vs. x86 performance Intel has done some amazing things with networking on x86, especially with Intel Xeon-based networking. The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) has achieved performance of 233 Gbps (347 Mpps) using a Xeon E5-2658. Telecom and application developers can build applications that provide any number of data services on packets transiting an Intel-based network function virtualized (NFV) instance. SEE: How Intel's open source Data Plane Development Kit enables high-performance Linux networking x86-based network solutions have enjoyed the flexibility of software. VMware's NSX is a great example of a platform that quickly integrates new protocols and services via software. In many instances, 233 Gbps of performance is more than fast enough. However, the performance of x86 network is just a fraction of the throughput available via dedicated ASIC. ASIC chip maker Broadcom recently announced a processor capable of 1Tbps throughput in a much more network-friendly physical package that supports high-density network connectivity. Network device manufacturers have long sacrificed flexibility for performance in system design. Unlike general computing processors, ASICs are purpose-built to accelerate specific algorithms. Protocols such as VXLAN require a redesign of the ASIC to perform high-throughput processing. Couple slow design, regression testing, and manufacturing into the equation and new protocol integration can take years to complete.

During TFD, Barefoot Network discussed some of the lessons the company learned from the graphics processing units (GPU) industry. Companies such as NVIDIA have transformed themselves into high-performance compute (HPC) companies, as opposed to companies simply focused on the graphics industry. As a result of the lessons it learned, Barefoot Networks announced their Tofino platform. Tofino is a programmable chip that enables line rate processing up to 6.5Tbps. Customers or network vendors can leverage the P4 programming language to customize white box solutions or fixed configuration products that offer x86-like flexibility while providing ASIC-like performance. The company also provided a reference design to the Open Compute Project (OCP) that leverages the Wedge 100B switch. The Wedge 100 is a plan submitted to OCP by Facebook. Leveraging a Wedge 100B with a Tofino chip, customers the size of Facebook can build a custom switching platform with only the services needed for operation of their application. The limited feature switches improve performance and reliability by eliminating general purpose features not needed by the customer's applications. Vendors could use the same platform to provide 100G network products with just the services individual customers require. It may take some time for enterprise customers to create custom code for white box switches. The more direct impact, however, is tighter release schedules for new services such as VXLAN. Tofino is a platform to watch carefully. As part of a long-term strategy, enterprise network managers need to pay attention to the chipsets in their network vendor products.

provided by SAS Feb 14, 2017, 08:00 ET Share this article CARY, N.C., Feb. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SAS, the leader in analytics, today announced it has joined the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. The new collaboration will add SAS® Cybersecurity, SAS' security analytics software platform, to the partner ecosystem's diverse portfolio of integrated security offerings. The venture builds upon a long-standing analytics modernization relationship between SAS and Intel, combining SAS' world-class advanced analytics platform with Intel's computational power to help businesses tap the full potential of their ever-growing data sources. This latest collaboration with Intel Security empowers customers to harness best-of-breed prescriptive and predictive analytics to better safeguard their invaluable data assets and infrastructures from ever-advancing cyber threats. "As analytics become a foundational component of security architectures, organizations will face the critical decision of choosing an analytics partner – a decision that must consider the ability to manage the full analytics life cycle," said Stu Bradley, Vice President of SAS Cybersecurity Solutions. "SAS brings an unrivaled pedigree in analytics to the Intel Security Innovation Alliance that will complement the partners' cohesive, unified array of security solutions with advanced analytics software to improve visibility and reduce cyber risk." Analyst firm IDC's inaugural Worldwide Semiannual Security Spending Guide, 2015H2 Forecast Release, projected that businesses would spend an estimated $73.7 billion on security-related software, services and hardware in 2016 alone – a figure predicted to grow to $101.6 billion by 2020. Despite such substantial annual investment, IT teams most commonly manage a fragmented patchwork of security tools, each collecting massive amounts of data but with no means to interact or generate a holistic view of security. The result is blind spots that weaken the organization's overall security posture. "Organizations need a robust analytics platform to capitalize on all the security data that's being exchanged – to reveal insights that are not being driven by the individual, siloed solutions themselves," said Bradley. "Intel Security's common data taxonomy creates robust opportunity for SAS to seamlessly deliver the enterprise visibility missing in today's security ecosystems." The Intel Security Innovation Alliance's mission is to accelerate the development of interoperable security products and simplify their integration within complex enterprise environments. As the largest pure play analytics vendor in the collective, SAS will assume a critical role in helping address industry's growing need to respond more quickly to security events, optimize workflows, and achieve more with existing (and often limited) security resources. "The Intel Security Innovation Alliance is driving a new era in security, where all components come together to work as a single, cohesive system, regardless of vendor or underlying architecture – and now with the benefit of SAS' top-ranked advanced analytics to augment defenses through enhanced security insights," said DJ Long, Senior Director of the Intel Security Innovation Alliance. "Together we will stimulate powerful new analytically driven workflows for security and compliance, reduce operational costs, and minimize the toll of adversaries threatening today's business, government and consumer data." Today's announcement came out of RSA Conference 2017, the world's leading security conference, being held Feb. 13-17 in San Francisco. To learn more, visit SAS at Booth N4308.

March 2017 now looks most likely, although Tim Cook has been dropping some worrying hints... We round up all the rumours of a new Mac Pro for 2017: the new Mac Pro's release date, price, tech specs, design changes and new features by Karen Haslam | 14 Feb 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Launch date Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Tech specs Buying guide for current Mac Pro models When will Apple release a new Mac Pro for 2017? And what tech specs, new features and design changes should we expect when Apple updates the Mac Pro line for 2017? Is there any chance Apple will discontinue the Mac Pro instead of updating it? We've had a long wait for the new Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro model was announced at WWDC in June 2013 and, for a top-of-the range system, the Mac Pro is looking pretty long in the tooth. But when will Apple announce a new Mac Pro? And what hardware improvements, design changes, tech specs and new features will we see in the new Mac Pro for 2017? There's some good news for expectant Mac Pro fans: code in Mac OS X El Capitan hints that a new Mac Pro (one with 10x USB 3 ports) could arrive soon. But nothing is certain at this point, and some pundits believe the Mac Pro should simply be discontinued. Some Apple appreciators are even working on concept images and videos of what an updated Mac Pro could look like. A concept video by a French designer sees the Mac Pro take the route of looking like an iMac while borrowing a lot of ideas from the Microsoft Surface Studio. Take a look for yourself here. Whatever the future holds for the Mac Pro, in this article we will be looking at all the rumours surrounding the next update of the Mac Pro line: the new Mac Pro's UK release date and pricing, its expected design, and the new features and specs we hope to see in the next version of the Mac Pro. For more discussion of upcoming Apple launches, take a look at our New iMac rumours and our big roundup of Apple predictions for 2017. And if you're considering buying one of the current Mac Pro models, read Where to buy Mac Pro in the UK and our Mac buying guide. See also: New MacBook Pro rumours | New MacBook Air rumours | New MacBook rumours | New iMac rumours | New Mac mini rumours New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Launch date We expect the new Mac Pro to be launched in March 2017. The present Mac Pro was unveiled at WWDC 2013, and it's been more than three years since it went on sale. It's about time, then, for an update to the Mac Pro for 2017. Of course, Apple hasn't announced an official launch date for the next generation of Mac Pro systems - the company is known for its code of silence when it comes to upcoming product launches. We had entertained hopes of a Mac Pro update at Apple's 27 October press event, but no such luck. In the event Apple unveiled a new MacBook Pro instead: a rather lovely new laptop with a customisable touch bar above the keyboard. (You can read more about that device here - New MacBook Pro 2016 review - and here: New MacBook Pro on Apple Store.) Despite the lack of news about the new Mac Pro in October, we remain optimistic that Apple will refresh the line in the near future. A few months back a source at one of Apple's partner companies confidently told us to expect this by the end of November, which was evidently wishful thinking; but it seems likely that March 2017 will see the Mac Pro updated alongside other Apple products. (However, we suspect the update will only involve spec/component bumps rather than a full-blown redesign of the Mac Pro.) Read more: iPhone 7 release date | iPhone 7 Plus release date New iMac 2017 release date: Apple CEO hints at future of the iMac In a rare Q&A session on Apple's internal employee network, Apple CEO Tim Cook gave an interesting response to a question about the future of the Mac, specifically mentioning the 5K iMac in his response. According to a transcript obtained by TechCrunch, an unknown Apple employee asked Cook: "We had a big MacBook Pro launch in October and a powerful upgrade to the MacBook back in Spring. Are Mac desktops strategic for us?" Interestingly, it's what Cook didn't mention in his response that suggests what Apple is planning for the future. In response, Cook wrote the following: "The desktop is very strategic for us. It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop - the largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I/O, and fastest performance. So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important, and in some cases critical, to people. "The current generation iMac is the best desktop we have ever made and its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best desktop display in the world. Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops. If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: we have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that." If you look closely, Cook never used the word "Mac" in his response. At all. Considering it's the name of Apple's oldest product line, you would think it'd get a mention in a question about the company's desktop lineup. Granted, he does mention desktop computers several times, but never the name of the hardware, apart from one exception - the 5K iMac, which hasn't been updated in over a year. Essentially, Cook was asked whether Mac desktops were strategic, and he answered that desktops were important. What about the Mac Pro? A report from Bloomberg might explain why Cook responded in this way, with keen Apple watcher Mark Gurman claiming that Apple has reorganised its software engineering department, meaning there's no longer a team dedicated to macOS - instead, engineers work on both iOS and macOS. He continues to claim that the Mac has been generally de-prioritised within the company, and that Mac engineers no longer get much attention from the company's industrial design team, which was until 2015 led by design chief Jony Ive, allegedly focussing more on iPhones and iPads. This suggests, to us at least, that while Apple is imagining a future where desktops are still being produced, they might not feature the iconic Mac branding. Could Apple be working on a macOS/iOS hybrid to launch as the ultimate desktop experience? With the astonishing number of iOS apps compared to macOS apps, it may be a smart investment for the company, but only time will tell. If so, this would signify the end of the Mac Pro line, a line that was once the pride of Apple, but has now been neglected for three years.  New Mac Pro 2017 release date: El Capitan code hint Code discovered in Mac OS X El Capitan offers a hint that a new Mac Pro may be on its way soon. There's a reference to a new Mac that's codenamed "AAPLJ95,1" within El Capitan, according to Pike's Universum. The current Mac Pro is similarly codenamed AAPLJ90,1 so it's plausible that the code refers to a new version of the professional-level workstation. Another clue that this is the Mac Pro: the code hints that there are 10 USB 3.0 ports on the new machine, and only the Mac Pro has anywhere near that many ports. (Currently there are 4 USB ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro, while the iMacs have 4 USB and 2 Thunderbolt.) We think adopting Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro may make more sense as it brings Thunderbolt to USB-C at 40Gbps for the best of both worlds. More on that below. It's been well over a year since El Capitan was launched, and many Apple fans have now moved on to macOS Sierra. We'll update this if any smoking guns are discovered in the Sierra code. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: Delays in 2013/2014 When Apple launches the new Mac Pro there may well be delays in availability, as there were in 2013-2014. Apple first unveiled the Intel Xeon (Ivy Bridge-E) Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, but the unit didn't actually start shipping until December that year. In fact, for most shoppers the supply of Mac Pro was so constrained that they didn't receive their new Mac until 2014 - in some cases not until February, or March, or in a few cases April. Having previewed the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2013, the company promised availability before the end of 2013, but it wasn't until 19 December that the Mac Pro became available. Then, following the launch, stocks were so limited that only a lucky few, US-based, customers were able to purchase the new professional Mac workstation before the end of 2013. Customers in the UK who ordered their new Mac on 19 December 2014 found that they would have to wait until January 2015 for the new Mac Pro. Some lucky UK customers finally received their Mac Pro around 12 January. This was almost a year after the old version of the Mac Pro was banned in Europe because it didn't comply with EU safety laws. One reason for the delays back in 2013 was thought to be the fact that Apple was building the new-look Mac Pro in the US: Apple had a new design which was being produced at an entirely new factory in the States, so the delays were understandable, although maybe not excusable. New Mac Pro 2017 release date: New delays We had hoped to hear new developments about a new Mac Pro, so we're growing impatient and are hoping for an update soon. Could updates to the current model face the same issues that slowed the production lines back in 2013? We think probably not. If you check Apple's website, you'll see that the wait for the current Mac Pro has come down to 24 hours (although if you want a build-to-order version the wait will be about 5-7 business days). The fact that Apple is no longer struggling to meet demand would suggest that when it launches the next Mac Pro there will not be the significant delays in getting units out to customers that there were at the end of 2013. Instead, the reason for the long wait for an update to the Mac Pro could be simple lack of interest in this workstation-style Mac. Apple may be focusing attention on other projects such as the Retina iMac, which was updated in October 2015. It's possible that Apple doesn't intend to update the Mac Pro at all. The company has launched several other new Macs since the launch of the Mac Pro, including impressively powerful iMacs that can sometimes perform better than the current entry-level Mac Pro can. Video editor Max Yuryev tested Final Cut and Premiere Pro rendering on both the 5K Retina iMac and 6 Core Mac Pro and found that the iMac performed better in some cases, although did suffer from heating issues that the Mac Pro avoids thanks to its design. Yet we don't think Apple is trying to phase out the Mac Pro in favour of a more powerful iMac line-up. It's more likely that it's just spending a long time getting the new Mac Pro right before it launches, after the issues it experiences with the previous launch. There is still a market for the more powerful Mac Pro, we think. But not everyone agrees with us, as we'll see in the next section. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac Pro? Maybe the Mac Pro will never be updated. MacObserver argues that the current Mac Pro is a failure, and compares it to the ill-fated Cube, which was available for less than a year in 2000/2001. (We look at more interesting failures and controversies in our roundup of the worst Apple products.) It's possible, indeed, that Apple will update its iMac line to the point where it satisfies the needs of pro users, rendering the actual Pro line irrelevant. As a thought experiment, TechRadar has imagined the specs of an 'iMac Pro' - "that glitzy, 27-inch 5K display paired with a 10-core Intel Xeon E7 (or two) and the latest and greatest AMD FirePro W9100" - and in this day and age the number of Mac buyers who really need the top spec appears to be dwindling.  Many professional Mac users are still using old Mac Pros from pre-2012 mainly because they are easily upgradable, with options for larger-capacity drives (2TB, 4TB or even more). You can even get a 12-core 3.46GHz processor in the older model that could give the newer, 2.7GHz 12-core processor in the 2013 Mac Pro a run for its money. As for video card options, the old Mac Pro has many more. Those who did upgrade to the 'new' trashcan-like Mac Pro are also finding that the need for multiple expansion cards and external drives are cluttering up their desks, where previously these extras could be neatly concealed inside the Mac Pro chassis. For all Apple's claims about it being a powerful machine, it appears that the Mac Pro is just not considered a professional workstation by the intended market - which does raise uncomfortable questions about its future as a product line. But with its status as Apple's flagship Mac, and the hoopla surrounding its reinvention in 2013, the US assembly plants and so on, we'd be surprised if Apple threw in the towel just yet. New Mac Pro 2017 release date rumours UK: Tech specs Currently, there are two standard Mac Pro models available along with various build-to-order options: Quad-Core and Dual GPU: 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 12GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each; and 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. 6-Core and Dual GPU: 3.5GHz 6-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor; 16GB 1866MHz DDR3 ECC memory; Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each; 256GB PCIe-based flash storage. It seems likely that Apple will update the Mac Pro with the next-generation Intel Xeon E5 processor described above, we may also see more RAM in the entry-level version, now that the 15-inch MacBook Pro range ship with 16GB as standard. We'll go into more detail below. New Mac Pro specs: Ports The current Mac Pro sports six Thunderbolt 2 ports, which means this Mac can be connected to up to three 4K displays. There's also 4 USB 3 ports; Dual Gigabit Ethernet; and an HDMI 1.4 UltraHD, as well as a combined optical digital audio output/analog line out mini-jack; headphone mini-jack with headset support; HDMI port supports multi-channel audio output and a built-in speaker. Code in the El Capitan beta actually suggests that the next generation Mac Pro will offer 10 USB 3.0 ports. Currently there are 4 USB 3 ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports on the Mac Pro. We think that it would make more sense if Apple adopts Thunderbolt 3 on the Mac Pro - this standard of Thunderbolt supports USB Type-C and offers 40Gbps transfer speeds, so Mac Pro users would get the best of both worlds. Thunderbolt 3 offers double the speed of USB 3.1, which is only 10Gbps.   Another thing Apple could add is a Lightning port as seen on the iPhone. Yes really. There are rumours that the lightning port will be used on Macs for plugging in headphones which could allow for high-res audio. However, many traditional Mac Pro users are still calling out for PCI slots, which would allow users to add faster SSDs and better video cards. Some even ask for internal drive bays, with Mac Observer noting that a 3.5in hard drive bay would allow for archival space to be added. New Mac Pro specs: Current processor The 2013 Mac Pro features Intel's Xeon E5 V2 processors (code-named Romley) offering up to 12 cores (as a build-to-order option). Back in September 2014 new Xeon E5 V3 chips (code-named Grantley) started shipping - bringing the Haswell architecture to pro workstations. At the time we thought the processor would soon make their way to the Mac Pro, but no upgrade emerged. Those Intel Xeon E5 V3 chips were being used in Dell's new Xeon Precision Tower (5810, 7810 and 7910) - find out more on Dell's website. These Dell workstations use the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processor series featuring either 14 or 18 cores per processor. The processors in the current Mac Pros are configurable up to 3.5GHz for a six-core option, 3.0GHz for an 8-core option, and 2.7GHz for a 12-core option. We may see a slight boost in these numbers, but we could equally see the same clock speeds, with the processors themselves being faster. It is possible that the new Mac Pro will, like the Dell above, offer an option of 14 or 18 cores. New Mac Pro specs: New Xeon E3-1205 v6 or Xeon E3-1585 v5 processor It is likely that we see brand new Xeon processors in the Mac Pro. It's expected that we see a late Skylake (Xeon E3-1585 v5) or the new Kaby Lake ( Xeon E3-1205 v6) processors included. The Intel Skylake processor features a base clock of 3.5GHz, four cores and eight threads - it has 8MB of cache and features the Iris Pro Graphics P580 - a powerful in-built GPU that will help low-profile renders. However, with Kaby Lake already being shipped to OEMs and manufacturers, we are more likely to see these new processors shipped with the new Mac Pro. The rumoured Xeon E3-1205 v6 is a base model - featuring 3GHz of processing power - we expect more powerful and optimised CPUs to be included within the Mac Pro. Read next: i5 or i7? What is turbo boost? Here's how to choose the best processor for your Mac New Mac Pro specs: Graphics The 2013 Mac Pro features dual workstation-class GPUs. The Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the Quad-Core version, and Dual AMD FirePro D500 with 3GB GDDR5 VRAM each in the 6-Core model. There’s also a build-to-order option of the Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each (an extra £540).  AMD showcased new its new FirePro W-series at Siggraph in August 2014. The FirePro W7100, W5100 may find their way into the new Mac Pro. Alternatively there are significantly faster graphics based on AMD's Fury platform that may be destined for the new Mac Pro. Update (08/03/2016): After a thread on the Apple Support Communities website amassed a huge response when complaining about faulty graphics cards in the Late 2013 Mac Pro, Apple admitted that a number of Mac Pro's have faulty cards and that affected customers could have the issue fixed free of charge. To be legible for a free repair, you must have encountered "distorted video, no video, system instability, freezing, restarts, shutdowns" or system startup failure.  It's not all Mac Pro's though, only those manufactured between February 8 and April 11 2015, and the issue can be fixed by taking your damaged Mac Pro to an Apple Store. Interestingly, MacRumours notes that the issues are known to exist with the AMD FirePro D500 and D700 GPUs, with the AMD FirePro D300 being completely unaffected. Will these issues force Apple into choosing another graphic card manufacturer for the next Mac Pro? While there are no rumours online that suggest so, we think a change could be on the cards for the Mac Pro GPU.

We'd like to see more storage as standard on the Mac Pro, as the target audience tend to be working with very large files. An option for 2TB flash storage would be nice. New Mac Pro specs: RAM The new Xeon E5 V3 Grantley chips are said to have DDR4 memory controllers, so you can expect even faster memory in this year's new Mac Pro. The current models offer 12GB RAM in the Quad-Core model, and 16GB in the 6-Code model as standard. You can add 32GB RAM at point of purchase for £360, or a massive 64GB RAM for £1,080. As we mention above, the 15-inch MacBook Pro now comes with 16GB RAM as standard, so we would hope that the updated entry-level Mac Pro would match that. 64GB RAM might sound like a lot to you, but some of these Dell workstations can accommodate up to 1TB of DDR4 RAM. We hope that the next generation of Mac Pros will be configurable to more than 64GB (four slots of 16GB). New Mac Pro specs: Internal design Here's one last titbit that may offer clues about the Mac Pro of the future. Apple has been granted a patent for the Mac Pro, specifically for the structure and organisation of internal components and external interfaces for a compact computing system, according to a report on Patently Apple.

Read our Mac Pro reviews: Mac Pro Six-Core/3.5GHz (late 2013) review | Mac Pro Quad-Core/3.7GHz (Late 2013) review | 2013 Mac Pro review, BTO version Where can I buy a Mac Pro? The most obvious place to buy a Mac Pro is from the Apple Store. Other than directly from Apple, you can buy the Mac Pro from Apple Premium Resellers such as Stormfront, Square Group, Solutions Inc, iStore, Western Computer, MR Systems, KRCS, HardSoft, and PC World. You can find an Apple Premium Reseller near you by searching on Apple's site. UK pricing for the Mac Pro Currently the Mac Pro starts at £2,999 in the UK for a quad-core 3.7GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon E5 processor with 10 MB L3 cache and Turbo Boost up to 3.9 GHz, 12GB RAM, Dual AMD FirePro D300 with 2GB of VRAM and 256GB of flash storage.  There is also a 6-core model with 3.5GHz Xeon E5, 16GB RAM, two AMD FirePro D500 cards with 3GB of VRAM, and 256GB flash storage for £3,899. We expect that prices won't change significantly when Apple updates the range, although we could see a drop in the old model and a rise in the base 2017 model - as we've seen through other Apple products. See: Apple price increases UK. Current pricing for Mac Pro build-to-order options  The build-to-order options will push the price higher. The following specifications are available for the 2013 Mac Pro: Build-to-order options on the 3.7GHz Quad-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.5GHz 6-core option (add £450), 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,800), or 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £3,150); 16GB (add £90), 32GB (add £450) or 64GB (add £1,170) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D500 (add £360), or or dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £900); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540) Build-to-order options on the 3.5GHz 6-Core Mac Pro 2013: 3.0GHz 8-core processor (add £1,350), 2.7GHz 12-core processor (add £2,700); 32GB (add £360) or 64GB (£add £1,080) RAM memory; dual AMD FirePro D700 (add £540); 512GB (add £180) or 1TB flash storage (add £540). A Mac Pro with the maximum 12-core 2.7GHz processors, with 30MB L3 cache, 64GB RAM, 1TB PCIe-based flash storage, Dual AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of GDDR5 VRAM each currently costs £8,759 including VAT.

I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too. Comments Contents Release date  Apple's October Mac event Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Price Specs and features Design What is the Mac mini? When will Apple release a new Mac mini in the UK? And what new features and design changes can we expect from the updated Mac mini in 2017? A new Mac mini was expected to launch in 2016, since the line wasn't updated at all in 2015; but Apple (as usual) is giving nothing away. Nevertheless, based on past experience and the specs of current Macs, we've got a fair idea of what to expect from the new Mac mini, and when to expect it. We've got all the new Mac mini hints and rumours for you right here. Read on for the next Mac mini's likely release date, specs, design changes and new features. We'll update this article whenever new information is unearthed, so check back regularly for the latest Mac mini update rumours. And remember to check our Mac buying guide for current buying advice, and our guide to the best cheap iPad deals. Last update: Apple has officially made the Mac mini (Early and late 2009, and mid 2010) vintage and obsolete. But we still feel a Mac mini update is due in 2017; read on for the latest rumours. New Mac mini 2017 rumours: Release date When will the next Mac mini come out? Apple last updated the Mac mini on 16 October 2014 after a two-year wait: the previous model came out on 23 October 2012. Mac mini fans are now waiting for the next iteration of the smallest and cheapest Mac. There were rumours suggesting that Apple would do a low-key update to its Mac desktop range by the end of November 2016, focusing on the Mac Pro but potentially covering the iMac and Mac mini at the same time. But it seems Apple disliked the idea. Instead, we would expect the mini to be updated during the company's usual spring event in March 2017. If we still don't see a Mac mini update in March 2017, it's probably safe to assume that Apple has killed off the Mac mini line. New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours UK: Apple's October Mac event Apple's 27 October Mac launch event was broadcast live on Apple's website. While the company did announce three new versions of the MacBook Pro (two with a new Touch Bar), the rest of the Mac range, including the Mac mini, seemed to be pushed to the side. There was no mention of any other Mac updates, and the event finished rather quickly when looking at the length of previous Apple events.  Does this spell the end of the Mac mini range? As mentioned above, while we assumed that Apple would stick to its two-year upgrade cycle for the Mini, it seems not to be the case. We speculate that if it doesn't get announced at an event in March 2017 (when Apple usually updates the MacBook), we think that Apple will kill off the Mac Mini line entirely. We explain why in more detail below.  See also: New MacBook Pro release | New MacBook Air release | New MacBook release | New iMac release | New Mac Pro release New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours: Previous theories One popular theory for a while was that the new Mac mini might make an appearance at WWDC 2016, which started on 13 June 2016 - but in the event, Apple didn't announce any new Macs at all. (Although Mac fans can console themselves with all the news about the macOS Sierra operating system, and what that means for your current machine. You can install macOS Sierra on your Mac mini right now, if it's a 2010 model or later.) The next generation of Intel chips was made available to OEMs in Q4 2016 - they're called Kaby Lake, and it's possible that the new Mac mini could feature processors from this batch. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. We'll talk about processors, and other specs, in a later section of this article. Also read: Mac mini vs MacBook Air  New Mac mini 2017 release date rumours UK: Will Apple discontinue the Mac mini? Apple, to paraphrase a colleague, is generally very good at killing its darlings: at knowing when it makes sense to drop a much-loved product or product feature - one which is often still popular and/or profitable - and switch focus to something else that has more of a future. Think the iPod classic or the optical drive, or dropping the headphone port from the iPhone 7. There are a couple of candidates to be the next iPod classic. The MacBook Air is one. But the Mac mini, which hasn't been updated since 2014, is rarely mentioned at events, and feels surplus to requirements now that the Apple TV is making its claim as a media centre device (although for storing a large number of films the mini remains an excellent choice, offering 500GB as standard and up to 2TB as a configuration option), will be expecting a P45 more than most of Apple's product line-up. The design of the Mac mini hasn't changed significantly since it was first launched and is starting to feel a little dated, and the device doesn't have a clear selling point (or at least, Apple isn't doing a good job of communicating one). So it wouldn't surprise us if Apple quietly retired the line at its next Mac launch event. It's either that or give it a radical overhaul. If Apple does kill off the mini, we'd have to start asking questions about the 'mini' branding in general, and wondering if the iPads are going to be reorganised: there's already a sense that the 'Air' brand is on the way out, across both MacBooks and iPads. But that's a story for another day. New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Price How much will the next Mac mini cost? There are currently three models of the Mac mini available; the one that's best for you will depend on your budget and computing needs. The cheapest model currently costs £479, the middle model is £679, and the priciest model is £949 - this is a price increase since its launch, due to Brexit. Of course, you'll still need to factor in the price of a monitor, keyboard and mouse. (For advice on that, see our roundups of the Best Mac monitors, Best Mac keyboards and Best Mac mice.) However, we don't anticipate Apple reducing the price with the new model when it launches, so you can expect similar pricing. Hopefully better specs for your money, though, of course. Which leads us on to... New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Specs and features The Mac mini is Apple's most budget-focused desktop system and as such features relatively low-end components. But what specs upgrades should we expect from the next Mac mini? Processor: The Kaby Lake question It's unlikely that Apple will include an AMD processor in the next generation of Mac minis... unlikely, but not out of the question, given that AMD's new CPUs are set to come out this year. We'd rate the chances of an AMD chip appearing in the 2017 Mac mini as slight. However, we do expect Kaby Lake, the latest generation of Intel chips. Intel has now started shipping its Kaby Lake processors. But the key word there is 'started': the Kaby Lake processors that would be suitable for a Mac mini may not appear for some months, assuming Apple decides to plump for a Kaby Lake chipset at all. According to MacRumors, in fact, mini-appropriate Kaby Lake chips may not roll out until very late 2016 or even early 2017, so any Mac mini launched before then would be limited to Skylake, the previous generation of Intel processors. That would still represent a significant power boost over the current Haswell processors. Kaby Lake supports Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1 and DisplayPort 1.2, as well as 4K video. The chips are manufactured using a 14nm process, same as Broadwell and Skylake. The next generation, Cannonlake, will switch over to a more accurate 10nm process. As we discuss in our iMac rumour roundup, Intel has laid out a roadmap for its next four generations of processor. After Skylake and Kaby Lake, Intel will release Cannonlake, then Ice Lake in 2018 and Tiger Lake in 2019. Graphics Our iMac predictions also include new graphics chipsets: Polaris 10, by AMD, which is particularly interesting because it may make the next iMacs VR-ready. But the current range of Mac mini models feature integrated graphics, and we expect this to remain the case in the next generation. RAM Right now, the entry-level Mac mini features just 4GB RAM as standard, which we think should be ramped up to 8GB in the new entry-level model. Storage The other big change we hope to see in the new Mac mini is the addition of more flash drive options. Currently the 2.8GHz model comes with a Fusion Drive, or you can add 256GB flash storage to that model, or the 2.8GHz model. While the 500GB hard drive in the current entry-level model (and the 1TB hard drive as standard in the £569 model) might appear attractive to some, flash memory is so much faster that we believe it is well worth the compromise of storing additional files on an external hard drive. However, it seems unlikely that Apple would do away with the hard drive storage option altogether, as many workgroups choose the Mac mini as a server and will need the extra capacity and lower prices that HD storage makes possible. Read next: New iMac rumours | New Mac Pro rumours USB-C It's felt like the USB port has been on borrowed time ever since Apple launched the first-gen 12-inch MacBook - with its lone USB Type-C (or, more commonly, just USB-C) port for both data and charging - in 2015. Like the optical drive circa 2012, it seems likely that bog-standard USB 3.0 is no longer in Apple's thoughts, and (unless the market rejects USB-C comprehensively, which despite some qualms about there only being one port on the MacBook, hasn't happened yet) it's surely a matter of time before the rest of the Mac line-up switches across to the newer tech. USB-C offers more advantages than just being reversible and thereby easier to connect when you can't see what you're doing; in theory, it offers twice the data throughput of USB 3.0 and the ability to deliver far more power. The latter factor enabled Apple to use USB-C as a combined data and power port and further slim down its laptop design. Our feeling is that the Mac mini won't be next on Apple's update list, however - our money's on the revamped MacBook Pro. As a budget-focused (and somewhat neglected) line, the Mac mini isn't likely to get the love and cutting-edge componentry of more favoured products. And power delivery - and the ability to remove extraneous ports and slim down the chassis - is far less of a concern for a static machine like the mini than for a portable like the MacBook. New Mac mini 2017 release date & specs rumours: Design It's possible that the Mac mini will get a new design. We're not expecting a major visual or build redesign, but it is certainly possible that it could get thinner and smaller, especially since it no longer has to accommodate a CD drive. Right now the dimensions are 3.6cm high, 19.7cm wide, and it weighs 1.22kg. How about a Mac mini that has similar dimensions to an Apple TV? (That's 9.8cm wide, 2.3cm high, and a weight of 0.27kg.) There was some speculation that the reason for the long delay prior to the Mac mini update in 2014 was that Apple was looking at redesiging the Mac mini along the lines of the Mac Pro. This was probably intended as an April Fool's Day prank, but we like this render of a flat Mac mini, as seen on Apple User. Even better, how about a Mac mini that's also an Apple TV? Adding Apple TV functionality to a Mac mini would be a great way of getting the Mac mini into people's living rooms as a home entertainment device. New Mac mini 2017 rumours: What is the Mac mini? Not the no-brainer it might sound like to keen mini-heads: plenty of otherwise tech-savvy folk aren't aware the Mac mini even exists. Indeed, sometimes it seems like Apple itself isn't aware of its presence. That would certainly explain the long gap before the 2014 model was launched. The Mac mini is Apple's smallest desktop Mac and also its cheapest Mac, at £479. It's a full-blown OS X or macOS Sierra desktop that fits into a self-contained chassis no bigger than a set-top box. It's an inexpensive living-room Mac that lacks the power of even some MacBooks and comes with no keyboard, mouse or display, but one that works perfectly as the centre of your digital home - not least because it comes with HDMI sockets, so that plugging it into a modern TV is a doddle. There used to be a Mac mini with OS X Server available for £849 but Apple removed that option from the line-up in October 2014.

How An Old PowerMac G5 Compares To Modern Intel CPUs Written by Michael Larabel in Hardware on 14 February 2017 at 07:52 AM EST. 31 Comments With Debian and Ubuntu dropping 32-bit PowerPC support in their future releases, you may be curious how the older PowerPC hardware compares to Intel's modern x86 processors if you are wishing to switchover. Here are some benchmarks. A Phoronix reader has provided comparison benchmarks of his PowerMac G5 to our recent Intel Kabylake CPU benchmarks and other recent x86 CPU tests. His PowerMac G5 v2 with the PPC970 is dual-core and clocks up to 2.0GHz. This Apple computer has 2GB of RAM, NVIDIA GeForce FX 5200 Ultra graphics, and was running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with the Linux 4.4 kernel and GCC 5.4 compiler. I, unfortunately, have no physical access to any PowerPC hardware at all. Fortunately, thanks to Phoronix reader Alexandre Couture we have these comparison data points to my recent Intel Linux CPU tests. With all of the tests done via the Phoronix Test Suite and centralized on OpenBenchmarking.org, it makes for easy independent yet reproducible and automated comparisons. The PowerMac G5 performance is incredibly poor compared to modern Intel x86 CPUs. This PowerMac7,2 model dates back to 2004 and was great back in the day... Now it won't even work with future Ubuntu/Debian releases. So even switching over to a $40 Kabylake Celeron CPU will be a huge upgrade in performance. Or a sub-$100 Pentium CPU is also a big upgrade if not wanting to switch to a Core CPU. Thanks to Alexandre for sending in these results showing how far performance has come since ~2004 with Apple PowerPC hardware. Unfortunately with no access to any PowerPC hardware, I'm not able to deliver any results showing how modern POWER hardware is performing. Those wishing to see more of these older PowerMac comparison results to Intel x86 CPUs can visit this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. 31 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Zoals in het screenshot te zien is kan je er nog een paar testen mee doen en een secure erase mee uitvoeren. De system tuner is nutteloos op Windows 10 voor zover ik kan zien. Alles stond ook standaard al goed bij mij terwijl ik zelf niets heb veranderd. Reageer +1 forsel @Lennyz • 14 februari 2017 11:15 Klinkt niet zo nuttig. Ik heb zelf een Samsung ssd, die hebben ook zulke tools. Maar gebruiken ga ik zo'n tool niet, geloof ik. Reageer +1 DukeBox @forsel • 14 februari 2017 11:26 Waar samsung juist wel wat kan toevoegen door een memory cache aan te maken. Bij veel io komt dat de levensduur ten goede. Reageer +1 forsel @DukeBox • 14 februari 2017 11:44 Bedankt voor de tip! Zal het dan toch eens proberen. Reageer 0 Tourmaline System en netwerk utilities @DukeBox • 15 februari 2017 15:53 Dan pakt hij wel minimaal 2gb of meer van je ram, om een memory cache aan te maken. Reageer 0 DukeBox @Tourmaline • 15 februari 2017 16:17 Nee (er vanuit gaande dat je GB bedoeld), RAPID mode will release and re-acquire system resources seamlessly based on system activity and requirements. RAPID mode consumes at most 25% of the installed DRAM, up to a maximum of 1GB.Voor performance heeft het voornamelijk nut bij SATA2 en in sommige gevallen SATA3 drives. Omdat ik mij ook afvroeg hoe het zat met write optimalisatie, heb ik zelf een test gedaan bij het spelen met games en wat foto bewerking. Met 2 Samsung 850 2TB EVO SSD's die in mirror staan, een mét rapid mode een zonder heeft die zonder rapid mode gemiddeld 3% meer writes. Het is niet veel maar in andere gevallen kan de winst veel meer zijn (of minder). Het is eigenlijk jammer dat de cache niet groter kan zijn dan 1GB en/of een langere write delay. Dat zou nog meer kunnen helpen.

Reageer 0 DukeBox @Tourmaline • 15 februari 2017 16:35 Toen ook niet, denk dat je in de wat bent met de minimale systeemeisen van 2GB. edit: Dit was de white paper op moment van de introductie: http://www.samsung.com/se...id_Mode_Whitepaper_EN.pdf Bevat exact dezelfde info als de huidige.

Het is wel al een tijdje geleden. In de oude versie kon je zelf nog aangeven hoeveel geheugen cache je wilde aanmaken. Ik lees net op het www dat de nieuwere magacian software sommige opties niet meer hebben.

Rival AMD has tried, a times valiantly, to keep up, but other than a short spurt in popularity with the Athlon 64 line, Intel’s maintained its commanding lead. Since the launch of its ‘Core i’ series of processors, particularly the second generation Core i series, Intel’s lead has only been growing. This lead can in part be attributed to Intel’s tick-tock development cycle. This cycle involves a tick, which changes the chip design, and a tock, which shrinks the manufacturing process. These ticks and tocks alternate each year. The process shrink refers to the size of the transistor gates. As a rule of thumb, the smaller they are, the faster and more efficient they run, resulting in ever-increasing performance. A shrink in transistor size also means that a higher density of them can be packed into a given area. Intel’s manufacturing process has shrunk from 32nm in 2011 to 14 nm today. The next step is 10nm, and this was expected last year. For the last few years, Intel appears to have hit a roadblock. The shrink to the 10nm process is taking longer than expected and even forced Intel to abandon its tick-tock cycle for something that it’s calling PAO (Process Architecture Optimisation). To put it another way, Intel has so far released three chips on the 14nm process – Broadwell (14 nm), Skylake (14 nm) and Kaby Lake (14 nm+), which caught the tech industry off-guard. Kaby Lake should have been built on the 10nm process. Now, it appears that Intel will release yet another generation of chips on the 14nm process. Called Coffee Lake (14 nm++), this will be Intel’s eight generation Core i series chip. There’s nothing to be consternated about, however. As PCWorld explains, this new 14 nm process, called 14 nm++ internally, is very different from the first 14 nm Broadwell chips. As ArsTechnica points out, Kaby Lake offers 10-15 percent more performance than Skylake, partly due to higher clock speeds, for the same TDP. The upcoming Coffee Lake chips will offer up to 15 percent more performance over Kaby Lake, says Intel. Either way, that’s a big bump in performance. To add to this, 10nm chips are actually coming and they’ll form the Canon Lake lineup. Analysts think that Intel plans to ship Coffee Lake chips for more mainstream applications and that the 10 nm Canon Lake chips will first hit low power devices like Ultrabooks before making their way to the mainstream. This will help Intel iron out any kinks in the 10 nm process. AMD is finally throwing a spanner in Intel’s works as well. AMD’s Ryzen expected to pose quite a threat to Intel’s stranglehold on the high-end PC market. Will Intel’s 15 percent performance bump be competitive? We’ll know for sure by April this year. The fight for CPU supremacy is indeed shaping up to be an interesting one.

Abhijit Ahaskar Asus R55UQ is a feature packed notebook capable of handling most heavy tasks and games. Click here for enlarge Asus R558UQ is one of the few notebooks that are already running the latest 7th generation Intel Core processor. And at Rs48,990, it is not very expensive either. It succeeds the Asus R558UR notebook which ran Intel’s 6th gen processor and sported a price tag of Rs46,598. What makes the new notebook interesting, apart from the interesting price tag, is that it is available in more eye popping colours, has better configuration newer specs and is lighter than its predecessor. Design: Ordinary looking, plastic body The R558UQ is a big screen notebook which like most other similar notebooks has a bigger footprint and requires a bigger bag to carry it. It looks slim and weighs 2.3kg, which makes carrying it around easy. It is available in four colour options — matte golden, glossy dark brown, red and dark blue. The all plastic exterior helps keep the weight in check but also gives it the look and feel of a budget laptop, especially the glossy brown variant. Despite the slim profile, the side panel carries all relevant connectivity options. The optical drive, VGA port, and LAN are still in vogue in many workplaces. The there is the HDMI port so you can hook it up with a bigger display or a projector. It also offers one USB 3.0 port and one USB 3.1 Type-C connector for faster data transfer. Keyboard: Small keys but well spaced The keys look flat and small but allow for quick typing after a while. They are also responsive and don’t require extra pressure to be applied on them. There is ample space between the keys which means you can type for long hours without worrying about tapping the neighbouring keys by mistake. The big letdown, in the keyboard, is that the keys are not backlit, which means you can’t use it in the dark with ease as laptops with backlit keyboard. The compact size of the keyboard leaves ample space for hand rest and touch pad. The touch pad is responsive but feels a bit small. Display: Big and non-reflective The laptop’s 15.6-inch LED display has a resolution of 1,920x1,080p. It has a matte finish on it which makes the display reflect less when the light source is directly behind the user’s head compared to laptops with glossy display.The display feels a bit dull due to the matte finish but you can liven up the display by bumping up the brightness a bit. The wide viewing angles are good which means you can use it for teamwork or watching movies with a friend or family member. Text looks crisp which makes reading and typing enjoyable. Performance: Smooth with most tasks Asus R558UQ is the first crop of Windows 10 notebooks running on Intel’s 7th Gen (Kaby Lake) Core i5-7200U Processor clocking at 2.5GHz and paired with 4GB RAM. It uses a dedicated Nvidia GeForce 940MX (2GB) graphics card which is a bit old but powerful enough to handle modern games. It was able to play some of the most demanding games like the Crysis 3 or the Sniper Ghost Warrior 2 at lower resolution and special effect settings without any stutter. The notebook offers 1TB HDD storage which means you have ample space for your movies, HD movies and games. Powered by a 2 cell Li-ion battery, the laptop lasted four to five hours on modest use and about an hour of non-stop gaming session, which is quite impressive. We also liked the audio output. Powered by Sonic Master speakers, we didn’t have to fall back on headphones even once while watching a movie or gaming. Verdict Asus R558UQ is powerful notebook capable of handling most day to day chores and some amount of gaming with ease. While build quality is not one of its strong areas, its performance, dependable battery backup and price tag makes it a solid proposition for professionals looking for an all-round notebook that can handle the personal chores comfortably. Its closest rival is the Dell Inspiron 5000 series 5567 notebook which looks slightly better. It is priced at Rs 56,190, runs Intel’s 7th Gen core i5 processor too, with 4GB RAM but with AMD Radeon R7 M445 graphics. It offers a 15.6-inch full HD display too and weighs as much as the Asus laptop.

In the same session, AMD showed its Zen x86 processor sports a 10 percent smaller die than Intel’s latest 14nm CPUs. The Stratix X uses Intel’s Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to link the FPGA with four external transceivers. The bridge is made using silicon die mounted in a BGA substrate which is significantly smaller than the silicon substrates used in the CoWoS process developed by TSMC and used by rival FPGA vendor Xilinx and GPU designer Nvidia. EMIB uses a combination of 55 micron micro-bumps and 100+ micron flip-chip bumps to support up to 24 transceiver channels with 96 I/Os each. They deliver 2 Gbits/second/pin at 1.2 pJ/bit/die using a proprietary protocol. EMIB uses fine-pitch vias and flip-chip interconnects rather than through-hole vias. (Images ISSCC) Currently, the bridge links four 28 GHz serdes to the FPGA. Intel has a road map to faster serdes and other kinds of external chips, said David Greenhill, an Intel engineer who presented the paper at ISSCC. The packaging technology drew several questions from a crowded session. Responding to a question from a Xilinx engineer, Greenhill said the Intel team doesn’t foresee any issues dealing with thermal challenges migrating the design to 56G serdes. Intel announced the technology more than two years ago as an offering in its foundry service. So far, it has not announced any other users of EMIB. The 14nm Stratix X packs 2.8 million logic elements into a 560mm2 fabric running at a gigahertz.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 13, 2017 at 9:01PM These days, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) forces gamers and other personal computer enthusiasts to make a tough choice when picking out desktop processors. Intel offers PC gamers chips with four incredibly fast processor cores ("mainstream desktop"), and it also offers them chips with between six and 10 processor cores ("high-end desktop"), but each of these cores is much slower than the four-core chips. The six- to 10-core chips also cost much more than the four-core chips do, as well. Although Intel does not provide sales data by individual chip model, I have a strong suspicion that even gamers with very deep pockets often opt for the super-fast quad-core chip rather than go for one of the more expensive chips. Image source: Intel. After all, since most games can't really take advantage of more than four cores, why should a gamer pick a chip with a lot of slower cores when the one with fewer but faster cores for cheaper will enable a superior user experience? This is one of the reasons that Intel's high-end desktop product lineup (the expensive six- to 10-core chips with relatively slow cores) has usually been somewhat of a "niche" among gamers. Going forward, considering a recent announcement from the chipmaker, I believe that Intel's high-end desktop processors will become much more attractive by remedying the problem that I outlined above. Data center first could mean high-end desktop first Intel's previous product development methodology was "personal computer first, data center second." Since Intel's mainstream desktop chips are designed first and foremost as personal computer chips (the same basic designs are used in high performance notebook computers as well as desktop computers), they have historically gotten all the technical goodies first. Indeed, the mainstream desktop chips have generally had Intel's most advanced processor cores built using the company's most advanced chip manufacturing technology. The high-end desktop chips, which are based on the chips that the company designs and sells into the data center, tend to not represent Intel's best -- at least in ways that matter to consumers.  The data center parts have generally been a generation behind in both processor architecture and manufacturing technology relative to the mainstream desktop/notebook processors. Now that the situation is going to reverse going forward, the high-end desktop chips should have the best processor cores and be built using the best manufacturing technology. Once Intel's product development methodology change flows through to products in the marketplace, then I wouldn't be surprised to see enthusiasts and gamers gravitating more to the high-end desktop products, as they will represent Intel's best, while the mainstream desktop chips will represent older, less desirable technology. Potential impact on Intel's business If what I expect to eventually play out does in fact happen, it would probably manifest itself in Intel's financial results as a mix shift to higher-performance/higher-priced gaming products. To the extent that Intel can drive a richer mix of products, the company should see both revenue (same number of units sold, but the ones that do sell are higher priced, on average) and profit improvements (even at fixed gross profit margin, higher revenue means higher gross profit dollars). This transition isn't going to happen overnight, though. Remember that Intel said that its data center products won't take the manufacturing lead from its traditional client personal computer products until it rolls out its third-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology. Considering that, don't expect Intel's high-end desktop products to become the company's unequivocally best products in terms of core performance and manufacturing technology until, perhaps, the middle of 2019.

As employees create new documents, presentations, spreadsheets and more, the amount of stored content grows dramatically over time. This rapid data growth creates a challenging new problem for IT professionals: how to store all the data in the most cost-effective way, while ensuring end-users have immediate access to the information they need. Many organizations depend on expensive, onsite Network Attached Storage (NAS) systems to house their data. While legacy NAS systems generally meet end-user demand for fast and easy access to regularly used “active” data, approximately 80% of the data stored in expensive NAS solutions is inactive and rarely accessed by end users – if at all. Storing all that “cold” data in “hot” access mediums is both inefficient and extremely expensive. Adding up the cost of necessary data protection, hardware, software, floor space, electrical power, and staff to manage the storage process, each gigabyte of NAS storage costs an organization an estimated $0.75 per month. Over the course of a year, snowballing storage costs result in a very expensive line item at $9,000 per terabyte. Ideally, an enterprise IT professional could identify and move those cold files easily, placing them in much cheaper internal or external cloud storage costing as little as $0.01 per gigabyte. However, the task of moving the older files from one storage location to another – manually – is a daunting task. An IT professional must face a lot of questions: What is the best way to identify the files to be moved? How often are the files used? What if older files moved out of primary storage are needed? How can all that data be maintained securely regardless of its storage location? How can the process be automated? The Big Data challenge is a big one indeed. As a solution provider, Equus regularly encounters enterprise customers facing this type of challenge. To deliver a proof-of-concept solution, infinite io turned to Equus for access to cutting edge Intel technology which aided in new product development. In turn, infinite io was able to deliver advanced solutions with a lengthy five-year product life cycle. The infinite io team, based in Austin, Texas, have solved these problems by tapping the latest Intel technologies incorporated in the Intel® Server System S2600WT for their new Network-Based Storage Controllers. infinite io’s controller scans metadata to identify the most-used data and documents. Active data is flagged for “hot” onsite storage, providing the fastest access for end-users. The controllers also ease the process of identifying cold data which can be moved to much more cost effective storage, while continuing to make the data readily accessible. The NSC controllers maintain added data security though deep packet inspection, bump-on-a-wire capability, advanced encryption, and access control list (ACL) support. infinite io chose the Intel® Server System S2600WT after an extensive search for a server product that meets the extreme performance and reliability specifications of their controllers. Each Intel product undergoes a rigorous design and testing process to ensure each element is capable of meeting the high demands of enterprise organizations. On top of this, Intel backs its products with a three-year warranty that includes option to extend coverage to five years. Customers can also count on Intel’s 24/7 support and have confidence in their purchases knowing Intel will replace or refund any product that fails. Similarly, infinite io relies on Equus Onsite Warranty and Support programs in order to tap the benefits of the technical service provider network Equus has established, and expedite parts replacement if necessary. What’s Inside Counts The NSC-055s Network Based Metadata Accelerator represents the entry point into infinite io’s product line, working in tandem with an enterprise’s storage filers the NSC-055s creates a memory-based “metadata map” for file systems and mounts being supported. After the initial file systems scan, deep packet inspection monitors and responds to metadata operations off-loading attached storage systems from the operation. With “always hot” status, and the ability to deliver 1,500,000 metadata operations per second thanks to the performance and technology contained in the Intel server system, the NSC-055s is able to enhance the performance of NAS systems – even those which are flash memory-based. The reduced workload on the NAS can also extend the life of primary storage. For those seeking an integrated network controller, the NSC-110 controller offers the NSC-055s’s capabilities, and builds upon them. The built-in network storage controller handles the directing and re-directing of data to the appropriate NAS or Cloud storage location. Up to 80% of all storage request are for metadata The NSC maps all storage metadata in RAM, which accelerates the response and offloads the filers from these requests. For an end-user, the experience is seamless and transparent. Data is served very quickly regardless of the file’s actual storage location. By utilizing different Intel processor and memory configurations, the NSC platform addresses different customer performance and functional requirements. According to David Sommers, VP Operations, infinite io, the NSC-110s flagship – their highest performance controller, also powered by performance-packed Intel servers -- accounts for 90% of their sales. It offers the best combination of performance and versatility in demanding enterprise scenarios. Set it and forget it Regardless of the version implemented, each controller is managed through a simple web interface, allowing an IT administrator to monitor status anytime and anywhere. The NSC’s learning curve is minor. Sommers highlights the simplicity of the controller management and reporting interface, “It’s created to be very intuitive. Most IT administrators are quickly up and running with infiniview*.” Speaking in more detail about hardware installation, he continues, “each controller is designed as a plug-and-play transparent solution, requiring no new file systems or storage mount points.” Once installed, the controller empowers an administrator to analyze, migrate, and manage enterprise-scale data. By scanning all attached data volumes, the NSC’s software provides an IT professional detailed information about the data itself by evaluating metadata like file size, user type, and date last used. With these insights, IT professionals can create policies to define what data characteristics flag a file for movement from the NAS to an internal or external cloud location. infinite io’s solutions can be utilized in any of three modes. “Out-of-Band” mode helps an IT professional identify which files should be moved. “Passive” mode adds the capability to assess the impact to performance, by exposing the device to the inline data-flow. Finally, “Active” mode enables the automatic movement of files based on the IT professional’s defined policies. Continuing to evaluate cold data residing in less expensive cloud solutions, the controller’s analysis engine monitors file status and cost savings reaped through the data migration. Sommers notes, “It has been extremely rewarding to develop a product that literally makes the IT professional a hero. Instant reports created through the controller’s web interface show just how much an enterprise is saving every day.” Inside the Controllers The NSC’s capability requires some innovative and very specialized technology under the hood. Intel’s® Trusted Platform Module System running with Intel® Xeon® processor E5 family - alongside Intel® Network Adapters, Intel® RAID Modules and maintenance-free backup, Intel® 10GbE LAN, and more – offers the speed and throughput necessary to make the infinite io solution seamless for an enterprise customer. As a systems provider, Equus augments the value of infinite io controller solutions through enterprise-level customer consulting, on-site support, and warranty management. Regarding infinite io’s controllers, Sommers reflects, “This achievement would not have been possible without many advanced technologies contained in Intel Server Products, and the great customer engagement from Equus.” Conclusions IT professionals find themselves pressured like never before to reduce corporate costs, while simultaneously ensuring end-users have fast and easy access to the data they need. infinite io’s controller utilizes policy-based rules to identify hot (active) and cold (inactive) data and then migrates the cold data to the cloud, while making it appear to still be on the local filer. Up to 80% of data currently stored on filers is stored in cold. With the help of Intel server compute-intensive capabilities, infinite io’s Network-Based Storage Controller and Metadata Accelerator implementations can offer the performance, value, and reliability needed for business-critical storage management. Combining Intel’s technology with solutions implementation expertise and support from Equus, infinite io’s plug-and-play solutions help enterprises solve some of the biggest data challenges today.

A coalition of tech firms including Uber, Intel and internet of things (IoT) provider Aeris, formed to secure the connected cars of the future, Wednesday released a manifesto inviting automakers to join together and pool resources to redesign key vehicle information architecture components with cyber-security in mind. Future of Automotive Security Technology Research (FASTR) promised to deliver precompetitive technological building blocks such as whitepapers, reference architectures, code samples, workshop best-known methods and other resources that automotive manufacturers can use across their supply chains.   The firms also are looking to offer multilayered security throughout vehicles to preserve data confidentiality, system integrity and system availability. They will establish, train and audit a Security Design Lifecycle process that incorporates early design architecture considerations. A holistic perspective will: look across in-vehicle, connectivity and data centre; follow industry best practices across all network interfaces; utilise software over the air solutions; and embrace the diverse perspectives of the evolving automotive ecosystem. The coalition will include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), transportation network companies, automotive supply chain providers, autonomous vehicle specialists, SoC providers and hardware and software suppliers, specialist automotive security companies, academics, researchers and hackers. Craig Hurst, executive director of FASTR and director of the industry alliances and marketing transportation solutions division at Intel, told SC Media, "FASTR membership is open to all companies across the automotive ecosystem, including rivals, with the belief that together through a holistic, systems-level approach we can move more quickly toward the organically secure vehicle of the future." “FASTR conducts its meeting under Chatham House Rules to allow for open dialogue with invited OEMs, tier ones and leading automotive software/hardware suppliers to foster the pre-competitive nature of the consortium.” Hurst went on to say that members are part of the three working groups within the technical steering committee (TSC) which include in-vehicle systems, cloud/connectivity and autonomous. Separately, other firms have been joining together for similar causes to share the responsibility of securing connected vehicles as car hacks and cyber-threats pose a significant threat to user safety. Earlier this year, researchers created an open-source connected car platform, Uptane, to help manage connected car system updates. Regulators are taking note as well. Last month, a bipartisan group of legislators recently proposed a bill that would call for industry professionals to study how to secure connected vehicles.

Krzanich met with President Trump on Feb. 8 and followed the meeting with an announcement that Intel would invest $7 billion in a factory that will employ up to 3,000 people in Chandler, Arizona. The investment would complete plans for a plant that was previously started. According to Krzanich, Trump's position on taxes is what inspired him to revive the factory. Under the current tax system in the U.S., relative to overseas, Krzanich said it would cost approximately $2 billion more over the span of 10 years. "The tax plan that the administration is putting forward would drastically reduce that … we are betting on that tax plan coming into fruition," Krzanich told "Mad Money" host Jim Cramer on Monday. Rick Wilking | Reuters Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, speaks during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017. The CEO opened up to Cramer and described what it was really like behind closed doors at the White House, stating that he considered it to be a way to start a dialogue with the new administration. "It was a good chance to sit down and talk about everything from immigration, tax reform, our position on diversity and women and underrepresented minorities in the workplace. All of those areas we were able to talk to both the president but also really substantive time with his staff," Krzanich said. Krzanich confirmed that after his meeting with Trump, he spent an hour and a half in the White House speaking to Gary Cohn, Ivanka Trump and Reince Priebus, among others, about various subjects. Intel also issued a letter to its employees and stakeholders clarifying why it was important to meet with Trump. The next day, Krzanich held a meeting with the organization to talk to them about why he did it. "We are not going to change as a company who we are. We stand for those values that we believe in," Krzanich said. Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News Intel Introduces Versatile New FPGA for Industrial and Automotive Markets SANTA CLARA, Calif.–()–To serve the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, Intel Corporation today announced the Intel® Cyclone® 10 family of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Designed to deliver fast and power-efficient processing, they have a variety of uses, including for automotive, industrial automation, pro audio visual and vision systems. As the “things” become more connected and able to share volumes of real-time data among themselves, data become more difficult to process. Information coming in from sensors and cameras in buildings, factories, homes and vehicles at an increasing rate can no longer be adequately handled by microprocessors or microcontrollers alone. High-performance processing devices such as Intel’s FPGAs are able to collect and send data, and make real-time decisions based on the input from IoT devices. FPGAs can be programmed to deliver the specific level of computing and functions required by different IoT applications. The Cyclone® 10 FPGAs – Cyclone® 10 GX and Cyclone® 10 LP – have their own unique features to address different design team needs. Cyclone 10 GX is unique among other low-cost FPGAs as it can support 10G transceivers and hard floating point DSP (digital signal processing). It offers 2-times the performance increase over the previous generation of Cyclone. The architectural innovation in the implementation of IEEE 754 single-precision hardened floating-point DSP blocks can enable processing rates up to 134 GFLOPs (giga floating-point operations per second). This is important for engineers needing higher performance using the FPGA for applications such as motion or motor control systems. Markets for Intel Cyclone 10 GX include those where high I/O performance and core speed are key requirements. Uses include industrial machine vision and smart city applications that provide surveillance in parking lots , on roads and on bridges. Cyclone 10 GX is also well-suited to support pro AV technologies, such as video streaming applications. Motor-driven systems account for more than two-thirds of industrial energy consumption, and their efficient operation is vital to the smart factory. Cyclone 10 GX FPGAs enable cost-savings when using motors and drives, power assembly, computer numerical control (CNC), machine tools and robotics. By using FPGAs such as the Cyclone 10 GX, operators can benefit from significant reductions in overall cost of ownership across entire product lines. For example, operators can use Cyclone GX to lower their bill of materials costs by integrating industrial networking and functional safety in a single chip. Designers using Cyclone GX and Cyclone LP FPGAs in industrial settings can more easily reach compliance under the Machinery Directive safety standard known as IEC 61508 by working with Intel, the first FPGA supplier to obtain device and tool qualification under this important industry standard. The Intel Cyclone 10 LP is the perfect solution for applications where cost and power are key factors in the design decision. These systems typically use FPGA densities that are sub 75K LE and chip-to-chip bridging functions between electronic components or I/O expansion for microprocessors. Cyclone 10 LP can also be used for automotive video processing used in rear-view cameras and in sensor fusion, where data gathered while the car is on the road is combined from multiple sensors in the car to provide a more complete view of what is happening. The Cyclone 10 FPGA family will be available in the second half of 2017, along with evaluation kits and boards, and the latest version of Quartus, the Intel FPGA programming software.

Analysis: Twitter still lost money during an election season when the service was a major part of the story nearly every day By Brady Dale • 02/13/17 1:25pm President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Intel CEO Brian Krzanich at the White House February 8, 2017. Krzanich announced an investment of $7 billion to build a factory in Chandler, Arizona. Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images This post is from “Last Week Was a Beta,” the Innovation channel’s technology news week in review. It must be frustrating running Twitter. Last week, Intel announced it would spend $7 billion on a factory in Arizona because it’s afraid of the President’s tweets. In fairness, it didn’t announce that it was afraid of his tweets, but that’s how it looks. Ever since the then president-elect’s wrestling match with Carrier over a factory relocation, primarily conducted via the microblog, big companies have been cautious about announcing moves against American workers. Intel, for its part, seems to have picked a way to get out ahead of any presidential ire. Not only did it not announce any firings, it went out of its way to let the president be seen getting credit for adding jobs. This looks like what financiers would call a hedge. Odds are, Intel knows it might later make moves the president doesn’t like, but the president might be less inclined to call the chipmaker out after he and its CEO have shared this special moment. CEOs hesitated to speak up until they knew they wouldn’t have to go it alone. If they’d condemned it one by one, they knew there would be tweeted consequences. Intel would probably quibble with this characterization of its decision, but here’s what’s clear: the company announced the factory investment in an Oval Office press conference coordinated with the president, as The New York Times reported. This president has been one of the most ardent users of his office’s bully pulpit in recent memory, and Twitter has been a great tool for him to work applying that public pressure into his day. He doesn’t have to organize a speech, call a press conference or even step out of his office. All he has to do is pick up his mobile and type a message out. It doesn’t always work, though. The president also went after Nordstrom last week for dropping his daughter, Ivanka Trump’s, clothing line. In the end, the retail chain seems to have come out ahead in the altercation, but who wins and who loses in a social media tête-à-tête with the commander-in-chief comes down to who a company’s customers are, as Bloomberg explained. It’s also worth adding that Intel probably also coordinated with the president in order to score points as the White House pursues major policy changes, such as a complete restructuring of how corporate taxes work. For example, House Republicans have been actively pressing the administration to consider changing America’s tax structure away from a profit-oriented tax and focusing solely on money earned inside the US border. Multinationals like Intel would want a place at the table as deals like this get considered. Theater like last week’s factory announcement gives the company a bargaining chip for access. But Intel, like every other major company, also doesn’t want to be the target of a Trump tweet storm. We saw that reticence a week ago as the tech industry finally came out as one condemning the president’s immigration order. CEOs hesitated to speak up until they knew they wouldn’t have to go it alone. If they’d condemned it one by one, they knew there would be tweeted consequences. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images So if the service is so powerful, why can’t it make money? Twitter earnings for the last quarter came out last week. Not only did it miss its target by $23 million, it lost $167 million. These steep losses came during Twitter’s prime time: the US presidential election. Twitter’s fiscal year runs the calendar year. It’s fourth quarter started on September 30, according to Yahoo Finance. During the election, Twitter was in the news nearly every day thanks the new President’s frequent tweeting during the campaign. If Twitter can’t make money during its prime time, when can it make money? In fact, Twitter lost $457 million for the year. Contrast it with the news from Facebook last week. Facebook turned 12 this month, but has only now finally showed signs of actually letting its customers verify the statistics the company uses to charge them. Last week, we reported on very public remarks by an executive of Procter & Gamble who said the company just won’t buy ads on sites that don’t have a third party verifying their statistics. Those remarks seem to have hit home. Menlo Park announced plans to give its advertisers more confidence in its numbers, but even with frustration growing, Facebook still makes lots of money. So even with bungled numbers and frustration in corporate America was turning against it, the world’s dominant social network ended the last quarter of 2016 with $3.5 billion in net income. That’s pretty good, but it’s still half as much as Intel plans to spend because (at least in part) it doesn’t want the White House sending any derogatory tweets its way. Seen in that light, one has to wonder if CEO Jack Dorsey isn’t sitting around asking himself how he can get in on his own company’s action.

The 2017 Razer Blade doesn't just receive this CPU upgrade over last year's model, Razer also delivers a GTX 10 series GPU, faster memory, and a new 4K UHD screen option to potential purchasers. Last year the Razer Blade packed the potent combination of an Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad-Core Processor (2.6GHz / 3.5GHz) and Nvidia GeForce GTX 970M (6GB GDDR5 VRAM) into a slim unibody 0.70-inch / 17.9mm aluminium chassis. This year that power plant has been replaced with the latest Intel Core i7-7700HQ Quad-Core Processor (2.8GHz / 3.8GHz), plus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5 VRAM). The chassis remains a slim 17.9mm. Elsewhere Razer has improved its Blade offering with faster memory DDR4 2400MHz rather than 2133MHz, and extra screen options. Last year there was a single screen choice; a 14.0-inch IGZO QHD+ 16:9 Ratio, 3200x1800, with LED backlight, and capacitive multi-touch. This year there are two options; a 14-inch IPS Full HD Matte (1920 x 1080), or a 14-inch 4K UHD (3840 x 2160) capacitive multi-touch screen. It’s a shame there's no 2K screen option. "The Razer Blade sets the benchmark for performance in thin laptops," said Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO, in a press release about the 2017 Razer Blade. "More users embraced this flagship computer model in 2016 than ever before, and we are excited to make it even more available worldwide this year. Beyond gaming, it has been really gratifying to see people enjoying the power and portability of the Blade for video editing, music creation and software development." Availability of the 2017 Razer Blade will start from today: RazerZone.com in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany and France will have stock from 13th Feb (today). Selected other retailers will have stocks from 20th Feb. Starting prices are US$1,899 / C$2,749 / €2,149 / £1,799. Meanwhile, Razer has scheduled rest of the world availability for March.

Posted by GoNz0 - Mon 13 Feb 2017 19:13 Like for like spec bar the GPU being a 1060 instead of a 1050 will cost £500 more than the Dell offering. £200 more I could understand, £500 they are having a laugh. I just paid £1,788 for the Dell XPS 15 2017 with UHD panel, 16gb RAM & a 512gb SSD with 3 years onsite warranty. Posted by EvilCycle - Tue 14 Feb 2017 11:24 As above I love the laptop but hate the price. I know you pay extra for the portability etc. and I understand there are people who spend a lot of time away from home that would benefit from this type of gaming machine, but I can never stop myself from comparing the specs to what you could get in a desktop for the same price, and it always puts me off because it just seems a bit excessive. Posted by decends - Tue 14 Feb 2017 19:56 i hate how much they charge for this laptop. For its price you could get a laptop with a 1070 inside of it instead. Sure its not gonna have all the bells and wistles (SSD's and crap) but its GPU will blow this thing out of the water.

Register for an Exam Today> Enterprise IT Departments Find It Hard To Keep the Cloud Safe By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 13 2017 A lack of appropriate IT security skills is hindering the expansion of cloud deployments, according to a new report released today by Intel Security at the annual RSA Security Conference in San Francisco. Forty-nine percent of the more than 2,000 organizations surveyed said that a lack of cybersecurity skills has slowed the adoption or usage of cloud services. An additional 36 percent of enterprises said they are experiencing a scarcity of cybersecurity skills but are continuing with their cloud deployments regardless. Only 15 percent of those surveyed stated they do not have a skills shortage, Intel reported. Lack of IT Skills The findings were published in Intel Security's second annual cloud security report, "Building Trust in a Cloudy Sky." The report outlines the current state of cloud adoption, the primary concerns with private and public cloud services, security implications, and the evolving impact of shadow IT, according to Intel. "The 'cloud first' strategy is now well and truly ensconced into the architecture of many organizations across the world," said Raj Samani, EMEA chief technology officer, Intel Security, in a statement. "The desire to move quickly toward cloud computing appears to be on the agenda for most organizations. This year, the average time before respondents thought their IT budgets would be 80 percent cloud-based was 15 months, indicating that cloud first for many companies is progressing and remains the objective." Nevertheless, a dearth of security skills remains a major issue preventing enterprises from adopting cloud technology more rapidly. As a result, employees may be engaging in shadow IT activities as a result of their employers' inabilities to provide the tools they feel they need for their jobs. But Trust Is Growing According to the report, almost 40 percent of cloud services are now commissioned without the involvement of IT as a result of the ease of procurement. In addition, visibility of these shadow IT services has dropped from about 50 percent last year to just under 47 percent this year, leading 65 percent of IT professionals to report that the phenomenon is interfering with their abilities to keep the cloud safe and secure. This is not surprising given the amount of sensitive data now being stored in the public cloud; more than half (52 percent) of respondents said they have definitively tracked malware from cloud SaaS (software-as-a-service) applications, according to Intel. Despite the growing pains, trust in cloud services is actually increasing, the report noted. Most organizations now view cloud services as being equally or more secure than private clouds, and more likely to deliver lower costs of ownership and overall data visibility. Improved trust and perception, as well as increased understanding of the risks by senior management, is encouraging more organizations to store sensitive data in the public cloud. Personal customer information is the most likely type of data to be stored in public clouds, kept there by 62 percent of those surveyed.

Once the cloud has predominantly pulled the majority of companies into the cloud you will see cloud providers raising pricing and services to a back breaking level just as the cable companies have done. Cloud providers will make it very expensive and extremely difficult for companies to pull back after they have committed all of their data and hardware into cloud based companies. Sean: Posted: 2017-02-13 @ 2:58pm PT It would have been nice to include some indication of the lacked skills, the ones that were in demand etc. and where to acquire them. M. Johnson: Posted: 2017-02-13 @ 2:55pm PT Nothing is more secure than something I have control of, therefore, until and unless I gain that kind of confidence in the Cloud, it will remain nothing more than vapor on the wind to me.

Microsoft Offers Patent Troll Defense Next Article > Amazon Unveils New Conference Call Service To Take on Skype By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 14 2017 A new video and phone conference service from Amazon aims to compete with the likes of Microsoft's Skype for Business. Amazon Web Services unveiled its new Amazon Chime service today to provide unified communications tools to enable companies to host or join meetings as well as chat online, while sharing content and screens across their devices. "In a world where meeting attendees are often not in the same city, much less the same office building, unified communications has become increasingly more important," the company said in a statement. "Amazon Chime takes frustration out of meetings, delivering very high quality video, voice, chat, and screen sharing." Push-Button Conferencing Amazon is pitching the new service as a way to bring high-end quality to an aspect of enterprise technology often seen as a source of frustration for companies due to clunky or hard-to-use interfaces, bad sound and audio quality and complicated login procedures. Chime aims to deliver high-end video and audio quality while making the process of hosting or joining a meeting as simple as the push of a button. Chime calls all participants listed for a meeting when it starts so joining is as easy as clicking a button in the app, according to the company. It also provides a visual roster of all attendees, taking the mystery out of knowing who is on the call. The new service also comes with its own mobile and desktop apps that can be synchronized across multiple Android, iOS, Mac, and Windows devices. Amazon said Chime can also be integrated into existing corporate directories, and also allow IT administrators to manage identities and control access across their organizations. Easy Deployment Perhaps most attractive for IT departments, Chime doesn't require deployment or upfront investments, since enterprises can just download the app. Additionally, Amazon said it costs about a third as much as competing solutions. "It's pretty hard to find people who actually like the technology they use for meetings today. Most meeting applications or services are hard to use, deliver bad audio and video, require constant switching between multiple tools to do everything they want, and are way too expensive," said Gene Farrell, vice president, enterprise applications, AWS, in the statement. The service is now available in three versions. Amazon Chime Basic is free and lets a user attend meetings, call another person using voice or video, and use its messaging and chat capabilities. Amazon Chime Plus adds user management, such as the ability to manage an entire e-mail domain, disable accounts, or configure Active Directory, as well as 1 GB per user of message retention, for $2.50 per user, per month. And Amazon Chime Pro adds the ability to host meetings with screen sharing and video for up to 100 users and also includes support for mobile, laptop, and in-room video along with unlimited VoIP support for $15 per user, per month.

In contrary to most currently known Optane products, that are low capacity caching drives, this Optane drive is a full fledged SSD with a capacity of 375 GB and up to 500,000 IOPS. The specs are posted by a Taiwanese website which took them from a document that briefly appeared on Intel’s website. The P4800X is a PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe add-in card. It’s expected that in the same P4800X series also drives with capacities of 750GB and 1.5TB should become available. When Intel and Micron first announced 3D Xpoint memory the companies claimed it would be 1000x faster than traditional NAND memory. When looking at the specified sequential read and write speeds this promise doesn’t seem to hold up. With 2,400 MB reads and 2,000 MB/s writes the first Optane SSD doesn’t impress as Samsung’s NAND based 1TB 960 Pro SSD is able to read data at 3,500 MB/s and write data at 2,100 MB/s. The 3D Xpoint memory does impress when it comes to latency and IOPS. Where the Samsung has a specified maximum 440,000 IOPS for reading and 360,000 IOPS for writing, the P4800X impresses with a specified 550,000 IOPS for random reads and 500,000 IOPS for random writes. Intel specifies a typical latency of 10 µs which is half of that of Intel’s own P3700 SSD. Even better, the sheet states that 99.999 percent of read and write operations will be performed in less than 150 or 200 microseconds (respectively), even with a queue depth of 16. Another advantage of 3D Xpoint memory appears to be endurance, something Intel and Micron also boasted about when the memory was announced. The P4800X is able to withstand at least 12.3 Petabytes of data written to the drive which is way more than the 800 TBW (0.8 PWB) of the 1TB Samsung 960 Pro. Although it’s unknown what the P4800X will cost, it’s likely the price will be a disadvantage over NAND SSDs. Another disadvantage is the power consumption. The PX4800X is listed to use 18 watts, while e.g the Samsung drive only draws up to 5.7 watts. When looking at the spec of this first Optane drive it doesn’t seem to live up the expectations Intel and Micron set for 3D Xpoint powered drives. It’s not 1000x faster than NAND and it doesn’t have 1000x the endurance of NAND.

Razer Razer made its slim 14-inch Blade into one of the smallest VR-ready PCs last September by dropping in Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. That's now being joined by the latest "Kaby Lake" silicon from Intel. Announced today, the Blade will run on a seventh-gen 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor, updated from its sixth-gen Core i7-6700HQ. We haven't seen big performance differences between the two, but it's always nice to have the latest components. Plus, it's joined by 16GB of faster 2,400MHz DDR4 memory. Also, with the last version, Razer added a matte 14-inch IPS 1,920x1,080-resolution display alternative to its high-res 3,200x1,800-pixel touchscreen. This time around you'll have a 4K UHD (3,840x2,160-pixel) touchscreen option, alongside the full HD screen -- Intel touts this generation of chips being particularly efficient with 4K video. The new 14-inch Razer Blade starts at $1,799 in the US and £1,899 in the UK, which roughly converts to AU$3,100. The full HD model is available now on the company's site and at other US retailers from February 20. Worldwide availability will rollout in March, while the 4K UHD model won't arrive until sometime in Q2. Razer keeps the Blade thin. Razer Aside from the processor and memory bumps and the high-res display, the slim system remains pretty much unchanged from last year's models. 2.8GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 with 6GB of VRAM 16GB of system memory (DDR4, 2,400MHz) Choice of 256GB, 512GB, 1TB PCIe-based SSD storage Killer Wireless-AC 1535 (802.11ac + Bluetooth 4.1) One USB-C Thunderbolt 3 and three USB 3.0 ports HDMI 2.0 video and audio output 3.5mm headphone/mic combo jack 0.7 x 13.6 x 9.3 inches (17.9 x 345 x 235 mm) Full HD weight: 4.1 pounds (1.86 kg) UHD touchscreen weight: 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg) A gaming laptop with a colorful personality The Razer Blade is one sold-separately accessory away from being ready for high-end VR. by Dan Ackerman 1:20 Close Drag Editors' Top Picks See All Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) Starting at: $1,699.00 Apple's Touch Bar -- a thin screen that replaces the function keys on the new MacBrook...

With their latest v5.4 release, StreamDSP has added support for Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGAs as well as Intel Stratix-10 FPGAs to their already impressive list of supported FPGA families. The StreamDSP sFPDP IP core is a fully-compliant implementation of the Serial Front Panel Data Port (sFPDP) communications standard, as defined by the VITA 17.1-2003 specification. StreamDSP Serial FPDP IP now supports the following FPGA devices: Xilinx Virtex UltraScale+, Virtex UltraScale, Virtex-7, Virtex-6 LXT, Virtex-5 LXT/FXT, Virtex-4 FX and Virtex-II Pro Xilinx Kintex UltraScale, Kintex-7, Artix-7, and Zynq-7000 Xilinx Spartan-6 LXT Altera Stratix-10, Stratix-V GX, Stratix-IV GX and Stratix-II GX Altera Arria-10, Arria-V GX, Arria-V GZ, Arria-II GX, Arria-II GZ, and Arria GX Altera Cyclone-V SOC and Cyclone-IV GX Microsemi Igloo-2 StreamDSP provides "ready-to-run" simulations, evaluations, and reference designs targeted to popular development boards for each of the supported FPGA families. This allows StreamDSP's customers to quickly and easily verify proper operation both in simulation and with their chosen device family and greatly shorten integration time. The wide range of FPGA device support also allows StreamDSP to do extensive compatibility testing between different FPGA families using their own array of development boards, sFPDP based equipment, and a sFPDP protocol analyzer from Absolute Analysis. The sFPDP IP core from StreamDSP makes it simple for customers to connect Altera and Xilinx devices together with very high bandwidth connections. "Over the past several years we've seen our customer base for the Serial FPDP IP core increase substantially. Our customers appreciate knowing that we're always busy adding support for the newest FPGA families, as well as continuing our support for the older families. Having this wide range of device support allows our customers to choose any FPGA device family they like for each program while retaining a common user interface to the high-bandwidth serial link," said Greg Schueller, StreamDSP's Director of Business Development. "The new UltraScale+ and Stratix-10 families enable an incredible amount of processing to be done in the FPGA, and Serial FPDP continues to be the high-speed serial protocol of choice for remote sensor applications. Many customers also choose Serial FPDP to allow simple plug-and-play connectivity between Altera and Xilinx devices," added Greg. To support the growing number of requests for even higher bandwidth, StreamDSP also provides a multi-lane wrapper that can be used to channel-bond several sFPDP lanes together. This gives StreamDSP's customers access to very high-bandwidth multi-lane data paths. In addition, StreamDSP is currently involved in the definition of VITA 17.3, which will be the successor to VITA 17.1, providing advanced encoding and native channel bonding.

Aside from the upgraded chips, the Blade is virtually unchanged from its predecessor, except for a slightly higher price, with the Blade now starting at $1,899 versus the previous model’s $1,799 price tag. The extra hundred dollars gets you a 2.8GHz Core i7 Kaby Lake processor (instead of a 2.6 GHz Skylake i7 chip), along with the same Nvidia GTX 1060 GPU, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a 1080p display. The Kaby Lake-equipped Blade with the 1080p screen configuration will be available on Razer’s website starting today in North America and Europe, while a 4K touchscreen variant will ship sometime in Q2 later this year.

Coverage of Disruptive Science and Technology Forum About Contact Facebook twitter Google February 10, 2017 Oncoming Drone Swarms air force, darpa, drone swarm, drones, entertainment, gadgets, intel, military, sports, technology, television Facebook Twitter linkedin google Reddit Lady Gaga opened the halftime show at Super Bowl LI in front of Intel’s drone swarm. Lady Gaga Halftime Drone Swarm show was pretaped to shield the crowd (no drones or planes were allowed near the stadium on the day of the game) This artful drone swarm is not the first, though it is probably the highest-profile spectacle of its kind in the United States. Drones and dance troupes appeared on talent shows, drones have danced with humans alone in a field, an earlier Intel drone swarm set an early Guinness World Record with a dancing display. And there is my personal favorite, a small swarm of just 20 aerial robots performing before Mount Fuji, lights and flights creating a vibrant, thick sky. At the end of their Half Time performance, Intel’s drones spelled out the name of the show’s other big sponsor, Pepsi. Each one of Intel’s “Shooting Star Drones” weighs under 10 ounces, can fly for up to 20 minutes, and flies at around 6 mph. Yet it’s the computing that really stands out: the whole swarm of 300 flying robots are controlled by one pilot and one computer, with a second pilot on hand in case of emergencies. Coordinating flying swarms has applications far beyond just entertainment. The Pentagon tested an autonomous drone swarm in October 2016. Those robots, coordinating with each other and flying together towards set objectives, represent the first wave of military swarming, with smaller, cheaper flocks of robots replacing or complementing the jobs previously done by bigger, more expensive craft. The US military has launched 103 miniature swarming drones from a fighter jet during a test in California.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Intel releases Unite collaboration tool By Sead Fadilpašić News  Collaboration is getting new toys. Shares Intel recently announced the launch of the new Intel Unite, a wireless meeting platform that works regardless of the device employees are using at any given moment. Intel Unite comes with a bunch of new features and capabilities, including analytics, extended support for more devices, extra features and more control for IT professionals.  “Using Intel Unite software on Intel’s Core vPro platform not only increases employee productivity, but delivers security and manageability features to drive peace of mind for my IT team deploying the solution. We’re finding that Intel Unite is easy to use, manage and has saved us significant time,” commented Adolfo San Martin from Acciona. First up is the Advanced Analytics. With the help of the new telemetry plug in, IT pros can track usage, including how often meeting spaces are utilised, for how long they’re used, and in which state is the technology used at those meetings. Besides Windows and Mac OS X, Intel Unite is now also available on iPads and Androids, with Chromebook support ‘not far behind’. Meeting Control now offers more control for meeting administrators. Different permissions can be set up, which is essential for, for example, classrooms. In terms of security, aside from the already available Rotating PIN, Intel Unite now offers Static PIN, as well. More details about the new product can be found on this link.   Image Credit: StockStudio / Shutterstock Topics intel intel unite collaboration features Load Comments GET YOUR FREE MAGAZINE NET: The Money Issue worth £5.99 Join over 7000 ITProPortal subscribers!

The new processor is based on the Broadwell-EX die and has approximately a 200 MHz higher base frequency than its direct predecessor, released in Q2 2016. Intel said that the new CPU has set a number of records in various benchmarks. Intel’s customers interested in the chip will also have to pay a record price too. The flagship Intel Xeon E7-8894 v4 processor features the Broadwell-EX XCC (extreme core-count) die and has 24 cores with Hyper-Threading technology, 60 MB of L3 cache, 165 W TDP, a default frequency of 2.4 GHz and a turbo frequency of up to 3.4 GHz. Like other Broadwell-EX XCC CPUs, the new chip has quad-channel DDR3/DDR4 memory controller support and can manage up to ~3 TB of DRAM per socket (when used in conjunction with four Jordan Creek 2 scalable memory buffers). The CPUs are also equipped with 32 PCIe 3.0 lanes and three 9.6 GT/s QPI links for multi-socket environments.

Such mission-critical machines typically to be available 24/7/365 and this is why the Xeon E7 v4 and the Broadwell-EX range has a host of various RAS (reliability, availability, serviceability) features. The Xeon E7-8894 v4 CPU has exactly the same set of capabilities as its direct predecessor, the Xeon E7-8890 v4 released last year. Intel claims that due to increased default frequency (and obviously because of the core count in general), the Xeon E7-8894 v4 sets a number of performance records in various general, server, HPC, big data analytics, business processing, database and other benchmarks, such as SPECint_base2006, SPECompG_2012, and so on. The Intel Xeon E7-8894 v4 processor carries a tray price of $8898, which is the highest price of an Intel mass-produced CPU ever. Its predecessor on the top spot in the range, the 24-core Xeon E7-8890 v4 (which runs at 2.2 GHz) is priced at $7174 and still sits at its original tray price. As always, there are customers willing to pay such sums of money for server CPUs that deliver certain levels of performance. Moreover, there are workloads that benefit from a +200MHz (9%) performance increase so significantly (from a financial point of view to the owners of the machines) that it justifies paying extra 24% (or $1724) for a 200 MHz frequency increase (provided that this is the only advantage that this CPU has over the E7-8890 v4).

Reply bill.rookard - Monday, February 13, 2017 - link Haha. Indeed. I don't think it will ever really hit $50.00 but if it falls to $250.00 it would be worth it to pick up. My question is pretty simple though. What about the Ryzen based server parts which you know will be hitting soon. The 32 core Naples chip - assuming that the Zen cores are indeed solid - and assuming that the pricing is similarly aggressive in their pricing - is likewise going to shake up the server market. I'd love to see how long that pricing at almost $9,000 per cpu will hold. Reply Black Obsidian - Monday, February 13, 2017 - link AMD's penetration in the server market has historically been almost entirely on the low end, despite having had some mid-range and even a couple of high-end (4S) offerings. It'll be interesting to see if Ryzen changes that, but I wouldn't hold my breath. For the 4S workloads I'm familiar with, a $9K CPU--or even the $100K box as whole, once you factor in 4 such CPUs and a couple TB of RAM--is a rounding error on the licensing costs of the software running on it and the professional(s) hired to use it. Reply Meteor2 - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link So what *are* the workloads for a 4S or a 8S server running these chips (and packing up to, what, 24 TB of RAM)? Running thousands of VMs in one box? Reply keeepcool - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link High Frequency Trading bots, google search, and lots more banking stuff, paired with buckets of FPGA's. Reply Kevin G - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link High frequency trading prefers low latency above anything else. Those systems often use lower core counts at higher clocks to shave off a bit of time. This chip doesn't fit well into that role vs. other models from Intel. Reply nils_ - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link Also, you don't really want NUMA in HFT, so there is little point in getting that many sockets. Reply Brutalizer - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link There are many types of high frequency traders. Scalpers needs ultra low latency, and they prefer a few highly clocked cores. Say an algorithm needs 20 steps before you can decide to trade or not, if you have 4GHz you finish 20 steps before another cpu that uses 2GHz. So HFT are not interested in these E7 cpus, they are too low clocked. The use case for these E7 cpus with up to 8-sockets, are large business servers such as SAP, databases, etc - such ERP business software must run on a single large machine, and can not be run on clusters such as SGI UV3000 servers. The largest scale-up business servers typically have 16 or 32-sockets. The largest scale-up clusters, typically have 10.000s of cores and 100s of TB of RAM - in effect a mini super computing cluster. The largest scale-up business server that SGI has, is a UV300H with 24-sockets, or have SGI released a new model with 32-sockets now? Anyway, business servers stop at 32-sockets. Scale out HPC clusters go to 10.000s of cores and above. But they can not run business software (because such software communicate too much between the cpus, so it can not spread out on a slow cluster) I have checked the "world records" that Intel claim. And they are somewhat strange. For instance, Intel claims 4-socket server world record of 43.300 saps. Well, one 2-socket SPARC M7 server reaches 30.800 saps. https://blogs.oracle.com/partnertech/entry/new_sap... And if you go to 8-sockets, SPARC M7 reaches 130.000 saps: https://blogs.oracle.com/BestPerf/entry/20160531_s... So, Intel is able to claim the "4-socket sap world record" only because Oracle has not bothered to benchmark 4-socket SPARC M7 servers. Likewise with the next benchmark I bothered to check, Java specjbb2015. 16-socket Integrity HP Superdome, reaches: 776,269 max-jOPS and 84,557 critical-jOPS. The number of interest is usually the critical-jOPS. But anyway, let us compare both numbers to one single SPARC M7 cpu: 120,603 max-jOPS and 60,280 critical-jOPS. https://blogs.oracle.com/BestPerf/entry/201511_spe... In other words, the 16-socket Intel E7 cpu server might have the 16-socket world record, but if Oracle just bothers to benchmark a 8-socket SPARC M7 server, then Oracle will easily get the world record. I think the other "world records" are similar. Because, typically, SPARC M7 is 2-3x faster than the fastest Intel Xeon or POWER8. And if this E7 want to compete with SPARC M7, it must be 2-3x faster than the E5-2699v4 cpu. Which can not happen. So I would be very surprised if Intel manages to snatch one single world record from SPARC M7 on a socket-per-socket basis. We all know that Intels new cpus are not 200-300% faster than the previous generation, no, they are only 10% faster or so. To compete with SPARC, Intel needs 200-300% improvements.

Almost half of 2,000 IT professionals surveyed for the vendor's second annual Building Trust in a Cloudy Sky report admitted a lack of infosec experts had slowed their cloud adoption plans. More than a third, 36%, say they're experiencing a scarcity in skills but are continuing to use and adopt cloud regardless, and just 15% of respondents said they have no skills shortage. While the skills gap has slowed 60% of engineering firms' cloud plans, the report found that the largest organisations had the most skills, and therefore were the least affected, with 23% of these firms reporting no skills gap. Growing trust in public cloud As companies struggle to source cybersecurity skills in-house, their trust of the public cloud is growing, with 85% of those surveyed storing all or some of their sensitive data (mostly customers' personal information) there, and 23% completely trusting it, compared to 13% in 2015. However, a quarter of UK companies aren't storing any data in the public cloud at all. "In the UK, low public cloud usage appears to be predominantly a trust issue, as they reported the lowest opinions of the public cloud's abilities to maintain identity and access control, and to keep their organization's data safe and secure from hackers," read the report. Private cloud drops off Meanwhile, pure private cloud users halved from 51% in 2015 to 24% in the latest report, with hybrid cloud growing from 19% to 57%. "This move to a hybrid private/public cloud architecture requires the data centre to evolve to a highly virtualised, cloud-based infrastructure," the report read. But companies cited unauthorised access to sensitive data as their top concern about private cloud, followed by IT skills for maintenance, and the requirement to maintain compliance. An average 52% of firms' data centre servers are virtualised, while 80% of companies are using containers, Intel's research found. With 73% expecting to shift to a software-defined data centre within two years, Intel found the shift is slowest at large organisations, with 10% having no plans to do so, and 29% only expecting to do so within five years. C-level get on board with the cloud Senior executives, including the C-suite, are now more aware of the pros and cons of public cloud, with 86% of IT staff saying their firm's top dogs "mostly or totally" understood these. CIOs and C-level staff expect their budgets to be weighted 80% towards the cloud in the next 12 months, and are more likely to be following a cloud-first strategy, according to the report. "These senior executives were also aware of the security skills shortage, and the affect it was having on their cloud adoption rate," the report read. They are tackling this by buying in integrated security tools, and running DevSecOps functions within the IT department. Cloud service provider issues "High costs/poor value is now the number one operational issue that IT professionals have experienced with their cloud providers in the past year," the report found, ranking it ahead of poor customer service, which came second. This marks a stark contrast with last year, when IT professionals experienced difficulty migrating services or data to the cloud. Lack of insight into cloud providers' operations remains IT professionals' top technical priority. https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-security-cloud-report-rev...

We play with the ultimate, if unofficial, NES, and see a streaming-only album win a Grammy. The ultimate NES comes with an appropriate price tag. The Analogue Nt Mini wants to be the last NES you'll ever buy Trying to play an NES cartridge on Nintendo's original, 30-year-old hardware can be an exercise in frustration. The console's ancient composite cables offer terrible image quality on modern televisions, and getting games to actually run is a ballet of resetting, jostling and, of course, blowing on game cartridges. While Nintendo's own NES Classic Edition and the Wii U and 3DS virtual consoles offer refuge for the casual gamer's nostalgic yearnings, collectors looking for a more authentic experience have had to compromise. Is it better to play on the original, but unreliable, hardware, or an NES clone plagued with compatibility issues? Sean Buckley says that with the Analogue Nt Mini, you may not have to tolerate either. They'll still be better. Intel's 8th-gen Core processors won't be revolutionary Intel has revealed that its 8th-generation Core processors, due in the second half of 2017 will be built on a 14-nanometer process for the fourth time in a row. The company is shy on what these new chips will entail, but it's claiming that it'll manage another 15 percent performance improvement -- in tests at least -- like it did with the 7th-generation Core designs you see now. Real-time weather reports from tiny drones. NASA's tiny airborne probes could help improve weather forecasts It's not easy to gather airborne weather data beyond major airports. Airliners have had a sophisticated probe system (TAMDAR Edge) for over a dozen years, but that doesn't help much in those remote areas where you may only see smaller airplanes or drones. NASA is close to covering this gap. It recently started test-flying a relatively tiny, lightweight version of TAMDAR Edge aboard an Ikhana drone. The tech promises real-time weather data on virtually any aircraft, filling in local atmospheric conditions even in barren places like the Arctic.

While the worldwide PC market is stagnating, the data center sector continues to see rapid growth. An Intel presentation showed that the total available market (TAM) – the maximum available revenue the company could generate if it owned the entire sector – was $30 billion for its PC CPU business. For data centers, the figure is more than double - $65 billion. As part of the company’s restructuring, “each of the functional groups inside of Intel look at their business and their investments and their strategies, in the context of making the data center a priority,” said Intel’s data center chief, Diane Bryant. “And that includes being first to launch on a next-generation process technology node, and that’s a big deal.” As noted by Fortune, with the amount of time it takes to develop each new generation of chips, we probably won’t see the effects of this shift in strategy for a few years. It’s likely to be 2019’s 10nm Tiger Lake chips that arrive for servers first, followed by the company’s 7 nm chips. While the move is unlikely to be welcomed by PC fans, it doesn’t spell the end for the platform. Like any company, Intel is just placing its primary focus on where the money is. The good news is that even as the PC market declined, the success of Intel’s Core i7 chips saw the firm raise its operating profits by 30 percent – a trend that’s expected to continue.

Credit: Ann Singer More like this John McAfee asks court to block Intel’s security spinoff Intel asserts its trademark rights against John McAfee John McAfee’s company could spoil the party for Intel’s new venture Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now A dispute between Intel and security expert John McAfee over the use of his name for another company is headed for settlement talks, according to court records. The move comes shortly after the federal court refused John McAfee and MGT Capital Investments, the company to be renamed, a preliminary injunction on Intel’s transfer of marks and related assets containing the word McAfee, as part of a proposed spin-out by the chipmaker of its security business as a separate company that would be called McAfee. The chip company said in September it had signed the agreement with TPG to set up a cybersecurity company in which Intel shareholders would hold 49 percent of the equity with the balance held by the investment firm. The two sides have now informed District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that they consent to a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox. MGT announced in May last year it was teaming with John McAfee to set up a security company that would be named “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc,” and would have him as the CEO and executive chairman. Intel acquired McAfee Inc. in 2011 and uses the McAfee mark for security products, services, and publications for consumers and businesses. It countered in a letter in June that John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security-related goods and services. The letter prompted John McAfee and MGT to file a suit to seek a judgment that “their use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business,” including in the renaming of MGT, does not infringe on Intel’s trademark rights or breach any agreement between the parties. John McAfee claims he entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a precursor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. The maverick entrepreneur has argued in court that he had at no point in the agreement assigned rights to his personal name through an assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agreed to restrict his right to do business using his own name. The settlement talks do not necessarily mean that the two sides will come to an agreement.

The chipmaker is “investing heavily” in quantum and neuromorphic computing, said Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, during a question-and-answer session at the company’s investor day on Thursday. “We are investing in those edge type things that are way out there,” Krzanich said. To give an idea of how far out these technologies are, Krzanich said his daughter would perhaps be running the company by then. Researching in these technologies, which are still in their infancy, is something Intel has to do to survive for many more decades. Shrinking silicon chips and cramming more features into them is becoming difficult, and Intel is already having trouble in manufacturing smaller chips. Smartphones, PCs, and other devices are getting smaller, faster and more power efficient thanks to Moore’s Law, a 1965 observation loosely stating that the number of transistors in a die area would double every two years, causing performance to double while driving down the cost of making chips. Intel has been using Moore’s Law as a guiding star to make faster and smaller chips and reducing the price of devices. However, it is widely agreed that Moore’s Law is slowly dying, and Intel’s manufacturing struggles are growing. For decades, Intel’s business has been heavily reliant on its ability to make and deliver chips. But the process is slowing down. Intel used to advance manufacturing processes every two years, and that has now changed to three to four years. One way to resolve that crisis—which all chipmakers face—is to completely change the current computing model in PCs, smartphones, and servers. The current model—known as the Von Neumann approach—involves data being pushed to a processor, calculated, and sent back to memory. But storage and memory are becoming bottlenecks. The answer is to adopt new models of computing, which is where quantum computers and neuromorphic chips fit in. Quantum computers have the potential to be powerful computers harnessing the unique quality of a large number of qubits to perform multiple calculations in parallel. Neuromorphic chips are modeled after the human brain, which could help computers make decisions based on patterns and associations. Intel has made some advances in quantum computing and neuromorphic chips. But Krzanich’s comments lend more credibility to the company’s push to look at a future beyond today’s computing models. Some short-term answers can resolve the bottlenecks based on Von Neumann model, including Optane, Intel’s new form of super-fast memory and storage. It could unite SSDs and DRAM in systems, cutting one bottleneck. Intel is also embracing silicon photonics, which could resolve throughput issues in data centers. Both technologies have researched for more than a decade and are now practical. The chipmaker has lived off the PC industry for decades but is now looking to grow in markets like data centers, the internet of things, automotive and high-performance computing. The new focus is bringing a gradual change to the way Intel makes chips. It’s similar to the 1970s, when different types of chips like vector processors and floating point arrays were crammed together for complex calculations. For example, Intel is slapping together two separate functional blocks for applications like machine learning and autonomous cars. Intel envisions FPGAs combining with CPUs in autonomous cars. Later this year, the company will release a chip called Lake Crest, which combines a Xeon server CPU with deep-learning chip technology it picked up through its Nervana Systems acquisition. Intel is also merging an FPGA inside an Intel Xeon chip to carry out machine learning tasks. Intel is expecting a lot of data to be generated by sources like autonomous cars, which will need edge processing for tasks like image recognition, analysis, and map updates. Intel is pushing its wide roster of co-processors to the edge, and that is where the quantum and neuromorphic chips may fit. Quantum computer research is also being done by other companies. D-Wave recently released a 2,000-qubit quantum computer based on quantum annealing, while IBM has a 5-bit quantum computer accessible via the cloud. IBM is also playing with brain-like chips and has benchmarked its TrueNorth chip, which has a million neurons and 256 million synapses. Academic institutions like the University of Heidelberg in Germany, Stanford University, and the University of Manchester in the UK are also working on neuromorphic chips. HPE has shown a computer that emulates the human brain, and it intends to adapt ideas from that for servers.         Related News Minister: Iran Ups Cooperation with Foreign Researchers  LATEST STORIES (11) Syrian Army Kicks off Fresh Round of Attacks in Eastern Aleppo to Bring Al-Assad Lake Under Control ISIL Terrorists Killed in Failed Attack on Iraqi Volunteer Forces, West of Mosul Hezbollah Leader Thanks 'Foolish' Trump for Revealing 'Ugly Face of US' Syrian Army Repels Terrorists' Attack on Al-Manshia Neighborhood of Dara'a Syrian Army Destroys Terrorists' Tunnel in Deir Ezzur Bahraini Police Use Tear Gas to Break up Protests Syrians Stuck in Greece Remember Memories of Those They Left Home Assad Tells Belgian Reporter Belgium & EU Merely Obey 'US Master' on Syria Hash Al-Shabi Forces Repel ISIL Attack, Southwest of Tal Afar Protestors Rally Against Donald Trump's Immigration Policies in New York City Construction of Karbala's International Airport Begins Spokesman Deplores US Meddling with Iran's Internal Affairs Revolution Anniversary: Bahrain’s Uprising Is Far from Over Parliament Speaker Renews Iran’s Support for Iraq’s Territorial Integrity Spokesman: Iran Prioritizing Regional Stability, Security Syrian Army Kicks off Fresh Round of Attacks in Eastern Aleppo to Bring Al-Assad Lake Under Control TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian Army troops launched a new round of offensives on ISIL's positions to take control of the al-Assad Lake that is the main source of water supply to Aleppo city.

Twitter Facebook Intel, McAfee dispute heads for settlement talks Security expert John McAfee claims he did not assign rights to his personal name IDG John Ribeiro (IDG News Service) 13 February, 2017 18:34 - - - - print email Comments A dispute between Intel and security expert John McAfee over the use of his name for another company is headed for settlement talks, according to court records. The move comes shortly after the federal court refused John McAfee and MGT Capital Investments, the company to be renamed, a preliminary injunction on Intel’s transfer of marks and related assets containing the word McAfee, as part of a proposed spin-out by the chipmaker of its security business as a separate company that would be called McAfee. The chip company said in September it had signed the agreement with TPG to set up a cybersecurity company in which Intel shareholders would hold 49 percent of the equity with the balance held by the investment firm. The two sides have now informed District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York that they consent to a settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox. MGT announced in May last year it was teaming with John McAfee to set up a security company that would be named “John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc,” and would have him as the CEO and executive chairman. Intel acquired McAfee Inc. in 2011 and uses the McAfee mark for security products, services, and publications for consumers and businesses. It countered in a letter in June that John McAfee does not have the right to use the McAfee name for security related goods and services. The letter prompted John McAfee and MGT to file a suit to seek a judgment that “their use of or reference to the personal name of John McAfee and/or McAfee in their business,” including in the renaming of MGT, does not infringe on Intel’s trademark rights or breach any agreement between the parties. John McAfee claims he entered in 1991 into an agreement with McAfee Associates, a precursor to McAfee Inc., to transfer certain assets to it in exchange for stock and a promissory note. The maverick entrepreneur has argued in court that he had at no point in the agreement assigned rights to his personal name through an assignment of trademark or otherwise, or agreed to restrict his right to do business using his own name. The settlement talks do not necessarily mean that the two sides will come to an agreement. Demand for 3rd Party ERP Support Soars More from Rimini Street Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 12, 2017 at 9:00PM A while back, various leaks showed that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was planning to introduce two waves of processors for its upcoming Purley server platform -- Skylake-EP and EX, and Cannon Lake-EP and EX. Skylake-EP and EX represent all new architectures built using the company's 14-nanometer+ technology, while Cannon Lake-EP and EX were supposed to represent mild architectural enhancements of the Skylake-EP and EX chips, but with the benefit of being built on the company's upcoming 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Intel's Haswell-EP server processor. Image source: Intel. Although I can't make this prediction with 100% certainty, I strongly suspect that based on Intel's most recent disclosures, Cannon Lake-EP and EX are dead. The new "data center first" strategy As I outlined in a previous column, Intel announced that it's making a massive change in its plans in how it builds future server processors. Going forward, beginning with the 10-nanometer++, the company's third-generation 10-nanometer manufacturing technology, server processors will be first to adopt new manufacturing technologies, with personal-computer chips adopting this new manufacturing technologies later. Intel's first 10-nanometer processor will be its Cannon Lake-Y chips targeted at low-power notebooks and 2-in-1 hybrid systems -- this is expected to go into volume manufacturing in the second half of 2017, with sales velocity accelerating in the first half of 2018. I believe that the company will introduce a second generation of chips built on 10-nanometer technology beginning in the second half of 2018, based on its Ice Lake architecture. I also believe this will be manufactured on Intel's second-generation 10-nanometer technology, known as 10-nanometer+. If we assume that Intel aims for annual product refreshes in the personal-computer market, then we should expect to see the company's third-generation 10-nanometer processor family, known as Tiger Lake, in late 2019/early 2020. Tiger Lake would presumably be manufactured in the company's 10-nanometer++ technology. If Intel's data-center group will start shipping product on 10-nanometer++ before its personal-computer chip business does, then we should expect the 10-nanometer++ server processor to launch sometime before late 2019 or early 2020. Let's call it mid-2019 for that processor family, which I believe will be codenamed Ice Lake-EP and EX. In that case, where's the room for Cannon Lake-EP and EX? Intel's Skylake-EP and EX chips are expected to launch in "mid-2017," according to recent company disclosures. If we have the 10-nanometer++ server processor pinned down to a mid-2019 launch, then the only way that the Cannon Lake-EP and EX parts, presumably 10-nanometer-based, would really fit in would be if they were to launch in mid-2018, since a product cycle of under one year in this market is highly unusual. However, over on the AnandTech forums, a user posted a slide that seemingly comes from Dell -- a leading personal-computer and server vendor. A purported Dell system road map. Image source: AnandTech Forums. In the slide, Dell shows that its server and workstation offerings will see upgrades to Skylake-EP and Skylake-W in the second half of 2017. The slide also indicates that those systems will continue to be the company's offerings through the second half of 2018. If Intel were going to release Cannon Lake-EP and EX chips in the middle of 2018, then one would reasonably expect a major server and workstation vendor like Dell to refresh its offerings to utilize those new chips. Will there be a Cannon Lake server processor family at all? I have seen evidence in the LinkedIn profiles of Intel employees that there indeed exist server processors utilizing Intel's Cannon Lake architecture. However, in the descriptions those employees provided, the chips are referred to as "SoCs" -- i.e., system on a chip. I think there's a very good chance we'll see Xeon D products, Intel's high-end server system-on-a-chip line aimed at certain types of less processor-intensive workloads, based on the Cannon Lake architecture in the future. However, I think that Cannon Lake-EP and EX -- the potential successors to the company's workhorse Skylake-EP and EX chips -- were cancelled to allow the superior Ice Lake-EP and EX products to come to market quicker than they would have otherwise.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

In light of the rise of emerging technologies, partners that can add unique layers of value are gaining greater prominence. Whether vertical or technology specific, forward-thinking partners now realise that staying vanilla seldom brings success, as customers place a premium on niche experts. Yet in parallel to the changing role of the partner, new influencers of IT are emerging across the business, with 72 per cent of IT buying decisions now made outside of the IT department. This exclusive ARN roundtable, in association with Telstra, discussed the changing dynamics of the channel in 2017, outlining how partners can specialise in a digital world, while attracting a new breed of buyer.

In a recent set of benchmarks, leaked by WCCFTech, it looks like this CPU is going to pack a serious punch and will not burn a hole in your pocket at the same time. Sysmark and CPUMark numbers test out the 8-core, 16-thread Ryzen 7-1700X, which tells us that this behemoth can easily take on Intel’s Core i7 6900K and 7700K. Ryzen comes with a 3.4GHz base clock and a 3.8GHz boost clock. The CPU is also expected to come with 95W of TDP and a 16MB L3 cache. In single threaded performance, Ryzen 7-1700X comes really close to the Intel Core i7-6900K, which is clocked at 3.20GHz, however, it fails to take over the recently unveiled 4.2GHz Core i7-7700K. Also read: Lenovo Yoga Book: Why I love and hate this ultra-portable When compared to Ryzen 1700X’s predecessor, however- The octa-core FX-8350, the Ryzen 1700X is an impressive 37% faster. Other tests reveal more hidden goodies about the soon-to-be-unveiled processor. We’re seeing a massive architectural improvement with better performance and lower power consumption. In the Integer math test, the Ryzen 7-1700X completely annihilates Intel's top-end Core i7-6900K. Also in this test, AMD Ryzen 7-1700X beats the Intel Core i7-7700K (4-core at 4.20GHz) by a whopping 85 percent. This sounds too good to be true. Even in the encryption test, AMD smashed the Intel Core i7 6900K and 7700K, which have been strong performers for Intel. However, the Ryzen 7-1700X doesn’t outperform the Intel Core i7’s in every test. The Intel processors still pack a hard punch when it comes to physics and prime numbers. You’ll need to take these numbers with a pinch of salt, as these are not the official test results. However, from what we can gauge, it seems like the CPU packing will pack a serious punch. You also cannot ignore the fact that this CPU is going to be priced at $389, according to leaks by WFFCTech. In comparison, a Core i7 6900K is priced at approximately $1000 as of now.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | February 13, 2017 -- 05:29 GMT (21:29 PST) | Topic: Security Intel Today's cybersecurity landscape is in a constant state of evolution. Old malware resurfaces to attack new targets, phishing campaigns plague the enterprise, and ransomware targets our healthcare services. It is a lot to ask for cybersecurity professionals to constantly stay on top of both new and existing threats, but Intel hopes to make the job easier. Last week, Intel Security, formerly known as McAfee, launched the Threat Landscape Dashboard. The platform is a free online resource which allows users to view what the company considers today's most significant threats. Malware and digital threats are ranked based on "the prevalence of attacks that exploit those vulnerabilities," according to Intel Security. The dashboard includes information on threats as a whole, exploit kits, vulnerabilities, campaigns, and ransomware. Relationships between them are also illustrated; for example, how the RIG exploit kit takes advantage of specific vulnerabilities in software to spread different ransomware families. "For the administrators responsible for safeguarding a company's systems, networks, and digital information, keeping up is an overwhelming task, made doubly difficult because it is often hard to determine the most significant threats," the team says. To make life easier, Intel Security has also added a "risk score" for each threat and campaign, alongside a "media score" based on how much attention the press is giving specific threats. At the time of writing, the company has ranked CVE-2016-7200, a Microsoft Edge vulnerability which allows remote attacks to take place, Cerber ransomware, the RIG exploit kit, and the Methbot fraud campaign as among the top 10 threats facing consumers and businesses today. See also: Why did Intel buy McAfee for $7.7 billion? In a blog post announcing the launch, Intel researchers said the dashboard is the result of nine months' work. However, Intel Security plans to further extend the platform with an RSS feed and reference links about threats including the original source, blogs, and whitepapers. 10 steps to erase your digital footprint SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 10 NEXT PREV More security news How to secure your IoT deployment in 10 steps Researchers discover over 170 million exposed IoT devices in major US cities How to handle changing privacy rules around the globe This Android Trojan pretends to be Flash security update but downloads additional malware Do you pass off your security responsibility to others?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 13 February 2017 | MYT 9:30 AM Intel, moving beyond PCs, seeks explosive growth in new technologies by mike rogoway Future-proofing itself: Intel envisions a future enabling self-driving cars, virtual reality and superfast 5G wireless networks. If Intel carries off its overhaul, the chipmaker will have remade its business on the fly and profited from the kind of technological change that has rendered other established companies obsolete. — Reuters Coming off the most eventful year in its history, Intel suggested that its transformation is ongoing and long-term.  With the PC market facing prolonged decline, executives at Intel's annual investor day said the company is depending on explosive growth in new markets or in established industries where it currently has a modest foothold.  The company envisions a future enabling self-driving cars, virtual reality and superfast 5G wireless networks. In pursuit of that goal, Intel pledged to invest billions of dollars in datacentres, artificial intelligence and computer networking.  "We're in a unique position in time where computing, memory and the requirements for large amounts of data are all converging," Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said.  He was back at corporate headquarters in California for the Feb 9 meeting, a day after making a surprise visit to the White House to announce a US$7bil (RM31.11bil) investment to open an idle factory in Arizona.  If Intel carries off its overhaul, the chipmaker will have remade its business on the fly and profited from the kind of technological change that has rendered other established companies obsolete.  "When I look at Intel three years, five years out from now, I do believe the complexion of the company and where they generate their revenue is going to change significantly," said Angelo Zino, equity analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Challenges abound, however, as Intel seeks to reposition itself in markets that haven't yet emerged with technologies it has yet to invent. Intel warned Feb 9 of slow growth and modestly lower profits over the next few years, weighed down by the struggling PC market.  Already, the transition has been painful: Intel eliminated 15,000 jobs in 2016 as it recalibrated in anticipation of the PC market's slide. It moved jobs and spending to new sectors.  And Intel warned Thursday that it will be some time before the fruits of its efforts become apparent. The company said it expects sales growth in the low single-digit percentages in each of the next three years, weighed down by continued declines in the PC market. Intel also said operating profits will be modestly lower.  Investors weren't pleased: Intel shares slid 2.5% Feb 9 to close at US$35.46 (RM157.60).  Intel's current business consists primarily of two segments: PCs, which supply most of its revenue, and datacentres, which deliver half of Intel's operating profits. Intel dominates both markets thanks to its industry leading microprocessors, with succeeding generations of technology crafted by its researchers in Hillsboro.  The PC market has been in decline for years, undermined by new mobile devices and the absence of compelling features to prompt consumers and businesses to upgrade their desktops and laptops.  And though Intel's datacentre business grew 8% last year, the company had been targeting annual growth of 15%. Intel said Feb 9 its long-term forecast is now a little north of 10%.  To compensate for those disappointments, Intel said Thursday it expects a huge boost in other markets: wireless technologies, computer memory and the emerging class of connected appliances and equipment called the Internet of Things.  Those businesses represented less than 5% of Intel's revenues last year. By 2021, though, the company envisions their share of its potential market doubling, tripling or quadrupling.  It may be unrealistic to expect those new segments to make up that large a share of Intel's business, Zino said.  "Even if you see that double-digit growth pace, it's probably not going to be big enough given the sheer size of Intel that it's going to move the needle," he said.  However, Zino said that even with the more modest growth and profit forecasts Intel issued Feb 9, the company's datacentre business is robust and has huge growth potential and by itself could fill the void created by the fading PC market.  Indeed, Intel said that it will start putting the first chips from each new generation of processor technology in datacentre products. Historically, PCs had been first to get Intel's new chips.  "This is a company that is going to be heavily driven and dominated by the datacentre business," Zino said.  At Thursday's meeting, investment analysts pressed Intel on its spending plans and declining profit margins. Krzanich, the CEO, said investors should cheer the company's investments.  Intel spends US$10bil (RM44.44bil) or more each year to upgrade factories in Oregon and elsewhere that give the company its lead in computer chip technology. With the PC market ebbing, Krzanich said Intel needs to find new areas where it can capitalize on its enormous investments.  "The minute you stop growing," Krzanich said, "you're basically saying over time the likelihood you'll run out of the ability to afford those factories and then that leadership will slowly diminish." — The Oregonian/Tribune News Service Related Stories You May Be Interested Gartner: Spend your limited IT budget wisely China’s Huawei, Philippine telco join forces in 5G deal Taiwan’s HTC posts seventh consecutive quarterly loss One bot to rule them all?

Ten Exciting Features Of The Linux 4.10 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 12 February 2017 at 09:18 PM EST. 22 Comments The Linux 4.10 kernel didn't end up being released today, but was pushed back by an extra week. However, in looking forward to next weekend, here are ten of the features that excite us about Linux 4.10. See The New Features & Exciting Changes Of The Linux 4.10 Kernel for our complete and original look at the new features and changes to Linux 4.10. But for those short on time, here are ten features that get us cheering for Linux 4.10: 1. Nouveau Boost support. The open-source NVIDIA DRM driver has initial support for allowing supported graphics cards to hit their "boost" clock frequencies for achieving higher performance. The re-clocking is still done manually and static, while at least now booting the system with the NvBoost option can allow achieving higher clock speeds. This boost support delivers noticeable performance gains as shown by our own benchmarks. 2. Initial mainline Intel GVT support. Intel developers have spent years working on Xen/KVM Graphics Virtualization Technology for allowing guest VMs to use their native OS Intel drivers for accessing the underlying Intel graphics hardware of the host. With Linux 4.10 this initial support is in place, but will continue to be refined over the coming kernel cycles. 3. More AMD Zen/Ryzen enablement. Through various pull requests there's been efforts for getting the AMD Ryzen processor support squared away in the mainline Linux kernel. Stay tuned for my AMD Ryzen Linux benchmarks in the weeks ahead. 4. On the Intel side, there is Turbo Boost Max 3.0 support. TBM3 is supported by Broadwell-E CPUs and future processors for being able to boost to even higher frequencies for single-threaded workloads. The Linux 4.10 kernel finally has a Turbo Boost Max 3.0 driver although it's going to be made better in a later kernel release. 5. EXT4 DAX iomap support and XFS iomap support. This makes the DAX I/O code-paths utilize the iomap framework rather than their older code-path, which then allows for more efficient block mapping, PMD page fault support, minor bug fixes, and improvements. DAX is the direct access support in the Linux kernel for file-systems to have more efficient, direct read/write access to persistent memory storage devices. 6. Better support for the Microsoft Surface 3/4 devices. 7. More ARM platform support including the Snapdragon 808/810, Huawei Nexus 6P, LG Nexus 5X, Pine64, Droid 4, and others. There is also early work on the NVIDIA Tegra P1 / Parker. 8. Improved Raspberry Pi 3 support. The Raspberry Pi VC4 DRM driver also picked up new features for bettering its open-source graphics stack. 9. ATA Command Priority support. The priority modes include normal priority, isochronous deadline-dependent priority, and a high priority. The high priority mode signifies that there should be an "attempt to provide better quality of service for the command. The device should complete high priority requests in a more timely fashion than normal and isochronous requests." 10. While the GCN 1.0/1.1 (SI/CIK) hardware support is still experimental / disabled-by-default for the AMDGPU driver, there have been various Radeon Southern Islands and Sea Islands improvements this cycle. There have also been more AMDGPU improvements around PowerPlay / power management. 22 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

 2 trades that could benefit from Trump David Galland, Garret/Galland Research Feb. 14, 2017, 4:36 PM 808 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump sits during a meeting with Chief Executive Officer of Intel Brian Krzanich in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts There are aspects to Trump’s public comments that concern me. He says stuff that makes me sit up and take notice, especially on the military front. Yet, rather than blindly accepting the “news” that best supports my biases, I try to view each new Trump “event” objectively. By contrast, the progressives/liberals unfailingly fall for every bit of click-bait that reinforces their view that Trump is a detestable, woman-hating, earth killer and the epitome of a capitalist pig. On the other side of the philosophical wall, there are an almost equal number of people who view Trump as a Knight Exemplar, come to smite the corrupt politicos and smash down the self-loathing, politically correct, climate-alarmist, and meddling-big-government, perfect-world socialists that have all but destroyed the American dream. The extreme distance between the two perspectives creates a tradeable opportunity. Actually, a series of tradeable opportunities, which I cover below. (For more trading ideas, subscribe to my free investment newsletter, The Passing Parade.) This is especially true because of the extraordinary media bias that takes every small thing Trump does or says and blows it way out of proportion. Any investor worth the moniker knows markets operate largely on emotion. And that gives rise to the Trump Trade. What Most People Are Missing… and How to Profit from It A more nuanced view of Trump’s various strong words has to take into account his deep experience negotiating hundred-million-dollar deals in the hardball world of New York and New Jersey real estate. We’re talking about sitting across the table from dozens of the world’s highest-paid lawyers and hammering out deals that mollify not just the sellers of the prime real estate, but also the zoning boards, unions, owners of neighboring properties, etc. Succeeding in that world requires a level of focus, determination, and skill that is impossible for the average person to even imagine. It is as hardball as it comes. Anywhere. Now ask yourself, how would someone with Trump’s negotiating credentials approach a counterparty ahead of a negotiation? Would they signal in advance what they wanted and all that they were willing to give up in order to get what they were after? Or would they come in hard with outsized threats and posturing, setting the stage to ultimately prevail on the points that count? Case in point, Trump has made much of the idea that he’ll make Mexico pay for a wall between the two countries. Among the many rejoinders to the idea, former Mexican President Fox said, “I’m not going to pay for that f#&#ing wall!” And so, thanks to Trump’s posturing, the negotiations began with arguing about who is going to pay for the wall—not even the wall itself. Getting the opposition to negotiate at the top of the range you set, in order to eventually settle for what you actually want, is Negotiation 101. And Trump is way, way past Negotiation 101. Viewed through that particular lens—and I think I am at least directionally correct, as Trump would be hard pressed to forget all he has learned about negotiating just because he’s been elected president—we can expect his administration to be something of a rollercoaster ride. That’s because he has a big agenda. And he has a lot of opposition to cut through in order to accomplish that agenda. As such, I suspect hardly a week will go by without Trump saying or doing something—loudly—that seems outrageous, ill-advised, or bullying. And the media, as set against Trump as they are, can predictably be expected to scream as loud as they can about his latest outrage and all the dire consequences. Viewed from the negotiator’s perspective, they are playing right into his hands. Likewise, we need to look past the posturing and try to ascertain what Trump’s end goals are. What does Trump want accomplished in each of these situations?  In most cases, he’ll be trying to deliver on his “America First” promise. That was by far the most prominent plank in his platform and in his inauguration speech. To get it done, he’ll need to improve the competitiveness of American business by cutting taxes, slashing regulations, and directly negotiating more equitable trade agreements with important trading partners. In Trump’s view, he is America’s negotiator-in-chief. It’s in his blood. It’s what he does best. Therefore, you can choose to get hung up on the optics, or you can take advantage of the situation by taking stock of whatever his next target may be and trading against all the easily frightened sheeple. To make the point, let’s return to the situation with Mexico. Trade Idea #1: Mexico The chart here shows the six-month performance of the Mexican Bolsa, their stock market. Garret/Galland Since the election, the Bolsa has traded like a yo-yo, based entirely on Trump’s pre-negotiation rhetoric and the biased media’s reaction to it. On this particular trade, which will likely be a buy of Mexican stocks, I’m going to watch things a bit more closely before taking a position. The real money will be made by waiting until it seems Mexico and the US are on the verge of a total breakdown in trade. In fact, what will really be happening is Trump wearing the Mexican politicians down to ensure he gets exactly what he wants. And make no mistake, the US will come out on top. That’s because over 81% of all Mexican exports—about $310 billion worth—go to the US. Mexico’s second-largest trading partner is Canada at a miserly $10.5 billion. There are a number of ways to play volatility in the Mexican market. You can concentrate your investments in specific Mexican exporting companies who trade as ADRs on US exchanges. But for most investors, the best approach is likely buying a large and liquid diversified ETF such as the iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (EWW). Trade Idea #2: Pounding on Pharma Another recent example of the Trump Trade can be seen in the pharmaceutical sector. That Trump would take on the sector is understandable; his most ardent supporters skew toward the 50+ age demographics. These are the people most affected by the skyrocketing insurance costs triggered by Obamacare and by the indefensibly high cost of certain drugs required for the patient to live a normal life. A friend of mine is currently spending over $2,000 a month for a single drug, so I understand the angst on a personal level. During his campaign, Trump promised to bring those drug costs down, and now he is ramping up the negotiations to do just that. Here’s a three-month chart of the price action in PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals (PJP), one of the more popular pharmaceutical ETFs. Garret/Galland Like the Mexican stock market, you can see a sell-off after Trump won, and the subsequent gyrations as Trump began to use the bully pulpit of his presidency to set the stage for negotiating with the drug industry. The recent spike in the index came after Trump sat down with key industry executives and offered to trade them a big reduction in regulation if they play ball with him on the pricing. That’s what’s called a win-win in the business world. Trump gets what he’s after (or at least there’s a good chance he does), and the drug companies get relief from the time and money regulatory regime that is the bane of their business. When the Media Sells, We’ll Buy Given Trump’s background, you can expect the president to go in hard every single time. And the media will inadvertently help him by whipping certain members of the public—including the investment community—into a frenzy of action. When they sell, we’ll be looking to buy. And when they buy, we’ll be looking to sell. In the end, successful investment speculation—and make no mistake, this is speculation—requires volatility. If nothing else, Trump is volatile. Or is happy to seem that way if, in the end, it gets him what he wants.

Sen. Roy Blunt indicated Flynn will “likely” be called to testify before the committee, according to Chad Pergram of Fox News. Flynn admitted to “inadvertently” briefing Vice President Mike Pence and others with “incomplete information” regarding his phone calls with the Russian ambassador in his resignation letter Monday. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s trust in Flynn had been “eroded” and that he asked for the former general’s resignation. Flynn is suspected of discussing U.S. sanctions on Russia with Russian Amb. Sergey Kislyak before Trump’s inauguration. Such conversations could be illegal under what is known as the Logan Act, which forbids private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments on “disputes or controversies” without proper U.S authority. “There are potential criminal violations here,” said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday. “There are potential criminal violations here,” Sen. Chuck Schumer says of Michael Flynn: https://t.co/Okz2bwUl4f pic.twitter.com/QaMCqUy1UP — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 14, 2017 Flynn’s ties to Russia have been an ongoing question since Trump first announced him as his pick for the national security adviser post. The former general is known to have a friendly stance toward Russia, especially compared to other administration officials like Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Flynn traveled to Russia in 2015 to give a paid talk before a gala in honor of Russia Today (RT), a Kremlin-funded television network. The transcripts of the phone calls between Flynn and Kislyak have yet to be released to the public. Follow Russ Read on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

When the CEO of Intel appeared at the White House to announce a revived effort to build a factory in Chandler, he talked about the need for more favorable tax policies under the Trump administration. The company also stands to get a big tax break at the state level under a legislation introduced in Arizona that was designed for big manufacturing corporations like Intel. Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File AP Photo Arizona state Rep. Jeff Weninger, R-Chandler, laughs after rushing to his desk to vote on a bill at the Capitol in Phoenix on Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017. Weninger is proposing a new way for big manufacturing companies like chip-maker Intel to use millions of dollars of tax credits they have on the books but are unable to use. Bob Christie AP Photo 1 of 2 i By BOB CHRISTIE Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story PHOENIX When Intel's CEO appeared at the White House last week to announce a revived effort to build a new factory in Chandler, he talked about the need for more favorable tax policies under the Trump administration. The company also stands to get a big tax break at the state level under legislation introduced in Arizona designed to help big manufacturers like Intel. Manufacturers are sitting on tens of millions of dollars in state income tax credits they can't use because previous cuts in Arizona corporate income taxes favoring them leave them owing no tax here. The legislation by Rep. Jeff Weninger, R-Chandler, would allow them to use those credits in other ways by getting cash refunds or money to offset sales-tax expenses when they invest in new facilities. Manufacturers would they only get half their credits back, the program is capped $10 million per year, and companies must agree to remain in Arizona for five years. The proposal in House Bill 2492 is set for a committee hearing Wednesday. It also contains three other major incentives for big manufacturers like Intel, Raytheon, Honeywell and Boeing. Weninger said the effort is needed to boost the state's competitiveness. He noted increased competition from other states and nations and the need to work to attract and retain high-paying manufacturing jobs. "We have to do whatever we can to remain very, very competitive with those other people," Weninger said in an interview Friday. The proposal was introduced just days before Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced during a meeting with President Donald Trump last week that the company would invest $7 billion to complete a computer chip plant in Chandler. The plant has been vacant since it was built several years ago. The announcement echoed one Intel made in 2011 with former President Barack Obama that never came to fruition. The plant is expected to be completed in three to four years and directly employ about 3,000 new workers. The CEO indicated that the company was counting on a tax break under the new administration. "It's really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to be manufacturing in the U.S," he said. Weninger said his proposal isn't linked to Intel's announcement and had been in the works for months during talks with big manufacturing companies, including Raytheon, Boeing, Intel and Honeywell. "This is something that's been going on for a long time, these companies all working together, all trying to figure out something where we can make Arizona more and more competitive," he said. But others believe Intel surely will be a major and early beneficiary. "I don't think there's any doubt about that," said Kevin McCarthy, president of the Arizona Tax Research Association. "They've got all the national news surrounding their expansion. There's probably some link there." Three other incentives that would help Intel are wrapped into Weninger's proposal. One is a new jobs=creation program giving big companies about $3 million a year in tax rebates. The second creates a new sales tax exemption for supplies needed in manufacturing clean rooms, while a third lowers property taxes on new equipment already taxed at an ultra-low rate in special trade zones like the one Intel occupies in Chandler. That and other provisions of the proposal trouble McCarthy, whose association generally opposes tax policies that single out classes of taxpayers because others have to pick up the tab. "We have concerns about the breadth of this," he said. "We definitely have concerns about the expansion of accelerated depreciation to Class 6 property. That much I know for sure, because (trade-zone) property applies to well more than the manufacturers who I know are advocating this."

Organizations are spending more of their budgets to support growing business initiatives. Gartner recently said that this would be a defining year for cloud as private cloud begins to give way to hybrid cloud, and nearly half of large enterprises will have hybrid cloud deployments by the end of 2017. In fact, Gartner describes cloud computing as a style of computing in which scalable and elastic IT-enabled capabilities are delivered “as a service” using internet technologies. It heralds an evolution of business in positive and negative ways. It has also become a hot industry term that has been used in many contradictory ways. Converged infrastructure is helping business look at the modern data center from a different perspective. We’re now creating better systems capable of multi-tenancy and better resource controls. According to Gartner, organizations typically have multiple goals for big data initiatives, including improving the customer experience, streamlining processes, lowering costs and marketing more effectively. The research firm’s survey showed that organizations are overwhelmingly targeting enhanced customer experience as the primary goal of big data projects (64 percent). Forty seven percent have their eyes on process efficiency and more targeted marketing. And a significant number are paying attention to enhancing security capabilities – 23 percent. “As big data becomes the new normal, information and analytics leaders are shifting focus from hype to finding value,” said Lisa Kart, research director at Gartner. “While the perennial challenge of understanding value remains, the practical challenges of skills, governance, funding and return on investment (ROI) come to the fore.” When we examined the results of a recent Data Center Industry Trends survey sponsored by Dell EMC and Intel, we learned that 50% of respondents leverage SaaS-delivered and cloud-based applications. A further 40% are aiming to support new, cloud-ready, applications and workloads. Here’s the interesting part – when asked how prepared they were for these new cloud initiatives, nearly 30% said that they are either not very prepared or not prepared at all for cloud. When you look at this kind of converged infrastructure environment, it’s important to see how a data center is also a gateway into the cloud. Converged infrastructure actually helps create a direct tie into a cloud architecture. Converged Infrastructure Enables Architectural Efficiency. We’re supporting greater numbers of users and workloads, all under the same IT architecture. Converged infrastructure (CI) not only supports more users, it also gives them a better experience. From the administrative perspective, you have your critical resources all under one management plane. Most of all – direct integration with the hypervisor allows you to literally create a bridge into the cloud. On premise converged infrastructure solutions can scale into the cloud or even other private data center solutions. The point is that you have the architectural freedom to design your environment around the growing needs of your business. CI – Helping you Innovate at the Pace of Software. Converged infrastructure is all about hardware and software intelligence. Now, you’re creating powerful profiles capable of dynamically provisioning and de-provisioning critical resources. Basically, converged infrastructure help you create cloud consumption models. Alerts, thresholds, specific policies, and even hypervisor-level controls – all enable easier management of a complex ecosystem. Through convergence, you can rapidly deploy new business units, test out new pieces of technology, and push workloads into the cloud directly from the management layer. This allows for the greatest amount of flexibility around the logical layer and the physical layer it supports. Enabling Systems Ready for Big Data. Virtual applications, desktops, big data, databases, virtual workloads, and a number of other types of solutions can be hosted on a CI platform. You can do things like graphics optimization, big data workload control, and even integrate with cloud systems. The beauty of CI revolves around its flexibility. In the past, heavy workloads (like data analytics) needed their own specific resources to function properly. Now, CI creates a platform where workloads like big data processing, and even virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) can live on the same ecosystem; all managed from one environment. Creating Extensions into Cloud. Modern converged infrastructure solutions now act as the foundation for hybrid cloud systems. Direct integration with virtualization and cloud environments allows administrators to create an intelligent bridge into the cloud. You can integrate with VMware vRealize cloud automation solutions for automation, and even extend into an OpenStack cloud management ecosystem. The important part is that it’s all under one converged platform – with intelligent management built in.  There are powerful integrations with virtualization systems as well as cloud infrastructures. This means that CI acts as a direct bridge into a variety of new types of workloads. This includes big data, hybrid cloud, virtualization, and much more. With greater levels of efficiency, density, and workload optimization, converged infrastructure aims to take on modern business challenges with truly smart IT solutions.   Previous Article Microsoft's Brad Smith: We Need a "Digital Geneva Convention" Next Article Zero One: Cybersecurity, a Business Challenge Tweet Get Daily Email News from DCK!Subscribe now and get our special report, "The World's Most Unique Data Centers."

Credit: Intel More like this HP plans to continue with Itanium in servers for HP-UX customers Intel's new Xeon server chip pushes Itanium closer to end HPE's Itanium server refresh should come in mid-2017 Video Mingis on Tech: Floating solar panels, a VR update -- and Tom Brady? Intel's Itanium chip is hanging by a thread, and after more than three years, the company is shipping the next and possibly final version of the processor, which is code-named Kittson. The chip is shipping to test customers, and volume shipments will commence later this year, a company spokesman said. Itanium chips have been used in mainframes and mission-critical servers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will ship servers with Kittson later this year. Itanium has been dying a slow and painful death, and Kittson will likely be the end of the line. Support for the chip has been dwindling, and software development has stalled. Intel may be happy to see Itanium sink as it looks to drop irrelevant products in its pursuit of profitable markets. Intel has been openly lobbying customers to switch from Itanium to x86-based Xeon chips, which has a server chip market share of more than 90 percent. Itanium is in maintenance mode, and "you won't see much more going forward," said Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. Intel developed Itanium in conjunction HP, and the first chip was released in 2001. The goal of the superfast chip was to replace older mainframe architectures like SPARC and to compete with IBM's Power. Intel considered Itanium the architecture of choice for future high-performance chips, but the Itanium chips flopped and couldn't outrun SPARC or Power. Itanium's biggest enemy was Intel's own Xeon chip, which became successful with mass adoption in fast-growing, low-end and mid-range server markets. Intel then put more resources into developing Xeon. Itanium has been in the news for the wrong reasons. The chip's slow death gained attention when Oracle decided to stop writing software for the architecture in 2011, after it determined the chip "was nearing the end of its life." Microsoft also pulled the plug on Itanium software development. Intel hasn't provided an Itanium roadmap ahead of Kittson. The new chip succeeds the older Itanium 9500 series code-named Poulson, which started shipping in the fourth quarter of 2012. The only big vendor still installing Itanium in servers is HPE, which puts the chip in mission-critical Integrity servers. HPE has reassured customers that it is committed to supporting Itanium until 2025, but the company is also successfully convincing customers to switch over to Xeon chips. HPE will release servers based on the new Itanium chips later this year, a spokeswoman for the company said in an email. "We are refreshing our HPE Integrity Servers with HP-UX to take advantage of Kittson in the second half of 2017," the spokeswoman said. HPE has kept Itanium support active until 2025 mainly due to long-term customer commitments. Many Itanium customers are government agencies, which sign long-term deals with vendors to supply and support servers. In addition to Unix-based HP-UX, the Integrity servers run on Linux and OpenVMS. OpenVMS will get Kittson support in the fourth quarter, according to a recently updated OS product roadmap on the website of VMS Software, which is leading the software development. Many customers may skip Kittson and jump to x86, but that could be an expensive proposition, McGregor said. The process involves porting legacy code over to new systems based on x86, and that process could take years. Some Itanium users -- especially financial organizations who rely on the rock-solid servers for transactions -- may not be willing to take the risk. "Sooner or later these guys have to convert to something else," McGregor said. HPE and Dell are offering services to port code over from mainframe systems to newer x86 servers, but the process is complicated and requires a lot of testing to ensure the code is stable.

Jason Chaffetz Reuters More On: michael flynn Republicans call for probe of Russian ties to Trump campaign Dan Rather warns Flynn scandal may be the next Watergate Flynn's fall should have the intel community in the hot seat Flynn's replacement plans housecleaning and other notable comments The Republican leader of the House Oversight Committee said Tuesday his panel won’t investigate the circumstances surrounding Michael Flynn’s resignation as national security adviser. “I think the situation has taken care of itself. I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue,” Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said, adding, “I think he did the right thing stepping down.” The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), said he’s more interested in looking into the leaks coming from the White House than probing what caused Flynn to step down over his contact with the Russian ambassador. Nunes said any communication between President Trump and Flynn is protected by “executive privilege.” But a Republican member of the Senate panel said an “exhaustive” investigation is needed to understand the relationship between the president and Russian officials. “I think everybody needs that investigation to happen,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) told St. Louis radio station KTRS. “And the Senate Intelligence Committee, again that I serve on, has been given the principal responsibility to look into this, and I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned, and shouldn’t reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions.” House Speaker Paul Ryan applauded Trump for seeking Flynn’s resignation but wouldn’t back an investigation into what the White House knew about Flynn’s contact with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “I think the president made the right decision to ask for his resignation … I’ll leave it up to the administration to describe the circumstances,” Ryan said at a Tuesday press briefing. Meanwhile, House Democrats are pressuring the Trump administration to hold a classified briefing to explain in detail why Flynn resigned. “We are communicating this request to the Department of Justice and FBI this evening,” Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and John Conyers (D-Mich.) wrote after Flynn announced his departure late Monday. The lawmakers said they were “shocked and dismayed” that the White House had been informed that Flynn misled the Trump administration about his contacts with Kislyak but “did nothing about it.” “Neither to clarify the truth to the American public or to stop General Flynn from being an ongoing national security concern,” they said in the statement. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) said “deeply troubling questions” remain. “The American people deserve to know at whose direction Gen. Flynn was acting when he made these calls and why the White House waited until these reports were public to take action,” said Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. Michael FlynnGetty Images He was referring to reports that then acting-Attorney General Sally Yates warned the White House that Flynn was misleading them on his contacts with Kislyak and feared he could be blackmailed by the Russians. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called out the Trump administration on Tuesday, saying Flynn’s resignation shines light on the “dysfunction” of the nation’s security operations and raises questions on the president’s relationship with Moscow. “Including statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies, and attempted interference in American elections,” McCain said. The Republican appeared to be referencing comments Trump made in an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly before the Super Bowl. O’Reilly pressed Trump on Russian President Vladimir Putin being a killer. “There are a lot of killers. You think our country’s so innocent,” Trump responded. SEE ALSO DOJ warned White House that Flynn could be vulnerable to Russian blackmail: report 0:0 The Justice Department reportedly warned The White House that national... In a statement, McCain thanked Flynn for his “many years of distinguished service to our country” and wished him “the very best in his future endeavors.” “As our nation confronts the most complex and diverse array of global challenges since the end of World War II, it is imperative that the president select a new national security adviser who is empowered by clear lines of authority and responsibility and possesses the skills and experience necessary to organize the national security system across our government.” McCain on Tuesday also called for American policy toward Russia to be made “clear and unequivocal.” Filed under congress ,  house oversight committee ,  michael flynn ,  national security Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Trump crashed wedding just after dealing with North Korea Read Next Trump crashed wedding just after dealing with North Korea Share Selection Trending Now in News 45,498 Details emerge of Melania's misery as first lady 12,112 My life sucks since winning the lottery 11,160 Colbert beating Fallon in ratings since Trump took office Now On Ruth Negga on auditioning for ‘Loving’ Tavi Gevinson is working on a new book Frank Pellegrino’s Friars Club memorial included surreal tribute SEE ALL Now On The Boundary-Pushing Sex Scenes of Lena Dunham SEE ALL Most Popular This Week How Obama is scheming to sabotage Trump's presidency Clinton reminds us why we're lucky she lost the election Surgeon jumps from bridge after divorce from TV personality wife $325K wedding nixed after brawl erupts at rehearsal dinner, suit...

After #FlynnResignation, @FBI must accelerate its investigation of the Trump Administration's Russian connection. https://t.co/DB9bqD3kju pic.twitter.com/UMe7bHsInx — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 14, 2017 Despite the outrage, Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Chair of the House Oversight Committee, confirmed earlier today that his panel won't investigate the circumstances that led to Michael Flynn stepping down Monday as President Trump's national security adviser.  Instead, Chaffetz deferred to the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating Russia's attempt to influence the presidential elections, a scope that includes campaign communications with the Russian government.  Per The Hill: *"I think that situation has taken care of itself.* I know that the Intel committee is looking into the hacking issue." *"I think he did the right thing stepping down."* *"It really is the purview of the Intel Committee. They really are the only ones that can look at that type of information, particularly when you’re talking about interactions with a nation state like that.* It’s not something the Oversight Committee can actually look at because sources and methods are the exclusive purview of the Intel Committee." Of course the "Swarm Of Angry Protesters" that took over a Chaffetz town hall meeting last week in Utah, amid chants of "Do Your Job", will likely not be very happy with his decision. Meanwhile, Chaffetz's assertion that the "situation had taken care of itself" didn't stop the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Elijah Cummings, from demanding a *"full classified briefing"* to determine *"who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national secruity."* Rep. Elijah Cummings (Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, called for a full classified briefing about the circumstances leading to Flynn's departure from all the relevant agencies. "Now, we in Congress need to know who authorized his actions, permitted them, and continued to let him have access to our most sensitive national security information despite knowing these risks. *We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security,"* Cummings said in a joint statement with Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Of course, there's only one logical conclusion to be drawn from all of this, namely that Jason Chaffetz is most likely a Russian spy and should be thoroughly investigated immediately... » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Wochit Headline News - 1 day ago< > Embed Is Trump Breaching Security Protocols? 00:47 The chairman of the House Oversight Committee sent questions to Trump’s chief of staff after photos spread on social media of the president working in the club’s restaurant.

Flynn stepped down from his post late Monday evening after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about a call he had with the Russian ambassador discussing the country’s sanctions. Chaffetz said he believes Flynn was right to resign, adding an investigation would just be under the jurisdiction of the House Intelligence Committee. “I think that situation has taken care of itself, I know that the Intel Committee was looking into the hacking issue previously, so I think he did the right thing by stepping down,” he told reporters. “When we get into sources and methods it really is the purview of the Intel Committee — they are the only ones that can look at that kind of information, particularly when you are look at the interactions with a nation-state like that.” GOP Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, a chairman of the moderate Tuesday Group, said he would like to see more information on the topic before determining if an independent investigation is necessary. “I’d like to find out what the facts are, I don’t know the facts — all I know is what I’ve read in the media,” he told reporters. “I’ll have the opportunity to see the vice president today and I’ll raise the issue with him.” House Speaker Paul Ryan, a self-proclaimed Russia hawk, said the Trump administration is not the first to try to repair relations with Russia, praising the president for his call for Flynn to resign. Ryan echoed Dent in saying he thinks it’s premature to determine whether an independent probe is needed. “I think the administration will explain the circumstances that led to this and the Intelligence Committee has been looking into this thing all along, by the way, just in respect to Russia,” he told reporters. ” I think that it’s really important that as soon as they realized they were being misled by the national security advisers they asked for his resignation — I can’t speak to the rest of the circumstances. I think we need to get all of that information before we prejudge anything.” Dent said he would like to see the administration’s policies on Russia veer to where the United States has stood on the issue in the past. “I hope with his departure we will move to a more traditional policy on Russia, the one that has been embraced by both parties over the last several years — since the second World War,” he said.

Measuring only 0.70 inches thin, it weighs a little more than four pounds and is housed in a unibody CNC aluminum chassis.   A Full HD panel comes standard on the new Razer Blade, while a new 4K UHD touchscreen option will be available for the first time on Razer's 14-inch model. Razer Blade users can enjoy extraordinarily clear visuals and intense frame rates in games with the Full HD display, or step up to the clarity of 4K for ultimate picture quality and the convenience of a touchscreen interface.   "The Razer Blade sets the benchmark for performance in thin laptops," says Min-Liang Tan, Razer co-founder and CEO.   "More users embraced this flagship computer model in 2016 than ever before, and we are excited to make it even more available worldwide this year.

The 14” gaming notebook uses the same 17.8 mm-thick chassis introduced last year and has the same I/O capabilities, but some minor differences in weight. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the entry-level Razer Blade now costs $100 less than it used to last year, but at the expense of a lower-resolution display. The new Razer Blade is based on the Intel Core i7-7700HQ (4C/8T, 2.8/3.8 GHz, 6 MB, 45 W) processor as well as the HM175 PCH (so, the same motherboard as before). The new chip is powered by the Kaby Lake microarchitecture, has higher frequencies compared to its predecessor that was used in last year’s Blades (Core i7-6700HQ) and supports Speed Shift v2 technology as well as other improvements. Along with the Kaby Lake CPU, the new Blade also got 16 GB of faster DDR4-2400 memory (soldered to the mainboard). In addition to 256 GB and 512 GB M.2 (NVMe/PCIe) SSDs, Razer now also offers a 1 TB PCIe drive as an option. When it comes to graphics, the new Blade uses NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 1060 with 6 GB of GDDR5 memory and an HDMI 2.0b output, just like the predecessor introduced last fall. Apart from the CPU and DRAM upgrades, Razer changed display options for the latest breed of Blade laptops. Last year the company only offered its Blades with touch-enabled IGZO LCDs featuring 3200×1800 resolution, and a matte 1920x1080 on the entry level. This year the higher-end Blade machines will feature touch-enabled UHD displays (3840×2160). Usage of the lower-resolution panel allowed Razer to reduce the price of the entry-level Blade to $1899 (or by $100), but at present we do not know how much the 4K SKUs is going to cost. In any case, systems featuring FHD panels will be slightly lighter and will have a longer battery life than models with UHD monitors. We haven't heard back from Razer on if the new UHD display continues to be a Sharp IGZO panel or not. Apart from displays, different Blade systems will look and feel exactly the same: both use a solid CNC-milled aluminum chassis with a matte black finish.

In a bid to appeal to those who care about security, there is a TPM 2.0 security chip installed. The new Razer Blade notebooks with FHD screens are available now in North America and Europe starting from US$1,899/C$2,749/€2.149/£1.799. The laptops with 4K UHD panels will be available in Q2 and Razer does not have pricing available at the moment, but expect it to be similarly priced to the outgoing QHD+ model.

POST A COMMENT 38 Comments View All Comments Infy2 - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link For $2000 I would expect nothing less than GTX 1080. Reply cyrusfox - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link but the TDP of the mobile 1060 is only 80 watts, for the 1080 it is 150 watts. You wouldn't have as pretty a package or as light/small form of a laptop with the 1080. This laptop is plenty capable, if you need more oomph, you either have to trade out aesthetics or save that for desktop use. Reply Inteli - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link Cooling a 1080 in this sized chassis would be very interesting. Reply Mathieu Bourgie - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link As previously mentioned, it isn't realistic to expect a 150W GTX 1080 in a 14" chassis. There are already very few 15.6" laptop with a GTX 1080, due to the challenge of cooling. Also, there's no laptop with a GTX 1080 available for $2000. The least expensive that I could find start at $2100 and most are $2400+. And those don't come with an aluminum unibody or RGB keyboard. The Razer Blade Pro (17" variant with GTX 1080) starts at $3700... Reply Morawka - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link unibody.. funny.. half the razer blade is plastic on the bottom Reply SpartanJet - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link Do you even own one? I can tell you its an aluminum uni-body, no plastic at all. Reply vincentlaw - Wednesday, February 15, 2017 - link It is most definitely not plastic on the bottom. It's very similar to the older unibody macbooks. Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link some crazy people made a single slot desktop 1070, that fan could theoretically be shoved into a thin gaming laptop. OTOH at full load I suspect it sounds like a fully loaded B52 using afterburners on takeoff. Reply ckbryant - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link B-52 isn't an afterburner capable jet engine. It would do no good for a sub-sonic plane to have afterburners Reply ckbryant - Tuesday, February 14, 2017 - link It does have a water inject feature to use water to increase spool speed for rapid takeoff but thats banned at most airports and etc...due to noise Reply 1 2 3 4 ▶ PIPELINE STORIES + Submit News EVGA's New iCX Range: NVIDIA GPUs with More Control for Cooling Toshiba Announces MN-Series HDDs: Up to 8 TB NVIDIA Releases 378.66 WHQL Driver: Game Ready, More Ansel, With 10 and 12-bit video Razer Blade Gets Core i7-7700HQ, Adds 4K Touchscreen, 1 TB SSD Options AMD Releases Radeon Software Crimson ReLive Edition 17.2.1 Intel Announces the Xeon E7-8894 v4 CPU: 24 Cores at 2.4 GHz for $8898 Qualcomm Announces 802.11ax Access Point and Client Solutions NVIDIA Releases Android 7.0 Update for SHIELD Tablet Eurocom Launches a 780 W External PSU for Laptops GlobalFoundries to Expand Capacities, Build a Fab in China NVIDIA Reports Q4 2017 And Fiscal 2017 Results: Record Revenue Intel Confirms 8th Gen Core on 14nm, Data Center First to New Nodes TWEETS IanCutress: Internet seems to be back - 20 minutes of big WTF.

The morning after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned amid a firestorm of controversy over his dealings with Russia, the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee stated that he won’t be probing President Donald Trump over his discussions with Flynn. However, he is interested in looking at something else — leaks to the press. According to CNN’s Manu Raju, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) spoke to reporters this morning on Capitol Hill and cited executive privilege as covering Trump regarding his conversations with his NSA. At the same time, Nunes said that he is “very concerned with the leaks” surrounding Flynn’s calls with the Russian ambassador and that it’s something he “wants to look into.” Nunes’ comments seem to reflect those made by the president this morning, via Twitter. The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017 The scandal involving Flynn over his communications with Russia blew up following a well-sourced report by the Washington Post  Thursday evening revealing that Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador prior to Trump’s inauguration. This was followed by another report last night indicating that former acting Attorney General Sally Yates informed the Trump administration that Flynn was susceptible to blackmail from Russia.

Here's the deal. Pictured here is the MacBook Pro unveiled in October 2016.  ( Stephen Lam | Getty Images ) Advertisement Apple may be preparing new motherboard configurations with Intel's Kaby Lake processors for the next-generation MacBook Pro models set to launch this year. Less than four months since the launch of Apple's much-touted MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, the rumor mill is again churning in anticipation of the next MacBook models. The company's latest macOS 10.12.4 public beta holds precious hints in this regard, referencing an exciting change in the processing department. The Pike's Universum blog spotted three motherboard identifiers that are not tied to any current MacBook Pro models, but use the same processing power management data as the existing 13- and 15-inch models released late last year. The files were not present in previous macOS versions, just the latest 10.12.4 beta. MacBook Pro With Kaby Lake The 2017 MacBook Pro laptops will most likely pack Intel Kaby Lake processors, adding some extra oomph. The faster Kaby Lake chips would make perfect sense, since Apple used Skylake processors for the MacBook Pro launched in late 2016. MacBook Pro models with Kaby Lake under the hood would also fall in line with recent reports indicating that Apple was slightly bumping the processing power for the upcoming models. Kaby Lake would not offer a groundbreaking improvement over Skylake, but minor improvements would nonetheless be in tow. New Identifiers Referenced In macOS 10.12.4 The Mac-B4831CEBD52A0C4C identifier likely refers to the two upcoming 13-inch MacBook Pro models with function keys, Apple-centric publication MacRumors points out. These models could feature Kaby Lake processors with a Turbo Boost speed of maximum 3,400 and 4,000 MHz, respectively. Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921 could be for three 13-inch models of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. These models could have Kaby Lake processors with Turbo Boost of up to 3,500, 3,700 and 4,000, respectively. Lastly, Mac-551B86E5744E2388 could be for three 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar variants. These models could have Kaby Lake processors with a Turbo Boost of up to 3,800, 3,900 and 4,100 MHz, respectively. Pike's Universum also verified the performance bias setting that each motherboard had and said they're likely not for desktops such as the Mac Pro or iMac. macOS 10.12.4 Apple first seeded the macOS 10.12.4 beta 1 to developers on Jan. 24 and released the first public beta of the software a few days later. The software update should bring a number of notable improvements over the previous version, including the Night Shift mode borrowed from iOS. The new-generation MacBook pro models will most likely make their debut after the macOS update is final and official, which should occur by early March. It remains unclear for now just when Apple might choose to unveil the 2017 MacBook pro models, but the WWDC event in June might be a possibility. Other rumors, however, also hinted at a potentially later launch in the second half of this year. As always, it is highly recommended to take all leaks and rumors with a hefty grain of salt until Apple officially confirms it. The references spotted in the macOS 10.12.4 beta offer valuable clues, but nothing is set in stone just yet.

Of course More like this Intel Data Center Storage XPoint: Leaked Intel specs reveal 'launch-ready' SSD – report Roses are nice, but SSDs from Chipzilla (if these specs are true) are DRAM-NAND gap-filler 14 Feb 2017 at 14:01, Chris Mellor Leaked Intel Optane SSD specs show much higher endurance and lower latency than NAND SSDs and good, but not great, IO performance. M.2 format 16GB and 32GB caching Optane drives have already been announced, but no add-in-card/SSD-type drives yet. However, the Chinese TechBang website says it has seen a data sheet for an Intel Optane SSD, the DC P4800X, and says the product is ready for launch. Ignoring all of Intel's previous XPoint hype and treating this as just another solid-state drive, we can see that its IO performance is not radically better than existing SSDs – in fact it's inferior to many – but its latency is lower than other SSDs, at less than 10 µs, and its endurance is far longer, at 30 drive writes per day. Its quality of service with 4KB and a random queue depth of 16 is 99.999 per cent, with reads completing in less than 150µs and writes in less than 200 µs. We don't know its price so cannot judge its price/performance, but we can certainly say it reacts faster than NAND SSDs, has higher write performance and lasts much longer. The data sheet specifies its capacity as 375GB and provides much performance and interface information. It says it is a half-height, half-length low profile add-in card, for example, and uses an Intel controller with Intel firmware: Copy of Intel DC P4800X data sheet We have tabulated some data from this data sheet and compared it to existing Intel, Samsung and WD NAND SSDs also using NVMe interfaces. All the numbers are "up to" values. Product Capacity Media Random Read IOPS Random Write IOPS Seq Read Seq Write Latency Endurance Intel DC P3608 1.6, 3.2, 4TB 20nm HET MLC NAND 850,000 150,000 5GB/sec 3GB/sec 20μs read/ write Up to 21.9PB writen.

However, Optane's 500,000 random write IOPS looks good, being double or triple other SSDs. Several drives in the table exceed the Optane product's sequential IO bandwidth; we can say it's respectable but not in the lead. Intel's own DC P3608 exceeds it comfortably. The Optane drive's endurance is outstanding, up to 10 times better in drive writes per day compared to the other drives in our table. This is no device whose weak write performance/endurance means it has to be used for read-centric applications. Is this leak genuine? Tom's Hardware found a conformity certificate on Intel's website, which is no longer available. We have asked Intel about this DC P4800X and expect a firm "no comment". If we get anything else, we'll let you know. ® Tips and corrections 16 Comments More from The Register Regular or premium?

OpenGL 4.0 Patches For Intel Ivy Bridge Revised Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 14 February 2017 at 08:11 AM EST. 22 Comments While yesterday's Mesa 17.0 release took Intel Haswell hardware from OpenGL 3.3 to OpenGL 4.5, this quarterly update didn't end up bring the older Ivy Bridge hardware past OpenGL 3.3. But consulting firm Igalia has continued working on their patches to bring Ivy Bridge hardware up to OpenGL 4.0. Hopefully we'll see this patch series land for Mesa 17.1: Igalia has sent out their third revision to a set of patches for enabling ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 for Ivy Bridge and it's the last extension needed for this generation prior to Haswell for having OpenGL 4.0 support. Let's just hope now that the patches will be reviewed in a timely manner so that they can land. The 24 patches sent out today add FP64 support to the Intel driver's align16 and align1 back-ends, allowing OpenGL 4.0 to be exposed for IVB. From Samuel Iglesias Gonsálvez, "This is the third version of the patch series that includes, among other fixes, a working DF MOV INDIRECT support for IvyBridge, improvements in the d2x legalization pass, improvements in the regioning parameters handling for DF instructions on IVB, and validator changes to detect misbehaviours in the generated code." These patches, however, do not have register spilling support for 64-bit FP64 data. The patches can be found on Mesa-dev. 22 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Benchmarks: Gaming Power Consumption, Picking a Winner 381 Facebook Twitter Reddit RSS Comments Although the launch of Intel's seventh-generation processor series in January was a relatively uneventful affair, there were a few items of interest -- namely the unlocked Core i3 7350K, which captured most of Kaby Lake's headlines early on. Despite that early intrigue, with a current retail price of $180, the 7350K is a mighty expensive dual-core processor and for $20 more you can land the quad-core Core i5-7400 (confusingly, both cost the same amount in Australia and other regions). Given their similar prices, quite a few of you have asked which is the better buy between the Core i3-7350K and Core i5-7400. The advantage of the slightly pricier Core i5-7400 is that it has four cores and larger L3 cache while its disadvantage is that it's locked at a base clock frequency of 3GHz with a maximum single core operating frequency of 3.5GHz. There is a bit more to this comparison but that's the gist of it. The Core i3-7350K on the other hand comes clocked at least 20% higher, 40% higher in fact when compared to the i5's base clock frequency. This is also an unlocked-K processor which means it can be overclocked to achieve even greater frequencies. I got my chip up to 4.8GHz without much fuss and that's almost 40% above the i5's maximum turbo boost frequency. A clock speed advantage of roughly 40 to 60% is huge and with its support for Hyper-Threading the 7350K should really challenge the 7400. There are however a few other factors at play here which make the 7350K look a whole lot less enticing, so let's touch on that before we even get to the benchmarks. Watch Steve cover the shootout in the video below... Consumers can pretty much get the most out of the Core i5-7400 on a $50 H110 motherboard with the standard Intel box cooler, while the 7350K requires a Z-series motherboard. Z170 boards start at $90 and Z270-based models start at $110, which is quite a bit more than an H110 motherboard. Not only, that but the 7350K will require an aftermarket cooler so you can add another $30 to the price. Therefore, you're looking at $250 for the Core i5-7400 with an entry-level motherboard whereas the 7350K will set you back at least $300 with a basic Z170 board and budget tower style air-cooler. So in the end you are paying about 20% more for the 7350K and its required components. Keeping all that in mind, let's find out how the two compare... Test System Specs Kaby Lake System Specs Intel Core i5-7400K (3.0GHz - 3.5GHz) Intel Core i3-7350 (4.2 GHz) Asrock Z270 Gaming K6 32GB DDR4-3000 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Vishera System Specs AMD FX-8370 (4.0GHz - 4.30GHz) Asrock Fatal1ty 990FX Professional 32GB DDR3-2400 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB SilverStone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Skylake System Specs Intel Core i7-6700K (4.0GHz - 4.2GHz) Intel Core i5-6600K (3.50GHz - 3.90GHz) Intel Core i3-6100 (3.70GHz) Asrock Z170 Gaming K6+ 32GB DDR4-3000 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Sandy Bridge System Specs Intel Core i7-2600K (3.4GHz - 3.8GHz) Intel Core i5-2500K (3.3GHz - 3.7GHz) Asrock P67 Transformer 16GB DDR3-1600 RAM Nvidia Titan XP Samsung SSD 960 Pro 1TB Silverstone Essential Gold 750w Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Benchmarks: Applications Excel is an application that has no problem utilizing a large number of threads and as such the Core i5-7400 performs much better than the 7350K. Even overclocked the 7350K simply couldn't match the 7400, taking over 10% longer to complete the workload. Surprisingly the overclocked 7350K was able to nudge ahead of the 7400 in the 7-Zip benchmark, that said it was just 4% faster. For any kind of encoding work having four physical cores will always beat trump two cores with Hyper-Threading and we see that here when testing with Premiere Pro CC. Even at 4.8 GHz the 7350K was 4% slower than the 7100 taking 18 minutes and 16 seconds to complete the workload. First up let's check out the single and multi-threaded performance using Cinebench R15. Here we see despite a massive clock speed advantage the 7350K is still quite a bit slower than the 7400 when comparing multi-threaded performance. That said, when overclocked the 7350K looks to be almost 40% faster for single threaded tasks. Next Page Benchmarks: Gaming Article Index More GHz or More Cores?

Mark Walton - Feb 13, 2017 11:07 am UTC Enlarge reader comments 175 Share this story Intel's eighth-generation Core CPUs, codenamed Coffee Lake, will launch in the second half of 2017—far earlier than the 2018 launch period suggested by supposed product roadmaps leaked last year. At its Investor Day event last week, Intel confirmed that its 8th-gen chips will once again be based on a 14nm process, much like Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake before it. The first Broadwell chips were released way back in 2014. Intel officially abandoned its previous "Tick-Tock" strategy—with each "tick" representing a die shrink and each "tock" representing a new microarchitecture—in early 2016, and instead promised a three-phase model of Process, Architecture, Optimization. But now, with Coffee Lake, it seems Intel might have abandoned that new model, too. Technically, Kaby Lake is the "Optimization" to the "Architecture" of Skylake and the "Process" of Broadwell, which makes the early launch of Coffee Lake on 14nm something of an anomaly. Further ReadingIntel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K review: Is the desktop CPU dead? Intel is promising around a 15 percent jump in performance versus Kaby Lake, although it hasn't noted whether this refers to desktop or mobile chips. Intel promised a similar performance jump between Skylake and Kaby Lake, but this was largely based on a bump in base clock speed for desktop chips; IPC (instructions-per-clock) remained identical. Where Intel will find the required performance improvements given it's stringing out 14nm for another year remains to be seen, although—as AMD has demonstrated with its Bristol Ridge CPUs—there are efficiency gains to be had with some clever engineering. Intel is keeping schtum about the full Coffee Lake lineup, but it's expected to include a six-core CPU as part of the standard range of i7 products. Currently, Intel only offers more than four cores in its Xeon and Extreme Edition ranges, which typically retail at much higher prices. The Coffee Lake chips will go head-to-head with AMD's upcoming Ryzen CPUs, which launch in March. Ryzen will feature eight cores and 16 threads in its top-end part, with six- and quad-core versions making up the rest of the line. Pricing for Ryzen is yet to be announced. Intel's highly anticipated Cannon Lake CPUs—which are based on a new 10nm process—do not currently have a release date. However, when they do eventually arrive, Intel has said that "Data centre [is] first for [the] next process node," meaning enterprise users will get their hands on their chips before consumers. Intel also noted that future process uses will be "fluid," depending on the market segment, meaning 14nm may be sticking around for longer than some had hoped. Further ReadingThe desktop CPU isn’t dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Further ReadingIntel forges ahead to 10nm, will move away from silicon at 7nmThe first 10nm chips consumers will get their hands on won't come from Intel but from Samsung and Qualcomm. The upcoming Snapdragon 835 SoC will be built on Samsung's 10nm process, enabling a 30 percent smaller die size and a claimed 40 percent reduction in power consumption. No devices using the Snapdragon 835 have been announced, but the chips are in production and are promised to arrive in the first half of 2017.

(Photo: George Frey, Getty Images) 36621 CONNECTTWEET 21 LINKEDIN 556 COMMENTEMAILMORE National security adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday, citing "incomplete information" that he provided top White House officials about his dealings with the Russian ambassador. "Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice-president elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador," Flynn wrote in a public statement. "I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology." Trump immediately named Lt. General Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr., as acting national security adviser, the White House reported. Former acting attorney general Sally Yates warned the White House that Flynn was misleading about the interactions with the ambassador, an official told USA TODAY. The official, who is not authorized to comment publicly on the matter, said Yates’ communication to the White House was prompted by assertions from top Trump officials, including Vice President Pence, that Flynn had not discussed sanctions imposed by the Obama administration for Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. The Washington Post first reported the development earlier Monday. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was abruptly dismissed by the White House late last month after directing Justice lawyers not to defend the new administration’s travel ban against seven Muslim-majority countries. Former director of national intelligence James Clapper and former CIA director John Brennan concurred with Yates, the Post reported. In the message, Yates and the other official named Vice President Mike Pence as one of the officials that Flynn misled about his communication with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak shortly after sanctions were announced in the final days of the Obama administration. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in a statement released Monday night that President Trump is evaluating the situation with Flynn.

"He's speaking to the vice president relative to the conversation the vice president had with Gen. Flynn, and also speaking to various other people about what he considers the single most important subject there is: our national security." On Feb. 8, Flynn categorically denied to the Post that he discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but the next day, he changed his testimony, telling the news organization that he "couldn't be certain that the topic never came up," according to the Post. U.S. intelligence reports during the White House campaign last year show that Kislyak and Flynn were in touch, the Post reported. Kislyak confirmed he and Flynn communicated but he declined to discuss the topic, according to the Post.

But one official told CNN that Flynn's future could be shaky given the development. "There's a lot of unhappiness over this," the official told the news organization. Yates was dismissed by President Trump on Jan. 30 after instructing the Department of Justice not to defend his travel ban in court. Late Monday night, Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo.., weighed in on the controversy, saying Flynn should resign from his position if the reports are deemed true. “As national security advisor, Michael Flynn is responsible to the President, the Vice President, and the American people,” Coffman said on his official Twitter account. "It is his duty to be fully transparent and forthright in his actions — anything less is unacceptable. If in fact he purposely misled the President, he should step down immediately.” Follow Charles Ventura on Twitter at @ventura_charles. Follow Melanie Eversley on Twitter @melanieeversley.

During the past 50 bars, there have been 26 white candles and 24 black candles for a net of 2 white candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 30.1587. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 11 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 41.32. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 66 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is -101.This is an oversold reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses above -100. The last signal was a buy 4 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 8 period(s) ago.

USA TODAY NETWORK U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he participates in a joint news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the East Room of the White House on February 13, 2017 in Washington, DC. The two leaders participated in a roundtable discussion on the advancement of women entrepreneurs and business leaders. (Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) 40 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 85 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — As he met for the first time with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump said Monday he is looking at no more than “tweaking” rules regarding trade with Canada, compared to what is under consideration in the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship. “It’s a much less severe situation than what’s happening on the southern border,” Trump said when asked what plans to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement could mean for Canada. “Our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we’re going to work to make it even better.” That could be good news for Detroit automakers and suppliers who see goods pour back and forth across the Canadian border. While automakers have largely remained silent on Trump’s threat to impose a border tax on autos and supplies imported into the U.S. from Mexico, such a move — which would require a rewriting of or a withdrawal from NAFTA — could impact their bottom line. Related: Trump soft pedals NAFTA criticism with Canadian PM, says Mexico the issue Trump is 'evaluating situation' about Flynn, spokesman says Trudeau, who opened his remarks by noting that the U.S. and Canada have some $2 billion worth in trade between them every day, acknowledged that any move to rewrite NAFTA “is a real concern to Canadians,” given the jobs affected. “We will be talking about how we will continue to keep those jobs for citizens on both sides of the border,” said Trudeau. “We have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of both of our economies.” The border crossing at Detroit is the busiest between the two countries, and Canada is the United States’ largest trading partner. Related: Windsor school board bans student trips to U.S. The meeting came as Trump has started welcoming world leaders to visit him in Washington. Last week, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe traveled to the U.S. as he and Trump discussed trade and other issues. Trump has pledged to get the U.S. out of what he has called bad trade deals that he and other critics argue have resulted in manufacturing jobs in Michigan and elsewhere fleeing the country. Few specifics came up at today’s news conference between the two leaders. There was no mention, for instance, of a proposed underground nuclear-waste facility under consideration near Lake Huron on the Canadian side of the border, even though several Michigan policymakers have urged Trump to press Trudeau to block the proposal. In a joint release before the news conference, Trump and Trudeau did note a “shared focus on infrastructure investments,” including the Gordie Howe International Bridge in Detroit, which they said “will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries.” They said they look forward to the bridge’s “expeditious completion.” FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

A public school board across the Detroit River in Windsor even canceled field trips to the U.S. because of worries that some students could be detained or turned back. Trudeau said it was not his intention in coming to Washington to “lecture another country” as to how it should govern itself. “There have been times when we have differences in our approaches,” Trudeau said, adding that when that has occurred, both sides have voiced their opinions “firmly and respectfully.” “Relationships between neighbors are pretty complex, and we won’t always agree on everything,” said Trudeau, who maintained that Canada takes its responsibilities for national security seriously when it comes to vetting immigrants and refugees. “Make no mistake, at the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other’s most essential partner.” Trump didn’t answer a question as to whether he had concerns about Canada’s refugee or immigration policies involving nations targeted in his travel policy, but reiterated his belief that security must be improved. “We have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are. … We have problems in every corner of the globe, no matter where you look,” he said.

Reuters/Joshua Roberts Donald Trump’s inauguration poster was taken down from its online store. This comes after social media users pointed out a typo in the print of the souvenir poster. “No dream is too big, no challenge is to great. Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach,” the quote featured on the poster reads. However, the poster misspells “too” as “to.” The poster was pulled from the website on Sunday, somewhere between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., as noted by the Hill. The poster was described by the Library of Congress on the original page as one that “captures the essence of Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency of the United States.” Nevertheless, it did not take long for social media users to notice, and point out, the error. Users were able to access it through an archived version that was available on the Internet Archive website. “No joke: Purchasable copy of Trump’s Inauguration Print, direct from the Library of Congress site. A 5th grader would’ve spotted this typo,” one user commented on the error. “‘Captures the essence of Trump’s campaign’ ‘to great.’” another user wrote. “Get’cher official Trump print from the Library of Congress. Extra ‘o’ in ‘too’ available separately,” another user commented. The error comes ahead of Trump’s first talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The two leaders will have “tough talks” on free trade. It is not the first time the Trump administration has caused misspelling errors in the time of Trump’s presidency. On Sunday, the Department of Education spelled W.E.B. Du Bois’ name on social media as “W.E.B DeBois.” "Education must not simply teach work – it must teach life. – W.E.B. DeBois,” the department had tweeted. Its subsequent apology post also contained a misspelling error. “Our deepest apologizes,” the department wrote on its Twitter account. The department eventually rectified the error, correcting the misspelling.

Instead, realize that this is a sea change, where the market is no longer influenced by the things that used hold it back before President Donald Trump won the election. Technology stocks in particular have roared since the election, with Apple hitting a new closing high on Monday. So much of the rally has roots that started in Silicon Valley, Cramer said. Thus, the price of Apple's stock is not determined by the White House. Yes, it has a large cash hoard overseas that could benefit from Trump's agenda of repatriation, but that's not the main thing powering Apple higher. "What is really driving the stock of Apple is something quite different. A realization that Apple's worldwide sales are coming in better than expected, its service revenue stream is on fire and its design and manufacturing supremacy is leaving long-time competitor Samsung in the dust," Cramer said. Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook looks at a display of the new 9.7' iPad Pro during an Apple special event at the Apple headquarters on March 21, 2016 in Cupertino, California. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said that regardless of the administration in the White House, it is important to have an open dialogue and to build a relationship in every country that his company operates in. Krzanich met with President Trump on Feb. 8 and followed the meeting with an announcement that Intel would invest $7 billion in a factory that will employ up to 3,000 people in Chandler, Arizona. The investment would complete plans for a plant that was previously started. According to Krzanich, Trump's position on taxes is what inspired him to revive the factory. Under the current tax system in the U.S., relative to overseas, Krzanich said it would cost approximately $2 billion more over the span of 10 years. "The tax plan that the administration is putting forward would drastically reduce that … we are betting on that tax plan coming into fruition," Krzanich said. As the transformation of technology continues to span the globe, VMware COO Sanjay Poonen told Jim Cramer on Monday that the company is watching the "America First" stance of immigration in U.S. very closely. "Our general philosophy is software changes the world … software is our birthright — Silicon Valley, and the United States — it is the reason people like me are here," Poonen said. Poonen immigrated to the United States from India in 1987 to attend Dartmouth College on a scholarship, and moved to Silicon Valley in 1991. As VMware continues to be the global leader in cloud infrastructure and virtualization, Poonen considers the opportunity for immigration to the U.S. to be very important. Munshi Ahmed | Bloomberg | Getty Images Copper production in Johor, Malaysia Cloud-based software company New Relic also launched a partnership with Amazon Web Services. New Relic specializes in helping their clients monitor and measure what their business software is doing and how users interact with it in real time. Its analytics engine provides a sophisticated dashboard for companies to provide insight into their digital operations. Cramer spoke with New Relic's CEO Lew Cirne, who explained that there are two big trends happening right now in enterprise software. The first trend is the digital imperative to reach customers. The second is the secular move to the cloud as companies exit the data center business. "While these big changes are happening, they need a dashboard to see how their software is running in the cloud … New Relic's dashboard plus the new infrastructure platforms provided by cloud providers helps enterprises make that migration," Cirne said. If one thing is certain for Cramer, it is that metal and copper stocks continue to roar higher, reaching levels not seen in the last two years. However, that doesn't mean Cramer recommends investing in these stocks. "I say you can trade the metal stocks, but not invest in them," Cramer said. Ultimately, he thinks that the stocks can only rally so far before they hit a wall looking for growth. And right now, growth is getting hard to find. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few stocks from callers: Chesapeake Energy Corporation: "I think it's the year of natural gas. People just don't realize it because we've had such warm weather and I do think that Chesapeake is a buy right here at $6." Ubiquiti Networks Inc: "They missed the quarter badly and in a lot of different ways. Therefore, I can't recommend it. It's in the penalty box. We've got to wait for the next quarter."

A look at his statements during a press conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: TRUMP: "We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases ... with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems, and we're getting them out and that's what I said I would do ... And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we're getting them out and that's exactly what we're doing." President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau walks off at the conclusion of a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) THE FACTS: Officials said an operation last week that resulted in the arrest of more than 680 immigrants in various cities was a routine enforcement action like those undertaken during the administration of Barack Obama, who deported an unprecedented number of people as president. More specifically, David Marin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, said the agency carries out such large-scale operations two or three times a year in his region. The California operation was in the planning stages "before the administration came out with their current executive orders," he said. More than 100 of the arrests were in the Los Angeles area. The notion that raids have been stepped up under Trump has been advanced both by the White House, to show that Trump is keeping a promise, and by advocates of those who have been targeted, to illustrate what they call the new president's heavy-handed tactics. But statistical evidence has not come in to show that enforcement has surged under the new Trump administration or that actual deportations are up. A similar series of raids under Obama in March 2015 resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000 criminals, the government said at the time. After the latest raids, immigration officials put out a statement saying a "rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible." And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said: "ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis." Trump's promise of a secure border was central to his campaign and he signed an executive order in his first week as president aimed at making dangerous people a priority for deportation. It's too early to know if that is working. ___ TRUMP: "You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel, the other day, announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation, lowering taxes, et cetera, they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate decisions that largely predate his presidential win, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole reason for the expected hiring. Several job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their total number of employees. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement about the Arizona investment at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, perhaps giving Trump an invitation to brag, which he quickly seized. But those policies have yet to be detailed publicly, much less enacted. The best jobs measure for Trump's administration will probably be the monthly employment reports from the Labor Department. They provide the unemployment rate and the total number of net jobs added or lost during each month. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report.

Immigrant advocates on Friday, Feb. 10, 2017, decried a series of arrests that federal deportation agents said aimed to round up criminals in Southern California but they believe mark a shift in enforcement under the Trump administration.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Razer today launched an updated model of its Blade notebook which promises increased power and performance. The notebook weighs 4.3 pound and measures in at 0.7 inch and yet it features Intel Kaby Lake processors and a 4K display. This is the first Razer Blade notebook with an optional 14 inch 4K display and an Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor under the hood. The notebook is capable of retaining its thickness despite the upgraded components due to its unibody aluminum construction. It also features the NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics processor with 6GB of DDR5 VRAM and 16GB of RAM. The notebook can be configured with SSD storage of up to 1TB. It features Thunderbolt 3 and the Razer Chroma keyboard. The 4K display is a nice option and even though it drives up the notebook’s price, it’s going to be worth the expense for customers who need a UHD display and don’t really care much about the battery life. For some, that’s a tradeoff worth making. Razer’s updated Blade notebook with a 14 inch Full HD display is now available for purchase via the company’s website in the United States, Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, and France for $1,899. The 4K model is going to cost more and will arrive later this year. Filed in Computers. Read more about Razer and razer blade.

Over the past three or four years the cloud industry has worked hard to stress the point that it takes security very seriously and it is often better protected than data in on-premise servers. But there continues to be a gut feeling among some users that still keeps them worrying about data integrity and that should be a chance for a reseller to step into the breach and ease their passage to the hosted world. The potential role that the channel should play has been highlighted by Intel Security, which has just released its second annual cloud security report. The vendor found that the UK is one of the most risk-averse when it comes to cloud adoption. Some of that is caused by a skills shortage making it harder for customers to move to a hosted environment, but there are also real concerns about moving sensitive data into the cloud. “Security concerns and the skills shortage seem to be holding UK organisations back when it comes to cloud adoption. Yet while our research clearly demonstrates that businesses in the UK are the least likely globally to implement a proactive cloud-first strategy, that is not preventing cloud from being adopted across the business. This often leads to shadow IT practices which make it difficult for IT to get a firm control over corporate data in the cloud," said Stuart Taylor, UKI regional director, channel at Intel Security. The Intel research found that 40% of cloud services were now being commissioned without the involvement of the IT department and the shadow IT problem was also adding to security headaches. “With more data shifting across to the cloud, it is essential that the correct security controls are put in place. By moving towards a cloud-first strategy, organisations can encourage the adoption of cloud services to increase flexibility, reduce costs and set up proactive security operations. To this end, we work closely with our channel partners to ensure they are in a position to advise end users on the steps needed to secure cloud deployments," he added. “Our channel partners understand that taking a proactive stance is key. Whether implementing integrated security solutions to ensure visibility across an entire organisation’s services, using authentication best practices or thwarting advanced targeted attacks through threat intelligence sharing, our partners are able to help companies go beyond initial protection by ensuring the correct technology is in place to rapidly detect threats and correct their systems when necessary. However, this focus on the threat defence lifecycle must go hand in hand with shifting the defender-attacker dynamic," he said. Intel Security's discoveries The firm got a fairly good insight into the current attitude towards cloud: Trust now outnumbers distrust for public clouds by more than 2-to-1. ·  49% of professionals slowed cloud adoption due to a lack of cybersecurity skills. ·  65% think Shadow IT is interfering with keeping the cloud safe and secure. ·  52% indicate a malware infection can be tracked to a cloud application. ·  62% store sensitive customer information in the public cloud.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Razer’s Blade gaming laptop gets a new 4K display and Kaby Lake processors 1 by Sean Chan Feb 13, 2017 at 16:20 GMT3 days ago Razer today announced some updates for its Blade gaming laptop. The company is upgrading the CPU inside the device, to offer a better performance. The company is also launching a new 4K variant of the device, which will make some games look much better. Razer’s latest Blade device now comes with Intel’s 7th gen Kaby Lake processors, which means you will be able to get slightly improved performance on the device. Of course, Intel’s 7th gen processors aren’t a significant upgrade from the 6th gen processors, but the improvements can be noticeable in some cases — especially when you’re gaming. The Razer Blade is also getting a new 4K display option later this year. The new 4K UHD touchscreen option will be available for the Blade’s 14-inch variant, which means you will get the best picture quality while you are gaming. Razer will still continue to offer the Full HD display, but if you are willing to spend a bit more, you’ll probably want to get the 4K UHD display which is shipping from Q2. Razer’s Blade device comes with some other powerful features, including 16GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM running at 2400MHz, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, up to 1TB of PCIe SSD storage, and Killer Wireless-AC. The company has also released a video showcasing some of the new features of the improved Blade: The new Razer Blade with the Full HD display is available right now from Razer’s official store, starting at $1,899. The device will also be available in select retail stores starting February 20th. The 4K variant will be available from Q2, pricing details regarding the 4K variant is yet to be available.

Single page Print Aorus' GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G graphics card reviewed Flying high by Jeff Kampman  10:08 AM on February 13, 2017 If you've followed Intel's Kaby Lake launch, you'll already be familiar with Gigabyte's Aorus sub-brand. Much as Asus' Republic of Gamers products are meant to put a more gamer-friendly face on products like motherboards, laptops, peripherals, and more, Aorus is where builders will find Gigabyte's flashiest and highest-performance products. The Aorus eagle already appears on laptops, motherboards, and peripherals, and now Aorus is adding a graphics card to its lineup: the GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G. Readers feeling déjà vu on first sight of the XE 8G (as we'll call it from here on out) are justified, since most of the underpinnings of this card come from the already-superb Gigabyte GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming we reviewed last year. The card's cooler and the fans that move air through it are unchanged from the Xtreme Gaming card. That's a good thing, since Gigabyte's trio of 100-mm overlapping fans is both quiet and effective. Like any respectable modern graphics card, the XE 8G stops its fans at idle for silent running. At least from the fan side, the differences of the XE 8G are all skin-deep: an RGB-LED-backlit Aorus logo on the side of the card, a cooler shroud that's a couple centimeters deeper than the XG card, a restyled quartet of light pipes above the central fan, and subtle gunmetal-and-orange accents. The taller cooler shroud means the XE 8G is a true triple-slot affair, but its 11.5" (293 mm) length should be plenty ingestable by most modern cases. Builders looking to double up on these cards will want plenty of expansion slots at the ready, though. Flip this beast over, and the two biggest changes to the XE 8G become obvious. Aorus' engineers weren't content just to cool the GPU from the die side. Instead, the XE 8G comes with what may be a first: a copper heatsink coupled to the back of the card's PCB using a thermal pad. Aorus claims this copper plate can reduce GPU temperatures by 3° C. Since this is the age of the RGB LED, Aorus also embedded a Technicolor-backlit version of its logo on the XE 8G's backplate. The XE 8G keeps its forebear's twin HDMI outputs on its front edge for use with Gigabyte's front-panel breakout box for VR headsets. Around back, it offers three DisplayPort 1.4-ready outputs, one HDMI 2.0b output, and one DVI-D output. Pair it with the $30 VR Extended Front Panel (not included with this card), and the XE 8G will end up with three DisplayPort 1.4-ready outputs and three HDMI outputs. Stripping the XE 8G to its bones reveals the same PCB design as the Xtreme Gaming before it. Gigabyte kept that card's glorious 12+2 power phase design, and it continues to be fed by two eight-pin PCIe auxiliary connectors. Each power plug has an LED above it that'll light up in solid white if a PCIe power connector isn't plugged in. They'll also blink if the card detects a problem with the quality of the power source it's hooked up to. In regular operation, these LEDs stay off. To carry heat away from the GP104 GPU, the XE 8G's heatsink uses the same large slab of copper from the Xtreme Gaming. This plate makes full contact with the graphics chip and its surrounding GDDR5X memory. This plate doesn't extend to the power-delivery circuitry, but a group of thermal pads ensure those components are still transferring heat to the aluminum fins of the heatsink. Instead of the straight, uniformly tall fin design of many graphics card coolers, the Xtreme Edition's fins have a zig-zaggy shape that's claimed to increase the surface area and potential heat-transfer ability of the heatsink. Remove a few more screws, and the XE 8G's backplate lifts away to reveal more thermal pads for the power-delivery hardware on the back of the card and the RGB LED hardware for the backlit logo. The copper cooling plate behind the GPU remains attached by way of a beefy thermal pad, and a gentle prying motion is all that's needed to lay the PCB fully bare. Strangely enough, the thermal pad makes contact with everything but the most prominent circuitry behind the GPU, so far as we can tell. The plate itself is milled thinner in areas where it would otherwise seem to make contact with that circuitry. We'll have to see whether this plate makes any difference to GPU temps during our thermal tests.   GPU base core clock (MHz) GPU boost clock (MHz) Memory clock (MHz) Memory size (MB) GTX 1080 Founders Edition 1607 1733 2500 8192 Aorus GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G (gaming mode) 1759 1898 2551.5 Aorus GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G (OC mode) 1784 1936 2600 Gigabyte GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming (gaming mode) 1759 1898 2553 Gigabyte GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming (OC mode) 1784 1936 2600 Given how many similarities we've just observed between the GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G and the GTX 1080 Xtreme Gaming, it's no shock that the clock speeds of these cards are nearly identical, as well. We wouldn't put too much stock in these numbers, though, since our experience with GPU Boost 3.0 on Nvidia's Pascal chips has shown that the chip will more or less do what it wants with regard to actual clock speed, given enough cooling hardware strapped on top. We'll observe GPU Boost 3.0's actual clock speeds in a moment. The Aorus GeForce GTX 1080 Xtreme Edition 8G will sell for $679.99, and it's already listed at Newegg as of this writing. Let's see if its performance is a dead ringer for its Gigabyte sibling's.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Max Ehrenfreund By Max Ehrenfreund February 13 Follow @MaxEhrenfreund President Trump looks at Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich, holding a silicon wafer, during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday. (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) Wall Street has President Trump's ear. He meets with bankers and financiers at the White House, and he has signed orders indicating that he will accommodate the industry's needs. Meanwhile, Trump's relationship with the nation's other center of big business has been tense, sometimes even hostile. Separated by culture, politics and a long, cross-country flight, Silicon Valley and the new administration have been experiencing compatibility issues. The contrast suggests how the president's connections in business and his experience in real estate could influence his economic policies. "The tech industry and the Trump administration are talking past each other as opposed to talking to each other," said Venky Ganesan, managing director of Menlo Ventures. Trump's first three weeks in office have made the difference clear. He sought to impose a ban on all immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, an action that prompted outrage from Silicon Valley, where many firms rely on foreign engineers. [How Microsoft avoided billions in taxes, and what the GOP says it will do about it] A few days later, Trump ordered a review of restrictions imposed on the financial sector after the crisis and delayed a rule intended to require retail financial advisers to act in their clients' best interests. Analysts said the actions signaled the White House would be friendly to Wall Street. The financial sector is well represented among Trump's cabinet and his advisers. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, White House senior strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Treasury secretary nominee Steven T. Mnuchin have all worked at Goldman Sachs. So did Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager who advised Trump during the campaign. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao spent time at Citi and Bank of America. The technology sector does have at least one well-placed spokesman among Trump's confidantes in billionaire Peter Thiel. "Peter is, I think, influential with Trump," said economist Stephen Moore, who advised the president during the campaign. "He’s, sort of, the point man when it comes to the concerns and needs and so on of these Silicon Valley companies." Trump also formed an advisory council of corporate leaders after his election, which includes a couple of delegates from Silicon Valley: Tesla's Elon Musk and IBM President Ginni Rometty. Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick quit the group last week in response to Trump's immigration order. Financiers, however, outnumber them on the panel. The group is chaired by Stephen Schwarzman, a founder of the private equity firm Blackstone. [Trump may be ditching conservatives on one of the issues they care about most] Other members include Jamie Dimon, the head of J.P. Morgan Chase, and Laurence D. Fink, chairman of the mammoth money manager BlackRock. Patomak Global Partners chief executive Paul Atkins is also on the council -- his firm provides consulting services to the financial sector. To some degree, the discrepancy is attributable to politics. Anecdotally, there are more Republicans working in Manhattan than in the Bay Area, and Democrats in the technology industry made no effort to conceal their distaste for Trump during the campaign. "Most of the CEOs are pretty hard-core Democrats," Moore said. "You have to search far and wide to find people in Silicon Valley who believe in the things that Trump talked about." Said Ganesan: "The tech industry, during the presidential campaign, was far more vociferous in its opposition and disdain for the Trump candidacy than I think other industries were." Yet Ganesan, the venture capitalist, argued that the technology sector should find ways of working with Trump. "Ultimately, both the tech economy and the Trump administration need each other," Ganesan said. "America’s leadership in the world is driven by technology." Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association -- a lobbying group that represents large technology companies -- agreed, predicting that entrepreneurs in technology would eventually find common ground with Trump's administration on areas such as regulation and trade. U.S. digital exports "can create a competitive amount of economic value and competitiveness in the United States, and that’s the exact kind of thing that he’s been talking about throughout the campaign," Beckerman said. "Who seems to be getting the love in the first few weeks is not necessarily an indication of the long game of the next four years." Former commerce secretary William M. Daley, whom President Barack Obama brought on as chief of staff in part to help the him improve his relationships with corporate America, said that Trump's personal relationships probably accounted for some of his apparent preference for bankers. [Trump said they were ‘getting away with murder.’ Now they might be getting a tax break.] "If you take his whole career back to his father, it’s a pretty closed sort of world," Daley said. "He probably knows every banker, because he’s probably tried to borrow from every one of them." While both New York and San Jose are redoubts of the economic elite, the "whole mindset" of doing business is very different between the two cities, Daley said. He said that Trump probably feels more comfortable in the staid, managerial world of finance, real estate and blue-chip corporations, in contrast to the more unpredictable and entrepreneurial world of computing. Financiers "want to live in a world that’s not as chaotic as the Silicon Valley crowd likes to live in," said Daley, a former J.P. Morgan banker who is now a managing partner at the Swiss hedge fund Argentière Capital. "In the Silicon Valley world, they’re all over the place. Every day is a new game plan." Daley pointed out that besides Trump's hotel in Las Vegas, his golf resort in Los Angeles and his recently completed Vancouver building, most of his properties are on the East Coast or overseas, limiting his exposure to the technology sector's culture and clout. "It's partly because Trump is a creature of New York," Moore said. "He's dealt with Wall Street his whole life." business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

Designed to deliver fast and power-efficient processing, they have a variety of uses, including for automotive, industrial automation, pro audio visual and vision systems. As the “things” become more connected and able to share volumes of real-time data among themselves, data become more difficult to process. Information coming in from sensors and cameras in buildings, factories, homes and vehicles at an increasing rate can no longer be adequately handled by microprocessors or microcontrollers alone. High-performance processing devices such as Intel’s FPGAs are able to collect and send data, and make real-time decisions based on the input from IoT devices. FPGAs can be programmed to deliver the specific level of computing and functions required by different IoT applications. The Cyclone® 10 FPGAs – Cyclone® 10 GX and Cyclone® 10 LP – have their own unique features to address different design team needs. Cyclone 10 GX is unique among other low-cost FPGAs as it can support 10G transceivers and hard floating point DSP (digital signal processing). It offers 2-times the performance increase over the previous generation of Cyclone. The architectural innovation in the implementation of IEEE 754 single-precision hardened floating-point DSP blocks can enable processing rates up to 134 GFLOPs (giga floating-point operations per second). This is important for engineers needing higher performance using the FPGA for applications such as motion or motor control systems. Markets for Intel Cyclone 10 GX include those where high I/O performance and core speed are key requirements. Uses include industrial machine vision and smart city applications that provide surveillance in parking lots , on roads and on bridges. Cyclone 10 GX is also well-suited to support pro AV technologies, such as video streaming applications. Motor-driven systems account for more than two-thirds of industrial energy consumption, and their efficient operation is vital to the smart factory. Cyclone 10 GX FPGAs enable cost-savings when using motors and drives, power assembly, computer numerical control (CNC), machine tools and robotics. By using FPGAs such as the Cyclone 10 GX, operators can benefit from significant reductions in overall cost of ownership across entire product lines. For example, operators can use Cyclone GX to lower their bill of materials costs by integrating industrial networking and functional safety in a single chip. Designers using Cyclone GX and Cyclone LP FPGAs in industrial settings can more easily reach compliance under the Machinery Directive safety standard known as IEC 61508 by working with Intel, the first FPGA supplier to obtain device and tool qualification under this important industry standard. The Intel Cyclone 10 LP is the perfect solution for applications where cost and power are key factors in the design decision. These systems typically use FPGA densities that are sub 75K LE and chip-to-chip bridging functions between electronic components or I/O expansion for microprocessors. Cyclone 10 LP can also be used for automotive video processing used in rear-view cameras and in sensor fusion, where data gathered while the car is on the road is combined from multiple sensors in the car to provide a more complete view of what is happening. The Cyclone 10 FPGA family will be available in the second half of 2017, along with evaluation kits and boards, and the latest version of Quartus, the Intel FPGA programming software.

As we get another day closer to the imperious Mobile World Congress, vendors throughout the telecoms market need to make sure everyone knows how busy they are in preparing for 5G. The rest of the year sees a constant jostle among vendors to show they’re the ‘first’ to launch an era-defining, ‘end-to-end’ solution to solve all your mobile woes; but in the build up to MWC that frenzied PR machine kicks into overdrive. Nokia is no exception, and has updated its cunning plan again with claims ahead of MWC it has successfully conducted the world’s ‘first’ connected based on the Verizon 5G Technology Forum pre-standards. The tests were conducted over its self-proclaimed 5G-ready AirScale radio access, running on the Intel-driven Nokia AirFrame data centre platform, coupled with an Intel 5G trial platform acting as an end-user device. Based on the associating comments coming from Nokia’s head of 5G business line, Harold Graham, Nokia isn’t prepared to downplay the significance of the trial results. “This first 5G connection is a true landmark for the telecommunications industry, and yet another mark of Nokia’s capabilities in 5G,” he humbly said. “With its low latency and significant capacity and speed increases, 5G will deliver a variety of new and innovative applications, and Nokia is playing leading roles in all aspects of the total 5G proposition. This ‘first’ highlights our commitment to being on the front line in providing our customers 5G-ready technologies so that they can seize early market opportunities by building 5G-enabled applications.” Along Nokia’s road to 5G feature a couple of additional announcements from the Finnish kit vendor ahead of MWC. It confirmed it will be launching ‘4.9G’ services later this year – also known as ‘gigabit LTE’ – as well as a whole bunch of massive MIMO antennas and RRHs to optimise resources and deliver gigabit speeds. It also says it will be giving a ‘world-first’ (there’s that word again) demonstration of Cloud Single RAN, which will be running 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G radios over its hardware. So there’s that to look forward to as well at MWC. Y’know, if that’s what you’re in to. Daily Poll What would you consider the biggest roadblock for autonomous vehicles?

Mark Walton (UK) - Feb 13, 2017 2:09 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 175 Share this story Intel's eighth-generation Core CPUs, codenamed Coffee Lake, will launch in the second half of 2017—far earlier than the 2018 launch period suggested by supposed product roadmaps leaked last year. At its Investor Day event last week, Intel confirmed that its 8th-gen chips will once again be based on a 14nm process, much like Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake before it. The first Broadwell chips were released way back in 2014. Intel officially abandoned its previous "Tick-Tock" strategy—with each "tick" representing a die shrink and each "tock" representing a new microarchitecture—in early 2016, and instead promised a three-phase model of Process, Architecture, Optimization. But now, with Coffee Lake, it seems Intel might have abandoned that new model, too. Technically, Kaby Lake is the "Optimization" to the "Architecture" of Skylake and the "Process" of Broadwell, which makes the early launch of Coffee Lake on 14nm something of an anomaly. Further ReadingIntel Kaby Lake Core i7-7700K review: Is the desktop CPU dead? Intel is promising around a 15 percent jump in performance versus Kaby Lake, although it hasn't noted whether this refers to desktop or mobile chips. Intel promised a similar performance jump between Skylake and Kaby Lake, but this was largely based on a bump in base clock speed for desktop chips; IPC (instructions-per-clock) remained identical. Where Intel will find the required performance improvements given it's stringing out 14nm for another year remains to be seen, although—as AMD has demonstrated with its Bristol Ridge CPUs—there are efficiency gains to be had with some clever engineering. Intel is keeping schtum about the full Coffee Lake lineup, but it's expected to include a six-core CPU as part of the standard range of i7 products. Currently, Intel only offers more than four cores in its Xeon and Extreme Edition ranges, which typically retail at much higher prices. The Coffee Lake chips will go head-to-head with AMD's upcoming Ryzen CPUs, which launch in March. Ryzen will feature eight cores and 16 threads in its top-end part, with six- and quad-core versions making up the rest of the line. Pricing for Ryzen is yet to be announced. Intel's highly anticipated Cannon Lake CPUs—which are based on a new 10nm process—do not currently have a release date. However, when they do eventually arrive, Intel has said that "Data centre [is] first for [the] next process node," meaning enterprise users will get their hands on their chips before consumers. Intel also noted that future process uses will be "fluid," depending on the market segment, meaning 14nm may be sticking around for longer than some had hoped. Further ReadingThe desktop CPU isn’t dead, it just needs a swift kick in the butt Further ReadingIntel forges ahead to 10nm, will move away from silicon at 7nmThe first 10nm chips consumers will get their hands on won't come from Intel but from Samsung and Qualcomm. The upcoming Snapdragon 835 SoC will be built on Samsung's 10nm process, enabling a 30 percent smaller die size and a claimed 40 percent reduction in power consumption. No devices using the Snapdragon 835 have been announced, but the chips are in production and are promised to arrive in the first half of 2017.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News World Hyperscale Data Center Market – Opportunities and Forecasts, 2015-2022 Hyperscale Data Center The press releases (PRs) on “Hyperscale Data Center Market” added by Big Market Research will enable major enterprises unlocks the real-time data pertaining to the overall industry performance across different regions. Request sample report @ goo.gl/HMoniW Hyperscale data center is designed to offer a single, largely scalable compute architecture, which is developed from small, individual servers called nodes that offer computing, networking, and storage solutions. These nodes are grouped together and managed as a single entity. The main idea behind developing hyperscale architecture is to start with small infrastructure to keep the initial investments minimal. With increasing demand, new nodes can be added to the cluster to expand the initial infrastructure. Hyperscale data centers are largely adopted by key companies, such as Amazon and Google, thereby emerging as one of the fastest growing technology in the IT infrastructure world. In May 2015, Intel announced the launch of new Intel Xeon Processor, which securely processes and analyzes enormous volumes of data in the system memory. Enquire about report @ goo.gl/TdfKYZ Efficiency is one of the key factors to be considered in a hyperscale data center, in addition to the design and layout of the facility. Designing is a very important factor as it helps to minimize the inefficiency at the rack, node, and facility level. Hyperscale data centers usually have compute nodes ranging from thousands to tens of thousands. In such a hyperscale data center, a small error in design can significantly increase the cost of computation. The other elements of the data center, such as power, HVAC, networking, and layout of racks, also affect its computation cost. Hyperscale data centers are implemented across various industries, namely, IT & telecom, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), government utilities, healthcare, energy, manufacturing, and others. IT strongly supports the growth of the banking sector, thereby enhancing the economic growth. Hyperscale data centers improve the competitive efficiency of the banking sector. The increasing adoption of hyperscale data center in BFSI application is expected to generate maximum revenue by 2022. In addition, in the manufacturing industry, huge amount of data is generated on the operation and shop floor, which can be analyzed to enhance the production practices. Thus, the manufacturing sector is expected to be the fastest growing application sector, with a rapid CAGR of 23.7% over the analysis period.

While the company is best known for its gaming peripherals and hardware, Razer has been releasing highly polished laptops for a few years now. Sure, the Blade and Blade Pro are powerful systems designed for portable gaming rather than everyday work, but Razer does have one laptop that competes strongly with ultraportables from the likes of Dell, HP, Apple, Lenovo and Asus. The Blade Stealth is smallest and sleekest laptop in Razer’s line-up, boasting a 12.5-inch display and powerful yet efficient hardware. You won’t find a dedicated GPU inside this machine, but you do get the latest Intel U-series Core processors and other high-end components typically found in other ultraportables of this size. Combined with an elegant, well-constructed chassis, the Blade Stealth is a laptop that should be on your radar. The first generation Blade Stealth was introduced at CES 2016 as a unique gaming laptop/ultrabook hybrid. The idea was gamers could carry around this portable laptop, then plug it into the Razer Core – a Thunderbolt 3 graphics card housing – to transform it into a gaming machine at home. It was a clever idea, but the Core didn’t catch on as much as Razer would have liked, mostly due to its high price tag. With the new Blade Stealth, Razer is more focused on the machine's strengths as an ultraportable laptop for a wide range of consumers not just gamers on the go, calling it “the ultimate ultrabook.” The design is largely the same as the previous model, but with a handy internal upgrade to Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and a larger battery. The exterior of the Blade Stealth didn’t require an update for the most part. Razer has mastered the design of beautiful black metal exteriors; their laptops are some of the most attractive and well built on the market. Heavily inspired by MacBook Pros, the Blade Stealth stands out with a simple yet classy and premium design that just looks and feels like an expensive piece of hardware. When forking out more than $1,000 on a product, this is the sort of experience you expect to receive. Razer uses “aircraft grade” aluminium for almost the entirety of the Blade Stealth’s CNC-machined chassis. This creates a beautiful, uniform look around the base and lid of this laptop, and the (mostly) single-piece construction adds to its seamless visual appeal. The only parts of this laptop that aren’t metal are the glass display, the rubber feet, and the plastic keyboard keys. Usually Razer products give a good balance between gamer elements and a more stealthy design. The Blade Stealth falls into the latter category, as this laptop’s all-black matte finish is understated in an appealing way. The only highlights are the striking illuminated acid green logo on the lid, and the green inserts to the USB ports. This color combination looks excellent, especially as most laptops these days opt for one of many shades of silver. The downside to an all-black laptop is it quickly becomes a fingerprint magnet. The lid, the keyboard surround, and especially the glossy glass touchscreen quickly accumulate visible finger grease that requires constant cleaning. The glass is relatively easy to keep in pristine condition, but the metal parts are harder to maintain. Someone who gets frustrated with a dirty laptop will not enjoy the Blade Stealth’s sleek finish. While Razer hasn’t attempted to break any portability records like the HP Spectre or Asus ZenBook 3, the company has still created a very slim and light laptop. The Blade Stealth, at 1.29 kg (2.89 lbs) heavy and 13.1mm thick, is slimmer than the latest 13-inch MacBook Pro and Dell XPS 13. It does this while including a comparable battery to the MacBook Pro, and a cell slightly smaller than the XPS 13. The Blade Stealth features a basic selection of ports. A Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C port for charging, connecting to the Razer Core, and use as a general Thunderbolt port is seen on the left, along with a USB 3.0 Type-A port and a 3.5mm audio jack. On the right is another USB 3.0 port and, surprisingly, a full-sized HDMI 2.0a port that makes it easy to connect the Blade Stealth to external displays. I would have liked to see perhaps an SD card slot and an additional USB port, but generally this port selection will be adequate. This laptop is powered on by a centered power button above the keyboard, while speakers flank the keyboard on either side. Many laptops these days include either side- or bottom-firing speakers, so I appreciate Razer’s work to integrate these speakers such that they actually point towards your ears during work. Like most laptops, these speakers don’t have great range but are acceptable and produce a good level of volume. The cooling solution on the Blade Stealth is simple. It consists of two small vents on the bottom of the laptop, along with a row of vents near the hinge assembly. There is only one fan situated on the right-hand side, which intakes air from the bottom and exhausts out the hinge. This fan is mostly off and therefore silent during regular use, although heavy workloads will see it spin up into a quiet whine. Despite not using the fan all that often, the Blade Stealth’s metal chassis isn’t hot to touch, indicating the passive cooling system in this laptop is well designed. The only major complaint I have with the Blade Stealth are the enormous bezels around the 12.5-inch display. This ultraportable is clearly a 13-inch-class body, yet the display seems small and dominated by massive black bars around every side. A 13.3-inch display and possibly even a 14-inch display would easily fit inside the space allocated to the current 12.5-inch panel, and this is a change I hope Razer will make in future models. Smaller bezels look better and provide a better experience.

But on Friday, California-based chipmaker GlobalFoundries announced a $10 billion project in China, showing how the center of gravity continues to shift across the Pacific. The new advanced-semiconductor factory, in the central Chinese city of Chengdu, is only the most recent in an array of investments, often by major multinationals, into China with the support of the Chinese government. The projects have become markedly more sophisticated, making more modern microchips, memory chips or flat-panel displays. In 2013 Beijing announced a major initiative to expand the country's ability to produce microchips, which act as the brains of everything from guided missiles to smartphones. Also driving the companies, according to analysts, are new guidelines urging Chinese electronics makers to buy chips made in China. Since China has begun focusing on semiconductors, the provenance of advanced chips has become an increasingly fraught political issue. The election of President Donald Trump has further increased pressure on companies, several of which have announced plans to build facilities in the United States. In Intel's case, it was a recommitment to an earlier plan the company had announced. "Almost all of the large semiconductor enterprises in the United States have received investment offers from Chinese state actors," according to a report from the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a think tank based in Germany. Although analysts remain unsure of how quickly China might be able to close a huge gap with companies from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States, the funds have been slowly attracting new plants. A semiconductor industry group said in a recent report that it was tracking the production of more than 20 semiconductor manufacturing plants in China.

Reuters/Joshua Roberts A senior White House official has denied answering whether US President Donald Trump will defend national security advisor Michael Flynn. This comes in the wake of reports claiming Flynn had conversations with a Russian diplomat before Trump was inaugurated as the US president. On Friday, Trump refused to answer directly whether he supports Flynn, saying he would be looking into the claims concerning the national security advisor’s associations with Russia. Nevertheless, Trump has maintained that he has confidence in Flynn and that he wanted to “keep moving forward.” On Dec. 29, Flynn had a conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Although Flynn initially refused discussing the issue of sanctions with the Russian official, he has now admitted that he did. The contradiction in his claims, along with those made by US Vice President Mike Pence, was first reported by the Washington Post. Flynn also conceded that he made several calls to the Russian ambassador. Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller said he could not answer regarding Trump’s confidence in Flynn. "It's not for me to tell you what's in the President's mind," Miller said. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said Flynn would need to offer clarification on his contradicting statements regarding his conversations with Kislyak. "General Flynn has said up to this point that he had not said anything like that to the Russian ambassador. I think now he's saying that he doesn't remember whether he did or not," Christie said, speaking with CNN. Christie had headed Trump’s transition planning prior to the US presidential election. Meanwhile, the White House has said it will be issuing a new immigration order. This comes after Trump’s travel ban was voted against by a federal judge and a three-judge panel. “Right now we are considering and pursuing all options,” Miller said, speaking with FOX Television. Trump’s travel ban stemmed from an executive order he had signed on Jan. 27. As part of the order, citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries were denied entry in the United States. Refugees from all countries were not allowed entry for 120 days, while citizens from Syria were banned indefinitely. “It's a political decision," Trump said, speaking with reporters. “This is just a decision that came down, but we're going to win the case.” The White House could either issue a new order or file an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. “The president’s powers here are beyond question,” Miller said. “We are contemplating new and additional actions to ensure that immigration is not a vehicle for admitting people into our country that are hostile to its nation and its values.” Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Hillary Clinton weighs in on court’s decision on Trump’s executive order Travel ban: US appeals court rules against Donald Trump's order Join the Discussion 0 0 0 Search Most Shared Most Read 1 ‘Better Call Saul’ season 3: Bob Odenkirk reasons show’s late coming 0 Shares 2 'Better Call Saul' season 3: Gus Fring's modest return to the world of Jimmy McGill 0 Shares 3 Guns N’ Roses rock Melbourne, apologise over 'Hello Sydney!' mistake 0 Shares 4 LG G6 to settle with Snapdragon 821 chip 0 Shares 5 NBA Trade Deadline: Raptors, Clippers trying to acquire Danilo Gallinari from Nuggets 0 Shares 6 ‘Outlander’ season 3: Leaked pictures from South Africa set 0 Shares 7 ‘Peaky Blinders’ season 4 confirmed 0 Shares 8 Roger Federer reveals three keys to longevity, diet regimen, day-to-day schedule, eating habits 0 Shares 9 ‘Vikings’ season 5: Lothbrok brothers are ‘gonna be at each other’s throats’ 0 Shares 10 ‘The Walking Dead’ season 7, episode 9 spoilers: What to expect 0 Shares Follow Us Please enter a valid email Like us Follow us Full site feed NAB survey shows stronger Australia economy Woolworths and Microsoft assure faster online service Apple Inc. reaches AU$909 billion market value Iron ore prices witness surge to reach US$90 Etsy brings good news for creative entrpreneurs, DYIers CSL revenue approaches US$600 million More Business Economy Markets Companies Real Estate Banking & Finance Man's dead body found in Sydney factory Small 2.7-magnitude earthquake rattles Adelaide Australian man whose girlfriend died in jet-ski crash pleads guilty Killer clown sentenced to 6 months for terrorising pregnant British woman with axe Australian community destroyed by bushfire Ku Klux Klan leader's wife, stepson charged with murder More News Australia Asia Pacific Africa The Americas Europe Middle East Jeremy Lin injury update: Brooklyn Nets PG ready to return post All-Star break NBA Trade Deadline: Cavaliers interested in Lakers guard Lou Williams Raptors acquire Serge Ibaka from Magic for Terrence Ross and future draft pick Adam Voges retires from Tests with batting average of 61.87 Reggie Jackson trade: Pelicans, Magic and Timberwolves vying for Pistons point guard NBA Trade Deadline: Warriors could sign Larry Sanders, not looking for trades More Sports AFL NRL Rugby Union Cricket Soccer Tennis Motor Sports Basketball NFL Fight Sports More More NES Classic Editions soon; ‘Fire Emblem Heroes’ available on iOS & Android Samsung Galaxy S7 vs iPhone 6s: Camera comparison [VIDEO] 'The Last Of Us 2' is 'a story worthy of Joel and Ellie' 'Final Fantasy XV' director hints at PC compatibility 8Pack OrionX: The most expensive gaming PC Researchers call to end long work hours for Australians More Life Environment & Science Health & Wellbeing Gaming Technology Travel & Food Fashion & Beauty Art & Design 'Justice League' cast updates: Laurence Fishburne ends speculations; explains why he won't be in the DC movie 'Wonder Woman' spoilers: Showrunners' Twitter activity sparks fan theories that Arnold Schwazenegger might join the cast soon Marvel gets fans in stitches in new 'Team Thor' spoof video, featuring roommate Darryl [Watch] 'General Hospital' spoilers for Feb. 16, 2017: Nina grows suspicious; Liz takes a stand; Kiki and Dillon reconnect 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' spoilers: New planet details 'Orphan Black' season 5 news: Tatiana Maslany and the clones return as final season gets a premiere date More Entertainment Movies TV Celebrities Music McLaren 570GT Review: Grand, But No Touring Car IBTimes Newsletters Sign up to get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.

For the first time in far too long, we have the prospect of an AMD processor that's not only competitive with Intel's latest and greatest, but perhaps potentially a better value in some cases, too. Following-up on our report of leaked Ryzen models earlier, we now get some rumored performance characteristics of one particular chip, the ~$389 Ryzen 7 1700X. The 1700X could become AMD's best bang-for-the-buck Ryzen processor in the enthusiast segment. It is rumored to cost $110 less than the 1800X, with the only trade-off (that we know of) being a 200MHz reduction in base frequency (from 3600MHz). As the "X" in the model number designates, however, the 1700X includes support for AMD's Extended Frequency Range (XFR) tech, just like the top-end 1800X. Apparently, WCCF Tech was able to dig up some Ryzen 7 1700X Sysmark and CPU Mark numbers from the benchmarks' databases and had some impressive results to share. On the single-threaded front, the 1700X comes close to the 3.20GHz Intel Core i7-6900K, but falls a bit behind the 4.2GHz Core i7-7700K. Compared to the 8-core FX-8350 from AMD, the Ryzen 7 1700X is allegedly an impressive 37% faster. Things begin to get more interesting with the other tests though, potentially highlighting the significant architectural improvements AMD has made with Ryzen. With an Integer math test, the Ryzen 7 1700X simply cleans house, even beating out Intel's high-end Core i7-6900K, which is a ~$1,000 8-core monster clocked at 3.2GHz. In this specific test, the AMD Ryzen 7 1700X manages to outperform the Intel Core i7-7700K (4-core at 4.20GHz) by a massive 85% - that is if the numbers are to be trusted, of course. A steady stream of recent "leaks" like this one, that paint Ryzen in a favorable light, has led some to speculate that Intel's sudden touting of its next-generation Core i7-8700 series means that AMD does in fact have something unbelievably HOT on its hands. Throughout all of the testing done, AMD's Ryzen chip comes out ahead more often than not. There are some cases where the beefiest Intel chips do strike back hard, though, especially with the physics and prime numbers tests. However, one more interesting result is in the encryption test, where AMD's Ryzen 7 1700X beats out the 8-core i7-6900K as well. Encryption has traditionally been an area where Intel's processors have been exceptionally strong. Excited for Ryzen? Let us know in the comments.  And stay tuned to HotHardware for more Ryzen info as it becomes available.

 FACT CHECK: Trump is taking credit for immigration and job creation initiatives that happened before he took office Alicia A. Caldwell and Josh Boak, Associated Press Feb. 14, 2017, 11:44 AM 8,383 facebook linkedin twitter email print President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with parents and teachers, Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. Associated Press/Evan Vucci WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is patting himself on the back for immigration and job-creation initiatives that started before he took office. A look at his statements during a news conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: TRUMP: "We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases ... with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems, and we're getting them out and that's what I said I would do ... And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we're getting them out and that's exactly what we're doing." THE FACTS: Officials said an operation last week that resulted in the arrest of more than 680 immigrants in various cities was a routine enforcement action like those undertaken during the administration of Barack Obama, who deported an unprecedented number of people as president. More specifically, David Marin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, said the agency carries out such large-scale operations two or three times a year in his region. The California operation was in the planning stages "before the administration came out with their current executive orders," he said. More than 100 of the arrests were in the Los Angeles area. In this Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2017, photo released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, foreign nationals are arrested during a targeted enforcement operation conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) aimed at immigration fugitives, re-entrants and at-large criminal aliens in Los Angeles. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement via Associated Press The notion that raids have been stepped up under Trump has been advanced both by the White House, to show that Trump is keeping a promise, and by advocates of those who have been targeted, to illustrate what they call the new president's heavy-handed tactics. But statistical evidence has not come in to show that enforcement has surged under the new Trump administration or that actual deportations are up. A similar series of raids under Obama in March 2015 resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000 criminals, the government said at the time. After the latest raids, immigration officials put out a statement saying a "rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible." And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said: "ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis." Trump's promise of a secure border was central to his campaign and he signed an executive order in his first week as president aimed at making dangerous people a priority for deportation. It's too early to know if that is working. ___ President Donald Trump looks at Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, holding a silicon wafer, during their meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 8, 2017. Associated Press/Pablo Martinez Monsivais TRUMP: "You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel, the other day, announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation, lowering taxes, et cetera, they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate decisions that largely predate his presidential win, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole reason for the expected hiring. Several job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their total number of employees. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement about the Arizona investment at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, perhaps giving Trump an invitation to brag, which he quickly seized. But those policies have yet to be detailed publicly, much less enacted. The best jobs measure for Trump's administration will probably be the monthly employment reports from the Labor Department. They provide the unemployment rate and the total number of net jobs added or lost during each month. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report.

Keeping Britain safe: how GCHQ's new cyber security agency will protect us from hackers Keeping Britain safe: how GCHQ's new cyber security agency will protect us from hackers Security 18 Oct 2016 ADVERTISEMENT In the UK, the government's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) recently opened, tasked with tackling this ongoing threat. The majority of the NCSC's work will involve protecting the UK against security issues, and in its first three months of 'unofficial' operation, the organisation said it thwarted 188 high-level cyberattacks launched against the country. Under this remit, the NCSC has to, of course, know what threats it is facing so, as part of its launch and efforts to be transparent, the group has published a report looking at "the past, present and future of cyber security".

"While predicting the future is impossible, the NCSC is absolutely committed to using our expertise to track and forecast upcoming changes in the cyber landscape so that we can continue to safeguard people’s lives and work online." However, it continued that most predictions about the future are either "utopian fantasies" or "dystopian warnings," so what should we be worried about? Here are six areas the NCSC believes pose the biggest risks. State hacking Government-sponsored hacking groups are well known. The work of Russian and Chinese hacking groups is expected to increase in 2017 and the hacking surrounding the US 2016 presidential election has highlighted how prominent state actors can be.

As governments store more data in the cloud and look to cut costs, the data of citizens and organisations will become vulnerable. Learn more about how one of Russia's most prominent hacking groups works. Quantum technologies Quantum computers are incredibly complex but are being developed at an accelerated rate: it's now possible to buy a quantum computer; they're programmable; and Intel has bet billions on non-silicon quantum chips.

This means the computers have the ability to be faster and more powerful than anything that's come before. The GCHQ body expects quantum computers to come out of labs within the next 10 years and predicts they'll bring new security challenges with them. Inside the weird world of quantum computers Inside the weird world of quantum computers Quantum Computing 09 Aug 2016 "Quantum processing can factor large numbers quickly to crack public-key encryption technology, necessitating a new approach to security," the NCSC says. And this ability, which would potentially give hackers access to private data, isn't just a theory: in March 2016, MIT scientists showed just how this would work. Satellites There are more than 27,000 pieces of space junk soaring around the world and, among the debris, are GPS satellites sending signals to Earth. These satellites underpin many of the globe's services, including navigation systems on millions of devices and vehicles. READ NEXT Here are the first seven startups receiving investment through GCHQ's cybersecurity accelerator Here are the first seven startups receiving investment through GCHQ's cybersecurity accelerator By Matt Burgess GCHQ's body doesn't say what specific problems may arise but highlights in the near future, there will be more low-Earth satellites than ever before. "Eventually some 4,000 satellites may be active in low-earth orbit," it says. Patricia Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at Chatham House and speaker at WIRED Security in 2016, has previously highlighted the threats posed by space infrastructure. "A large part of the critical infrastructure is sitting up there and not a lot can be done about it – it's very old technology and it has never had any cyber protection built in," she told WIRED. In 2013, the International Space Station was infected with malware that was carried on a USB stick by a Russian astronaut. Relying on technology It's almost impossible to avoid technology, and the NCSC says this is only going to rise. "Increasing dependence on information and communications will mean cyberspace will be widely exploited by all types of actors," it warns. "Widespread dependence" will lead to attacks against systems becoming more prominent and potentially dangerous. A power station in Ukraine was put offline after a cyberattack in 2015 leaving 225,000 people without electricity in freezing temperatures. However, the NCSC doesn't entirely bemoan technology. Many security flaws themselves could be fixed by computers and "vulnerabilities could be reduced by new technologies such as the development of intelligent, self-repairing networks, and virtual databases," its document adds. Internet of Things What is the Internet of Things? WIRED explains What is the Internet of Things? WIRED explains WIRED Explains 25 Jan 2017 ADVERTISEMENT Almost all products can be connected to the internet with the addition of a few wireless chips. There are now connected hairbrushes, rectal thermometers, bins, and more. Experts say the Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to let businesses operate more efficiently and provide more data than humans have ever had before, but this is ripe for explotation. "While [IoT] poses new opportunities, it will also present many new challenges," the NCSC says. Its document gives little space to what IoT could do, but you don't have to look far to see problems. In October 2016, large parts of the internet were taken offline by an IoT botnet. The insecure internet connected items were all being controlled after being infected with malware. Robots "Robotic, unmanned and autonomous systems will increasingly bridge the gap between the virtual world and the real world over the next decade," the NCSC says. As with any online system, there will be the potential to hack them. This is highlighted as something that may need GCHQ's and the NCSC's attention in the future.

Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz Sandoval is visiting Silicon Valley next week to woo tech companies to bring jobs to Mexico. (Photo: Jalisco government, for USA TODAY) 14440 CONNECTTWEET 62 LINKEDIN 17 COMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — The governor of Mexico's state of Jalisco is visiting more than 40 U.S. tech companies with the message that it's a great place for high tech, the latest cross-border recruitment effort to respond to U.S. immigration policy. Jalisco Gov. Jorge Aristóteles Sandoval Díaz will meet with California Gov. Jerry Brown, 13 large tech companies including Facebook and Google, and 30 startups beginning this week in California. It's an annual trip for officials from Jalisco, birthplace of tequila, synonymous with hot sauce, and sometimes called Mexico's Silicon Valley for its already thriving tech scene. This year, the trip has an added purpose: to talk to Brown about a bi-lateral agenda to support Mexican citizens to remain in the U.S. And, Sandoval will promote capital city Guadalajara and the rest of Jalisco as a friendly environment for skilled workers that may have trouble getting hired by U.S. tech firms if the Trump administration passes more restrictions on H-1B visas, as a draft order indicated. "We want tech companies to know there is a huge opportunity in Jalisco for them to grow," Sandoval, who has created a cabinet-level Innovation Department, told USA TODAY in a phone interview Tuesday. "Jalisco has many advantages" — a close time zone to Silicon Valley, talent, strong university system, government support and infrastructure, Sandoval said. The Trump administration's policies, in particular the possibility of an executive order that could curtail H-1B work visas, also work in Jalisco's favor, he said. The pitch is hardly a slam-dunk. Some tech companies remain reluctant to expand in Mexico, with a threatened 35% tariff from Trump on goods made there looming as large as his much-heralded wall. (Trump floated the idea of a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall, though White House spokesman Sean Spicer said it was one of several proposals.) There are also lingering questions about Jalisco's overall tech talent, poor broadband access in some areas and costs related to opening operations offshore. Nonetheless, Sandoval's push to raise awareness about Jalisco comes at a time when the U.S.'s northern neighbor, Canada, is also attempting to recruit tech workers as the U.S. halts entries of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations and threatens to further limit H-1Bs, which offer a pipeline of talent from abroad. Canadian venture firms and companies are enticing U.S. start-ups with funding, sparkling new work spaces, broadband access and a relatively affordable cost of living. Jalisco's pitch is similar. The state  on the western coast of central Mexico has blossomed into a thriving tech hub worth $21 billion. Guadalajara or coastal Puerto Vallarta are home to manufacturing, design and research-and-development operations for Intel, Hewlett Packard and Oracle, among others. Oracle and Intel house innovation centers in Guadalajara, and a 940-acre media-business center is under construction. Wizeline CEO Bismarck Lepe is big fan of Guadalajara as a tech hub.  (Photo: Wizeline, for USA TODAY) Technology goods represent about 55% of Jalisco's exports, and account for 25,000 jobs in the state. Nearly a third of Mexico's tech business comes from Jalisco, according to a spokesman for Sandoval. "The Jalisco government is 100% focused on technology," says Bismarck Lepe, CEO of San Francisco-based tech services firm Wizeline. "It's an ideal region for intellectual property, and not cheap manufacturing." Lepe has deep ties to Mexico. His parents are from there, but left for the U.S. for a better economic opportunity. Lepe, who studied at Stanford University and worked at Google, decided to return in 2010 after a third-party analysis determined Guadalajara was fertile ground for tech talent. Half of Wizeline's 270 employees are in Guadalajara, most of them engineers. DROPBOX mensaje Gobernador Silicon_v2 subt.mp4 Canada seizes chance to skim talent from disaffected U.S. tech companies "We want to make Guadalajara a tech hub for the world — from multinational companies to mid-tiers and start-ups," says Cindy Blanco, general director of StartupGDL, a nonprofit organization that champions the region. Guadalajara has lured entrepreneurs with a pool of tech talent fed by the university system, a comparable time zone (Central) to Silicon Valley and direct flights, Blanco says. Cindy Blanco, general director of nonprofit StartupGDL.  (Photo: StartupGDL, for USA TODAY) The close proximity of Mexico and Canada could offer concerned American companies — and workers — an option should Trump issue executive orders on a revised travel ban, curtail H-1Bs and revise the NAFTA trade accord. Job seekers are likely to choose Canada as a backup. It was the most popular second destination, at 43%, followed by Australia (12%) and the United Kingdom (5%), based on 1,200 people tracked last week by Indeed, a job-search engine. Mexico was No. 12 on the list. 'Not an ideal solution' Mexico is at a disadvantage when it comes to talent, say tech executives. Its engineering pool isn't as bountiful in Mexico as it is in India and China, and salaries for Mexican engineers are significantly higher because competition for them is so fierce, says Stephen Stokols, CEO of FreedomPop, a wireless Internet and mobile virtual network operator. "Mexico is a primary market for us, but it's not an ideal solution," Stokols says. His Los Angeles-based company has 20 people — about 10% of its worldwide workforce — in Mexico City, mostly engineers. "We would have more people there, if the engineering talent were available." Mexico's new economy starts to take off It can also be expensive to open operations south of the border and establish a payment system, says Jesus Hoyos, managing director at Solvis Consulting, which resells tech products in Mexico. Still, Mexico might offer as compelling a case for job seekers turned away by the U.S. It is a huge trade partner with the U.S. — trade between the two companies totaled $583.6 billion in 2015, according to the U.S. Trade Representative — and the home to  more than 1million Americans, the largest community for expatriates. (Nearly 40,000 American and Canadian expats are among Jalisco's population of seven million.)

Mike McCurry worked for President Bill Clinton, and Ari Fleischer for President George W. Bush. They also weigh in on whether the president and the reporters who cover him should be toasting one another at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Comments have been edited for length and clarity. On White House turmoil McCurry: There is always this kind of period at the beginning of a new administration where there’s upheaval, there’s change. A new president coming in, new staff. But partly because Donald Trump elected to be thoroughly anti-establishment, all of the establishment procedures at the White House are kind of upended at the moment, so they’re going through I think an unusual amount of turmoil in this transition. Fleischer: Donald Trump was not elected to be a smooth operator. He was not elected to be an established, well-known Washington hand. If people wanted to have calm, they would have elected Hillary, a Washington insider who would have known how to make the appointments, etc. but the country wants people to have Washington change. ... Ultimately, Donald Trump is going to rise or fail on the big changes he makes — whether the economy gets strong, whether wages go up, whether jobs come back to America. McCurry: You referenced the Clinton experience, and yes, there was this kind of period of turmoil in the beginning. It took a full two years before Leon Panetta came in as chief of staff to get things kind of established as a more regular order. The problem is in the world we’re in now with everything instantaneously available, you don’t get two years to sort it all out. He’s got maybe like another two months at best I think to sort of get things on before people begin to say, what’s this presidency about at the end of the day? Fleischer: I’ll go back to your old boss. If there’s anything he proved in the late 1990s, it’s that a roaring economy solves a lot of personal foibles. On the press as 'the opposition party' McCurry: There has not been a president since George Washington that thought the press was fair and balanced. ... But this is particularly belligerent, and it comes at a time when the accountability mechanisms of how we really hold power to truth, they are fragile right now. And that is the traditional role of the fourth estate. The presidents don’t like them all the time, but they usually have recognized that there’s an indispensable role there for them to be a way in which we kind of measure and hold accountable the people who are responsible for executive action. But this president doesn’t seem to honor that tradition, and that is a troubling thing to me. Fleischer: He regularly does sit down with the top-notch, mainstream reporters — the people he decries — and he sits down with them and does the interviews. But he’ll also go around them, which of course he should. The technology of today, why wouldn’t you? Any president who doesn’t do that would be committing malpractice, from a communications standpoint. Capital Download - Conversations with Washington's biggest newsmakers The first 100 days of the Trump presidency Aide: President Trump lost trust in Michael Flynn and asked him to quit McCurry: Most presidents have at the end of the day acknowledged the vital role the press plays in protecting the interests of the American people, and that remains to be stated clearly and unambiguously by this president, and I think that is something that we should be concerned about. Fleischer: The First Amendment is so much bigger and more powerful than the temporary words of the president acknowledging the role of the press. The press doesn’t need a president to acknowledge it; the press has it. It’s called the First Amendment, and it’s inviolate. And the press just has to do its job, whether the president likes it or not. The press just has to be neutral, and fair, and accurate and call it as they see it. On Trump and Twitter McCurry: It would be in most cases for a White House reporter absolute bliss to be able to wake up at 6 in the morning and see the innermost thoughts of the president on your smartphone at that time in the morning. Fleischer: Here you have unfiltered — it’s not running through a staffing process. There’s nobody substituting their words for his. You are hearing and seeing what the president of the United States is thinking and why he’s thinking it. McCurry: For better or worse. President Trump walks down the steps of Air Force One upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base on Feb. 6, 2017.  (Photo: Jose Luis Magana, AP) On the White House Correspondents Dinner Fleischer: My view is the president shouldn’t go. I just don’t see why you need government officials to go to a press dinner. McCurry: It would be disingenuous for President Trump to go given his belligerence towards ‘the dishonest media.’ I mean, why would he want to be in the company of these dishonest people who he constantly every day disrespects? Fleischer: Everybody wants the president to go because it helps sell tickets, makes for a more glamorous event. And in that sense the media is no different from any other organization in Washington that wants to have a dinner or a convention and have the biggest, best speaker they can find. The press should not be in that business of seeking governmental speakers. On 'Saturday Night Live' McCurry: Did you ever get lampooned on Saturday Night Live? Fleischer: No. Jon Stewart went after me a bunch of times. McCurry: I think on the Weekend Update part of the program, I might have gotten skewered a couple of times. Fleischer: I got my name in a crossword puzzle a few times, but that’s about the extent of my fame.

(Photo: MANDEL NGAN, AFP/Getty Images) 14570 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 289 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Michael Flynn's resignation Monday as President Trump's national security adviser answered the question about his future in the White House. But such a high-profile resignation just 24 days into the new administration is unlikely to be the end of the story. After all, Flynn's conversations with the Russian government go to the heart of a controversy that has dogged Trump since the campaign: whether Trump is too close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who intelligence agencies suspect of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Flynn resigned after he lost the president's confidence for misleading Vice President Pence about his contacts with Russia. Pence had denied that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russian ambassador on Dec. 29. The Justice Department, which is responsible for counterintelligence, told the White House last month that Flynn did discuss the issue. Ever since Sen. Howard Baker asked the question in a Watergate hearing, the central question in any Washington scandal is, "What did the president know and when did he know it?" White House press secretary Sean Spicer answered those questions Tuesday. Did the president-elect ask Flynn to talk to Russia about sanctions? "Absolutely not," Spicer said. When did the Justice Department notify the White House that it knew Flynn had lied? "January 26," he said. But as with many such Washington stories, every answered question leads to new unanswered ones. Here are some: What did Flynn tell the Russian ambassador? Flynn's conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak came the same day the Obama administration announced a new round of sanctions against Russia for its computer hacking during the 2016 presidential election. It's unclear whether Flynn would have been privy to non-public information about those sanctions, or whether he made any promises about what the Trump policy would be. At the same time, the Obama administration also expelled Russian agents from the United States — a move that Russia conspicuously failed to respond to. In his CBS interview. Pence ruled out any discussion about that subject as well: “They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia." Did Flynn discuss that issue? At Tuesday's briefing, Spicer was asked if the White House would declassify and release transcripts of those calls. "It is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time." What are Flynn's connections to Russia? As a retired Army general in 2015, Flynn traveled to Moscow to speak at the 10th anniversary gala for Russia Today in an event also attended by Putin. Flynn has acknowledged he was paid for the visit, which — if not approved by the secretaries of Defense and State — would violate federal law. He has not said how much he was paid or whether it was approved. Russia Today was identified in an intelligence assessment as one of the Kremlin's top purveyors of propaganda and misinformation in the 2016 presidential election, leading to a heightened sensitivity over Flynn's participation in the event, which Flynn said was arranged by a speaker's bureau. House Democrats have called for an investigation into those connections. Was anyone else involved? "Was Gen. Flynn directed or authorized to do what he did?" asked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Tuesday. "Who else from the Trump administration, transition or campaign had contact with the Russians?" And it's not just Democrats asking those questions. "I'd like to know, did he just do this as a rogue? Gen. Flynn just decided to call the Russians up one day and say we're gonna have a different view on sanctions, don't worry about it? Or did it come from somebody else in the White House?" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News. Where was the Justice Department? At the White House briefing Tuesday, Spicer had his own questions: "I think the first question should be, where was the Department of Justice in this?" he said. "We were making statements based on what Gen. Flynn was telling us starting on Jan. 13. The vice president went out on the 15th, right? They didn't notify the White House Counsel's office until Jan. 26." At the time, the acting attorney general was Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who was fired Jan. 30 for refusing to defend a Trump executive order instituting a travel ban from seven majority-Muslim countries. Why are there so many leaks? The Flynn saga was brought to a head by two stories in the Washington Post: One last week that reported that nine current and former intelligence officials had refuted Flynn's denials that he had discussed sanctions with Russia, and another on Monday about on the Justice Department concerns about Flynn's phone calls. To Trump, those are the biggest questions. "The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?" he tweeted Tuesday. But as with many such Washington stories, every answered question leads to new unanswered ones.

Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill in this Sept. 21, 2016, file photo.  (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, sent a letter to the White House on Tuesday seeking explanations for "widespread reports that sensitive information may have been shared or discussed in a common area at Mar-a-Lago" by President Trump last weekend. The letter, sent to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, came in the wake of reports that Trump may have been receiving sensitive information via his cellphone about North Korea's testing of a ballistic missile while eating dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a public room at Trump's club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday night. "Accounts and photographs from other diners seem to indicate these communications occurred in the presence of other guests," Chaffetz wrote. "Reportedly, documents were provided by what appeared to be White House staff for the President's review while the dinner proceeded." "During this time, according to reports, the President made telephone calls to staff in Washington, D.C.," Chaffetz continued. "These reports and social media accounts have suggested White House staff used their own cell phones to provide illumination for reviewing documents. Separately, one Mar-a-Lago guest posted to his Facebook page a photograph with a man described to be the holder of the 'nuclear football.' " Chaffez noted that White House press secretary Sean Spicer has said no classified information was present in the Mar-a-Lago dining room and that Trump was briefed in a "Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF)" both before and after the dinner. "Nevertheless, discussions with foreign leaders regarding international missile tests, and documents used to support those discussions, are presumptively sensitive," Chaffetz wrote. "While the President is always on duty, and cannot dictate the timing of when he needs to receive sensitive information about urgent matters, we hope the White House will cooperate in providing the Committee with additional information."

"He went and with his national security team, they briefed him on a situation in North Korea," Spicer told reporters. "Subsequently he had a dinner, which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members. At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about." Spicer added that, after the dinner, the president went back to the secure location to get an update from his aides. "So I'm not really sure where people jump to conclusions," Spicer said. "There is a SCIF there. It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President, by his national security team, the situation in North Korea and then the President subsequently stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware."

SOLARINA HO Toronto — Reuters Published Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 4:30PM EST Last updated Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017 4:36PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print SecureKey Technologies and a Canadian non-profit coalition have received a grant from a research centre funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help build a digital identity network, the Toronto-based tech company said on Tuesday. Last fall, SecureKey raised $27-million from six of Canada’s top banks, including Royal bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank. Other previous investors included Intel Capital, Visa Inc. and Canadian telecom firms. The companies, along with different levels of government, have partnered to lay the groundwork for a national digital identity network they hope to launch commercially later this year. The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), a non-profit coalition of public- and private-sector organizations, aims to build a national system that allows the public to access online services without memorizing dozens of passwords, or prove their identity, while still maintaining their privacy and security. The grant for up to $800,000 from Command, Control and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analytics (CCICADA) will help build the necessary infrastructure to make that happen, SecureKey’s chief identity officer Andre Boysen said in an interview. “In today’s world, every organization acts on its own,” Mr. Boysen said. “Digital identity is bigger than any one organization … it takes a village to make digital identity work.” Consumers need a trustworthy mechanism to prove someone’s identity and make identity fraud difficult in today’s increasingly digital environment, Mr. Boysen said. The company uses blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to create a “triple blind” privacy protocol that allow individuals to easily connect to partnering online services using an existing, trusted log in credential, while limiting the actual amount of data being transmitted for security. Blockchain is a distributed record of transactions, or other data, maintained by a network of computers without the need for approval from a central authority. The technology makes large-scale hacking extremely difficult. The “triple blind” mechanism means a consumer can use their bank credentials to log in, for example, and access their destination service, but the bank can not see where the data is going, and the recipient can not see which bank is used or any bank account information. As a middleman, SecureKey is similarly “blind” and cannot see who is using the services. “That’s why DHS is interested, because now we have scalable market service with very, very good privacy and that’s what we’re using blockchain for. It helps us implement blinding,” Mr. Boysen said.

Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, speaks during a hearing on Capitol Hill in this Sept. 21, 2016, file photo.  (Photo: Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images) House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, sent a letter to the White House on Tuesday seeking explanations for "widespread reports that sensitive information may have been shared or discussed in a common area at Mar-a-Lago" by President Trump last weekend. The letter, sent to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, came in the wake of reports that Trump may have been receiving sensitive information via his cellphone about North Korea's testing of a ballistic missile while eating dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a public room at Trump's club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday night. "Accounts and photographs from other diners seem to indicate these communications occurred in the presence of other guests," Chaffetz wrote. "Reportedly, documents were provided by what appeared to be White House staff for the President's review while the dinner proceeded." "During this time, according to reports, the President made telephone calls to staff in Washington, D.C.," Chaffetz continued. "These reports and social media accounts have suggested White House staff used their own cell phones to provide illumination for reviewing documents. Separately, one Mar-a-Lago guest posted to his Facebook page a photograph with a man described to be the holder of the 'nuclear football.' " Chaffez noted that White House press secretary Sean Spicer has said no classified information was present in the Mar-a-Lago dining room and that Trump was briefed in a "Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF)" both before and after the dinner. "Nevertheless, discussions with foreign leaders regarding international missile tests, and documents used to support those discussions, are presumptively sensitive," Chaffetz wrote. "While the President is always on duty, and cannot dictate the timing of when he needs to receive sensitive information about urgent matters, we hope the White House will cooperate in providing the Committee with additional information."

"He went and with his national security team, they briefed him on a situation in North Korea," Spicer told reporters. "Subsequently he had a dinner, which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members. At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about." Spicer added that, after the dinner, the president went back to the secure location to get an update from his aides. "So I'm not really sure where people jump to conclusions," Spicer said. "There is a SCIF there. It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President, by his national security team, the situation in North Korea and then the President subsequently stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware."

USA TODAY NETWORK President Trump and Michael Flynn (Photo: Jim Watson, AFP/Getty Images) 13867 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDIN 578 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — President Trump knew for more than two weeks that ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn lied about his contact with a Russian ambassador and demanded his resignation because he could no longer trust him, the White House spokesman said Tuesday. "The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation, and a series of other questionable instances, is what led the president to ask for General Flynn's resignation," Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said. Vice President Pence didn't know about Flynn's actions until Feb. 9, Pence's press secretary, Marc Lotter, told the Washington Post and NBC News Tuesday. Flynn's resignation, less than a month after Trump took office, came as a growing number of members of Congress sought an investigation into Flynn's contacts with the Russians and those of the entire Trump White House, which has made improved ties between the two countries a cornerstone of the president's foreign policy. Trump and aides spent weeks evaluating allegations against Flynn and concluded that he misled Pence and others when he said he had not discussed then-pending sanctions on Russia with the U.S. ambassador from that country, Spicer and other officials said. Pence echoed Flynn's denials in a television interview, and protested Flynn's conduct in light of recent revelations. Trump did not oust Flynn sooner, Spicer said during a White House news briefing, because there was no proof Flynn had broken the law by calling Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Spicer said Trump did not authorize Flynn to call Kislyak about then-pending sanctions from the Obama administration against Russia over its involvement in the 2016 elections. "It was not an issue of law, it was an issue of trust," Spicer said. Members of Congress, including some Republicans, said Flynn's departure underscores concerns about the Trump administration, the Russians, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, potential ties that are already the subject of an FBI investigation. Flynn's forced resignation "is a troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus" and "also raises further questions about the Trump administration’s intentions toward Vladimir Putin’s Russia," said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. McCain cited "statements by the president suggesting moral equivalence between the United States and Russia despite its invasion of Ukraine, annexation of Crimea, threats to our NATO allies, and attempted interference in American elections."

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, told CNN: "Did General Flynn act alone? I want to know what Russia is up to." Citing reports that the Justice Department warned the White House a month ago that Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail because he had misrepresented his talks with the Russian ambassador, Democrats and other Trump critics said they would continue to press Trump for a probe of the incident. "The Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn's conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge," said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. For his part, Trump took to social media to protest news leaks. While not mentioning Flynn, Trump tweeted: "The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?" The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017 Trump declined to answer reporters' questions about Flynn during a Tuesday morning meeting of parents and teachers. Calling Sergey Flynn's departure, the first high-profile resignation of the Trump administration, started with a phone call. During a conversation late last year with Kislyak,Flynn discussed then forthcoming sanctions the Obama administration was placing on Russia over involvement in the U.S. election, including the hacking the emails of Democratic Party officials close to nominee Hillary Clinton. Flynn initially denied discussing sanctions with Kislyak — a falsehood repeated in public statements by Vice President Pence, among other administration officials. Aides to the president said Pence protested and played a role in discussions about what to do with Flynn. "Misleading the vice president really was the key here," presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway told NBC's Today show Tuesday. The content of Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador and a discussion of sanctions emerged during the FBI’s ongoing investigation into communications between former and current Trump aides and Russian government officials, a U.S. official said. Sally Yates, then-acting attorney general during the Trump administration transition, was prompted to alert the White House counsel, Don McGahn, Spicer said. Other officials, including Vice President Pence, said they were assured that Flynn’s pre-inaugural conversations did not include the subject of sanctions against Russia, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity because officials were not authorized to comment on the matter publicly. Fearing that the content of conversations could later be used against Flynn by Russian authorities as a form of blackmail, the official said the decision was made to raise the matter with the White House. It was immediately unclear how the White House responded to Yates’ information, the official said. Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was later fired by Trump for refusing to defend the president’s controversial executive order to suspend immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. That order, now the subject of multiple court challenges across the country, is on hold. The official with knowledge of the matter said the federal inquiry continues into the communications with Russian officials, though it was not clear what affect, if any, Flynn’s resignation would have on the investigation. Shortly before acting Yates alerted the White House of inconsistencies in Flynn's public statements about his private conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.— secretly monitored by federal authorities — FBI agents interviewed the then-Trump administration national security adviser, the official said. The official declined to elaborate on the contents of the interview, but indicated that Yates moved to raise concerns with the White House counsel  about Flynn's possible exposure to blackmail by Russian authorities within a day or two after the interview. The official declined to comment on whether authorities had concluded that Flynn's statements were truthful. Lying to the FBI is a felony offense. At the White House, Spicer said Trump learned of the Justice Department's concerns on Jan. 26 and immediately asked McGahn's office to investigate. While there is no evidence Flynn broke the law, Spicer said Trump believes his now-former national security adviser misled Pence and others about the phone call. Spicer said Trump requested the resignation, though other administration officials have told reporters that Flynn acted voluntarily. While Trump named an acting national security adviser — retired three-star general Joseph Keith Kellogg Jr. — the White House has floated other names to take over the post full time. They include Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command and protégé of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and retired general David Petraeus, a former CIA director who resigned after acknowledging he gave classified information to a biographer with whom he was having an affair. Read more: Russian lawmakers: Flynn pushed out to hurt Russia-U.S. relations Fired a month in: Michael Flynn's rise and very fast fall Full text of Michael Flynn's resignation letter In his resignation letter, Flynn said that, because of the "fast pace of events," he "inadvertently" gave Pence and others "incomplete information" about his call with the Russian ambassador. "I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology," Flynn wrote. While a close adviser to Trump during his presidential campaign, Flynn was in trouble from Day One. Critics cited his past ties to Russia, and what appeared to be signs of disorganization within the National Security Council. Flynn, who had been fired as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency by President Obama, made himself a political target by campaigning aggressively against Clinton, sometimes leading Trump supporters in chants of "lock her up!" Flynn resigned hours after Spicer announced that the president was "evaluating the situation" regarding Flynn. Flynn's tenure as national security adviser, less than a month, is by far the shortest ever for the influential position. President Ronald Reagan's first national security adviser, Richard Allen, lasted just under a year. Clinton, whom Trump defeated in the November election, also weighed in on Flynn, retweeting a message from former spokesman Philippe Reines about the involvement of Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., spreading "fake news" about the Democratic campaign. "Philippe's got his own way of saying things, but he has a point about the real consequences of fake news," Clinton said.

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) 13232 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee will introduce a bill this week that would force President Trump to disclose his income, assets and liabilities in a foreign country before he embarks on new trade negotiations, his aides tell USA TODAY. The measure from Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden also would require similar disclosure when the president takes other actions on international trade, such as reducing tariffs to give developing countries better access to U.S. markets. “Americans have a right to know if the President is looking out for the good of the country or just his own bottom line when he negotiates a trade deal, decides whether or not to enforce our trade laws, or decides whether to cut tariffs on imports from a developing country,” Wyden said in a statement. “Trump has business interests around the world, but he continues to keep the full nature of those ties secret.” Wyden’s proposal marks the latest push by Democrats on Capitol Hill and independent watchdogs to pressure the Trump administration, as they clamor for investigations into a top White House aide and search for novel ways to force the new president to disclose more information about his vast business interests and the ethics questions that have dogged him since his Jan. 20 swearing-in. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and five other Democratic senators recently wrote to White House counsel Don McGahn, asking him to rein in possible ethics violations after top White House aide Kellyanne Conway touted Ivanka Trump’s clothing line during a television interview. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Tom Udall, D-N.M., have sought the membership list for Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private resort in Palm Beach, Fla. On Monday, the head of the House's tax oversight committee, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, shot down a Democratic proposal to use a little-known 1924 law to demand the Treasury Department turn over 10 years of Trump’s tax returns to lawmakers. White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.  (Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images) Trump's real-estate and branding empire does business from the Philippines to Uruguay. Later this week, his adult sons are set to attend the opening of a new Trump-branded golf course in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. As president, Trump has moved quickly on trade deals, taking executive action during his first week in office to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal pushed by President Obama. He also has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico. Trump has transferred day-to-day management responsibilities of his international real-estate and branding empire to Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and a longtime Trump executive. But he has refused to release his tax returns — citing an IRS audit — or to relinquish ownership of the Trump Organization, prompting continued scrutiny about the government's entanglement with the Trump brand. Over the weekend, for instance, he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago, which he has dubbed the winter White House. On Saturday night, other diners at the club looked on as Trump and his aides worked on their response to North Korea’s missile test. A club member posted pictures of their interactions on Facebook. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that no classified information was reviewed during the dinner on the resort's patio. Democrats face long odds of their efforts gaining much traction in a Republican-controlled Congress, but they increasingly feel emboldened by the fury of Democratic activists who have taken their protests to the streets and into congressional town hall meetings in the first weeks of the Trump administration, political observers say. "The Democrats, driven by their supporters, are determined to inquire into all of these open questions," said Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  “There is a very broad sense among the people who are not die-hard supporters of Donald Trump that there are so many unanswered questions and so many ethical strings to be pulled, that the sweater will unravel." Questions mount Trump's allies have said that liquidating his business is not a realistic option and would pose its own problems, such as buyers paying more than fair-market value for pieces of the empire in an effort to curry favor with the president. The Trump Organization's new management structure includes an internal chief compliance counsel and an outside ethics adviser, veteran Republican lawyer Bobby Burchfield, who reviews and signs off on significant business transactions that could pose conflicts of interest. But in a little over three weeks in office, Trump and his family have had to navigate a myriad of questions about the connections between his official duties and the Trump family’s business interests. Some examples: • First lady Melania Trump’s contention in a recently filed libel lawsuit against The Daily Mail that the newspaper’s unfounded allegations about her past jeopardized her ability to garner “multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which the Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.” • The promotion of Ivanka Trump and her fashion line by Trump and his aides. After Trump took to Twitter last week to castigate Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s clothing line, two White House staffers swiftly voiced support. Spicer told reporters department store chain's decision amounted to a personal attack on Ivanka Trump because of her father’s policies. "He has every right to stand up for his family," Spicer said. Conway, in an interview from the White House briefing room, went further, encouraging viewers of Fox & Friends to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” • Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump also have maintained high profiles. Earlier this month, Trump’s sons made a front-row appearance during their father’s televised announcement of Judge Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee. In addition, The Washington Post recently reported that a January business trip to Uruguay by Eric Trump cost taxpayers nearly $100,000 in hotel expenses for the Secret Service and embassy staff.

In recent interviews with The New York Times, the Trump sons say they do not cross ethical lines by discussing Trump Organization matters with their father. They said they were in Washington the day of the Gorsuch announcement for business at the Trump International Hotel and visited the White House to say hello to their father and enjoy the historic occasion. Conway’s promotion of Ivanka Trump’s fashion line last week prompted a rare rebuke from a Republican, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who called her remarks “wrong, wrong, wrong” on Twitter. Chaffetz and the committee’s top Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, also sent a letter to the federal government’s top ethics regulator, questioning whether Conway broke federal rules that bar public officials from promoting products. In a letter released Tuesday, the head of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub said Conway's comments likely violated ethics rules and asked the White House to investigate her conduct and report back to his office by Feb. 28.

Flynn was fired by one American commander-in-chief for insubordination, Now he may removed by another. Flynn resigned as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser Monday. Carolyn Kaster — The Associated Press file WASHINGTON >> Fired by one American commander in chief for insubordination, Michael Flynn has now been removed by another. The White House said Tuesday that President Donald Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, a hard-charging, feather-ruffling retired lieutenant general who just three weeks into the new administration had put himself in the center of a controversy. Flynn resigned late Monday. At issue was Flynn’s contact with Moscow’s ambassador to the United States. Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak appear to have discussed U.S. sanctions late last year, raising questions about whether he was freelancing on foreign policy while President Barack Obama was still in office and whether he misled Trump officials about the calls. The center of a storm is a familiar place for Flynn. His military career ended when Obama dismissed him as defense intelligence chief. Flynn claimed he was pushed out for holding tougher views than the Obama administration about Islamic extremism. But a former senior U.S. official who worked with Flynn said the firing was for insubordination, after the Army lieutenant general failed to follow guidance from superiors. Advertisement Once out of government, he disappeared into the murky world of mid-level defense contractors and international influence peddlers. He shocked his former colleagues a little more than a year later by appearing at a Moscow banquet headlined by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Given a second chance by Trump, Flynn, a lifelong if apolitical Democrat, became a trusted and eager confidant of the Republican candidate, joining anti-Hillary Clinton campaign chants of “Lock Her Up” and tweeting that “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” As national security adviser, Flynn required no Senate confirmation vote or public vetting of his record, and his tenure was brief but turbulent. The Washington Post and other U.S. newspapers, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported last week that Flynn made explicit references to U.S. sanctions on Russia in conversations with Kislyak. One of the calls took place on Dec. 29, the day Obama announced new penalties against Russia’s top intelligence agencies over allegations they meddled in the U.S. election process to help Trump win. While it’s not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office, the repeated contacts just as the U.S. was pulling the trigger on sanctions suggests Trump’s team might have helped shape Russia’s response. They also contradicted denials about such discussions of the sanctions by several Trump administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn later backed off his adamant denials. On Friday, he said he “no recollection” of discussing sanctions policy but “can’t be certain,” according to an official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. He apologized to Pence, who, apparently relying on Flynn’s denials, vouched for him on television. In his resignation letter, Flynn said he held numerous calls with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition and gave “incomplete information” about those discussions to Pence. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump requested Flynn’s resignation because of an erosion of trust. INSUBORDINATION Flynn’s sparkling military resume had included key assignments at home and abroad, and high praise from superiors. The son of an Army veteran of World War II and the Korean war, Flynn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1981 after graduating from the University of Rhode Island. He started in intelligence, eventually commanding military intelligence units at the battalion and then brigade level. In the early years of the Iraq war, he was intelligence chief for Joint Special Operations Command, the organization in charge of secret commando units like SEAL Team 6 and Delta Force. He then led intelligence efforts for all U.S. military operations in the Middle East and then took up the top intelligence post on the Joint Staff in the Pentagon. Ian McCulloh, a Johns Hopkins data science specialist, became an admirer of Flynn while working as an Army lieutenant colonel in Afghanistan in 2009. At the time, Flynn ran intelligence for the U.S.-led international coalition in Kabul and was pushing for more creative approaches to targeting Taliban networks, including use of data mining and social network analysis, according to McCulloh. “He was pushing for us to think out of the box and try to leverage technology better and innovate,” McCulloh said, crediting Flynn for improving the effectiveness of U.S. targeting. “A lot of people didn’t like it because it was different.” It was typical of the determined, though divisive, approach Flynn would adopt at the Defense Intelligence Agency, which provides military intelligence to commanders and defense policymakers. There, he quickly acquired a reputation as a disruptive force. While some applauded Flynn with forcing a tradition-bound bureaucracy to abandon old habits and seek out new, more effective ways of collecting and analyzing intelligence useful in the fight against extremist groups, others saw his efforts as erratic and his style as prone to grandstanding. In the spring of 2014, after less than two years on the job, he was told to pack his bags. According to Flynn’s telling, it was his no-nonsense approach to fighting Islamic extremist groups that caused the rift. A former senior Obama administration official who was consulted during the deliberations disputed that account. Flynn was relieved of his post for insubordination after failing to follow guidance from superiors, including James Clapper, Obama’s director of national intelligence, said the official, who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters. CIVILIAN LIFE Plunged into civilian life for the first time in 33 years, Flynn moved quickly to capitalize on his military and intelligence world connections and experience. He did so in an unorthodox way. “I didn’t walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrup Grumman or Booz Allen or some of these other big companies,” Flynn told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. Instead, he opened his own consulting firm, Flynn Intelligence Group, in Alexandria, Va. He brought in his son, Michael G. Flynn as a top aide, and began assembling a crew of former armed forces veterans with expertise in cyber, logistics and surveillance, and sought out ties with lesser-known figures and companies trying to expand their profiles as contractors in the military and intelligence spheres. One “team” member listed on the firm’s site was James Woolsey, President Bill Clinton’s former CIA director. Woolsey briefly joined Flynn on Trump’s transition team as a senior adviser, but quit in January. Another was lobbyist Robert Kelley. Kelley proved a central player in the Flynn Group’s decision to help a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey’s government. At the same time that Flynn was advising Trump on national security matters, Kelley was lobbying legislators on behalf of businessman Ekim Alptekin’s firm between mid-September and December last year, lobbying documents show. It was an odd match. Flynn has stirred controversy with dire warnings about Islam, calling it a “political ideology” that “definitely hides behind being a religion” and accusing Obama of preventing the U.S. from “discrediting” radical Islam. But his alarms apparently didn’t extend to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government as it cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup last summer. Erdogan’s power base is among Turkey’s conservative Muslim voters and many affected by his crackdown are secularists. Shortly before Trump’s election, Flynn wrote an op-ed saying Turkey needed U.S. support and echoing Erdogan’s warnings that a “shady” Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be protected by the United States. Erdogan accuses the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of orchestrating the coup attempt and has requested extradition. Obama officials widely described Turkey’s evidence of Gulen’s wrongdoing as insufficient. Alptekin, the businessman, told The Associated Press he met Flynn several times starting last summer. He wouldn’t detail their conversations. Alptekin said he met mostly with Kelley, a former chief counsel to a congressional subcommittee, who registered with Congress as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin established in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin also is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee, though he says he has no official relationship with Turkey’s government. Kelley said Flynn’s consulting firm could help “do something about improving the relations between Turkey and the United States,” Alptekin told the AP. He said he didn’t consider any need for his firm or Kelley to register with the Justice Department as a “foreign agent in this context” because his firm was “not a government entity.” FOREIGN AGENT? Kelley also was a registered foreign agent for the National Mobilization Force, a Turkish-backed militia fighting the Islamic State group in Syria. Documents filed with the Justice Department show Kelley was paid $90,000 to “convey the views” of the armed group to Congress, federal officials and the media. The Justice records do not cite any Kelley affiliation with the Flynn Group. But a December letter from Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to top federal intelligence officials raised questions about whether Kelley inappropriately represented the militia on behalf of Flynn’s firm, which they said raises “the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents.” Several ethics experts also said Flynn’s firm should have registered with the Justice Department. “If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress on influencing U.S policy, they need to file under the foreign agent act,” said Lydia Dennett, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington good government group. Alptekin said Inovo BV paid Flynn’s firm “tens of thousands of dollars.” Kelley said Flynn’s firm made less than $5,000 for its three months of work on behalf of Alptekin’s company when he filed a lobbying termination notice to Congress on Dec. 1. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group have not responded to multiple calls and emails from the AP. Flynn said in a statement that Kelley provided to Yahoo News in mid-November that “if I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed.” The Flynn Intel Group’s website no longer operates and AP visits to three northern Virginia locations associated with the firm no longer showed any company activity or identification. Several Flynn Intel Group staffers who worked for the firm and its cyber and flight subsidiaries, FIG Cyber Inc. and FIG Aviation, departed around the November election. BLIMP IN A BOX Flynn had other nontraditional business engagements. In early 2015, he signed on with the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks as a member of its Public Sector Advisory Council comprising retired military officers working as a “sounding board” to answer “the technology needs of the world’s governments.” He advised Conversion Capital, a venture capital firm specializing in tech-oriented investments. He was briefly listed as a board director of GreenZone Systems, a technology firm headed by another Flynn Intel Group partner, Iranian-American investor Bijan Kian. And then there was Drone Aviation, a firm that makes tethered surveillance drones. Flynn was named vice chairman and a board member in May 2016, and said he would promote the firm’s “blimp in a box” concept for military and government use and expand “the role of persistent aerial solutions in the marketplace.” The company later won a $400,000 Defense Department contract. Drone Aviation paid Flynn a $36,000 annual salary and awarded him 100,000 shares of restricted stock. He was re-elected to the board after Trump’s election but stepped down from the board after being offered his job at the White House. Another venture was Brainwave Science, a Boston company publicizing its use of “brain fingerprinting,” scans that the firm claims can be used to assess a person’s honesty. Flynn briefly joined the advisory board in February 2016. The firm’s concept is disputed by critics and one adviser left the board after media reports surfaced that he pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to Russia’s spy agency. MEETING PUTIN Like many former military officials, Flynn boosted his profile by appearing on television news and talk shows, including several networks connected to foreign governments. They include Qatar-backed Al Jazeera and RT, the news network aligned with the Russian government. He has said he wasn’t paid for the appearances. But a December 2015 trip to RT’s 10th anniversary celebration would put Flynn in some unique company. An RT video from the Moscow event showed Flynn seated next to Putin and rising during a standing ovation following the Russian leader’s address. Flynn has acknowledged being paid for the appearance, but hasn’t said who wrote the check or for how much. Flynn’s webpage at All American Speakers shows a standard lecture circuit fee in the $30,000-$50,000 range. According to another attendee at the event, Jill Stein, the former Green Party presidential candidate who won 1 percent of the popular vote last November, RT paid for the Moscow event. Stein told the AP she turned down the network’s offer to pay for her transportation and stay at Moscow’s Hotel Metropol, where the event was held. “I didn’t think it was appropriate for a presidential candidate to take money from a foreign government,” she said. Before dinner, Flynn was interviewed on international issues by an RT personality. He then joined Stein and others at a front table, seated with Putin and an entourage of aides. Stein said she didn’t see Flynn and Putin talk privately at the table. Flynn later told the Post that he had only a brief introduction with Putin. Flynn shrugged off the meeting as “boring.” Still, several Democratic House members have asked if Flynn accepted payment from RT and if that is a violation of the federal Emoluments Clause, which prohibits even retired military officers from accepting direct or indirect payments from foreign governments. The Army said Tuesday it hasn’t investigated. Flynn was both hopeful and skeptical about Russia relations before joining Trump’s administration. In his 2016 book “The Field of Fight,” Flynn warned that Russia had joined an “enemy alliance” with Iran. But he also talked publicly of Russia as a possible ally with the U.S. in confronting radical Islam. Subscribe to Home Delivery and SAVE!

The System Is Working Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by David French February 14, 2017 3:28 PM @DavidAFrench Response To... Why the Flynn Debacle Matters Each day of the young Trump presidency brings a reminder that the American republic was built from the ground-up to resist authoritarianism and corruption. That of course doesn’t mean that we’re immune from man’s fallen nature, just that our system is better equipped than virtually any other to repel it, to keep it from fundamentally tainting the entire governmental enterprise.  We’re watching that reality unfold before our eyes. Look at the two tweets below — the first from Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz and the second from Republican senate majority leader Mitch McConnell: After Trump may have discussed NK missile launch in the middle of Mar-a-Lago public dining room, Chaffetz demands to know security protocols pic.twitter.com/pWC0xnHvVk — Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) February 14, 2017 McConnell: “Highly likely” Senate Intel Committee will look into whether Trump directed Flynn to talk sanctions with Russia ambassador — Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 14, 2017 This is the majority in Congress exercising its investigatory and oversight role on a president of its own party. Why? Part of it is simple integrity. This is the right thing to do, and both Chaffetz and McConnell should be commended for not automatically circling the partisan wagons. But there’s something else at work as well — institutional power and incentives. A legislature that abdicates on its core Constitutional responsibilities is a legislature that surrenders its own power and acts against its own self-interest. To be sure, some men and women will roll over in the face of a strong executive for the sake of short-term political gain, but wiser heads who care about the strength of their institutions will rebel.  Indeed, if there’s a dominant story of the first few weeks of the Trump presidency, it’s how weak he’s proven to be, not how strong. So far, there are far fewer signs of a looming autocracy and far more signs of ineffective and contentious incompetence. Trump’s been checked by the courts, by the press (make no mistake, the press forced Flynn out the door), and is now facing scrutiny from the legislature.  Here’s the reality Trump faces — he’s going to have to get better at his new job, or he’s going to find himself increasingly marginalized, not increasingly powerful. If his White House doesn’t start demonstrating basic competence (including showing that it can consistently tell the truth), the other branches of government will flex their muscles, quickly.  The Trump/Clinton race represented a series of important and consequential failures — including failures of the parties and failures of the voters. But the Founders were wise enough to anticipate our fallibility. The last few weeks have been messy and painful, but so far the guardrails are holding.

The latest iteration of the sleek 14-inch notebook features one of Intel's latest 7th-generation 'Kaby Lake' processors, 16GB of RAM as standard, and a new optional touchscreen with 4K (3840x2160px) resolution. Another standard feature is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB GDDR5 VRAM, and buyers will be able to choose 256GB, 512GB or 1TB SSD storage options. "The Razer Blade sets the benchmark for performance in thin laptops," said Razer co-founder and CEO Min-Liang Tan. "More users embraced this flagship computer model in 2016 than ever before, and we are excited to make it even more available worldwide this year. Beyond gaming, it has been really gratifying to see people enjoying the power and portability of the Blade for video editing, music creation and software development." Like other Razer notebooks, including its predecessor, the new Blade also features the company's Chroma keyboard lighting array, which can be extensively customized. There are two core versions of the new Razer Blade, which differ only based on their displays: a standard Full HD panel; or a touchscreen with 4K resolution. Key specs of both models are shown below: Feature Razer Blade Full HD Matte Razer Blade 4K UHD Display 14-inch Matte display Full HD (1920x1080px) 14-inch Capacitive multitouch 4K (3840x2160px) Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB GDDR5 VRAM) Processor Intel Core i7-7700HQ quad-core processor with Hyper-Threading 2.8GHz / 3.8GHz (Base / Turbo) Chipset Mobile Intel PCHM 100-series chipset, HM175 Storage 256GB, 512GB or 1TB SSD (PCIe M.2) Memory 16GB dual-channel onboard memory (DDR4, 2400MHz) Operating system Windows 10 (64-bit) Communication Killer Wireless-AC 1535 (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac + Bluetooth 4.1) Input + output Integrated 2MP webcam Anti-ghosting keyboard with Chroma backlighting Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) USB 3.0 x 2 (SuperSpeed) HDMI audio and video (4K at 60HZ) output Integrated 2MP webcam Anti-ghosting keyboard with Chroma backlighting Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) USB 3.0 x 2 (SuperSpeed) HDMI audio and video (4K at 60HZ) output Multi-point touchscreen interface Audio Built-in stereo speakers 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo port Array microphone Bluetooth 4.1 Dolby Digital Plus Home Theater Edition 7.1 Codec support (via HDMI) Additional features Razer Synapse enabled with programmable keyboard, backlighting and fan control Kensington Security Slot Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) security chip embedded Power Compact 165W power adapter Built-in 70Wh rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery Size 345 x 235 x 17.9mm Weight 1.86kg 1.95kg The new Razer Blade Full HD models are now available direct from Razer in: the United States, priced from $1,899 USD; Canada, from $2,749 CAD; the United Kingdom, from £1,799 GBP; and France and Germany, from €2,149 EUR.

The White House said Tuesday that President Donald Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, a hard-charging, feather-ruffling retired lieutenant general who just three weeks into the new administration had put himself in the centre of a controversy. Flynn resigned late Monday. At issue was Flynn's contact with Moscow's ambassador to the United States. Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak appear to have discussed U.S. sanctions late last year, raising questions about whether he was freelancing on foreign policy while President Barack Obama was still in office and whether he misled Trump officials about the calls. The centre of a storm is a familiar place for Flynn. His military career ended when Obama dismissed him as defence intelligence chief. Flynn claimed he was pushed out for holding tougher views than the Obama administration about Islamic extremism. But a former senior U.S. official who worked with Flynn said the firing was for insubordination, after the Army lieutenant general failed to follow guidance from superiors. Once out of government, he disappeared into the murky world of mid-level defence contractors and international influence peddlers. He shocked his former colleagues a little more than a year later by appearing at a Moscow banquet headlined by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Given a second chance by Trump, Flynn, a lifelong if apolitical Democrat, became a trusted and eager confidant of the Republican candidate, joining anti-Hillary Clinton campaign chants of "Lock Her Up" and tweeting that "Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL." As national security adviser, Flynn required no Senate confirmation vote or public vetting of his record, and his tenure was brief but turbulent. The Washington Post and other U.S. newspapers, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported last week that Flynn made explicit references to U.S. sanctions on Russia in conversations with Kislyak. One of the calls took place on Dec. 29, the day Obama announced new penalties against Russia's top intelligence agencies over allegations they meddled in the U.S. election process to help Trump win. While it's not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office, the repeated contacts just as the U.S. was pulling the trigger on sanctions suggests Trump's team might have helped shape Russia's response. They also contradicted denials about such discussions of the sanctions by several Trump administration officials, including Vice-President Mike Pence. Flynn later backed off his adamant denials. On Friday, he said he "no recollection" of discussing sanctions policy but "can't be certain," according to an official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. He apologized to Pence, who, apparently relying on Flynn's denials, vouched for him on television. In his resignation letter, Flynn said he held numerous calls with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition and gave "incomplete information" about those discussions to Pence. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump requested Flynn's resignation because of an erosion of trust. ___ INSUBORDINATION: Flynn's sparkling military resume had included key assignments at home and abroad, and high praise from superiors. The son of an Army veteran of World War II and the Korean war, Flynn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1981 after graduating from the University of Rhode Island. He started in intelligence, eventually commanding military intelligence units at the battalion and then brigade level. In the early years of the Iraq war, he was intelligence chief for Joint Special Operations Command, the organization in charge of secret commando units like SEAL Team 6 and Delta Force. He then led intelligence efforts for all U.S. military operations in the Middle East and then took up the top intelligence post on the Joint Staff in the Pentagon. Ian McCulloh, a Johns Hopkins data science specialist, became an admirer of Flynn while working as an Army lieutenant colonel in Afghanistan in 2009. At the time, Flynn ran intelligence for the U.S.-led international coalition in Kabul and was pushing for more creative approaches to targeting Taliban networks, including use of data mining and social network analysis, according to McCulloh. "He was pushing for us to think out of the box and try to leverage technology better and innovate," McCulloh said, crediting Flynn for improving the effectiveness of U.S. targeting. "A lot of people didn't like it because it was different." It was typical of the determined, though divisive, approach Flynn would adopt at the Defence Intelligence Agency, which provides military intelligence to commanders and defence policymakers. There, he quickly acquired a reputation as a disruptive force. While some applauded Flynn with forcing a tradition-bound bureaucracy to abandon old habits and seek out new, more effective ways of collecting and analyzing intelligence useful in the fight against extremist groups, others saw his efforts as erratic and his style as prone to grandstanding. In the spring of 2014, after less than two years on the job, he was told to pack his bags. According to Flynn's telling, it was his no-nonsense approach to fighting Islamic extremist groups that caused the rift. A former senior Obama administration official who was consulted during the deliberations disputed that account. Flynn was relieved of his post for insubordination after failing to follow guidance from superiors, including James Clapper, Obama's director of national intelligence, said the official, who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters. ___ CIVILIAN LIFE: Plunged into civilian life for the first time in 33 years, Flynn moved quickly to capitalize on his military and intelligence world connections and experience. He did so in an unorthodox way. "I didn't walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrup Grumman or Booz Allen or some of these other big companies," Flynn told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. Instead, he opened his own consulting firm, Flynn Intelligence Group, in Alexandria, Va. He brought in his son, Michael G. Flynn as a top aide, and began assembling a crew of former armed forces veterans with expertise in cyber, logistics and surveillance, and sought out ties with lesser-known figures and companies trying to expand their profiles as contractors in the military and intelligence spheres. One "team" member listed on the firm's site was James Woolsey, President Bill Clinton's former CIA director. Woolsey briefly joined Flynn on Trump's transition team as a senior adviser, but quit in January. Another was lobbyist Robert Kelley. Kelley proved a central player in the Flynn Group's decision to help a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's government. At the same time that Flynn was advising Trump on national security matters, Kelley was lobbying legislators on behalf of businessman Ekim Alptekin's firm between mid-September and December last year, lobbying documents show. It was an odd match. Flynn has stirred controversy with dire warnings about Islam, calling it a "political ideology" that "definitely hides behind being a religion" and accusing Obama of preventing the U.S. from "discrediting" radical Islam. But his alarms apparently didn't extend to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government as it cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup last summer. Erdogan's power base is among Turkey's conservative Muslim voters and many affected by his crackdown are secularists. Shortly before Trump's election, Flynn wrote an op-ed saying Turkey needed U.S. support and echoing Erdogan's warnings that a "shady" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be protected by the United States. Erdogan accuses the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of orchestrating the coup attempt and has requested extradition. Obama officials widely described Turkey's evidence of Gulen's wrongdoing as insufficient. Alptekin, the businessman, told The Associated Press he met Flynn several times starting last summer. He wouldn't detail their conversations. Alptekin said he met mostly with Kelley, a former chief counsel to a congressional subcommittee, who registered with Congress as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin established in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin also is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee, though he says he has no official relationship with Turkey's government. Kelley said Flynn's consulting firm could help "do something about improving the relations between Turkey and the United States," Alptekin told the AP. He said he didn't consider any need for his firm or Kelley to register with the Justice Department as a "foreign agent in this context" because his firm was "not a government entity." ___ FOREIGN AGENT? Kelley also was a registered foreign agent for the National Mobilization Force, a Turkish-backed militia fighting the Islamic State group in Syria. Documents filed with the Justice Department show Kelley was paid $90,000 to "convey the views" of the armed group to Congress, federal officials and the media. The Justice records do not cite any Kelley affiliation with the Flynn Group. But a December letter from Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to top federal intelligence officials raised questions about whether Kelley inappropriately represented the militia on behalf of Flynn's firm, which they said raises "the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents." Several ethics experts also said Flynn's firm should have registered with the Justice Department. "If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress on influencing U.S policy, they need to file under the foreign agent act," said Lydia Dennett, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington good government group. Alptekin said Inovo BV paid Flynn's firm "tens of thousands of dollars." Kelley said Flynn's firm made less than $5,000 for its three months of work on behalf of Alptekin's company when he filed a lobbying termination notice to Congress on Dec. 1. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group have not responded to multiple calls and emails from the AP. Flynn said in a statement that Kelley provided to Yahoo News in mid-November that "if I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed." The Flynn Intel Group's website no longer operates and AP visits to three northern Virginia locations associated with the firm no longer showed any company activity or identification. Several Flynn Intel Group staffers who worked for the firm and its cyber and flight subsidiaries, FIG Cyber Inc. and FIG Aviation, departed around the November election. ___ BLIMP IN A BOX Flynn had other nontraditional business engagements. In early 2015, he signed on with the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks as a member of its Public Sector Advisory Council comprising retired military officers working as a "sounding board" to answer "the technology needs of the world's governments." He advised Conversion Capital, a venture capital firm specializing in tech-oriented investments. He was briefly listed as a board director of GreenZone Systems, a technology firm headed by another Flynn Intel Group partner, Iranian-American investor Bijan Kian. And then there was Drone Aviation, a firm that makes tethered surveillance drones. Flynn was named vice chairman and a board member in May 2016, and said he would promote the firm's "blimp in a box" concept for military and government use and expand "the role of persistent aerial solutions in the marketplace." The company later won a $400,000 Defence Department contract. Drone Aviation paid Flynn a $36,000 annual salary and awarded him 100,000 shares of restricted stock. He was re-elected to the board after Trump's election but stepped down from the board after being offered his job at the White House. Another venture was Brainwave Science, a Boston company publicizing its use of "brain fingerprinting," scans that the firm claims can be used to assess a person's honesty. Flynn briefly joined the advisory board in February 2016. The firm's concept is disputed by critics and one adviser left the board after media reports surfaced that he pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to Russia's spy agency. ___ MEETING PUTIN Like many former military officials, Flynn boosted his profile by appearing on television news and talk shows, including several networks connected to foreign governments. They include Qatar-backed Al Jazeera and RT, the news network aligned with the Russian government. He has said he wasn't paid for the appearances. But a December 2015 trip to RT's 10th anniversary celebration would put Flynn in some unique company. An RT video from the Moscow event showed Flynn seated next to Putin and rising during a standing ovation following the Russian leader's address. Flynn has acknowledged being paid for the appearance, but hasn't said who wrote the check or for how much. Flynn's webpage at All American Speakers shows a standard lecture circuit fee in the $30,000-$50,000 range. According to another attendee at the event, Jill Stein, the former Green Party presidential candidate who won 1 per cent of the popular vote last November, RT paid for the Moscow event. Stein told the AP she turned down the network's offer to pay for her transportation and stay at Moscow's Hotel Metropol, where the event was held. "I didn't think it was appropriate for a presidential candidate to take money from a foreign government," she said. Before dinner, Flynn was interviewed on international issues by an RT personality. He then joined Stein and others at a front table, seated with Putin and an entourage of aides. Stein said she didn't see Flynn and Putin talk privately at the table. Flynn later told the Post that he had only a brief introduction with Putin. Flynn shrugged off the meeting as "boring." Still, several Democratic House members have asked if Flynn accepted payment from RT and if that is a violation of the federal Emoluments Clause, which prohibits even retired military officers from accepting direct or indirect payments from foreign governments. The Army said Tuesday it hasn't investigated. Flynn was both hopeful and skeptical about Russia relations before joining Trump's administration. In his 2016 book "The Field of Fight," Flynn warned that Russia had joined an "enemy alliance" with Iran. But he also talked publicly of Russia as a possible ally with the U.S. in confronting radical Islam.

"I didn't walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrup Grumman or Booz Allen or some of these other big companies," Flynn told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. Instead, he opened his own consulting firm, Flynn Intelligence Group, in Alexandria, Va. He brought in his son, Michael G. Flynn as a top aide, and began assembling a crew of former armed forces veterans with expertise in cyber, logistics and surveillance, and sought out ties with lesser-known figures and companies trying to expand their profiles as contractors in the military and intelligence spheres. One "team" member listed on the firm's site was James Woolsey, President Bill Clinton's former CIA director. Woolsey briefly joined Flynn on Trump's transition team as a senior adviser, but quit in January. Another was lobbyist Robert Kelley. Kelley proved a central player in the Flynn Group's decision to help a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's government. At the same time that Flynn was advising Trump on national security matters, Kelley was lobbying legislators on behalf of businessman Ekim Alptekin's firm between mid-September and December last year, lobbying documents show. It was an odd match. Flynn has stirred controversy with dire warnings about Islam, calling it a "political ideology" that "definitely hides behind being a religion" and accusing Obama of preventing the U.S. from "discrediting" radical Islam. But his alarms apparently didn't extend to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government as it cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup last summer. Erdogan's power base is among Turkey's conservative Muslim voters and many affected by his crackdown are secularists. Shortly before Trump's election, Flynn wrote an op-ed saying Turkey needed U.S. support and echoing Erdogan's warnings that a "shady" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be protected by the United States. Erdogan accuses the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of orchestrating the coup attempt and has requested extradition. Obama officials widely described Turkey's evidence of Gulen's wrongdoing as insufficient. Alptekin, the businessman, told The Associated Press he met Flynn several times starting last summer. He wouldn't detail their conversations. Alptekin said he met mostly with Kelley, a former chief counsel to a congressional subcommittee, who registered with Congress as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin established in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin also is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee, though he says he has no official relationship with Turkey's government. Kelley said Flynn's consulting firm could help "do something about improving the relations between Turkey and the United States," Alptekin told the AP. He said he didn't consider any need for his firm or Kelley to register with the Justice Department as a "foreign agent in this context" because his firm was "not a government entity." ___ FOREIGN AGENT? Kelley also was a registered foreign agent for the National Mobilization Force, a Turkish-backed militia fighting the Islamic State group in Syria. Documents filed with the Justice Department show Kelley was paid $90,000 to "convey the views" of the armed group to Congress, federal officials and the media. The Justice records do not cite any Kelley affiliation with the Flynn Group. But a December letter from Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to top federal intelligence officials raised questions about whether Kelley inappropriately represented the militia on behalf of Flynn's firm, which they said raises "the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents." Several ethics experts also said Flynn's firm should have registered with the Justice Department. "If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress on influencing U.S policy, they need to file under the foreign agent act," said Lydia Dennett, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington good government group. Alptekin said Inovo BV paid Flynn's firm "tens of thousands of dollars." Kelley said Flynn's firm made less than $5,000 for its three months of work on behalf of Alptekin's company when he filed a lobbying termination notice to Congress on Dec. 1. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group have not responded to multiple calls and emails from the AP. Flynn said in a statement that Kelley provided to Yahoo News in mid-November that "if I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed." The Flynn Intel Group's website no longer operates and AP visits to three northern Virginia locations associated with the firm no longer showed any company activity or identification. Several Flynn Intel Group staffers who worked for the firm and its cyber and flight subsidiaries, FIG Cyber Inc. and FIG Aviation, departed around the November election. ___ BLIMP IN A BOX Flynn had other nontraditional business engagements. In early 2015, he signed on with the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks as a member of its Public Sector Advisory Council comprising retired military officers working as a "sounding board" to answer "the technology needs of the world's governments." He advised Conversion Capital, a venture capital firm specializing in tech-oriented investments. He was briefly listed as a board director of GreenZone Systems, a technology firm headed by another Flynn Intel Group partner, Iranian-American investor Bijan Kian. And then there was Drone Aviation, a firm that makes tethered surveillance drones. Flynn was named vice chairman and a board member in May 2016, and said he would promote the firm's "blimp in a box" concept for military and government use and expand "the role of persistent aerial solutions in the marketplace." The company later won a $400,000 Defense Department contract. Drone Aviation paid Flynn a $36,000 annual salary and awarded him 100,000 shares of restricted stock. He was re-elected to the board after Trump's election but stepped down from the board after being offered his job at the White House. Another venture was Brainwave Science, a Boston company publicizing its use of "brain fingerprinting," scans that the firm claims can be used to assess a person's honesty. Flynn briefly joined the advisory board in February 2016. The firm's concept is disputed by critics and one adviser left the board after media reports surfaced that he pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to Russia's spy agency. ___ MEETING PUTIN Like many former military officials, Flynn boosted his profile by appearing on television news and talk shows, including several networks connected to foreign governments. They include Qatar-backed Al Jazeera and RT, the news network aligned with the Russian government. He has said he wasn't paid for the appearances. But a December 2015 trip to RT's 10th anniversary celebration would put Flynn in some unique company. An RT video from the Moscow event showed Flynn seated next to Putin and rising during a standing ovation following the Russian leader's address. Flynn has acknowledged being paid for the appearance, but hasn't said who wrote the check or for how much. Flynn's webpage at All American Speakers shows a standard lecture circuit fee in the $30,000-$50,000 range. According to another attendee at the event, Jill Stein, the former Green Party presidential candidate who won 1 percent of the popular vote last November, RT paid for the Moscow event. Stein told the AP she turned down the network's offer to pay for her transportation and stay at Moscow's Hotel Metropol, where the event was held. "I didn't think it was appropriate for a presidential candidate to take money from a foreign government," she said. Before dinner, Flynn was interviewed on international issues by an RT personality. He then joined Stein and others at a front table, seated with Putin and an entourage of aides. Stein said she didn't see Flynn and Putin talk privately at the table. Flynn later told the Post that he had only a brief introduction with Putin. Flynn shrugged off the meeting as "boring." Still, several Democratic House members have asked if Flynn accepted payment from RT and if that is a violation of the federal Emoluments Clause, which prohibits even retired military officers from accepting direct or indirect payments from foreign governments. The Army said Tuesday it hasn't investigated. Flynn was both hopeful and skeptical about Russia relations before joining Trump's administration. In his 2016 book "The Field of Fight," Flynn warned that Russia had joined an "enemy alliance" with Iran. But he also talked publicly of Russia as a possible ally with the U.S. in confronting radical Islam.

The White House said Tuesday that President Donald Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser, a hard-charging, feather-ruffling retired lieutenant general who just three weeks into the new administration had put himself in the center of a controversy. Flynn resigned late Monday. At issue was Flynn's contact with Moscow's ambassador to the United States. Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak appear to have discussed U.S. sanctions late last year, raising questions about whether he was freelancing on foreign policy while President Barack Obama was still in office and whether he misled Trump officials about the calls. The center of a storm is a familiar place for Flynn. His military career ended when Obama dismissed him as defense intelligence chief. Flynn claimed he was pushed out for holding tougher views than the Obama administration about Islamic extremism. But a former senior U.S. official who worked with Flynn said the firing was for insubordination, after the Army lieutenant general failed to follow guidance from superiors. Once out of government, he disappeared into the murky world of mid-level defense contractors and international influence peddlers. He shocked his former colleagues a little more than a year later by appearing at a Moscow banquet headlined by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Given a second chance by Trump, Flynn, a lifelong if apolitical Democrat, became a trusted and eager confidant of the Republican candidate, joining anti-Hillary Clinton campaign chants of "Lock Her Up" and tweeting that "Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL." As national security adviser, Flynn required no Senate confirmation vote or public vetting of his record, and his tenure was brief but turbulent. The Washington Post and other U.S. newspapers, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported last week that Flynn made explicit references to U.S. sanctions on Russia in conversations with Kislyak. One of the calls took place on Dec. 29, the day Obama announced new penalties against Russia's top intelligence agencies over allegations they meddled in the U.S. election process to help Trump win. While it's not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office, the repeated contacts just as the U.S. was pulling the trigger on sanctions suggests Trump's team might have helped shape Russia's response. They also contradicted denials about such discussions of the sanctions by several Trump administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn later backed off his adamant denials. On Friday, he said he "no recollection" of discussing sanctions policy but "can't be certain," according to an official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. He apologized to Pence, who, apparently relying on Flynn's denials, vouched for him on television. In his resignation letter, Flynn said he held numerous calls with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition and gave "incomplete information" about those discussions to Pence. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that Trump requested Flynn's resignation because of an erosion of trust. ___ INSUBORDINATION: Flynn's sparkling military resume had included key assignments at home and abroad, and high praise from superiors. The son of an Army veteran of World War II and the Korean war, Flynn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1981 after graduating from the University of Rhode Island. He started in intelligence, eventually commanding military intelligence units at the battalion and then brigade level. In the early years of the Iraq war, he was intelligence chief for Joint Special Operations Command, the organization in charge of secret commando units like SEAL Team 6 and Delta Force. He then led intelligence efforts for all U.S. military operations in the Middle East and then took up the top intelligence post on the Joint Staff in the Pentagon. Ian McCulloh, a Johns Hopkins data science specialist, became an admirer of Flynn while working as an Army lieutenant colonel in Afghanistan in 2009. At the time, Flynn ran intelligence for the U.S.-led international coalition in Kabul and was pushing for more creative approaches to targeting Taliban networks, including use of data mining and social network analysis, according to McCulloh. "He was pushing for us to think out of the box and try to leverage technology better and innovate," McCulloh said, crediting Flynn for improving the effectiveness of U.S. targeting. "A lot of people didn't like it because it was different." It was typical of the determined, though divisive, approach Flynn would adopt at the Defense Intelligence Agency, which provides military intelligence to commanders and defense policymakers. There, he quickly acquired a reputation as a disruptive force. While some applauded Flynn with forcing a tradition-bound bureaucracy to abandon old habits and seek out new, more effective ways of collecting and analyzing intelligence useful in the fight against extremist groups, others saw his efforts as erratic and his style as prone to grandstanding. In the spring of 2014, after less than two years on the job, he was told to pack his bags. According to Flynn's telling, it was his no-nonsense approach to fighting Islamic extremist groups that caused the rift. A former senior Obama administration official who was consulted during the deliberations disputed that account. Flynn was relieved of his post for insubordination after failing to follow guidance from superiors, including James Clapper, Obama's director of national intelligence, said the official, who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters. ___ CIVILIAN LIFE: Plunged into civilian life for the first time in 33 years, Flynn moved quickly to capitalize on his military and intelligence world connections and experience. He did so in an unorthodox way. "I didn't walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrup Grumman or Booz Allen or some of these other big companies," Flynn told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. Instead, he opened his own consulting firm, Flynn Intelligence Group, in Alexandria, Va. He brought in his son, Michael G. Flynn as a top aide, and began assembling a crew of former armed forces veterans with expertise in cyber, logistics and surveillance, and sought out ties with lesser-known figures and companies trying to expand their profiles as contractors in the military and intelligence spheres. One "team" member listed on the firm's site was James Woolsey, President Bill Clinton's former CIA director. Woolsey briefly joined Flynn on Trump's transition team as a senior adviser, but quit in January. Another was lobbyist Robert Kelley. Kelley proved a central player in the Flynn Group's decision to help a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's government.

Last fall, SecureKey raised C$27 million from six of Canada's top banks, including Royal bank of Canada (RY.TO) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO). Other previous investors included Intel Capital, Visa Inc (V.N) and Canadian telecom firms. The companies, along with different levels of government, have partnered to lay the groundwork for a national digital identity network they hope to launch commercially later this year. The Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC), a non-profit coalition of public and private sector organizations, aims to build a national system that allows the public to access online services without memorizing dozens of passwords, or prove their identity, while still maintaining their privacy and security. The grant for up to $800,000 from Command Control and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analytics (CCICADA) will help build the necessary infrastructure to make that happen, SecureKey's chief identity officer Andre Boysen said in an interview. "In today's world, every organization acts on its own," said Boysen. "Digital identity is bigger than any one organization ... it takes a village to make digital identity work." Consumers need a trustworthy mechanism to prove someone's identity and make identity fraud difficult in today's increasingly digital environment, Boysen said. The company uses blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to create a "triple blind" privacy protocol that allow individuals to easily connect to partnering online services using an existing, trusted log in credential, while limiting the actual amount of data being transmitted for security. Blockchain is a distributed record of transactions, or other data, maintained by a network of computers without the need for approval from a central authority. The technology makes large-scale hacking extremely difficult. The "triple blind" mechanism means a consumer can use their bank credentials to log in, for example, and access their destination service, but the bank can not see where the data is going, and the recipient can not see which bank is used or any bank account information. As a middleman, SecureKey is similarly "blind" and cannot see who is using the services. "That's why DHS is interested, because now we have scalable market service with very, very good privacy and that's what we're using blockchain for. It helps us implement blinding," said Boysen.

(Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) 47 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORE White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller doubled down on President Trump’s unsupported claim that thousands of voters were bused in from Massachusetts to vote illegally in New Hampshire. Despite multiple prods from ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos to provide evidence, Miller did not — instead he said the practice was common knowledge to “anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics.” New Hampshire’s deputy secretary of state told us there is no evidence of organized efforts to bring in voters from out of state. Miller then went on to repeat the baseless claim of massive voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election across the country, based on two studies that show no such thing. Busing voters from Massachusetts? Miller’s comments came as he attempted to defend the president’s reported comments about voter fraud in New Hampshire to a group of senators in a private meeting last week. Trump claimed that he lost New Hampshire in the general election because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused in to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. “Having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics,” Miller said on ABC’s This Week on Feb. 12. “It’s very real, it’s very serious.” When Stephanopoulos asked for evidence of people being bused in from Massachusetts to vote illegally in New Hampshire, Miller said, “Talk to anybody who has worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody is aware of the problem in New Hampshire with respect to bringing in voters.” Not everyone. Republican Thomas D. Rath, the former New Hampshire attorney general who did not support Trump in the primary, tweeted this: Let me as be unequivocal as possible-allegations of voter fraud in NH are baseless,without any merit-it's shameful to spread these fantasies— Tom Rath (@polguru) February 12, 2017 On CNN, Rath went on to say that Miller’s comments were “not connected to reality.” “People were not bused in here illegally,” Rath said. “That did not happen,” he added, pausing on each word for emphasis. Fergus Cullen, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party in 2007-2008, who said he has been working on elections in the state for the better part of two decades, called Miller’s statement “completely preposterous” and “absolutely delusional.” Claims of people being bused in to New Hampshire from out of state are probably as old as buses themselves, Cullen told us in a phone interview. “It’s been made in many elections,” Cullen said. “But it is completely baseless, completely false.” The rumor likely gains traction due to the state’s same-day voter registration policy. That means eligible voters can show up and vote on Election Day if they sign an affidavit attesting that New Hampshire is their “domicile,” and they get a photo taken. The state’s domicile law is pretty vague on requirements for residency, Cullen said. And so it is possible for someone who only moved to the state a week before to legally vote there. The law also allows college students from out of state to vote in New Hampshire, although it would still be illegal to vote in more than one state (or at more than one New Hampshire polling place). Much as some may not like the same-day registration law — and Cullen said he’s not a fan — it is the state law. But people availing themselves of same-day registration, legally, is different from thousands of Massachusetts residents being bused in to vote illegally in New Hampshire. The idea that people could quietly pull off such a scheme in an age when anyone with a cellphone could document a bus bringing in people from out of state is preposterous, Cullen said. And Republicans who say they don’t like same-day registration have only themselves to blame, Cullen said. The same-day registration law, he said, was passed in 1996 by a Republican majority to get around the federal motor voter law, which requires states to offer voter registration at the DMV when people get their driver’s licenses or at state agencies that provide public assistance. Cullen said Republicans feared that would be a boon to Democratic Party registration. David Scanlan, deputy secretary of state for New Hampshire, told us in a phone interview that there were about 5,000 domicile affidavits signed on Election Day in November. According to the law, he said, people could have moved to New Hampshire on Election Day and still could have been eligible to vote there. But the state has ways to check up on that. The state sends out a verification mailing to those who sign domicile applications, Scanlan said. Those that come back as undeliverable are referred to the attorney general for investigation. State officials have yet to complete that process, he said. Every election, he said, state officials have come across a few cases of voter fraud. But, he said, “We really don’t have any evidence of any organized effort from another state to send people to try to change the outcome of the vote.” Such an organized effort would be logistically difficult to pull off, Scanlan said, and the penalties are severe. Voting by a person who is knowingly unqualified to vote is a class B felony in New Hampshire, and the court can impose a maximum range of between 3.5 years to 7 years in prison and a fine of up to $2,000. It also could carry a civil penalty. Each town is its own polling place with its own slate of elected polling officials, Scanlan said. “They have a pretty good handle on the pulse of the place,” he said. “They would sense if there was something going on in terms of busloads of people coming in, and it would be reported.” “We just don’t see it,” Scanlan said. “I don’t think we’ve ever had a complaint of busloads of people coming in from out of state.” Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers University and author of The Myth of Voter Fraud, said the allegation of “busloads” of people coming in to vote from out of state is a common urban myth, particularly in New Hampshire. Minnite says that’s in part because courts have ruled that it’s OK for students to claim domicile in New Hampshire while attending New Hampshire colleges from out of state. And New Hampshire has several universities in small towns. But that’s not the same as people being bused in from out of state to vote illegally. There is simply no evidence of that, Minnite told us. “For him [Miller] to claim, belligerently and with no evidence, something that is a completely untrue myth, that gets everyone upset about the integrity of our elections, it’s incredibly reckless,” she said. “They need to provide the evidence, or stop it.” President Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 13, 2017.  (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Noncitizens, dead voters and more Miller went on to talk about voter fraud across the country, arguing that Trump was “correct 100%” when he said he would have won the popular vote if not for 3 million to 5 million illegal votes. Trump won the election with a convincing victory in the Electoral College, but Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes. “But I can tell you this, voter fraud is a serious problem in this country,” Miller said. “You have millions of people who are registered in two states or who are dead who are registered to vote. And you have 14% of noncitizens, according to academic research, at a minimum, are registered to vote, which is an astonishing statistic.” We won’t go into this too deeply, as we have covered it numerous times in-depth. When it comes to “people who are registered in two states or who are dead who are registered to vote,” Miller is referring to a 2012 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts, titled “Inaccurate, Costly and Inefficient: Evidence That America’s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade.” That report found that “more than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters” and that “approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.” The report’s authors said it shows that voter rolls are “susceptible to fraud,” and that it is evidence of the need to upgrade voter registration systems. But the study’s lead author made clear that the study “found no evidence that voter fraud resulted.” As for Miller’s claim that “you have 14% of noncitizens, according to academic research, at a minimum, are registered to vote,” that’s based on research by two Old Dominion University professors published in the journal Electoral Studies. That study drew upon a national election survey in which 14% of people who self-identified as noncitizens in both 2008 and 2010 samples indicated they were registered to vote. Based on those who reported that they actually voted, the authors estimated that 6.4% of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2% of noncitizens voted in 2010. That study was blasted in a rebuttal paper written by a Harvard professor who helps to maintain the voting database. He attributed the results to “measurement error” — noting, for example, that a small number of people had marked in some years that they were noncitizens, but not in other years. The rebuttal paper concluded that “the likely percent of non-citizen voters in recent US elections is 0.” We second Stephanopoulos, who ended his interview with Miller by saying, “But, for the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. … You have provided zero evidence that the president’s claim that he would have won the general — the popular vote if 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn’t voted, zero evidence for either one of those claims.” Read more: FEC official wants proof of New Hampshire voter fraud claims The first 100 days of the Trump presidency FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images) 13232 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee will introduce a bill this week that would force President Trump to disclose his income, assets and liabilities in a foreign country before he embarks on new trade negotiations, his aides tell USA TODAY. The measure from Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden also would require similar disclosure when the president takes other actions on international trade, such as reducing tariffs to give developing countries better access to U.S. markets. “Americans have a right to know if the President is looking out for the good of the country or just his own bottom line when he negotiates a trade deal, decides whether or not to enforce our trade laws, or decides whether to cut tariffs on imports from a developing country,” Wyden said in a statement. “Trump has business interests around the world, but he continues to keep the full nature of those ties secret.” Wyden’s proposal marks the latest push by Democrats on Capitol Hill and independent watchdogs to pressure the Trump administration, as they clamor for investigations into a top White House aide and search for novel ways to force the new president to disclose more information about his vast business interests and the ethics questions that have dogged him since his Jan. 20 swearing-in. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and five other Democratic senators recently wrote to White House counsel Don McGahn, asking him to rein in possible ethics violations after top White House aide Kellyanne Conway touted Ivanka Trump’s clothing line during a television interview. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., and Tom Udall, D-N.M., have sought the membership list for Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private resort in Palm Beach, Fla. On Monday, the head of the House's tax oversight committee, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, shot down a Democratic proposal to use a little-known 1924 law to demand the Treasury Department turn over 10 years of Trump’s tax returns to lawmakers. White House officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sen.

As president, Trump has moved quickly on trade deals, taking executive action during his first week in office to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal pushed by President Obama. He also has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico. Trump has transferred day-to-day management responsibilities of his international real-estate and branding empire to Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and a longtime Trump executive. But he has refused to release his tax returns — citing an IRS audit — or to relinquish ownership of the Trump Organization, prompting continued scrutiny about the government's entanglement with the Trump brand. Over the weekend, for instance, he hosted Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-a-Lago, which he has dubbed the winter White House. On Saturday night, other diners at the club looked on as Trump and his aides worked on their response to North Korea’s missile test. A club member posted pictures of their interactions on Facebook. White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that no classified information was reviewed during the dinner on the resort's patio. Democrats face long odds of their efforts gaining much traction in a Republican-controlled Congress, but they increasingly feel emboldened by the fury of Democratic activists who have taken their protests to the streets and into congressional town hall meetings in the first weeks of the Trump administration, political observers say. "The Democrats, driven by their supporters, are determined to inquire into all of these open questions," said Cal Jillson, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  “There is a very broad sense among the people who are not die-hard supporters of Donald Trump that there are so many unanswered questions and so many ethical strings to be pulled, that the sweater will unravel." Questions mount Trump's allies have said that liquidating his business is not a realistic option and would pose its own problems, such as buyers paying more than fair-market value for pieces of the empire in an effort to curry favor with the president. The Trump Organization's new management structure includes an internal chief compliance counsel and an outside ethics adviser, veteran Republican lawyer Bobby Burchfield, who reviews and signs off on significant business transactions that could pose conflicts of interest. But in a little over three weeks in office, Trump and his family have had to navigate a myriad of questions about the connections between his official duties and the Trump family’s business interests. Some examples: • First lady Melania Trump’s contention in a recently filed libel lawsuit against The Daily Mail that the newspaper’s unfounded allegations about her past jeopardized her ability to garner “multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which the Plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.” • The promotion of Ivanka Trump and her fashion line by Trump and his aides. After Trump took to Twitter last week to castigate Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s clothing line, two White House staffers swiftly voiced support. Spicer told reporters department store chain's decision amounted to a personal attack on Ivanka Trump because of her father’s policies. "He has every right to stand up for his family," Spicer said. Conway, in an interview from the White House briefing room, went further, encouraging viewers of Fox & Friends to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff.” • Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump also have maintained high profiles. Earlier this month, Trump’s sons made a front-row appearance during their father’s televised announcement of Judge Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee. In addition, The Washington Post recently reported that a January business trip to Uruguay by Eric Trump cost taxpayers nearly $100,000 in hotel expenses for the Secret Service and embassy staff.

In recent interviews with The New York Times, the Trump sons say they do not cross ethical lines by discussing Trump Organization matters with their father. They said they were in Washington the day of the Gorsuch announcement for business at the Trump International Hotel and visited the White House to say hello to their father and enjoy the historic occasion. Conway’s promotion of Ivanka Trump’s fashion line last week prompted a rare rebuke from a Republican, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who called her remarks “wrong, wrong, wrong” on Twitter. Chaffetz and the committee’s top Democrat, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, also sent a letter to the federal government’s top ethics regulator, questioning whether Conway broke federal rules that bar public officials from promoting products. In a letter released Tuesday, the head of the Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub said Conway's comments likely violated ethics rules and asked the White House to investigate her conduct and report back to his office by Feb. 28. Conway pushed back, noting in a recent tweet that she has the president's support and that "millions of Americans support him and his agenda."

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) 28093 CONNECTTWEET 193 LINKEDIN 377 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — The White House has posted inaccurate texts of President Trump's own executive orders on the White House website, raising further questions about how thorough the Trump administration has been in drafting some of his most controversial actions. A USA TODAY review of presidential documents found at least five cases where the version posted on the White House website doesn't match the official version sent to the Federal Register. The differences include minor grammatical changes, missing words and paragraph renumbering — but also two cases where the original text referred to inaccurate or non-existent provisions of law. By law, the Federal Register version is the legally controlling language. But it can often take several days for the order to be published, meaning that the public must often rely on what the White House puts out — and that's sometimes inaccurate. For example: ► The controversial travel ban executive order suspended the Visa Interview Waiver Program and required the secretary of State to enforce a section of the Immigration and Naturalization Act requiring an in-person interview for everyone seeking a non-immigrant visa. But the White House version of the order referred to that provision as 8 U.S.C. 1222, which requires a physical and mental examination — not 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires an interview. ► An executive order on ethical standards for administration appointees, as it appears on the White House website, refers to"section 207 of title 28" of the U.S. Code. As the nonprofit news site Pro Publica reported last week, that section does not exist. The Federal Register correctly cited section 207 of title 18, which does exist. Transparency advocates said the discrepancies raise unnecessary concerns about Trump's executive actions. "These last-minute edits suggest the Trump White House needs to revisit their vetting, sign-off, and publication processes for executive orders," said John Wonderlich, executive director of the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation. The White House has faced questions about the vetting of executive orders, especially the order suspending travel for nationals of seven majority-Muslim countries. That order caused confusion inside and outside the administration and led to the firing of acting Attorney General Sally Yates when she refused to defend it in court. Trump has signed almost all of his executive orders in public ceremonies. The White House Staff Secretary's office then sends the original, signed copy to the Office of the Federal Register, which is part of the National Archives. The Federal Register says its version is the exact text of what the president approved. "We would never correct something that the president signs," said Jim Hemphill, special assistant to the director of the Federal Register. "Once the president's signature is on that, that's a legal document that we would never change." Read more: Presidential memoranda vs. executive orders. What's the difference? He calls them 'big stuff,' but most of Trump's executive orders are presidential small ball Reality check: After three weeks, Trump has hit a Washington wall The White House did not respond to a request for comment Monday. It's unclear whether the press office somehow released out-of-date copies of executive orders, or whether the president signed new orders correcting mistakes before they were sent to the Federal Register. Among the other discrepancies: ► An executive order asking the secretary of Labor to re-examine the "Fiduciary Rule" is missing the beginning of a sentence describing what rule the memo is referring to. The official version reads, "The Department of Labor's (Department) final rule entitled, Definition of the Term ‘Fiduciary.' " The White House version simply says "Term 'Fiduciary.' " ► A memorandum on construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline contained minor grammatical changes, with the official version putting instructions to the secretary of the Army in the passive voice. Instead of "the Secretary of the Army shall promptly provide a copy of this memorandum" to Congress, the final text said "a copy of this memorandum shall be provided immediately." ► The Federal Register renumbered a presidential memorandum on a plan to defeat the Islamic State to include a Section 3. The White House version put all the effective clauses in Section 2.  FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Despite multiple prods from ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos to provide evidence, Miller did not — instead he said the practice was common knowledge to “anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics.” New Hampshire’s deputy secretary of state told us there is no evidence of organized efforts to bring in voters from out of state. Miller then went on to repeat the baseless claim of massive voter fraud in the 2016 presidential election across the country, based on two studies that show no such thing. Busing voters from Massachusetts? Miller’s comments came as he attempted to defend the president’s reported comments about voter fraud in New Hampshire to a group of senators in a private meeting last week. Trump claimed that he lost New Hampshire in the general election because thousands of Massachusetts residents were bused in to New Hampshire to cast illegal votes against him. “Having worked before on a campaign in New Hampshire, I can tell you that this issue of busing voters into New Hampshire is widely known by anyone who’s worked in New Hampshire politics,” Miller said on ABC’s This Week on Feb. 12. “It’s very real, it’s very serious.” When Stephanopoulos asked for evidence of people being bused in from Massachusetts to vote illegally in New Hampshire, Miller said, “Talk to anybody who has worked in politics there for a long time. Everybody is aware of the problem in New Hampshire with respect to bringing in voters.” Not everyone. Republican Thomas D. Rath, the former New Hampshire attorney general who did not support Trump in the primary, tweeted this: Let me as be unequivocal as possible-allegations of voter fraud in NH are baseless,without any merit-it's shameful to spread these fantasies— Tom Rath (@polguru) February 12, 2017 On CNN, Rath went on to say that Miller’s comments were “not connected to reality.” “People were not bused in here illegally,” Rath said. “That did not happen,” he added, pausing on each word for emphasis. Fergus Cullen, a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party in 2007-2008, who said he has been working on elections in the state for the better part of two decades, called Miller’s statement “completely preposterous” and “absolutely delusional.” Claims of people being bused in to New Hampshire from out of state are probably as old as buses themselves, Cullen told us in a phone interview. “It’s been made in many elections,” Cullen said. “But it is completely baseless, completely false.” The rumor likely gains traction due to the state’s same-day voter registration policy. That means eligible voters can show up and vote on Election Day if they sign an affidavit attesting that New Hampshire is their “domicile,” and they get a photo taken. The state’s domicile law is pretty vague on requirements for residency, Cullen said. And so it is possible for someone who only moved to the state a week before to legally vote there. The law also allows college students from out of state to vote in New Hampshire, although it would still be illegal to vote in more than one state (or at more than one New Hampshire polling place). Much as some may not like the same-day registration law — and Cullen said he’s not a fan — it is the state law. But people availing themselves of same-day registration, legally, is different from thousands of Massachusetts residents being bused in to vote illegally in New Hampshire. The idea that people could quietly pull off such a scheme in an age when anyone with a cellphone could document a bus bringing in people from out of state is preposterous, Cullen said. And Republicans who say they don’t like same-day registration have only themselves to blame, Cullen said. The same-day registration law, he said, was passed in 1996 by a Republican majority to get around the federal motor voter law, which requires states to offer voter registration at the DMV when people get their driver’s licenses or at state agencies that provide public assistance. Cullen said Republicans feared that would be a boon to Democratic Party registration. David Scanlan, deputy secretary of state for New Hampshire, told us in a phone interview that there were about 5,000 domicile affidavits signed on Election Day in November. According to the law, he said, people could have moved to New Hampshire on Election Day and still could have been eligible to vote there. But the state has ways to check up on that. The state sends out a verification mailing to those who sign domicile applications, Scanlan said. Those that come back as undeliverable are referred to the attorney general for investigation. State officials have yet to complete that process, he said. Every election, he said, state officials have come across a few cases of voter fraud. But, he said, “We really don’t have any evidence of any organized effort from another state to send people to try to change the outcome of the vote.” Such an organized effort would be logistically difficult to pull off, Scanlan said, and the penalties are severe. Voting by a person who is knowingly unqualified to vote is a class B felony in New Hampshire, and the court can impose a maximum range of between 3.5 years to 7 years in prison and a fine of up to $2,000. It also could carry a civil penalty. Each town is its own polling place with its own slate of elected polling officials, Scanlan said. “They have a pretty good handle on the pulse of the place,” he said. “They would sense if there was something going on in terms of busloads of people coming in, and it would be reported.” “We just don’t see it,” Scanlan said. “I don’t think we’ve ever had a complaint of busloads of people coming in from out of state.” Lorraine Minnite, a professor at Rutgers University and author of The Myth of Voter Fraud, said the allegation of “busloads” of people coming in to vote from out of state is a common urban myth, particularly in New Hampshire. Minnite says that’s in part because courts have ruled that it’s OK for students to claim domicile in New Hampshire while attending New Hampshire colleges from out of state. And New Hampshire has several universities in small towns. But that’s not the same as people being bused in from out of state to vote illegally. There is simply no evidence of that, Minnite told us. “For him [Miller] to claim, belligerently and with no evidence, something that is a completely untrue myth, that gets everyone upset about the integrity of our elections, it’s incredibly reckless,” she said. “They need to provide the evidence, or stop it.” President Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 13, 2017.  (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images) Noncitizens, dead voters and more Miller went on to talk about voter fraud across the country, arguing that Trump was “correct 100%” when he said he would have won the popular vote if not for 3 million to 5 million illegal votes. Trump won the election with a convincing victory in the Electoral College, but Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes. “But I can tell you this, voter fraud is a serious problem in this country,” Miller said. “You have millions of people who are registered in two states or who are dead who are registered to vote. And you have 14% of noncitizens, according to academic research, at a minimum, are registered to vote, which is an astonishing statistic.” We won’t go into this too deeply, as we have covered it numerous times in-depth. When it comes to “people who are registered in two states or who are dead who are registered to vote,” Miller is referring to a 2012 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts, titled “Inaccurate, Costly and Inefficient: Evidence That America’s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade.” That report found that “more than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters” and that “approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.” The report’s authors said it shows that voter rolls are “susceptible to fraud,” and that it is evidence of the need to upgrade voter registration systems. But the study’s lead author made clear that the study “found no evidence that voter fraud resulted.” As for Miller’s claim that “you have 14% of noncitizens, according to academic research, at a minimum, are registered to vote,” that’s based on research by two Old Dominion University professors published in the journal Electoral Studies. That study drew upon a national election survey in which 14% of people who self-identified as noncitizens in both 2008 and 2010 samples indicated they were registered to vote. Based on those who reported that they actually voted, the authors estimated that 6.4% of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2% of noncitizens voted in 2010. That study was blasted in a rebuttal paper written by a Harvard professor who helps to maintain the voting database. He attributed the results to “measurement error” — noting, for example, that a small number of people had marked in some years that they were noncitizens, but not in other years. The rebuttal paper concluded that “the likely percent of non-citizen voters in recent US elections is 0.” We second Stephanopoulos, who ended his interview with Miller by saying, “But, for the record, you have provided zero evidence that the president was the victim of massive voter fraud in New Hampshire. … You have provided zero evidence that the president’s claim that he would have won the general — the popular vote if 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants hadn’t voted, zero evidence for either one of those claims.” Read more: FEC official wants proof of New Hampshire voter fraud claims The first 100 days of the Trump presidency FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedIn President Trump: A new era in Washington begins  Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Ya Libnan Lebanon News and World News Live from Beirut Featured News Lebanon News World News Opinion Business News Arts & Culture Sci & Tech Video Flynn, fired once by Obama, now resigns to Trump February 14, 2017 by yalibnan 3 Comments Michael Flynn quits over secret contacts with Russia Fired by one American commander in chief for insubordination, Michael Flynn has now delivered his resignation  to another. President Donald Trump had been weighing the fate of his national security adviser, a hard-charging, feather-ruffling retired lieutenant general who just three weeks into the new administration had put himself in the center of a controversy. Flynn resigned late Monday. At issue was Flynn’s contact with Moscow’s ambassador to the United States. Flynn and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak appear to have discussed U.S. sanctions late last year, raising questions about whether he was freelancing on foreign policy while President Barack Obama was still in office and whether he misled Trump officials about the calls. The center of a storm is a familiar place for Flynn. His military career ended when Obama dismissed him as defense intelligence chief. Flynn claimed he was pushed out for holding tougher views than the Obama administration about Islamic extremism. But a former senior U.S. official who worked with Flynn said the firing was for insubordination, after the Army lieutenant general failed to follow guidance from superiors. Flynn stepped down late Monday, ending days of speculation about his fate following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin, center right, sits with retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, center left, at a dinner in Moscow in 2015. Putin who favored Donal Trump was accused of manipulating the US election by hacking Hillary Clinton’s campaign . (Mikhail Klimentyev/Pool photo by Sputnik via AP) Once out of government, he disappeared into the murky world of mid-level defense contractors and international influence peddlers. He shocked his former colleagues a little more than a year later by appearing at a Moscow banquet headlined by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Given a second chance by Trump, Flynn, a lifelong if apolitical Democrat, became a trusted and eager confidant of the Republican candidate, joining anti-Hillary Clinton campaign chants of “Lock Her Up” and tweeting that “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.” As national security adviser, Flynn required no Senate confirmation vote or public vetting of his record, and his tenure was brief but turbulent. The Washington Post and other U.S. newspapers, citing current and former U.S. officials, reported last week that Flynn made explicit references to U.S. sanctions on Russia in conversations with Kislyak. One of the calls took place on Dec. 29, the day Obama announced new penalties against Russia’s top intelligence agencies over allegations they meddled in the U.S. election process to help Trump win. National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has resigned in disgrace, and both Democrats and the media’s punditocracy see much more than one rogue, lying White House official. While it’s not unusual for incoming administrations to have discussions with foreign governments before taking office, the repeated contacts just as the U.S. was pulling the trigger on sanctions suggests Trump’s team might have helped shape Russia’s response. They also contradicted denials about such discussions of the sanctions by several Trump administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn later backed off his adamant denials. On Friday, he said he “no recollection” of discussing sanctions policy but “can’t be certain,” according to an official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. He apologized to Pence, who, apparently relying on Flynn’s denials, vouched for him on television. In his resignation letter, Flynn said he held numerous calls with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition and gave “incomplete information” about those discussions to Pence. For days, Trump was publicly and unusually quiet on the matter. While his aides were declaring the president had confidence in Flynn, Trump privately told associates he was troubled by the situation, according to a person who spoke with him recently. INSUBORDINATION Flynn’s sparkling military resume had included key assignments at home and abroad, and high praise from superiors. The son of an Army veteran of World War II and the Korean war, Flynn was commissioned as a second lieutenant in May 1981 after graduating from the University of Rhode Island. He started in intelligence, eventually commanding military intelligence units at the battalion and then brigade level. In the early years of the Iraq war, he was intelligence chief for Joint Special Operations Command, the organization in charge of secret commando units like SEAL Team 6 and Delta Force. He then led intelligence efforts for all U.S. military operations in the Middle East and then took up the top intelligence post on the Joint Staff in the Pentagon. Ian McCulloh, a Johns Hopkins data science specialist, became an admirer of Flynn while working as an Army lieutenant colonel in Afghanistan in 2009. At the time, Flynn ran intelligence for the U.S.-led international coalition in Kabul and was pushing for more creative approaches to targeting Taliban networks, including use of data mining and social network analysis, according to McCulloh. “He was pushing for us to think out of the box and try to leverage technology better and innovate,” McCulloh said, crediting Flynn for improving the effectiveness of U.S. targeting. “A lot of people didn’t like it because it was different.” It was typical of the determined, though divisive, approach Flynn would adopt at the Defense Intelligence Agency, which provides military intelligence to commanders and defense policymakers. There, he quickly acquired a reputation as a disruptive force. While some applauded Flynn with forcing a tradition-bound bureaucracy to abandon old habits and seek out new, more effective ways of collecting and analyzing intelligence useful in the fight against extremist groups, others saw his efforts as erratic and his style as prone to grandstanding. In the spring of 2014, after less than two years on the job, he was told to pack his bags. According to Flynn’s telling, it was his no-nonsense approach to fighting Islamic extremist groups that caused the rift. A former senior Obama administration official who was consulted during the deliberations disputed that account. Flynn was relieved of his post for insubordination after failing to follow guidance from superiors, including James Clapper, Obama’s director of national intelligence, said the official, who asked for anonymity to discuss personnel matters. CIVILIAN LIFE Plunged into civilian life for the first time in 33 years, Flynn moved quickly to capitalize on his military and intelligence world connections and experience. He did so in an unorthodox way. “I didn’t walk out like a lot of guys and go to big jobs in Northrup Grumman or Booz Allen or some of these other big companies,” Flynn told Foreign Policy magazine in 2015. Instead, he opened his own consulting firm, Flynn Intelligence Group, in Alexandria, Va. He brought in his son, Michael G. Flynn as a top aide, and began assembling a crew of former armed forces veterans with expertise in cyber, logistics and surveillance, and sought out ties with lesser-known figures and companies trying to expand their profiles as contractors in the military and intelligence spheres. One “team” member listed on the firm’s site was James Woolsey, President Bill Clinton’s former CIA director. Woolsey briefly joined Flynn on Trump’s transition team as a senior adviser, but quit in January. Another was lobbyist Robert Kelley. Kelley proved a central player in the Flynn Group’s decision to help a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey’s government. At the same time that Flynn was advising Trump on national security matters, Kelley was lobbying legislators on behalf of businessman Ekim Alptekin’s firm between mid-September and December last year, lobbying documents show. It was an odd match. Flynn has stirred controversy with dire warnings about Islam, calling it a “political ideology” that “definitely hides behind being a religion” and accusing Obama of preventing the U.S. from “discrediting” radical Islam. But his alarms apparently didn’t extend to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government as it cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup last summer. Erdogan’s power base is among Turkey’s conservative Muslim voters and many affected by his crackdown are secularists. Shortly before Trump’s election, Flynn wrote an op-ed saying Turkey needed U.S. support and echoing Erdogan’s warnings that a “shady” Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be protected by the United States. Erdogan accuses the cleric, Fethullah Gulen, of orchestrating the coup attempt and has requested extradition. Obama officials widely described Turkey’s evidence of Gulen’s wrongdoing as insufficient. Alptekin, the businessman, told The Associated Press he met Flynn several times starting last summer. He wouldn’t detail their conversations. Alptekin said he met mostly with Kelley, a former chief counsel to a congressional subcommittee, who registered with Congress as a lobbyist for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin established in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin also is a member of a Turkish economic relations board run by an Erdogan appointee, though he says he has no official relationship with Turkey’s government. Kelley said Flynn’s consulting firm could help “do something about improving the relations between Turkey and the United States,” Alptekin told the AP. He said he didn’t consider any need for his firm or Kelley to register with the Justice Department as a “foreign agent in this context” because his firm was “not a government entity.” FOREIGN AGENT? Kelley also was a registered foreign agent for the National Mobilization Force, a Turkish-backed militia fighting the Islamic State group in Syria. Documents filed with the Justice Department show Kelley was paid $90,000 to “convey the views” of the armed group to Congress, federal officials and the media. The Justice records do not cite any Kelley affiliation with the Flynn Group. But a December letter from Democratic senators Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to top federal intelligence officials raised questions about whether Kelley inappropriately represented the militia on behalf of Flynn’s firm, which they said raises “the potential for pressure, coercion, and exploitation by foreign agents.” Several ethics experts also said Flynn’s firm should have registered with the Justice Department. “If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress on influencing U.S policy, they need to file under the foreign agent act,” said Lydia Dennett, an investigator with the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington good government group. Alptekin said Inovo BV paid Flynn’s firm “tens of thousands of dollars.” Kelley said Flynn’s firm made less than $5,000 for its three months of work on behalf of Alptekin’s company when he filed a lobbying termination notice to Congress on Dec. 1. Kelley and Flynn Intel Group have not responded to multiple calls and emails from the AP. Flynn said in a statement that Kelley provided to Yahoo News in mid-November that “if I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed.” The Flynn Intel Group’s website no longer operates and AP visits to three northern Virginia locations associated with the firm no longer showed any company activity or identification. Several Flynn Intel Group staffers who worked for the firm and its cyber and flight subsidiaries, FIG Cyber Inc. and FIG Aviation, departed around the November election. BLIMP IN A BOX Flynn had other nontraditional business engagements. In early 2015, he signed on with the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks as a member of its Public Sector Advisory Council comprising retired military officers working as a “sounding board” to answer “the technology needs of the world’s governments.” He advised Conversion Capital, a venture capital firm specializing in tech-oriented investments. He was briefly listed as a board director of GreenZone Systems, a technology firm headed by another Flynn Intel Group partner, Iranian-American investor Bijan Kian. And then there was Drone Aviation, a firm that makes tethered surveillance drones. Flynn was named vice chairman and a board member in May 2016, and said he would promote the firm’s “blimp in a box” concept for military and government use and expand “the role of persistent aerial solutions in the marketplace.” The company later won a $400,000 Defense Department contract. Drone Aviation paid Flynn a $36,000 annual salary and awarded him 100,000 shares of restricted stock. He was re-elected to the board after Trump’s election but stepped down from the board after being offered his job at the White House. Another venture was Brainwave Science, a Boston company publicizing its use of “brain fingerprinting,” scans that the firm claims can be used to assess a person’s honesty. Flynn briefly joined the advisory board in February 2016. The firm’s concept is disputed by critics and one adviser left the board after media reports surfaced that he pleaded guilty in 1996 to selling stolen biotech material to Russia’s spy agency. MEETING PUTIN Like many former military officials, Flynn boosted his profile by appearing on television news and talk shows, including several networks connected to foreign governments. They include Qatar-backed Al Jazeera and RT, the news network aligned with the Russian government. He has said he wasn’t paid for the appearances. But a December 2015 trip to RT’s 10th anniversary celebration would put Flynn in some unique company. An RT video from the Moscow event showed Flynn seated next to Putin and rising during a standing ovation following the Russian leader’s address. Flynn has acknowledged being paid for the appearance, but hasn’t said who wrote the check or for how much. Flynn’s webpage at All American Speakers shows a standard lecture circuit fee in the $30,000-$50,000 range. According to another attendee at the event, Jill Stein, the former Green Party presidential candidate who won 1 percent of the popular vote last November, RT paid for the Moscow event. Stein told the AP she turned down the network’s offer to pay for her transportation and stay at Moscow’s Hotel Metropol, where the event was held. “I didn’t think it was appropriate for a presidential candidate to take money from a foreign government,” she said. Before dinner, Flynn was interviewed on international issues by an RT personality. He then joined Stein and others at a front table, seated with Putin and an entourage of aides. Stein said she didn’t see Flynn and Putin talk privately at the table. Flynn later told the Post that he had only a brief introduction with Putin. Flynn shrugged off the meeting as “boring.” Still, several Democratic House members have asked if Flynn accepted payment from RT and if that is a violation of the federal Emoluments Clause, which prohibits even retired military officers from accepting direct or indirect payments from foreign governments. Flynn was both hopeful and skeptical about Russia relations before joining Trump’s administration. In his 2016 book “The Field of Fight,” Flynn warned that Russia had joined an “enemy alliance” with Iran. But he also talked publicly of Russia as a possible ally with the U.S. in confronting radical Islam.

By Ross Rubin | February 14, 2017 -- 17:54 GMT (09:54 PST) | Topic: iPhone Apple has a long history of hanging back and embracing standards with a big splash. One example was USB, the now-ubiquitous connector that got off to a slow start before Apple began supporting it in the iMac. Another was Wi-Fi, a prevalent standard that once competed for consumer adoption with a vanquished rival called HomeRF. Does the iPhone still matter? Huawei, not Apple, now drives the mobile conversation Cupertino is a victim of its own success and is fully responsible for creating the Chinese Android monster. Read More Now, news that Apple has joined of the Wireless Power Consortium comes amidst rumors that the company will finally add inductive charging to the iPhone, becoming one of the last major manufacturers to do so, either directly or via a first-party accessory. Of course, there is no guarantee that Apple will so act. It was, for example, a board member of the Blu-ray Disc Association and never shipped a product with a Blu-ray drive. It's also possible that Apple could reserve wireless charging, as it does now, for select products such as the Apple Watch. However, were the company to bring Qi to the iPhone, it would have a broad range of implications. Also: As iPhone 8 rumors swirl, Apple takes big step toward wireless charging | OLED iPhone 8 will be an expensive gamble for Apple | No need to wait for the iPhone 8: You can have wireless iPhone charging today Game over. For years, at least two incompatible charging systems systems have been vying for adoption among among handset makers, accessory suppliers, and venues such as Starbucks and airport lounges. They have been Qi, supported by the Wireless Power Consortium, and Airfuel, the latest name of a roll-up of standards supported by the Airfuel Alliance. The Qi standard that Apple would support has had a significant lead in smartphone adoption. While the Airfuel Alliance has had some powerful backers such as Intel, Starbucks, and Samsung, the latter has supported Qi alongside Airfuel in a nod toward the rival standard's prevalence. Apple's embrace of Qi would be a major blow to Airfuel, which could die on the vine or retreat to focus on wireless PC charging as Intel has positioned it. Better compatibility. In addition to coronating Qi as the One True Induction Charging Standard, Apple's embrace of Qi could benefit the performance of the standard in a few ways. First, it wouldn't be surprising to see Apple's arrival coincide with a new version of the Qi standard that offered faster charging, greater range or other benefits. Also, with a huge new potential market, makers of Qi chargers would likely step up to ensure compatibility with the iPhone and other phone vendors would ensure that they conformed to this implementation as well. A sealed iPhone. I wrote about the potential of a sealed iPhone in advance of Apple dropping the iPhone's headphone jack. Adopting wireless power wouldn't necessarily mean that the company would kill the Lightning port in the next iPhone. However, there would be several reasons that might give Apple the "courage" to do so . These include freeing up ever-precious real estate and easier waterproofing. Lighting has been living on borrowed time anyway since Apple embraced USB-C. As many frustrated new MacBook Pro owners has observed, it's pretty ridiculous that the power cable for their computer can't charge an iPhone when it can charge Android phones from brands such as Motorola, HTC, and LeEco. The evolution of iPhone through the year... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 14 NEXT PREV A chorus of yawns. Supporting Qi is far from leading edge. LG shipped the first Qi-compatible phone in the US in 2011. Even BlackBerry checked it off its bucket list with the Priv. Of course, if Qi were just an incremental feature in the new phone, there may be cause for a golf clap. After all, the lack of Qi support hasn't done much to keep people away from iPhones up to this point. But if this "catch-up" functionality is positioned as a major new feature, the next iPhone likely doesn't have a great story to tell. Contactless wireless charging push-back. And there might be further bad news associated with Apple adopting Qi. Many speculated that Apple was bypassing charging pads to embrace a room-based system that passively provides wireless electricity through the air much as Wi-Fi provides connectivity. There are already a few companies in this space, including WiTricity, Energous, and UBeam. Microsoft also recently filed a patent for a room-based wireless charging system using light. Of course, Apple could support both pad-based and room-based of charging technologies, but adopting Qi signals that such advances are further in the future for the iPhone. Once the pads are in place, inductive wireless charging is a cool convenience. It would make topping off the iPhone easier and Apple's support would make Qi more prevalent and more robust. But support for wireless charging on its own would hardly be the kind of game changer that Apple needs for its flagship device.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 February 2017 by Military News ‘Transformative Power of Transparency’ Tops on New GRI Chief’s By Dave Armon, 3BL Media CMO SOURCE: 3BL Media, LLC DESCRIPTION: Unlike another world leader who is one month into his new job, Tim Mohin has heralded his new administration at GRI by kicking off a global listening tour. A veteran sustainability officer at tech giants like AMD, Apple and Intel, Mohin has yet to issue any sweeping executive orders.  He took his roadshow to Phoenix this week for the “GRI Reporters’ Summit” and received input from companies using the Global Reporting Initiative’s standards to keep stakeholders briefed on environmental, social and governance issues. “I know that reporting can be a positive force for change,” said Mohin, who also worked as a section chief for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier in his career. “I believe in the transformative power of transparency.” Amsterdam-based GRI is used by nearly three quarters of all companies issuing sustainability reports.  Yet the 20-year-old nonprofit faces new entrants proposing alternative reporting models. During his first public speech since being selected as GRI’s CEO, Mohin acknowledged a “fragmented and burdensome” collection of reporting methodologies — characterizing it as a “confusing morass” – and vowed to work toward “harmonizing all of the frameworks.” GRI took one step in that direction last fall by pledging to work with the United Nations Global Compact to shape public reporting of the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  “We have companies today with revenues larger than the GDP of some countries,” Mohin said, adding that reporting is one tangible way the private sector can demonstrate progress in sustainable development. Among goals outlined by Mohin during his session was improved use of technology in sustainability reporting, allowing consumers to access data in formats beyond PDFs. “What are we getting for our massive investment in time?” he asked, pledging to work toward answering the question. Mohin, who spoke ahead of the annual GreenBiz Forum for sustainability officers in Phoenix, said companies should be guided by the four Cs of reporting: concise, consistent, comparable and current. Check back later this week for additional updates from the GreenBiz event.

CALDWELL, JOSH BOAK, The Associated Press Close icon ALICIA A. CALDWELL, JOSH BOAK The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is patting himself on the back for immigration and job-creation initiatives that started before he took office. A look at his statements during a news conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau: TRUMP: "We're actually taking people that are criminals, very, very, hardened criminals in some cases ... with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems, and we're getting them out and that's what I said I would do ... And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we're getting them out and that's exactly what we're doing." THE FACTS: Officials said an operation last week that resulted in the arrest of more than 680 immigrants in various cities was a routine enforcement action like those undertaken during the administration of Barack Obama, who deported an unprecedented number of people as president. More specifically, David Marin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, said the agency carries out such large-scale operations two or three times a year in his region. The California operation was in the planning stages "before the administration came out with their current executive orders," he said. More than 100 of the arrests were in the Los Angeles area. The notion that raids have been stepped up under Trump has been advanced both by the White House, to show that Trump is keeping a promise, and by advocates of those who have been targeted, to illustrate what they call the new president's heavy-handed tactics. But statistical evidence has not come in to show that enforcement has surged under the new Trump administration or that actual deportations are up. A similar series of raids under Obama in March 2015 resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000 criminals, the government said at the time. After the latest raids, immigration officials put out a statement saying a "rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible." And Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said: "ICE conducts these kind of targeted enforcement operations regularly and has for many years. The focus of these enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE's Fugitive Operations teams on a daily basis." Trump's promise of a secure border was central to his campaign and he signed an executive order in his first week as president aimed at making dangerous people a priority for deportation. It's too early to know if that is working. ___ TRUMP: "You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel, the other day, announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation, lowering taxes, et cetera, they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands and thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same." THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate decisions that largely predate his presidential win, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole reason for the expected hiring. Several job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their total number of employees. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama's presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel's high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he made his announcement about the Arizona investment at the White House in support of the president's tax and regulatory policies, perhaps giving Trump an invitation to brag, which he quickly seized. But those policies have yet to be detailed publicly, much less enacted. The best jobs measure for Trump's administration will probably be the monthly employment reports from the Labor Department. They provide the unemployment rate and the total number of net jobs added or lost during each month. ___ Find all AP Fact Checks here: http://apne.ws/2kbx8bd ___ Associated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Jim Drinkard contributed to this report.
