Reg readers vote Tom Baker for Doctor 13. Of course Welcome to my world of The Unexplained – yes, you're welcome to it More like this Cisco Atom Hardware Data Centre Intel Atom chips have been dying for at least 18 months – only now is truth coming to light Vendors clocked C2xxx flaw when returns spiked 7 Feb 2017 at 23:10, Thomas Claburn Exclusive The flaw in Intel's Atom C2000 family of chips has been vexing Intel's hardware customers for at least a year and a half, according to a source at one affected supplier, but it wasn't immediately obvious that Intel's silicon was to blame. The well-placed insider, who spoke to The Register on condition of anonymity, said the problem – which results in bricked systems – became apparent to engineers at product makers when the return rate on gear spiked about 18 months ago. It took additional time to figure out that Intel's hardware was responsible. The vendor in question worked with Intel engineers during this period to replace affected units under manufacturer warranty. Then about two months ago, Intel acknowledged the issue was with its chip blueprints, the source said. In January, with the publication of errata documenting the flawed LPC clock outputs in its Atom C2000 system-on-chips, Intel acknowledged the issue publicly. Around the same time, chief financial officer Robert Swan said profitability during Intel's fourth quarter last year had been constrained by an unspecified product issue, prompting the company to establish a cash reserve to deal with the blunder. Cisco's subsequent publication of an advisory warning that a variety of its products could fail after 18 months of use because of a faulty clock component appeared to The Register to be related to Intel's disclosure, in no small part because Cisco's devices contained Intel Atom C2000 line chips. Both companies have repeatedly refused to acknowledge the linkage, despite repeated hectoring from The Register. At the same time, they have refused to offer any correction or claim that their respective issues are unrelated. "We are working with all customers to implement the fix we have available now," an Intel spokesperson told The Register on Tuesday. "We aren't providing additional details on which companies." Companies that appear to be affected by the Atom C2000 flaw include not only those mentioned in our previous report – Aaeon, Dell, HP, Infortrend, Lanner, NEC, Newisys, Netgate, Netgear, Quanta, Supermicro, Synology, and ZNYX Networks – but also ASRock Rack (C2550D4I and C2750D4I), iXsystems (FreeNAS Mini), Seagate (NAS Pro), and Sophos (UTM firewall SG 125). Our industry source suggested that non-disclosure agreements with Intel prevent companies from releasing or discussing information about technical issues related to Intel products. Some Intel customers, however, have trouble maintaining the code of silence. A spokesperson for Synology contacted The Register on Tuesday in response to a languishing query, saying that "Synology is investigating this issue together with Intel." The spokesperson subsequently asked to revise the company's statement with alternative facts that omitted any mention of Intel. This code of silence, in the opinion of our source, ends up hurting Intel's hardware customers because they get blamed for products that fail, even when the fault is Intel's. Public's right to know Had Intel spoken up sooner and named customers with affected products, there might not be so many forum posts and online product reviews lamenting unexplained failures of devices running Atom C2000 chips. "I think it's better for the public to know [the failure is] not because of our product," the source said. Intel's hardware partners and their customers are still trying to sort things out. A Reg reader reported that when he asked about his Seagate NAS Pro, which contains an Intel Atom C2338, Seagate technical support offered a response suggesting disinterest in any potential problem: "Regarding the Intel Specifications Sheet on the Atom C2000 series in reference to item AVR54, Seagate does not maintain any information on device failure rates or failure rates that may exist due to the above related bulletin." Synology said it is still investigating the issue and that while it "has not seen any indication that this issue has caused an increase in failure rates for DiskStation or RackStation models equipped with Intel Atom C2000 series processors," the company intends to post an advisory when additional information becomes known. Others report more positive interaction with affected companies. "I had an ASRock C2750D4I (Intel Atom C2750-based Mini ITX board) that died after 26 months of use!" a Reg reader told us. "Yes, 2 months out of its warranty! Thankfully ASRock replaced the board with no fuss at all ... ASRock just said that the board wasn't repairable and sent a replacement, nothing was ever said regarding why it died." ® Updated to add In a statement today, pfSense-maker Netgate said: "Netgate has become aware of an issue related to a component manufactured by one supplier that affects some of our products. This is a widely used component that is used by many companies around the world ... if the component fails, the system will not successfully reboot. We are working with the component supplier and our manufacturing partner to resolve this issue as quickly as possible."

The issue is in the Atom C2000 chips, which started shipping in 2013. The problem was first reported by The Register. In January, Intel added an erratum to the Atom C2000 documentation, stating systems with the chip "may experience [an] inability to boot or may cease operation." The chip is the last among Intel's line of short-lived low-power Atom chips for servers. It was used in microservers but also networking equipment from companies like Cisco, which has issued an advisory about a product defect related to a component degrading clock signals over time. A clock signal degrade hurts the ability of the chip to carry out tasks. Intel is trying to fix the issue but declined to comment on when it'll deliver an update. "There's a board level workaround that we are sharing with customers now," an Intel spokesman said in an email. "Additionally, we are implementing and validating a minor silicon fix in a new product [update]." The usual server refresh cycle is three to five years, but networking and storage equipment -- which the C2000 is targeted toward -- is often used for five to 10 years. Companies using the chip should contact their field representative or system provider for updates. Intel continuously finds flaws in its chips, and it fixes them over time. But one that may crash a system is serious and could put data at risk. Intel also had an issue with its Skylake chip that could freeze PCs under certain conditions when executing complex workloads. The chipmaker has given up making Atom chips for servers, replacing them with the Xeon-D and Xeon-E3 chips. Intel is now dedicating Atom chips to drones, robots, gateways, smart devices, and internet of things products. Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the New Zealand Reseller News newsletter!

Blog :  Apple’s Class-Action Lawsuit: Never Intentionally Break Your Product Article :  Gain More Control of BYOD Apps with an Enterprise App Store AMD’s Strangely Unusual Path to Market for Impressive New Server Processor Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 07 Feb, 2017          |         |     Share AMD is coming out with its new Naples processor for servers. After being knocked out of the market due to missed commitments, getting back in would typically be ugly. Server buyers tend to be very conservative and would be slow to move to a new processor anyway. AMD is taking a very interesting path to market that pulls from its core differentiating feature and builds on its increasing financial success to overcome this shortcoming. Let’s chat a bit about this because the process is unique and I think it might represent a best practice for how to speed an enterprise-class product to market and assure customer advocacy for it. AMD’s Sustaining Advantage over Intel If I were to sum up one of the top competitive advantages that AMD has had over Intel, it is that it asks OEM customers what they want and then tries to build it. Intel tells its customers what it’s going to build. Historically, there has been more tension between OEMs in all segments and Intel with regard to direction and policies, while AMD’s issues have historically been more about meeting roadmap promises. In short, AMD, being smaller, has historically been more responsive and often favored in terms of relationships, but this has been offset by an historic problem with execution. Lisa Su, AMD’s current CEO, who came from IBM, has been addressing AMD’s execution issues with near amazing success. AMD’s steadily improving financial performance supports these results and if AMD can convince OEMs that they will get the relationship they want, with the reliability they need, getting design wins shouldn’t be a problem. Clearly this is being showcased in its game console, PC, and graphics car businesses. But getting these systems into companies might still be problematic. Cloud Strategy In general, new systems like this have a cart and horse problem, in that large companies don’t want to buy technology in this class until it has been proven in large companies, making it nearly impossible to get around an entrenched vendor. However, we have a new class of companies at scale that are far more open to new technology, largely because their performance and cost needs are typically well ahead of where technology is currently performing. These are the massive cloud providers that are building data centers the size of small towns with energy requirements that rival some cities. They will often take products that haven’t even completed a beta cycle of aggressive testing and sometimes even use them in order to address these critical needs. And given that they tend to have cutting-edge fail-over capability tied largely to their critical ability to shift loads of all sizes near instantly, their environments are far more tolerant of as-yet untested technology. What AMD is doing is putting its parts in development into these environments under load to assure that they are reliable and that the parts are tuned to the unique requirements of these massive cloud providers. In theory, if the coming Naples offering is specifically designed to handle affordably (in power used and cost) the massive variety of loads of a major cloud provider, then it should not only be ideal for on-premises cloud offerings but for a wide variety of similar requirements from enterprise buyers. In short, by the time Naples comes to market, there should be a number of high-visibility, high-load cloud companies that will be happy to advocate that it performs as promised, potentially effectively addressing that cart and horse problem. Wrapping Up: Best Practice Generally, I think it ideal, particularly for a new product, to partner with end customers in that product’s development because it should assure a far better match to the needs of the related market. I’m not sure this process should ever be broken; it used to be really hard to collaborate in this fashion because doing so securely across company lines, particularly through OEMs, was virtually impossible. But given that cloud providers often work directly with companies like AMD, and collaboration tools have massively improved over the last decade, suddenly there is an opportunity for even parts makers like AMD to build relationships with those that use their products. Through this, it can uniquely understand current and emerging needs and come up with products that can address those needs. I also think this process was likely refined in AMD due to its unique position with Microsoft and Sony’s game console divisions, which have to work tightly with the parts providers because, although their solutions are very different from servers, they too have to push the performance envelope while keeping costs down. It won’t be until next year around this time when we’ll know if this process is actually effective for Naples, AMD’s new server part. But it should be, because working closely during development with those who will use a new product has been proven in most professions going back hundreds of years. Apparently, we in tech are sometimes slow learners. So, what is strange about this path is that it is unusual. I think everyone should work with users to develop new products.

The contract, which is seen by many industry experts as unnecessary and shady, will see Sibton Switch Systems Limited – a company formed only in August 2015 –run a system to make banks, mobile money platforms and other payment systems interoperable. Initial figure sighted by Daily Guide as the cost submitted by Sibton to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for the implementation of the retail payment system was GH¢4,667,414,340.82. What raises eyebrows is the fact that two other entities that bid for the same contract – Vas Intel Limited and Mericom Solutions Limited – submitted tender amounts and packages worth GH¢14,094,795.00 and GH¢5,465,396.06 respectively. Vas Intel files for annulment Minutes of a tender committee meeting dated Monday, July 04, 2016, capture the bids submitted by all the three interested companies. The tender committee, chaired by Mr Innocent Asamoah, in its remarks after the evaluation of the tenders, concluded that all three were responsive and met their expectations and so awarded the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. This led Vas InteL Limited to write to the BoG to protest the award of the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. In its letter dated July 25, 2016, Vas Intel wrote that it was conceivably impracticable for the BoG to award a contract to Sibton within six business days after the opening of tenders on July 4, 2016. According to the letter, “All procurement actions taken by the BoG pursuant to Act 663 must be done with a strict and uncompromising adherence to the principles of transparency and fairness so as to protect and preserve public property and interest, as well as the integrity of the laws governing public procurement within the territory of the Republic of Ghana.” Telecom operators in the country are unhappy about moves by the Central Bank to impose on them a third-party company which will be intermediate in mobile money transactions across different networks. Telecom operators outraged The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications has bared its teeth at the Central Bank and condemned the move to impose Sibton Switch Systems Limited on the players in the industry. In a letter dated January 9, 2017, the chamber argues that the move by the BoG and Sibton is not in alignment with international standards or benchmarks. They also argue that the fees being charged by the switch are too high and have the potential to undermine the successes chalked by the industry. The Telecoms Chamber, after meetings with banks, mobile money operators, and the Central Bank, warned that aside from the outrageous costs of the project, the scope was also not well defined and could run the industry into a state of chaos. Case for GHIPSS The Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ghana. It was incorporated in May 2007 with a mandate to implement and manage interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Industry leaders believe that the BoG should annul the deal with Sibton Switch Systems Limited and offer GhIPSS the needed leverage to continue integrating payment systems like they have successfully done over the past decade.

Built for power users with robust graphics applications, ClearCube’s A6106SLW Workstation delivers Xeon E3-1200 v5 processors or 6th generation Intel Core i7 and i5 processors, Intel C236 chipset (Skylake), up to 64 GB DDR4-2133 MHz RAM, and NVIDIA’s Quadro K420, K1200, K2200, and K4200 video cards. Ten A6106SLW Blade PCs mount in a chassis that takes up only six rack units (10.5 inches). A6106SLW Workstations are specially designed with embedded PCoIP® host cards that host IP connections from remote desktop zero client end point devices. Zero clients support up to four displays, have no memory, operating system or local storage. All processing takes place on the A6106SLW Workstation, and only pixel changes are transmitted to the zero client devices over an encrypted protocol. No data exists at the desktop location, which is a huge deterrent to data theft and security breaches. Zero clients are so secure they are used by financial trading floors, NSA and other intelligence agencies. „The new A6106SLW allowed us to design a flexible environment for our demanding workflow, and gave the best utilization of resources,” said Jeff Vandehey, Sr. Desktop System Administrator, LAIKA animation studio. „While running in a controlled location, this set of powerful workstations delivers top of the line graphics through a simple connection back to the desktop where it’s needed.” Designed to eliminate PCs from work areas, the centralized ClearCube architecture locates workstation assets—including powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and storage drives—in the customer’s secure datacenter. Graphics rendering and other computation-intensive applications are typically associated with the roar of noisy GPUs and fans running at full speed, all the time. The A6106SLW virtually eliminates this grievance by optimizing power requirements (lowering fan speed) and sequestering the workstation to a secure datacenter, away from the work area. By centralizing workstations, organizations can power and cool A6106SLWs more cost-effectively than distributed PCs, and IT staff can return workstations to service quicker.

But patenting an idea does mean that you think it’s worth protecting, and I really can’t say that’s true about Intel’s curved laptop concept. Don't Miss: This is our best look yet at the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus The patent, which was filed for in 2015 and uncovered by The Leaker, shows a laptop with a curved screen and curved base. This makes sense, insofar as TVs and phones have recently started to have curved displays, and someone at Intel thought there’s probably some marketing mileage in bringing that over to laptops. But when you start to actually look at the design, you can see that this is objectively the worst thing to come out of a design studio since two Samsung engineers sat down and thought “hey, maybe we should make this battery thinner.” The curved base is obviously necessary to accommodate the curved screen, but I imagine typing on it would be hellacious and it won’t exactly sit nicely on a table. Also, imagine trying to fit this in a backpack that’s been designed to take a nice, normal, flat laptop. Then there’s the curved screen itself. Curved gaming monitors make a tiny amount of sense, because you’re normally the only one using them, sitting in a dark room far away from the rest of the human race. But for almost all other applications, they suck. Consider The Verge‘s recent review of a Samsung TV with a curved screen, “which means that it picks up and seemingly magnifies every glimmer of light in the room.” This is true of almost any curved display, and means that you’ll never be able to have two people simultaneously viewing your laptop screen, ever. In conclusion: a curved laptop would be bad in every possible way. The only redeeming feature of this patent is that it is not yet reality, which means there’s time for Intel to kill the idea with fire and never speak of it again.   Trending right now: 8 paid iPhone apps on sale for free right now Apple leaks details about the upcoming MacBook updates The Mars rover just sent back data that has scientists completely stumped See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next The White House employee who ensures Trump doesn’t get hacked has been fired BGR News Professional swimwear designed to suit your needs SwimOutletSponsored Wristband monitors your blood alcohol content while you drink Yahoo Tech Your first look at 'Avengers: Infinity War' CNET Target’s big Apple Watch sale is still happening right now BGR News Sleep Well with a Great Mattress!

Credit: Intel More like this Intel puts mobile chip failures in its past with first speedy 5G modem Intel researches tech to prepare for a future beyond today's PCs Intel's latest Xeon chips based on Skylake due next year Video Highlights from Interop 2015 A flaw in an old Intel chip could crash servers and networking equipment, and the chipmaker is working to fix the issue. The issue is in the Atom C2000 chips, which started shipping in 2013. The problem was first reported by The Register. In January, Intel added an erratum to the Atom C2000 documentation, stating systems with the chip "may experience [an] inability to boot or may cease operation." The chip is the last among Intel's line of short-lived, low-power Atom chips for servers. It was used in microservers and in networking equipment from companies like Cisco, which has issued an advisory about a product defect related to a component degrading clock signals over time. A clock signal degrade hurts the ability of the chip to carry out tasks. Intel is trying to fix the issue but declined to comment on when it will deliver an update. "There's a board level workaround that we are sharing with customers now," an Intel spokesman said in an email. "Additionally, we are implementing and validating a minor silicon fix in a new product [update]." [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] The usual server refresh cycle is three to five years, but networking and storage equipment -- which the C2000 is targeted toward -- is often used for five to 10 years. Companies using the chip should contact their field representative or system provider for updates. Intel continuously finds flaws in its chips, and it fixes them over time. But one that may crash a system is serious and could put data at risk. Intel also had an issue with its Skylake chip that could freeze PCs under certain conditions when executing complex workloads. The chipmaker has given up making Atom chips for servers, replacing them with the Xeon-D and Xeon-E3 chips. Intel is dedicating Atom chips to drones, robots, gateways, smart devices and internet of things products.

Will AMD Be Launching 17 Ryzen Processors Next Month? Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Tue, Feb 07, 2017 - 2:28 PM Rumor has it that AMD is going to be releasing 17 Ryzen processors that are divided into three series named R3, R5 and R7. The high-end Ryzen processors will be placed into the R7 range and will all be 8-core 16-thread processors that are meant to compete with the Intel Core i7 series. Next you have the mid-range R5 Ryzen CPUs will that are all 6-core 12-thread parts and then at the bottom-end of the stack you have the R3 Ryzen processors that are all quad-core parts that either have no additional threads or a maximum of eight. AMD calls this additional threading SMT (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) technology, which is the equivalent to Intel’s HT (Hyper-Threading) technology. AMD has been able to come up with 17 processors by varying clock speeds and other features for product range differentiation. The AMD R7 1800X or R7 Pro 1800X as some sites are calling it will be the eight-core, 16-thread monster that AMD has been touting since Zen debuted. According to the leaked slide above from some sites in Asia, the clock speeds on that processor might be 3.60 GHz and there is no mention of boost clocks on the leaked processor table. This table shows that AMD will be having six-core Ryzen CPU models and that is interesting as Zen is made of CPU complexes (CCXes) that each contain four cores. That means the existence of 6-core Ryzen processors would mean that AMD has been able to successfully disable part of one of the two CCX units. Rumors still have the AMD Ryzen processors coming our on March 3rd, 2017, but we’ve still seen some people saying that March 7th, 2017 is the date. Both dates are less than a month away, so it will be interesting to see what we can learn before the official release. Just remember that Ryzen is pronounced rye-zen, not rizen! AMD Ryzen R7 CPU Lineup R7 1800X R7 PRO 1800 R7 1700X R7 1700 R7 PRO 1700 The AMD R7 family of processors will feature 8 cores with SMT for a total of 16 threads. These processors will be competing against Intel Core i7-7700, Core i7-7700K, Core i7-6800K and the Core i7-6900K,. The battle between the AMD R7 1700X will be going up against the Core i7-7700K will be one that gamers and performance enthusiasts should be most interested in. AMD Ryzen R5 Series CPUs R5 PRO 1600 R5 1500 R5 PRO 1500 R5 1400X R5 PRO 1400 R5 1300 R5 PRO 1300 The mid-range AMD R5 series of CPUs will 6 core and 4 core variants with SMT enabled for either 12 or 8-threads. These processors will compete against the Intel Core i5-7400 to the Core i5-7600K processors. The AMD R3 series does not have SMT support and they were not compared to any Intel processors in the table. FXi2 Well at least AMD is likely to offer more than 4 cores on a consumer platform. Intel makes you go “extreme” for that. Competition is good for all Arnulf Will fake speculation table turn out to be fake speculation table?

Via Paul Thurrott, Microsoft is offering discounts of up to $250 on several Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 models. The deals include: Microsoft Surface Book – Intel Core i5, 8 GB, 128 GB. $1299, $200 off. Microsoft Surface Book – Intel Core i5, 8 GB, 256 GB, discrete GPU (first-gen). $1649, $250 off. Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – Intel Core m3, 4 GB, 128 GB. $699, $200 off. (Includes Surface Pen.) Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – Intel Core m3, 4 GB, 128 GB. $699, $100 off. (No Surface Pen.) Microsoft Surface Pro 4 – Intel Core i5, 8 GB, 256 GB. $1049, $150 off. Related Stories Microsoft Going Big With Next Surface Pro Surface Pro 5 Spec Rumors Suggest eSIM In Microsoft's 2017 Tablet Surface Book vs. MacBook Pro 2016 — Which Is Better? Microsoft’s current promotion runs until Feb. 25. While the consumer-level Surface Pro 4 has seen several discounts in the past, the higher-end Book’s rarely sees similar price savings. As Paul Thurrott noted, the Book’s $1,299 promo price is close to the cheapest price Microsoft has charged for the high-end tablet PC. The Surface Pro 4 is Microsoft’s flagship consumer tablet PC and is anchored around a central tablet with laptop-level storage and specifications. The Surface can also be connected to Microsoft’s Type Cover, which is a combo cover-keyboard that provides full typing functionality for the computer. By comparison, the Surface Book is a higher-end counterpart to the Surface Pro series. The premium-priced Surface Book lineup sports specifications in line with more powerful business and enterprise-friendly laptops, making it suitable for applications like photo processing and video editing. Unlike the Type Cover — which is thinner and meant for portability — the Book features a detachable full-sized keyboard that comes with the tablet PC. While Microsoft has yet to formally announce a successor to the Surface Book or Pro 4, both models have some age versus competing models. The Pro 4 and Book were originally launched in late 2015, though they’ve seen incremental updates since then. For a new Surface Pro 5, potential features and specifications that could see upgrades include USB-C support, Intel Kaby Lake or Cannonlake processors and improved Windows 10 integration.

Join For Free In a continuing series of articles sharing what I've learned about Oracle JET, I'd like to extend upon the previous article talking about installing Oracle JET for web application development, and this time look at installing Oracle JET for hybrid mobile application development. Oracle JET is capable of not just building client-side web applications, but thanks to the underlying power of Apache Cordova it can build & deploy hybrid mobile applications too, for Android, iOS and Windows UWP. Installing the base tooling for Oracle JET is relatively easy, and extending it with Cordova is easy too. However installing the tooling for each mobile platform for the uninitiated can be challenging and why I thought I'd attack this "beast" in a separate article to help others. Installing the Oracle JET Prerequisites In the previous article for web application development, I covered what you needed to install for Oracle JET. This included installing Git and NPM first, then via NPM installing Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and the Oracle JET generator. It just so happens this set of packages is the prerequisite for installing the additional hybrid mobile tooling. So, for all intents and purposes, Oracle JET hybrid mobile development is just an extension of Oracle JET web development. While there are certainly some tasks that are mobile specific (such as integrating the camera or GPS), it's useful to understand from a learning perspective that an Oracle JET mobile app is pretty much the same as an Oracle JET web app, just deployed to a mobile device. This means that when things don't work in your JET mobile app because of a bug in your code, but say the Android Emulator is being its usual painful self during debugging, you can often run and test apps in your development machine's browser to get around this sort of development grind. There are a few mobile specific tasks we can't test in the browser, but thanks to the mock plugins provided by Cordova you can actually do a lot. Installing Apache Cordova Having installed the Oracle JET tooling from the previous article, using NPM we can install Apache Cordova for mobile development as follows: npm install -g cordova To check which Cordova version was installed run the following: npm list -g --depth=0 An example result from my Mac: /usr/local/lib
├── bower@1.7.9
├── cordova@6.3.1
├── generator-oraclejet@1.1.0
├── grunt-cli@1.2.0
├── node-inspector@0.12.5
├── npm@2.15.9
└── yo@1.8.4 From here we need to make a choice of which mobile platform we're going to support. Apache Cordova itself supports (at last count) eight different platforms, but Oracle has made the decision upon extending itself on top of Cordova to only support Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps (deployable to Windows 10 devices). Which we choose is up to us and our needs, each of us will need to pick our own poison (as the saying goes, which nicely sidesteps me from any Android-vs-iOS-vs-Windows debates I hope ;-). From a development perspective, it's worth noting of the 3 mobile development platforms we're about to talk about, that is the Android SDK for Android development, Apple Xcode for iOS, and MS-Visual Studio for Windows UWP, only the Android SDK is capable of being installed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux development machines. Xcode is tied to MacOS only, and Visual Studio to Windows only. In Oracle's mobile team when writing tutorials for developers to use, as the Android SDK covers virtually all the PC operating systems that developers can bring to a classroom, we tend to focus on the Android SDK first as a pseudo-universal development platform, as we know (hope?) all students can install this. So I'll cover Android first, but, skip to your favorite mobile platform if you're interested in iOS or Windows instead. Android, the Android SDK and Android Emulator For hybrid mobile development on Android, we require the Android SDK. The Android SDK is either bundled with Android Studio or a separate download from the following page. The SDK is now somewhat obscured as "command line tools" at the bottom of the page, where we find the downloads for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. For this article, we'll assume you download & installed the SDK rather than Android Studio. The SDK zip does not come with any specific version of Android installed, known as an Android API, so you must run the SDK Manager to download these in turn. Once the SDK is installed we start the SDK Manager via <install-dir>/sdk/tools/android(.exe). On opening it for the first time the SDK Manager at the bottom will report it is loading from an external repository to determine what is available for download. If you are behind a corporate firewall you will need to open the SDK Manager preferences and set the proxy settings for this to work correctly, remembering to restart the SDK Manager if the process is stuck. By default the SDK Manager will suggest some required packages it will automatically download, but from there we need to pick a specific Android API. In doing so we need to be mindful that the version of Cordova we download has its own dependencies of what Android API level it supports, so you should check this yourself. For Apache Cordova 6.3.1 at the time of writing, according to the Cordova documentation that is Android 6.0 (API 23). In expanding a specific API, it includes a whole bunch of system images for different Android platforms including ARM and mobile devices, as well as specialized TV and Wear platforms. We'll drop the later two to save some unnecessary downloads. From the Extras top level option, it's also useful to select the Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer). I'll talk about this more in a moment. Once we've selected the options, we then select the Install Packages button, accept the relevant licenses then wait for everything to download. Be patient. It can take a while on slow connections. Like downloading the APIs as an extra step, assuming we don't have an Android device to run with, Android makes our job harder as we also need to setup the Android Emulator before we can start developing and testing our app. In turn, the Android Emulator is notoriously slow making it painful to develop with. This is where the Intel HAXM installer from above comes in. While there are some other options to the slow Android Emulator such as Genymotion, the Intel HAXM driver if installed on an Intel-based PC including Intel-based Windows, MacOS & Linux will significantly increase the speed of the Android Emulator. It does this by allowing the emulator to access the Intel CPU virtualization optimizations. There are some prerequisites such as your Intel CPU supports Intel's Virtualization Technology and VT-X, and if running on Windows Hyper-V must be disabled, which you can read about here. By default the Intel HAXM drivers are not installed when downloaded via the SDK Manager, you need to execute the file downloaded to the <android-home>/extra/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager directory, typically called something like intelhaxm.exe or IntelHAXM_X.X.X.dmg. The install instructions are fairly self-explanatory. My tip is to make sure you reboot your PC once installed, at least on MacOS I've had some problems with the drivers not properly applying post install unless I reboot. Now that we have the HAXM drivers installed we can setup the Android Emulator. The Android Emulator requires that we configure an Android Virtual Device (AVD), which is a configuration set of the Android device we want to emulate. Luckily it has a number of predefined templates that make this easier. With the SDK Manager running select the Manage AVDs menu option. In the resulting AVD Manager window, select the Device Definitions tab where it will list a number of preconfigured AVDs for known devices like the Nexus 5. On selecting this, then Create AVD, we will be presented with the remaining options we need to configure. From experience, first-time users tend to try to max out the AVD settings. But as the emulator can be so slothful, I recommend trying to keep this to a minimum. The target represents the Android API level we downloaded earlier. Remember to select something relevant to your Cordova release. For the CPU/ABI, for the Intel HAXM driver to work, we must select a System Image built by Intel, typically "Intel Atom (x86)" or "Intel Atom (x86_64)" (the difference being the 64 image emulates 64bit Intel Atom devices). For the Skin select "Skin with dynamic hardware controls," and then the rest of the options are left as default. Finally, note the default AVD Name at the top. Change this to something simple like "MyAVD" with no spaces, then press Ok. Next, for building Android apps, Apache Cordova requires that the Java Standard Edition SDK be installed (v7 or the latest v8). Having installed the Android SDK and Java SDK, Cordova then requires environment variables ANDROID_HOME and JAVA_HOME to point at these. The Cordova documentation gives instructions for how to set the environment variables on different operating systems. Phew. Android certainly requires the most steps to setup.  At this point, we've set up the Android SDK & Android Emulator and we're ready to return to working with Oracle JET. Skip right down to the last section before the conclusion to see what to do next. iOS, Apple Xcode, and the iOS Simulator If we instead choose to go the iOS route we can take some satisfaction that getting up and running is much easier than with the Android SDK. As a reminder, though, Apple's Xcode is only available on MacOS, there are no Windows or Linux versions. As such you will need a Mac to develop iOS applications via Xcode with Oracle JET. To install Xcode, we need to check what versions of iOS and Xcode are supported by Cordova before continuing. At the time of writing, Cordova supports Xcode 7, by the time you read this Xcode 8 may be supported. Cordova does great work in supporting the latest and greatest, but, if the latest version just came out a few days before you sometimes need to show some patience and download an older version. You can download the latest version from the Apple App Store for free, or older versions via the Apple Developer Center. Once installed we need to run Xcode at least once to accept the terms and conditions. Also, in the past, from experiences, it's been important to run iTunes at least once to do the same as can block iOS app builds & deployments. We've found in running a number of workshops corporate users of MacOS/OSX have never run iTunes unlike regular Mac users and this has caught them out. Having done all this, by installing Xcode we get a full set of device simulators at the most recent O/S version supported by that version of Xcode. If we want older simulators we can download them via the Preferences -> Components -> Simulator window. Otherwise, we're ready to kick on with JET. Skip right down to the last section to see what to do next. Finally Cordova itself requires we install the following via the command line, to support Cordova installing through Xcode. xcode-select --install
npn install -g ios-deploy Windows 10 UWP and MS-Visual Studio 2015 and the Emulator Setting up the development environment for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps is also straight forward. In this case, we need to download and install MS-Visual Studio 2015 to our Windows 10 PC. The free Community Edition of Visual Studio 2015 is a good option. On installing Visual Studio we need to ensure during the install process to also select "Universal Windows App Development Tools" and the associated children. If you miss the option during the install, try the Tools menu -> Extensions and Updates and Tools section. Once installed we need to run Visual Studio once to accept the terms and conditions. Note here how I'm not telling you to check the Cordova documentation. At the time of writing while Cordova does support Windows 8 & MS-Visual Studio 2013 development, for Oracle JET, Oracle has decided to only support Windows 10 UWP apps via MS-Visual Studio 2015 going forward. So you need to be cognizant of Oracle's support for Windows, not Cordova's in this case. Once complete this is a fairly rudimentary install compared to Android. Having finished the install we not only get some Windows device simulators, but we can also deploy our app directly to our development machine (unlike iOS & Android). Continue to the next section to find out what to do next with Oracle JET. Creating, Building and Running Oracle JET Hybrid Mobile Apps Once we have the respective mobile development platform installed on our development PC, we're ready to return to Oracle JET and create a hybrid mobile app. Like the previous article we use Yeoman on the command line to generate an Oracle JET scaffold, with a slightly different syntax from just creating a web application: yo oraclejet:hybrid MyMobileProject --template=navbar --platform=<android|ios|windows> Note for the "platform" (singular) option we must specify our mobile platform of choice without the brackets, such as the following: yo oraclejet:hybrid MyMobileProject --template=navbar --platform=android We can also use the "platforms" (plural) option to specify multiple platforms to support.  Wait patiently for the components to download and install. Next, we can build and serve our app: cd MyMobileProject
grunt build
grunt serve By default, the last two options will build the app for our selected mobile platform via Cordova, then start the associated emulator or simulator for our platform, deploy the app to the emulator or simulator and finally start the app for us. For platforms like Android where we may already have a number of emulator AVDs configured, or on iOS where we might want to pick out a specific simulator, we might like to use the extra option "destination" to specify the AVD name we set up earlier: grunt serve --destination=MyAVD ...and the result: Another option as explained earlier is to bypass the mobile emulator or simulators using the development machine's browser, instead, with the browser option. The browser can be a much faster route to development particular when fixing layouts for example. grunt serve --browser ...which will look like: At this point we're now up and running with the hybrid mobile development platforms for Oracle JET mobile development, and we're ready to continue learning about Oracle JET. As previously recommend if you're new to Oracle's JET I highly recommend hitting the Oracle JET homepage which includes links to the documentation, tutorials, videos, demo applications and a detailed cookbook. Conclusion The nice thing about learning Oracle JET for web development is everything we learn is extensible to Oracle JET hybrid mobile development. Yes there are plenty of arguments from the native mobile development camp about native mobile apps are best, but there is a great attraction to being a JavaScript developer and being able to develop solutions for web and mobile apps using exactly the same skillset.

After all, that’s what Apple does every year with its MacBooks, even if not every year brings over a major Mac redesign. But thanks to Apple’s own macOS 10.12.4 beta files, we now have a pretty good idea of what to expect this year for the MacBook Pro update. Don't Miss: The Mars rover just sent back data that has scientists completely stumped Apple blog Pike’s Universum discovered in the new macOS beta release three motherboards that do not correspond to any current MacBook Pro model. The motherboards would not fit future desktops, and they use the exact same processor management data as the 2016 MacBook Pro models. The 2017 line of MacBook Pro models is expected to feature faster, more efficient Intel Kaby Lake processors. The blog looked at the various Kaby Lake CPU versions currently available and discovered which chips will probably be used in each new MacBook Pro. Here they are, as listed by MacRumors: 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Even though Apple’s latest macOS beta may contain revealing data about the next MacBook Pro update, you shouldn’t expect a release anytime soon. Apple is likely to unveil the 2017 models much later this year with WWDC 2017 being the earliest possibility.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel responds to AMD’s Ryzen onslaught with… Intel responds to AMD’s Ryzen onslaught with some Core i7 and i5 updates By Mark Coppock — February 7, 2017 10:46 AM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you AMD's new Ryzen CPUs could force Intel to cut prices and pump up performance, giving you even more powerful PC gaming options. AMD is getting ready to roll out its new Ryzen CPUs, promising significantly improved performance not only over AMD’s previous processor line but also in comparison to the best that Intel currently has to offer. AMD will be releasing a host of new CPUs ranging from quad-core versions with four threads up to octa-core versions with 16 threads. Intel is rolling out its seventh-generation, or Kaby Lake, architecture, which is focused more on efficiency than outright performance. However, Intel isn’t standing still in the face of Ryzen’s impending release, Hexus reports. More: Leaked roadmap shows AMD may release three classes of Ryzen desktop processors According to Canard PC, a French publication, Intel is planning to both adjust Kaby Lake pricing and push out some new versions directly in response to Ryzen. The new CPUs could be unlocked versions of both Core i7 and Core i5 Kaby Lake, as such: Intel Core i7-7740K, 4.3GHz with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz, a thermal design power rating of 100W, and with 8MB of L3 cache. Intel Core i5-7640K, 4.0GHz, TDP of 100W or more, 6MB of L3 cache, and support for Hyperthreading. This would be a first for recent Core i5 chips, which typically do not have Hyperthreading enabled. AMD has not yet announced pricing for its Ryzen CPUs, and that will likely dictate how aggressively Intel adjusts its own cost structure for the Kaby Lake line. And, Intel will be releasing its own new generation Cannonlake architecture, which will be focused on switching to a new 10nm fabrication process and not necessarily on massive performance increases. In the meantime, it appears that Intel will be somewhat limited in its ability to respond to Ryzen. We’re still not certain which of AMD’s new CPUs will be released the soonest and how long it will take the company to roll out the complete line including the highest-end parts. AMD will also be releasing its new Vega GPU architecture, meaning that Nvidia will face its own competitive pressures. If you’re Intel or Nvidia, then AMD is giving you a headache about now. If you’re a PC gamer or anyone looking to build a high-performance machine, then you have good reason to be excited. Even if Ryzen isn’t your cup of tea, its mere presence in the market should force Intel and Nvidia to be that much more aggressive in rolling out their own improvements.

The chip giant is reportedly surprised by the performance of the Ryzen lineup and will release higher clocked Kaby Lake CPUs to not be ‘humiliated’ by AMD. The information comes from the well respected French website Canard PC (via) who reports that Intel considers the new AMD Ryzen CPU as a ‘serious threat’. Canard PC writes, “Intel’s communication department is now trying to avoid at all costs the humiliation of a Ryzen CPU with performance comparable to a Core i7 6900K (€1200) , but for a much lower price.” In response to AMDs Ryzen CPUs, Intel would be planning to release two new CPUs of its Kaby Lake generation, a Core i7 and a Core i5. The Core i7 would be the  7740K that is reportedly clocked at 4.3 Ghz, has 8MB L3 cache and a TDP of 100 W. This CPU has a clock speed that is 100 Mhz higher than the Core i7 7700K and in return the TDP is 9 watts higher. The Core i5 is the 7640K that has 4 cores running at 4.0 Ghz and comes with 6MB L3 cache. The TDP of this CPU would climb above the 100 watts. Canard PC initially reported this CPU would have Hyper Threading but isn’t sure about this anymore. According to the website it would be the first time a desktop Core i5 supports Hyper Threading, a feature that normally differentiates between an desktop i5 and i7. On laptops Hyper Threading on a Core i5 is common. Intel might release even more Kaby Lake CPUs complementing these models, depending on the final test results of the Ryzen CPUs, Canard PC writes. Major customers of the chip giant are reportedly testing the Core i5 7640K and Core i7 7740K but Intel doesn’t guarantee them they will be sold. The main reason is that validation of the new CPU models is time consuming and Intel wants to be able to respond within days in case AMD’s Ryzen CPUs perform better than expected. Especially Intel’s clock speed per core is still higher which means that its CPUs will perform better on applications that are not able to take advantage of the 6 and 8 cores some of the AMD Ryzen CPUs will provide. Up to 4 cores Intel will still be faster and it seems the company will underline that to respond to AMD with higher clocked Kaby Lake processors. Canard PC is sceptical on how afraid Intel should be. The website is unsure if the entire Ryzen lineup will really perform as well as some expect. AMD might be looking for a ‘WOW’ effect with its 8 core Ryzen CPUs, but it might only be able to sell a handful of them. The rest of the range might perform a lot less as AMD might have issues with its yield. The company might need to lower the clock speed of cores to make sure they work reliable and even disable cores that don’t function well. The 4 core and 6 core Ryzen CPUs are already 8 core CPUs where AMD has disabled defective cores, according to Canard PC. The website concludes that in case AMD provides journalists only with the high end 8 core 3.6 / 4.0 Ghz CPUs, and doesn’t provide 4 core variants, the company might have issues with the performance of the rest of the range of Ryzen CPUs.

I hope AMD cleans Intel's clock in the bang-for-the-buck arena. Without decent competition, Intel gouges the crap out of its customers. 5 Agree RTV71 MyCE Member Posted on: 09 Feb 17 15:16 I'm planning on getting a new laptop but I'm waiting until mobile Ryzen systems are available.

Apple released the current generation of MacBook Pro models in October. The code discovered in macOS 10.12.4 points to what could be coming in the next lineup. Pike’s Universum shared the discovery in a blog post (via MacRumors) that points to unused board-ids: Mac-B4831CEBD52A0C4C – two models with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3400 and 4000 MHz. This one uses the exact same processor power management data as the new MacBookPro13,1. Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921 – three models with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3500/3700 and 4000 MHz. This one uses the exact same processor power management data as the new MacBookPro13,2. Mac-551B86E5744E2388 – three models with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3800/3900 and 4100 MHz. This one uses the exact same processor power management data as the new MacBookPro13,3. The post adds that based on the perf-bias setting, these likely refer to future MacBook hardware and not new iMac desktops. In total, the new motherboard identifiers include two new 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar models, three new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models, and three new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models with faster processors. The code discovered so far lines up with what has so far been rumored for this year: Kaby Lake processors for MacBook Pros expected later this year. Apple is also rumored to be dropping the prices of new MacBook Pro models and introducing a 32GB RAM option, addressing complaints of the current lineup. Here’s what the Pike’s Universum blog post expects for the base 13-inch, Touch Bar 13-inch, and Touch Bar 15-inch MacBook Pros based on the code discovered: MacBookPro13,1 Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) MacBookPro13,2 Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) MacBookPro13,3: Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Apple’s current lineup of MacBook Pros use Skylake generation Intel processors. Intel detailed its seventh-generation Kaby Lake chips expected in future MacBook Pros earlier this year. Apple is also reportedly adding a second ARM-based chip in new MacBook Pros (Touch Bar already includes one) that could handle low power tasks.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to new ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --February 2017 AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!! --February 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. February Keeney (Engineering Manager, Community & Safety, GitHub) is passionate about building inclusive workplaces and online communities. Presently, she is furthering these goals in her role as the Engineering Manager for the Community & Safety team at GitHub. February can frequently be seen taking photos of sidewalks and power lines. Left unattended at conferences, she will seek out a piano and start covering pop b-sides. February lives in SF Bay Area. Kristy Tillman (Head of Communication Design, Slack). Before her role at Slack, Kristy served as the design director for Society of Grownups, a venture changing the face of financial literacy for the young adult set. There she was dedicated to crafting and inspiring the brand across both the digital and physical experiences. Previously, Kristy was a designer at IDEO, working projects ranging from brand to digital design. She is a 2013 Media Ideation Fellow, and an alumni of Florida A&M University and teaches design at General Assemb.ly. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse.

Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

That is impressive seeing how the AMD FX Series of processors struggles to keep up with most any Intel quad-core processor released over the past several years. We’ve never actually benchmarked the Intel Core i7-6900K processor and seeing how AMD is focusing the performance of Ryzen against that particular processor it seemed like it might be a good idea to have an Intel 8-core processor in our benchmark charts for comparison sake. We are also very interested in seeing how the 6900K performs in our updated benchmark test suite for 2017. Intel Broadwell-E LGA2011-3 Desktop CPU Lineup SKU Name Cores/Threads Core Clock Boost Clock L3 Cache TDP PCIe Lanes Price (USD) Core i7-6950X 10/20 3.0 GHz 3.5 GHz 25 MB 140W 40 $1635 Core i7-6900K 8/16 3.2 GHz 3.7 GHz 20 MB 140W 40 $1030 Core i7-6850K 6/12 3.6 GHz 3.8 GHz 15 MB 140W 40 $570 Core i7-6800 6/12 3.4 GHz 3.6 GHz 15 MB 140W 28 $420   The Intel Core i7-6950X and Core i7-6900K processor are aimed at those that need as many processing cores that they can get on a desktop platform. If four or six cores aren’t enough and you have the proper funds, you can move up to an eight or ten core processor. Thanks to Intel Hyper-Threading technology you’ll actually end up with double that number when it comes to threads, so you can run up to 20 simultaneous operations at once!  All four of these HEDT parts have Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 and the good news on that front is that Microsoft has been offering native support for that since Windows 10 Anniversary Update (version 1607 and beyond). If you are running an older OS you’ll need to install a separate driver on Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and earlier Windows 10 releases. You can find that driver here if you are needing it. For those that have unlimited cash and want the most cores available, the Intel Core i7-6950X for $1635 is the easy choice. If you actually have a budget the Intel Core i7-6900K is an interesting processor as it costs roughly 37% less than the 6950X and has faster clocked cores despite having 20% fewer. The Core i7-6900K’s base and boost clock speeds are each 200 MHz higher than the Core i7-6950X 10-core processor, so it might actually be faster on lightly threaded applications. Both processors have 40 PCI Express lanes, so you don’t have to worry about the limitations of the Intel Core i7-6800 on Intel X99 platforms. Since this processor has been out since Q2’2016 we’ll get right to the benchmarks after looking at the test systems on the next page. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

In SLI or crossfire, 8 PCI express lanes are enough to drive a second GPU without a bottleneck. Or you can just forget about SLI or Crossfire – a single GTX 1080 get’s the job done – even at 4K. You may have to dial back settings in the latest games – which I’ve done and the games still look great. Only in the most heavy threaded applications will you benefit from having 8 cores over 6. Those applications always make you wait…you’ll still be waiting…only waiting less. If your workload is only sometimes heavy threaded (Arguably 99+% of people on the planet) then you can save yourself another $600. When you compare the extra money spent versus the performance gained, the i7-6800K really shines. Dorian Kunch Nate, thanks for the thorough review and including my 2700K at 4.5 in da mix. I can still sit tight.

Apple blog Pike's Universum uncovered a trio of motherboard identifiers that do not correspond with any current MacBook Pro model, but use the exact same processor power management data as 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models released in late 2016. The plist files do not exist in previous macOS Sierra versions. The next-generation MacBook Pro models would likely be powered by Intel's faster Kaby Lake processors, which are the natural successor to Skylake processors used in late 2016 models. This would be in line with a report from six weeks ago claiming the MacBook Pro will receive only minor bumps in processing power for 2017. Mac-B4831CEBD52A0C4C would likely be for two new 13-inch MacBook Pro models with function keys. The models would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3400 MHz and 4000 MHz respectively. Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921 would likely be for three new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. These notebooks would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3500/3700 MHz and 4000 MHz respectively. Mac-551B86E5744E2388 would likely be for three new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. These notebooks would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3800/3900 MHz and 4100 MHz respectively.The blog said it checked the performance bias setting of each motherboard and determined that they are unlikely to be for desktop models such as the iMac and Mac Pro. There is also no GPU data as of yet. The blog cross-referenced Intel's lineup of Kaby Lake processors currently available with the motherboard identifiers and was able to determine which chips are likely to be used in each new MacBook Pro: 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W)Apple seeded the first beta of macOS 10.12.4 to developers on January 24, and additional betas should follow. It is highly unlikely Apple will launch new MacBook Pros until the software update is officially released at the earliest, which should happen by late February or early March based on previous releases. Apple could feasibly launch next-generation MacBook Pro models at any point following the release of macOS 10.2.4, but its late 2016 models are still rather new. WWDC 2017 in June is likely the earliest possibility for a refresh, but previous rumors also point towards a launch in the second half of 2017 or later. Last month, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said new Kaby Lake-equipped MacBook Pros will enter mass production in the July quarter. He also mentioned a "15-inch MacBook" that will include 32GB of RAM and enter mass production in the early fourth quarter, which starts in September.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Report: Intel to launch a Kaby Lake chip with AMD Radeon graphics 02/04/2017 at 9:23 AM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Chip makers Intel and AMD may be seen as rivals, but late last year HardOCP’s Kyle Bennett reported that Intel was planning to launch a new product featuring an Intel CPU and AMD graphics. Now he’s followed up with some more details, suggesting that the new multi-chip-module will launch before the end of 2017. Intel is said to be “licensing AMD GPU technology” with the goal of releasing a module sporting an Intel 7th-gen “Kaby Lake” processor bundled with an AMD graphics processor. This may just be the first of several such offerings. The first Intel/AMD solution is said to be aimed at entry-level or mid-range devices, which suggests Intel isn’t necessarily hoping to sway customers for its high-end products featuring Intel Iris integrated graphics. But using AMD Radeon graphics rather than Intel HD graphics could allow Intel to bring higher-performance graphics to its more affordable products. Keep in mind, neither Intel nor AMD have verified any of this information, and Bennett says “no money has changed hands yet,” which is allegedly why there are no details about the deal in the latest earnings reports from the two companies. via TechPowerUp Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Latest News BLU Tank Xtreme 5.0 is a cheap, rugged Android phone Budget phone maker BLU's latest device is a $130 Android smartphone that has a … [Read More...] Reports: Xiaomi is working on its own line of smartphone chips, dubbed “Pinecone” Chinese phone maker Xiaomi also produces a whole bunch of other things, … [Read More...] GPD Pocket 7 inch laptop crowfunding campaign starts Feb 15th The GPD Pocket is a tiny laptop computer with a 7 inch full HD display, an Intel … [Read More...] Deals Deals of the Day (2-10-2017) Sure, the biggest smartphone show of the year is coming up at the end of the … [Read More...] Featured articles Intel Compute Card is a tiny PC for a modular world Intel envisions a world where you'll be able to buy a smart TV, smart … [Read More...] The Loving Project: a podcast celebrating 50th anniversary of Loving v Virginia In 1967 the Supreme Court struck down state laws banning interracial marriage. … [Read More...] Playing with Fire: Hacking Amazon’s $50 Fire tablet The Amazon Fire Tablet may not be one the best tablets money can buy, but more … [Read More...] Latest news from the LPX Show LPX Episode 14: Adapted (Kaomi Goetz on Korean international adoptees returning to Korea) LPX Episode 13: Someone is wrong on the internet!

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Feb 7, 2017 at 8:54AM On Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) most recent earnings call, CFO Robert Swan provided some insight into the company's gross profit margin guidance for the full year of 2017. Intel guided to full-year gross profit margin of 62% on a GAAP basis for 2017 -- a 110 basis point (1.1%) improvement from the 60.9% gross profit margin that it reported for 2016. A pair of Apple iPhones. Image source: Apple. Interestingly, Intel tells investors to expect gross profit margin of 62% in the first quarter of 2017, which suggests that the company isn't expecting margins to improve throughout the year. This is a little bit surprising, as Intel usually enjoys the benefit of revenue leverage during the second half of any given year relative to the first half, since industrywide personal computer sales tend to be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first. Swan explained what's going on, and from that explanation, the chipmaker appears to be betting on having won cellular modem orders for the next-generation Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. The CFO speaks Swan said that "headwinds" to the company's gross profit margin in 2017 compared to 2016 will come in the form of increased non-volatile memory product sales, as well as from modem sales. The executive was quick to explain that increased memory and modem sales lead to "good growth, increasing profitability, [and] good earnings." That said, he also conceded that those products carry lower gross profit margins than the rest of the company's business. The way to think about it is this: It's generally better for a company to sell $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit margin and $30 worth of product at 30% gross profit margin -- diluting the average gross profit margin percentage to 53% -- than to just sell the $100 worth of product at 60% gross profit margin, assuming all else is equal. What does this have to do with the iPhone 8? Circling back to the topic at hand, let's go over why this commentary might suggest that Intel is inside the next iPhone. If we look at the trend in Intel's cellular modem revenue, we see that the company saw an initial ramp-up of shipments during its third quarter, with sales accelerating in the fourth quarter. This is consistent with Apple's iPhone ramp-up plans: it builds a bunch of phones in anticipation of the launch, sells even more phones in the quarter following the launch, and then it sees iPhone sales cool off in the following quarters -- until the cycle begins anew. If Intel doesn't expect to be in the next-generation iPhone, then investors should expect the company to see a substantial drop in cellular modem revenue during the second half of 2017. (In this case, Intel would only be shipping modems into older, discounted iPhone 7 models.) In that case, cellular modems wouldn't be a headwind to gross profit margin improvement for Intel during the second half of 2017 relative to the first half of 2017, since its cellular modem volumes/revenue would naturally decline -- proving a tailwind to average gross profit margin, not a headwind. It seems likely, then, that Intel expects to be inside of at least some of Apple's next-generation iPhone models. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

At that time HardOCP Editor, Kyle Bennett, had recently posted a statement saying that there would be Intel processors packing AMD GPU technology in the not-too-distant future. Bennett seemed to have a lot of faith in his sources and in the fact that the deal was done. Just ahead of the weekend Mr Bennett returned to his site's forums to reaffirm his position. He published the statement as reproduced below: OK. Got information back on this. Everything I have mentioned here is definitively correct. Intel is licensing AMD GPU technology. No money has changed hands yet, so there is not financial impact till late in the year, hence nothing in the current earnings report. The first product AMD is working on for Intel is a Kaby Lake processor variant that will positioned in the entry-to-mid level performance segment. It is in fact an MCM (multi-chip-module), and will not be on-die with the KB CPU. It is scheduled to come to market before the end of the year. I would expect more collaboration between AMD and Intel in the future on the graphics side. And you can take all that to the bank. As mentioned back in December, Intel's Nvidia GPU licensing agreement is to expire - and now it's just around the corner, the end of next month to be exact. There are no reports of an extension to the existing Intel / Nvidia deal. If a new deal is brokered by any of the three parties at the end of March it should be announced to investors, as it is share-price sensitive information. Some kind of Intel / AMD deal does look increasingly likely. However, a Kaby Lake processor with Radeon graphics sounds like something that could possibly harm the prospects of AMD's own Raven Ridge APUs, for example. Furthermore, did we see Intel processors with Nvidia GPUs on board during the existing licensing deal? - No. Time will tell.

The first set of products with Kaby Lake-U were ultrabooks. However, ultra-compact form-factor (UCFF) PCs were not long behind. There are already three vendors in the market with Kaby Lake UCFF PCs - ASRock (Beebox-S), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi 2). We have already reviewed the MSI Cubi 2 - a no-frills Kaby Lake 'NUC' The most important differentiating features of the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U include a USB 3.1 Gen 2 bridge, as well as a LSPCon (for HDMI 2.0 / HDCP 2.2 support) on the motherboard. This review takes a look at how the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U fares in typical UCFF PC workloads. Introduction Ultra-compact form factor (UCFF) PCs have become quite popular after Intel introduced the NUCs. They have become powerful enough to be the primary computing platform for many households. In addition to the Intel NUCs, many system vendors have come up with their own approach to UCFF PCs. These include ASRock (with the Beebox series), ECS (LIVA), GIGABYTE (BRIX), and MSI (Cubi) amongst others. Kaby Lake-U, as per Intel's claims, is fabricated on a much more mature 14nm process and brings about a 11% improvement in performance for the same power consumption. The GPU's media engine has also been updated. On the whole, the performance improvements look good for UCFF PCs - particularly for those upgrading from the first or second-generation systems. We have reviewed multiple Beebox systems before (Cherry Trail, Skylake), and, from an industrial design viewpoint, the Beebox-S 7200U Kaby Lake version is no different. The dimensions are one of the smallest to allow the installation of a 2.5" drive. Unlike the MSI Cubi 2, the Beebox-S 7200U supports a M.2 2280 SSD (with the help of a M.2 riser - the same as the one used in the Skylake Beebox-S 6200U). The Kaby Lake Beebox series is currently made of two SKUs, one based on the Core i3-7100U and another based on the Core i5-7200U. Both of these come barebones (no storage, memory, or OS). ASRock sampled us the version with the Core i5-7200U. The Beebox-S 7200U can take up to two DDR4 SO-DIMMs (operating at 2133 MHz). We completed the hardware build to result in the following specifications for our Beebox-S 7200U review configuration. Note that we processed most of our benchmarks with the NVMe drive, but a few testing routines used the SATA SSD (the relevant sections will go into the details). ASRock Beebox-S 7200U Specifications Processor Intel Core i5-7200U Kaby Lake, 2C/4T, 2.5 GHz (up to 3.1 GHz), 14nm PLUS, 3MB L2, 15W TDP Memory G Skill F4-2133C15-8GRS DDR4 15-15-15-36 @ 2133 MHz 2x8 GB Graphics Intel HD Graphics 620 Disk Drive(s) Samsung SSD 950 PRO (512 GB; M.2 Type 2280 PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe; 40nm; MLC V-NAND) (OR) Crucial MX200 CT500MX200SSD1 (500 GB; 2.5in SATA 6Gb/s; 16nm; MLC) Networking Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3160 (1x1 802.11ac - 433 Mbps) 1x Intel I-219V Gigabit LAN Display 1x mini-Display Port 1.2 (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) 1x HDMI 1.4b (4096x2160 @ 24 Hz) 1x HDMI 2.0a (3840x2160 @ 60 Hz) Audio 3.5mm Headphone Jack & Microphone Combo Jack Capable of 5.1/7.1 digital output with HD audio bitstreaming (HDMI) Miscellaneous I/O Ports 3x USB 3.0 (Type-A) 1x USB 3.1 Gen 2 (Type-C) Operating System Retail unit is barebones, but we installed Windows 10 Pro x64 Pricing $350 (barebones) $815 (as configured with NVMe SSD) / $666 (as configured with SATA SSD) Full Specifications ASRock Beebox-S 7200U specifications Buy ASRock Beebox-S 7200U on Amazon.com The ASRock Beebox-S 7200U kit doesn't come with any pre-installed OS, but does come with a CD containing Windows drivers. In any case, we ended up installing the latest drivers downloaded off ASRock's product support page. In addition to the main unit, the other components of the package include a 65 W (19V @ 3.42A) adapter with a US power connector, a VESA mount (along with the necessary screws), a driver CD, user's manual and a quick-start guide. In addition, we also have the appropriate cables - both data and power - to install a 2.5" drive in the system. A small IR remote control with a pre-installed CR232 battery (not shown in the picture below) is also part of the package. The unique part of the package is a small plastic tab and an additional screw that allows for installation of a M.2 2280 SSD in the unit. Note that even though Kaby Lake-U can theoretically support up to three simultaneous displays, the Beebox-S 7200U supports only two at a time (either HDMI 2.0 + HDMI 1.4 or HDMI 2.0 + DP). Other components that reside on the underside of the motherboard include the ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 bridge chip and the MegaChips LSPCon to enable the HDMI 2.0 output from the DisplayPort output of the Kaby Lake-U SiP. The most important update from the Skylake Beebox is the additional HDCP 2.2 capability and DRM capabilities enabled by the Kaby Lake-U processor. The PCIe lanes from the SiP are distributed as follow: PCI-E 2.0 x1 port #4      In Use @ x1 (ASMedia ASM1142 USB 3.1 xHCI Controller) PCI-E 2.0 x1 port #5      In Use @ x1 (Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 3160 AC HMC WiFi Adapter) PCI-E 2.0 x4 port #9      In Use @ x4 (Samsung NVMe SSD Controller) ASRock's BIOS has plenty of features that are missing in the BIOS from other vendors. I will not go into the details of all the BIOS features, but, readers interested in checking out the available options can peruse the user manual available here. Compared to the MSI Cubi 2 with Kaby Lake, we find the Realtek GbE adapter replaced by the Intel I-219V. The Wi-Fi adapter is the Intel AC3160 compared to the AC3168. Compared to the barebones Core i5 version of the Cubi 2 (Cubi2-006BUS) at $375, the Beebox-S 7200U with the same processor is cheaper at $350 and also comes with better capabilities. In the table below, we have an overview of the various systems that we are comparing the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U against. Note that they may not belong to the same market segment. The relevant configuration details of the machines are provided so that readers have an understanding of why some benchmark numbers are skewed for or against the ASRock Beebox-S 7200U when we come to those sections.

Reply lordmocha - Tuesday, February 07, 2017 - link According to "7th-gen-core-family-desktop-s-processor-lines-datasheet-vol-1.pdf": 2.5.8 describes the CPU display support info: "The HDCP 2.2 keys are integrated into the processor and customers are not required to physically configure or handle the keys. HDCP2.2 for HDMI2.0 is covered by the LSPCON platform device." (The LSPCON is the 3rd party motherboard soldered down solution.) DP supports HDCP2.2 with HDR (4k@60 10 bit) HDMI1.4 does supports HDCP2.2 but NO HDR (4k@30 8 bit) HDMI2.0 does supports HDCP2.2 but NO HDR (4k@60 12bit (YUV 420)) HDMI2.1 does supports HDCP2.2 with HDR (4k@60 12bit (YUV 420)) 2.4.3.1 describes the CPU Hardware Accelerated Video Decode support: HEVC/H265 (8 bit) Profile: Main, Level: 5.1: Max Resolution: 2160p HEVC/H265 (10 bit) Profile: Main, BT2020, isolate Dec, Level: 5.1, Max Resolution: 2160p It does not clarify if these are HEVC Version 1 profiles or HEVC Version 2 profiles. It does says "All supported media codecs operate on 8 bpc, YCbCr 4:2:0 video profiles.". Reply lordmocha - Wednesday, February 08, 2017 - link Of note is the CPU maxes out at HEVC level 5.1 whereas the HEVC spec goes up to level 6.2, and videos can be found online using levels above 5.1, thus they won't be able to be hardware decoded. vdpauinfo output would be nice to see Reply DanNeely - Tuesday, February 07, 2017 - link Is it just weird perspective, or is the computer shown on the packaging a much longer model than the one that was reviewed? Reply BrokenCrayons - Tuesday, February 07, 2017 - link Like all NUC form factor systems, this one is adorably cute! Cooling looks like its done via the internal fan and movement of air so it's a candidate for a collection of kitten stickers on the outside. Those won't hurt internal temps, I'm thinking because of the case being made from plastic. Too bad about the heat issues. It probably won't be a problem under normal use right from the start, but dust buildup might take its toll over time. I do wish companies overbuilt their cooling systems a bit to tolerate fan slowdown and dust. Reply fanofanand - Wednesday, February 08, 2017 - link That would blow up the "planned obsolescence" strategy. Reply BrokenCrayons - Wednesday, February 08, 2017 - link Does a company really need to do something like that with a NUC box? The CPU is soldered down and the motherboards can't be swapped out so the obsolescence is already implied. Designing and installing effective cooling probably would save a company money on in-warranty returns and build goodwill toward the brand by limiting failures and possible erratic behavior. Reply fanofanand - Thursday, February 09, 2017 - link Your logic is sound, but most failures don't occur within the warranty period. Sometimes it seems they set the warranty period based on failure rates during QA testing. If they have a 50% failure rate on year 4 they just make sure the warranty is 3 years (oversimplified and inaccurate figures but that's the gist of it). Auto manufacturers have been doing this for decades, there was a reason most powertrain warranties went to 50,000 miles but massive head gasket failures or transmission failures would occur at 60k (I experienced both with GM products which is why they won't be getting any more of my hard earned money).

By Liam Tung | February 7, 2017 -- 11:31 GMT (03:31 PST) | Topic: Laptops Lenovo's ThinkPad P71 is designed to help creators meet the expected growing demand for virtual-reality content. Image: Lenovo One of three new ThinkPad Windows 10 mobile workstations from Lenovo is just for virtual-reality content creators. To help creators meet the expected growing demand for VR content, Lenovo has released its new mobile ThinkPad P71 workstation. The unit has Oculus, HTC, and Nvidia certifications, and it's powered by Intel's Xeon E3-v6 processors for mobile, while its GPU options max out at Nvidia's Quadro 5000. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet review: Compact, robust and modular Lenovo's 12-inch ThinkPad X1 Tablet is a compact and robust modular 2-in-1 hybrid. It's not cheap though, and you'll probably have to add the optional Productivity Module to get reliable all-day battery life. Read More The 17-inch laptop weighs in at a hefty 7.6lb (3.4kg), coming with 64GB RAM and four storage devices with up to 1TB of SSD storage. It also features a 4K UHD display with the option to switch to a FHD touch display and dual-fan cooling. Operating system options consist of Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Also available are a range of connectivity options, including four USB 3.0 ports, dual Intel Thunderbolt 3 ports to help move big files, a docking connector, and smartcard reader. Lenovo is also tipping in two new 15-inch ThinkPad models. The ThinkPad P51s is over half a pound lighter than its predecessor, making it the lightest and thinnest mobile workstation ever built by Lenovo's ThinkPad brand. The model weighs 4.3lb (1.95kg) and is 0.79 inches (20.2mm) thick, featuring a 15.6-inch 4K UHD IPS display with optional FHD touchscreen. Top options for the P51s are a seventh-generation Intel Core i7 processor, Nvidia Quadro M520M graphics chip, 32GB RAM, and either HDD or SSD storage of up to 1TB. It also features a USB-C port with Intel's Thunderbolt 3 technology, three USB 3.0 ports, and a docking connector. OS options are Windows 10 or Windows 7. The P51 meanwhile caters to engineers but doesn't aim for Ultrabook status, weighing 5.6lb (2.5kg) with a thickness of 1.02 inches (25.9mm). Still, it does offer Intel Xeon E3-v6 mobile processors, seventh-generation Intel core processors, and up to two Quadro M2200M graphics chips, with 64GB RAM and up to 1TB storage. Operating system options are the same as the P71's, with Windows 10, Ubuntu Linux, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The cheapest of the three is the ThinkPad P51s, which goes on sale in March from $1,049. The pricier ThinkPad P51 and P71 will arrive a month later, and will start at $1,399 and $1,849, respectively.

Photographer: Bob Levey/Getty Images The synchronized swarm of 300 drones lit up the night sky behind Lady Gaga, morphing into an American flag as she recited the Pledge of Allegiance. Sunday’s Super Bowl halftime light show -- prerecorded to comply with prohibitions on flying drones over people -- was choreographed by Intel Corp. It provided a dramatic backdrop for the performance and also illustrated the ways large companies are embracing unmanned aircraft in sometimes unexpected ways. Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. Photographer: Bob Levey/Getty Images The registration of drones used for business has gone from a trickle to a flood. Only a handful were listed in the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft registration database a few years ago. That number swelled to 6,683 as of the end of 2016, according to agency records analyzed by Bloomberg. The list of companies reads like a who’s who of top U.S. corporations, along with startups seeking to catch the wave of unmanned commerce. It comprises old-guard railroads like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s BNSF, utilities including Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric Co., and technology companies like Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and a company that has supplied drones to Alphabet Inc.’s Project Wing. In December alone, Disney Co.’s TV network, ABC Inc., registered 29 drones, bringing its total to 51. 37,000 More “It does show that there is a lot of interest, and this industry is, pardon the pun, really ready to take off,” Tom McMahon, a spokesman for the Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a Virginia-based trade group, said in an interview. The companies listed in the FAA’s database are the ones the public knows about. Most unmanned aircraft now are being registered in a new, separate online system that the agency has ruled isn’t public information. It has a total of more than 37,000 additional commercial drones registered since the agency created it a year ago. Intel, for example, had registered 112 drones in the public database, giving it the second-largest total. Those were for an earlier light show. The hundreds it has used for the Super Bowl and other recent events are registered separately in the nonpublic system, spokeswoman Krystal Temple said in an e-mail. Temple declined to say how many unmanned craft the company has in the U.S. “Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before,” Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, said in a statement. The portion of Gaga’s performance including the light show was taped in advance, Temple said. U.S. regulations prohibit drones from flying over people in most cases. The Federal Aviation Administration also imposed a temporary drone ban around the stadium. Before drone commerce can really flourish, the FAA must expand the current regulations that mostly prohibit flights above people and over long distances, according to the Small UAV Coalition trade group. A UAV is an unmanned aerial vehicle. “But what we are seeing, which is incredibly exciting, is companies are investing in this,” Michael Drobac, the coalition’s executive director, said in an interview. The Washington-based group represents companies including Amazon and Intel. The use of drones for business has benefited from regulatory changes. The FAA put rules in place last year allowing more routine commercial drone flights during the day, at low altitudes and within sight of an operator. It also set up a waiver process to allow night operations or other expanded missions if an applicant proves they are safe. While automated drone deliveries and other far-flung uses won’t be permitted initially, the agency is laying the foundation for expansion. It is crafting a proposal to allow some drone flights over people, for example. Gaga’s roof-top opening portion of the Super Bowl show, with drones forming a star-like backdrop, also was pretaped prior to the game and fed into the broadcast, Temple said. Fans in the stadium had to watch it on video, just like people at home. Intel also produced a holiday show with Disney in Florida from Nov. 20 through Jan. 8, with drones forming a green Christmas tree and a blue dove, among other effects. Drones on Way to U.S. Sky With Privacy Issues in Tow: QuickTake Through the end of 2014, there had been only about 230 drones registered with the FAA, almost all by companies manufacturing the devices, such as military supplier Aerovironment Inc., academic institutions researching them or government agencies, according to FAA data. That began to change after the FAA created a process in 2014 for businesses to use unmanned aircraft. By March 2015, at least 100 were being registered per month. The registrations in the FAA’s public database peaked last May with 449. An analysis of more than 5,500 of the initial permits granted for commercial drone flights issued by the FAA before the latest regulations went into effect found that most were for small companies with less than $1 million in annual revenue for purposes involving aerial photography or data collection, according to the AUVSI. Mapping, Agriculture One smaller company hoping to capitalize on the new industry had registered the most drones in the FAA’s system. PrecisionHawk USA Inc., which operates drones for agriculture and mapping, listed 113 of its aircraft, beating out Intel by a single drone, according to the FAA’s data. The Raleigh, North Carolina-based company provides drone services to companies that prefer not to own and operate them. Its remote sensors and mapping tools can be used by insurance agents documenting property damage and by farmers assessing their crops, said Thomas Haun, PrecisionHawk’s vice president of global strategy. The company also has teamed up with Deere & Co. to add value to the data it collects. John Deere tractors can be programmed to automatically fertilize needy patches of soil identified from drone flights. Green Mountain Power Corp., which provides three-quarters of Vermont’s electricity, has 16 drones it uses for maintenance, mostly in emergencies, spokeswoman Kristin Carlson said. It has even used drones to check on whether osprey nests on its poles were abandoned or occupied, Mike Burke, director of field operations, said. ABC’s news division is embracing drones in a big way, said Maria Stefanopoulos, production manager for the Good Morning America show. The network is equipping every one of its field producers with an unmanned aircraft so they can be used to cover disasters and other breaking-news events, Stefanopoulos said. A project to film a volcano in Iceland two years ago showed the value of mounting cameras on unmanned aircraft, she said, and they’ve been used since for coverage of forest fires and tornadoes. “We realized it was going to change the way we told stories forever,” she said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The contract, which is seen by many industry experts as unnecessary and shady, will see Sibton Switch Systems Limited – a company formed only in August 2015 – run a system to make banks, mobile money platforms and other payment systems interoperable. Initial figure sighted by DAILY GUIDE as the cost submitted by Sibton to the Bank of Ghana (BoG) for the implementation of the retail payment system was GH¢4,667,414,340.82. What raises eyebrows is the fact that two other entities that bid for the same contract – Vas Intel Limited and Mericom Solutions Limited – submitted tender amounts and packages worth GH¢14,094,795.00 and GH¢5,465,396.06 respectively. Vas Intel Files For Annulment Minutes of a tender committee meeting dated Monday, July 04, 2016, capture the bids submitted by all the three interested companies. The tender committee, chaired by Mr Innocent Asamoah, in its remarks after the evaluation of the tenders, concluded that all three were responsive and met their expectations and so awarded the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. This led Vas InteL Limited to write to the BoG to protest the award of the contract to Sibton Switch Systems Limited. In its letter dated July 25, 2016, Vas Intel wrote that it was conceivably impracticable for the BoG to award a contract to Sibton within six business days after the opening of tenders on July 4, 2016. According to the letter, “All procurement actions taken by the BoG pursuant to Act 663 must be done with a strict and uncompromising adherence to the principles of transparency and fairness so as to protect and preserve public property and interest, as well as the integrity of the laws governing public procurement within the territory of the Republic of Ghana.” Telecom operators in the country are unhappy about moves by the Central Bank to impose on them a third-party company which will be intermediate in mobile money transactions across different networks. Telecom Operators Outraged The Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications has bared its teeth at the Central Bank and condemned the move to impose Sibton Switch Systems Limited on the players in the industry. In a letter dated January 9, 2017, the chamber argues that the move by the BoG and Sibton is not in alignment with international standards or benchmarks. They also argue that the fees being charged by the switch are too high and have the potential to undermine the successes chalked by the industry. The Telecoms Chamber, after meetings with banks, mobile money operators and the Central Bank, warned that aside the outrageous costs of the project, the scope was also not well defined and could run the industry into a state of chaos. Case For GHIPSS The Ghana Interbank Payment and Settlement Systems Limited (GhIPSS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ghana. It was incorporated in May 2007 with a mandate to implement and manage interoperable payment system infrastructure for banks and non-bank financial institutions in Ghana. Industry leaders believe that the BoG should annul the deal with Sibton Switch Systems Limited and offer GhIPSS the needed leverage to continue integrating payment systems like they have successfully done over the past decade.

Contacto Casa   Financiera Espectáculos Tecnología Deporte Mundo Salud Sábado, 11 Febrero, 2017 Tecnología Lenovo Introduces New ThinkPad Workstations at SOLIDWORKS World 2017 Lenovo Introduces New ThinkPad Workstations at SOLIDWORKS World 2017 Ramiro Mantilla | 06 Febrero, 2017, 23:37 The ThinkPad P71 brings professionals across industries - ranging from media and entertainment to manufacturing - the most powerful system with a dedication to new and emerging technology to meet the needs of the most discerning users in the most demanding fields of work. "Lenovo's VR-ready ThinkPad P71 with Quadro Pascal-based GPUs for mobile workstations provides the performance, features and memory required for creating the most compelling VR experiences anywhere". For $1,399 in April, you'll also be able to get your hands on the ThinkPad P51. "Lenovo's VR-ready ThinkPad P71 with Quadro Pascal-based GPUs for mobile workstations provides the performance, features and memory required for creating the most compelling VR experiences anywhere". The 7.6-pound mobile workstation is powered by either Intel's Xeon E3-v6 series or Intel seventh generation Kaby Lake Core i7 processors. Thanks to its heft (the P51 comes in at 5.6 pounds), it can pack in four memory slots and a more powerful graphics card, the Nvidia Quadro M2200M, compared to the P51s. This business behemoth is available with an X-Rite Pantone sensor for calibrating the screen color on its 4K display. Moving on to its slightly smaller brethren, the ThinkPad P51 has a 15-inch display available in FHD (touch or non-touch) and 4K UHD resolutions. This new line of P Series machines is tuned on both the software and hardware fronts to tackle tasks in the areas of advanced analysis, to engineering, animation, and building design. The ThinkPad P51's port layout largely resembles that of the ThinkPad P71, but only features a single Thunderbolt 3 port instead of two. Lenovo is also going to sell an optional IR camera with the device, and it also sports Thunderbolt 3. This year's Xeon CPUs cut down a fair bit on power usage, which could be a big deal for medium or large companies concerned with their energy bills. The P71 will be an intriguing option for fledgling VR developers - Lenovo is advertising it as VR-ready, and it'll have the power to allow developers to work on their games from a mobile workstation. Today, in conjunction with the Solidworks World 3D CAD tradeshow, Lenovo announced their ThinkPad P Series mobile workstations.

In the same session, AMD showed its Zen x86 processor sports a 10 percent smaller die than Intel’s latest 14nm CPUs. The Stratix X uses Intel’s Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) to link the FPGA with four external transceivers. The bridge is made using silicon die mounted in a BGA substrate which is significantly smaller than the silicon substrates used in the CoWoS process developed by TSMC and used by rival FPGA vendor Xilinx and GPU designer Nvidia. EMIB uses a combination of 55 micron micro-bumps and 100+ micron flip-chip bumps to support up to 24 transceiver channels with 96 I/Os each. They deliver 2 Gbits/second/pin at 1.2 pJ/bit/die using a proprietary protocol. Click here to read more ...

Lenovo's Yoga A12 Android 2-in-1 has futuristic touch panel keyboard The Yoga A12 replaces the hard keyboard with a touch panel one Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 06 February, 2017 16:01 0 - - - - print email Lenovo is ditching the hard keyboard for a cool new touch one on its new Yoga A12 2-in-1, which can be an Android tablet or a laptop. But for those seeking the latest and greatest hardware, there's a disappointment. It runs on an old chip from Intel, which has rolled back its development of Android, raising questions on the frequency of OS updates. The highlight of Yoga A12 is the versatile touch panel that can be a smartphone-like virtual keyboard. It's a feature adapted from the Yoga Book, which was introduced last year. The Yoga A12 has a 12.2-inch touchscreen, and a back-lit input touch panel replaces the hard keyboard. Lenovo said the virtual keyboard provides a user experience similar to on-screen ones on smartphones and tablets. Lenovo is betting that those comfortable with mobile typing will adapt quickly to this touch keyboard. The Android OS also provides a familiar mobile interface. The Yoga A12 has Android 6.0.1, and will ship in many countries this month starting at US$299.99. But there are some disappointments. The screen has a resolution of 1200 x 800 pixels, and its components are aging. It has Intel's Atom X5 tablet processor, code-named Cherry Trail, which the chip maker is now phasing out. Intel is replacing Atom X5 chips with newer Celeron and Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake, which are mainly going into Windows tablets and 2-in-1s. Intel in May last year discontinued Atom smartphone chips. Lenovo had an explanation on why it used Atom X5 in Yoga A12. "When Intel made its announcements about Atom, the Yoga A12 was already well in development. Intel has nevertheless committed to keeping the Atom X5 in the market to support the Yoga A12 and other products," a spokesperson said in an email. Lenovo said there's a clear upgrade path from Atom to Apollo Lake processors. That's an indication that Lenovo may use Apollo Lake chips in the successor to Yoga A12. Most Android devices today are based on ARM chips. Only a handful of Android tablets have Cherry Trail chips, including Lenovo's Yoga Book and Panasonic's ToughPad FZ-A2. PC makers are also quickly cutting Atom chips from tablets. Dell isn't selling Android tablets with Atom chips, and Microsoft has discontinued Surface 3, which had a Cherry Trail chip. Lenovo said it plans to upgrade Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0 in the next couple of months. Yet, there are questions on the frequency of OS upgrades. Intel -- which was responsible for developing Android updates -- has scaled back development of the OS for mobile devices, and is focusing more on Windows and Chromebooks. Lenovo may have to take on the development of a custom Android 7.0 for Yoga A12, which could be a challenging task. It could get some help from Intel and the open-source community. Current Atom-based Android mobile devices are mostly stuck at Android 5 or 6, and won't get Android 7.0. With 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, the Yoga A12 has features similar to that of a Chromebook -- except it is for Android users. But Chromebooks are now getting the ability to run Android applications. In the future, Lenovo plans to bring its virtual keyboard to Chromebooks as well.

(Images ISSCC) Currently, the bridge links four 28 GHz serdes to the FPGA. Intel has a road map to faster serdes and other kinds of external chips, said David Greenhill, an Intel engineer who presented the paper at ISSCC. The packaging technology drew several questions from a crowded session. Responding to a question from a Xilinx engineer, Greenhill said the Intel team doesn’t foresee any issues dealing with thermal challenges migrating the design to 56G serdes. Intel announced the technology more than two years ago as an offering in its foundry service. So far, it has not announced any other users of EMIB. The 14nm Stratix X packs 2.8 million logic elements into a 560mm2 fabric running at a gigahertz.

By TheresePoletti Columnist Shares of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have been on a tear since the company reported better-than-expected earnings last week, in a report that was drowned out by earnings from tech behemoth Apple Inc. In the past five days, its shares are up nearly 28%. On Monday alone, AMD’s AMD, +1.19%  stock soared 11.36%. A positive story in Barron’s, with the headline “AMD’s Revival is for Real,” and comments by CNBC’s Jim Cramer provided the most fodder for traders, but there was also an unconfirmed report that it will license its graphics chip designs to partner/frenemy Intel Corp. INTC, -0.34% when its deal with Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -2.37%   ends in March. Shares of AMD topped the most active gainers on Monday, and outperformed the S&P 500 SPX, +0.36%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.48%   An AMD spokesman declined to comment on the rumors of another licensing deal with Intel. (AMD already licenses the core x86 chip design from Intel.) Last week, several analysts raised their earnings estimates and price targets on AMD, the perennial No. 2 to Intel. AMD has a history of ups and downs, including financial woes, management issues and product execution problems. But as MarketWatch has noted in a previous column, many investors are counting on a new product family, known as Zen, to help it regain lost share in the server market, a fast-growing field where it has not been a player for the past few years. Betsy Van Hees, an analyst with Loop Capital Markets, has a buy rating on AMD and raised her price target to $12 last week. But she noted that she also has a new tone of cautiousness, because of concerns that the stock is now “priced to perfection.” “Although AMD had an impressive year of beats and raises in 2016, we believe the bar has been set very high in 2017 with AMD having no room for error,” she said. Why AMD Shares Are Soaring(5:00) Barron's Bounce: Graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices power devices that run applications ranging from video games to artificial intelligence. Plus: an undervalued energy play and what's next for Chipotle shares. AMD is set to launch three major chips in the first half of this year: A desktop processor called Ryzen based on its new Zen family architecture; graphics processing chips called Vega; and server chips also based on the new Zen architecture, with a processor called Naples. “We believe over the course of AMD’s long history that this is the first time the company has ever embarked upon such an aggressive endeavor to ramp three new products in such a short amount of time,” Van Hees wrote. The results from all these product launches are not going to be evident overnight, noted Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research. “Investors are going to want to see the fruits of the company’s labors translate into meaningful financial upside,” Rasgon wrote last week. “Additionally, given likely channel dynamics it will probably be 2018 before we know if gains, if any, are sustainable. This still requires a leap of faith we’re not quite ready to make.” AMD’s management, under Chief Executive Lisa Su, who joined AMD in October 2014, has made huge strides in building credibility again on Wall Street. Now, the next question is whether those same kind of gains can be made again in the corporate computing market. With its shares now surging past many analysts’ current price targets, it might wise to proceed with some caution.

View Latest Posts >>> Down Here on the Farm (Part II) By Preston James, Ph.D on February 6, 2017 We are being "farmed" and asset stripped by the Banksters. American soldiers have been used as profit-making cannon fodder in all wars engineered by the Banksters to "liberate" cheap natural resources for their corporate cronies. Our assets are being continuously stripped by the Banksters charging pernicious usury for "renting" what should have been our own money in the first place. How did this ever happen to us? by  Preston James Ever since the top brass of the US Army Air Corps (which later became the USAF) decided that the Roswell Crash had to be suppressed, a revolutionary change occurred in US Intel. Thus the Roswell crashed flying saucer story was immediately excised from the Major Mass Media and a flimsy cover story was substituted that a weather balloon crashed instead. The Big Boys who really run things decided this incident provided a terrific opportunity to seize complete control over the USG and the whole United States of America, including all dissonant political factions. How was this done? It was done using the same methodologies that locked down the Manhattan Project: use of special Intel classifications levels and “need to know” as a standard for what Intel was shared with whom. During WW2,a serious tone was projected that “loose lips” sink American ships in reaction to the discovery of the penetration of Nazi saboteurs in certain Eastern ports. The FBI under Hoover had moved quickly under wartime national security to arrest and stop these saboteurs. After Roswell. “If the human race knew the truth, some people would be worried…” After Roswell this same wartime attitude of the seriousness of secrecy being necessary to protect “national security” was also projected, intensified and taken to the extreme with the passage of the national Security Act of 1947 which gave the authority for the creation of the CIA. The CIA was never supposed to be deployed domestically but thanks to Roswell, asserted itself and took charge of the new USAF when it was transformed from the WW2 US Army Air Corps. The crashed Alien ET anti-gravity craft and Roswell and other locations was seized and used to manipulate President Truman into believing the CIA was necessary to protect this secret from the Russians and Chinese. Later Truman claimed this was the biggest mistake of his Presidency because he came to realize that the CIA spread its control all over America by setting up, acquiring and even hijacking hundreds of proprietary fronts as cover. Soon nobody knew where all these were, or what they were, nor did future Presidents have the necessary security clearances to be able to find out. The foreign technology back-engineering program at Patterson Army Air Corp Base (later to become Wright Patterson USAF Base). The Alien ET recovery program and back engineering of these anti-gravity craft led to deep-black and beyond-black unacknowledged programs buried deep within certain aeronautical and defense contractors which formed off the books secret alliances with the USAF and alternatively the USN, both competing for space superiority. Initially all the  analysis and back-engineering done at Patterson, later to become Wright Patterson USAF Base. Later, these functions were transferred to Groom lake, areas S4 and then S2 and finally to the Four Corners areas into cloaked bases underground. These underground bases opened up to receive aircraft and trucks. One well known was is located outside Sedona, Arizona allegedly connected to the large Argo Tunnel accessible through a hotel in Denver at one end for top brass to enter. The Banksters who sit at the top of the Pyramid of Power. Now consider the Big Boys that sit at the top of the hierarchical Pyramid of Power, that is, the illegal, unconstitutional private central Banksters. They asset strip We The People of vast amounts of our wealth through the issuing of fake Fiat “funny money” (script), the illegal, unconstitutional charging pernicious usury on use of this funny money, and the illegal, unconstitutional fraudulent pernicious usury on an imaginary debt. Obviously it is extreme RICO fraud to charge American’s pernicious usury to use what should have been their own money in the first place that isn’t even real money. This funny money is accepted only because there are illegal, unconstitutional laws requiring it to be accepted as “legal tender”. These City of London Banksters viewed Roswell and a great opportunity to lockdown all America by expanding this WW2 wartime concept of locking down secrecy. The CIA was set up by Third Reich Nazi Intel brought over under Operation paperclip run by Gehlen and Mueller with full support of the Duklless and Prescott Bush, even though Bush had his Union bank Assets seized and his hands slapped for supporting the Nazis during WW2. Prescott Bush became an informant for the FBI and gained immunity from prosecution for treason by signing an agreement that his progeny would never run for any political office. He was a hard core Nazi man like his “son” GHWB and the Dulles brothers. This immunity agreement Prescott Bush signed was allegedly the document Sandy Berger tried to steal from the National Security section of the US National Archives (and was caught and received minimal correction for). GHWB climbs to the top for managing Op40 at Dallas.  GHWB ran OP40 assassination of JFK, RFK and MLK and his reward was to climb the ladder into the higher levels of the Pyramid of Power. He created a massive Fourth Reich Intel operation that absorbed the CIA in full. This is best referred to as the Bush Crime Cabal (BCC) and many believe that Trump’s victory (whatever it turns out to be) was a complete defeat of the BCC. The CIA and the BCC as well as the Fourth Reich were merged into this CIA group and over 750 of the largest International Corporations bought with stolen Nazi Gold and assets. This was all allowed by the City Of London Rothschild Khazarian Banksters who formed a working partnership with them. There was a large secret “Roundtable” of Intel and organized crime entities formed that reputedly involved the Cosa Nostra, the Khazarian Mafia (included the Red Mafia in Soviet Russia and its satellites), the CIA, NATO (which included Gladio run by the Fourth Reich and their “left Behind Army”), the Japanese Yakuza and the Chinese Triads, and the Corsican Mafia. The Third Reich becomes the Fourth Reich and goes corporate “three piece suit”. In the mid 1950s the Third Reich went “three piece suit” becoming the Fourth Reich and allegedly formed a working relationship at the roundtable with the Israelis. Deals were made. Hitler had to be taken care of as did Bormann. It was alleged that the Israelis had been hunting these surviving Nazis in South America but did not have the power to get them because these Nazis has formed a secret alliance with the USG under paperclip. Thus the Nazis had been authorized by the USG to align themselves with South American dictators and provide their security services like they did for the Egyptian government. Otto Skorzeny Skorzeny makes a deal with the Babylonian Talmudists (aka Khazarians). Supposedly Skorzeny who believed that the Israelis were hunting him as Peron started losing power, used back channels to negotiate a deal with the Israelis. If he was to do some occasional wetwork for them and make certain that the Nazi enclaves and safe-houses in South America were for the most part defanged or destroyed as false cover suggesting an end to the Third Reich, he would be left alone. However, it is a good bet that the Israelis had much more in mind such as forming a strategic partnership with the new arising Fourth Reich as the USG was busy doing in order to use the Nazi technology, drug business and worldwide Intel network. Like a number of the top Nazis, use of doubles and faked deaths was something Bormann was an expert in. Accounts vary, some believe that he died in the mid 1950’s which a better bet is that he lived until other early 1980’s living in luxury in Buenos Aries serving as CEO of the Fourth Reich. What is  not in doubt is that Bormann was the Third Reich’s business manager and also the Fourth Reich’s initial one and played a key role in transforming the Third Reich into the Fourth Reich, using the vast wealth that the Third Reich acquired. Where all the Gold and assets the Third Reich came from is a very big mystery. Yes there was the gold confiscated by the Nazi machine all over Europe, but some researchers have hypothesized that the Nazis actually found Solomon’s missing gold from Old Testament times. In any event the Third Reich morphed into the Fourth Reich, completely three piece suit, corporate on the surface, while forming a partnership with the CIA and Mossad to set up the drug cartels in South America and run them. Conflict was always elicited between the cartels to keep them from getting too strong. Special ops, spooky teams and Delta Forces were allegedly used to keep non-payers in line who went off the reservation and broke the rules. Fourth Reich and the Israeli (Khazarian mafia) merge together at the City of London Banksters “Roundtable of Organized crime conglomerates”. It is seemingly quite counterintuitive for the Israelis to sit at the same Roundtable with the Fourth Reich and other organized crime conglomerates. But the best reports suggest that this is what actually occurred. And this is why the Cosa Nostra went into business with the CIA in trafficking in opium from the Golden Triangle and later cocaine from the Mena Arkansas operations of GHWB. What is truly amazing is that all this is hidden in plain sight and could be easily researched, but few even working in the CIA or top LE have any clue that this is what is really going on or what the select powerbrokers at the top of the Pyramid of Power are really like or stand for. A secret war between the USAF (hijacked by the BCC) and the US Navy. Some insiders claim that the USN has succeeded in becoming the prominent Secret Space War agency even over the USAF. And some have claimed that there has been a secret war ongoing between the USAF which was fully absorbed by the CIA and the Bush Crime Cabal (BCC) that hijacked it against the USN. Allegedly this war went live when the Pentagon was struck at the Naval Intel offices by a Tomahawk cruise missile with a hardened nose cone fired from an Israeli Dolphin Class diesel sub purchased from the Germans. This set off the pre-planted internal charges that murdered many innocents including about 25 of the Able Danger Team that was investigating the Mossad theft of Davy Crocket nuclear warheads from Pantex in Amarillo, Texas which had been processed and re-weaponized into mini-nukes and micro-nukes. A good guess is that mini-nukes were pre-planted in the basements of the Twin Towers, one each that turned the rock formations to lava, then blasted upward while micro-nukes were detonated progressively every ten stories starting at the top which were pre-planted in the elevator shafts during nine months of maintenance of the elevators. I have heard repeated reports that the USN has instituted a rear guard action to stimulate and elicit populism in the American People through the Internet’s Alternative Press in an attempt to break the back of the Bush Crime Cabal, its CIA leadership and the leadership of the USAF and NATO. And even stranger it is rumored that a certain faction of the Mossad has joined forces. The Black Pope is reputed by insiders to be calling the shots right now. The bottom line is that the COL Banksters who sit up high on the pyramid of power underneath the Jesuit Superior General (aka the “Black Pope”), have used the Alien ET crashes and the related Foreign technology programs (recovery teams and back-engineering programs) as a opportunity to lock down all of America. And this has been done under this false cloak of so-called “national security” which can be invoked to cover every single abridgement of the US Constitution and basic felony violations of the Rule of Law. This has prevented any oversight at all and any Member of the US Congress who tries get the Dave Durenberger fake smear job or if that doesn’t work they get the Senator Paul Wellstone correction (which is permanent sanction). Obviously over half of the male members of the US Congress and the USG in general have been completely compromised and are easily black-mailable by various Intel agency “handlers”. It’s a sad fact that so many have been seriously “human compromised”. Good reasons to believe that the Israelis have been blackmailing the USG over its partnership with the Nazis after WW2 under Operation paperclip and other joint functions. It’s a very good bet that the Israelis have been blackmailing the USG over Operation Paperclip and their joint Intel ventures, joint NASA ventures, Secret Space War ventures, secret South American security forces, death squads and drug cartel enterprises with the Nazis for a very long time. Once this sinister truth is learned by We The People in mass, the power of this Israeli blackmail will end. Like it or not America is basically a Fourth Reich nation operating in partnership with the Israeli PNACers and Israeli-American “Israeli-first” Dual Citizen traitors. This must end and the revelation of all this via the Internet can bring it about. Certainly the Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) would never do so. It is now pretty clear that the Fourth Reich has pretty much gained control over the USG through its Secret Space War Program and its CIA, which has expanded into thousands of proprietary cover businesses throughout America and much of the world. The folks that run the CFR and stack and control the USG to meet their needs, have been able to ride the Fourth Reich wave to personally empower and enrichen themselves beyond measure. To do this they had to give up their very souls to Lucifer (not kidding here), betray America and sell out to the City of London RKM private Globalist Banksters who started Bolshevism and Nazism and Maoism in the first place. Conclusion: Culling the herd with flying machines … Basically the Alien ET, recovered and back engineered anti-gravity craft, Secret Space War issue has been used to create this complete lock-down of America. And this has lockdown has been used to transform America into a plantation of Serfs and Slaves into the COL Banksters’ war-making machine, designed to asset strip huge profits from We The People and other nations exclusively for the .00001 who sit at the top of the Pyramid of Power at the expense of the common folk. Partial official disclosure is likely to occur this year, because, thanks to the Internet, the New Gutenberg Press, all secrecy is ending in stages. It was supposed to end in 2015 but the BCC prevented it. Now with the demise of the BCC, it is expected disclosure will likely occur sooner than later. And it has been rumored that some who sit on Majestic, the organization controlling it have started authorizing it in bits and pieces from senior individuals who know the full story all the way back to WW2 with the Nazis. In the meantime, until this important truth disseminates to most of We The People in believable form, we are all essentially going to remain being being “farmed” and asset stripped for our labors by the COL Banksters and their stateside Franchisees the Federal Reserve System, the biggest financial fraud in US history and the greatest crime ever committed under RICO state and federal laws. ______________ Related Posts: Exclusive: The Coming Shift to the Esoteric (updated) Deepest Darkest Secrets behind the Establishment Hierarchy’s evil Globalist NWO Agenda The Secret Law of Opposites The Zionist-Christian Alliance and the Great Deception Obama Commutes Whistleblower Chelsea Manning’s Sentence The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Log in to Reply frog  February 8, 2017 at 5:46 am I am at a loss with your statement that an Israeli sub fired a Tomahawk at the Pentagon. Don’t get me wrong, they are capable of doing this, but I look at the evidence. Radar picked up an aircraft on a down ward spiral, then hitting the Pentagon. A small engine part was found with small landing gear at the Pentagon,(no seats,luggage,food carts, cushions, bodies found) to me, more likely a Global Hawk. A G H flies above civilian radar, it’s about 90% Carbon Fiber so can’t be picked up easily, did the G H fire the missile before crashing into the Pentagon. And why was the FBI out directing Pentagon staff in a line to pick up small parts.( Of the G H?) Also there is a picture of about 8 Pentagon military guys caring a long item under a blue tarp. Was this part the fuselage of the G H.? What about the Pentagon, does it have it’s own missile protection system? and did it fire on it’s self. It was some kind of missile like you say, because it went through 3 rings of the Pentagon, each with 18 inch of reinforced concrete each side. Log in to Reply Preston James, Ph.D  February 8, 2017 at 3:02 pm The aircraft passed over the Pentagon at the same time the flashbang charges were ignited in the trash bins brought outside. The eyewitness who was going to go public with this was murdered by FBI div 5 wetboy. frog  February 8, 2017 at 8:33 pm Thanks for your reply Preston, but a Tomahawk cruise missile does not have landing gear. or was that placed their?? Like the engine and later the landing gear jammed between two buildings(With a long piece of rope still attached,wow) I remember the dumpsters, totally separate from the pentagon burning with huge black smoke, otherwise excellent article. MileHighLife  February 7, 2017 at 12:23 pm Thanks Dr James, hopefully the major changes brought on by the “good guys” that you often mention are nigh! There’s been several large pedophile/human trafficking ring busts over the past few days that were vaguely covered by Fake-stream news networks. Wonder why?

_ Macworld Australia MAC iPad iPhone iSnap App Guide Gadget Guide mResell HOME NEWS FEATURES REVIEWS HELP/TIPS BLOGS Mac In Business Communications Productivity Security Workflow FORUM MAGAZINE Digital Subscription Current Issue Back Issues Why a dual-processor Fusion Mac makes a lot of sense Dan Moren 7 February, 2017 View more articles fromthe author AAA 1 Comment News Why use one processor when two will do? This week, Bloomberg reported that Apple has developed an ARM-based chip that it will integrate into future Macs to handle some of the low-power responsibilities, thus taking pressure off the main, more power-hungry Intel processor. Here’s the thing: this multipronged approach is nothing new to Apple. And while I do believe that Apple is investigating building computers based solely on the same type of ARM architecture it uses in its iOS devices, this latest report doesn’t necessarily draw a straight line to that future. After all, the Touch Bar and Touch ID sensor in the new MacBook Pro already rely on an ARM chipped dubbed the T1. Mainly, it’s another example of Apple mixing and matching technologies where appropriate so that it always has the best tool for the job. A second chip for better battery life The putative purpose of this ARM chip, which Bloomberg reports is dubbed the T310, is to handle low-power activities, such as the Power Nap feature first introduced in Mountain Lion. Power Nap activates when your computer is put to sleep, allowing your Mac to continue carrying out certain tasks like fetching your mail, updating synced data like contacts and reminders, getting new pictures posted to Photo Stream, and keeping Find My Mac up-to-date. Basically, it ensures that when you wake up your Mac, it doesn’t have to spend several minutes updating everything before you can see the latest content. It also attempts to perform certain housekeeping features while the computer is otherwise idle. But even though Power Nap is intended to use the Mac’s processor in a low-power fashion, those Intel chips are still more power intensive than their ARM counterparts, which were designed for battery-sipping mobile usage. Hence the idea to add a second chip dedicated to handling this kind of activity, allowing the main processor to go to sleep. That potentially ratchets up the battery life that Apple is so very concerned with in its portable Mac line. Apple Apple’s A10 Fusion chip has two higher-power cores and two efficiency cores, and powers the iPhone 7. If this approach sounds familiar, it should, because Apple’s used it multiple times before: most recently in the A10 Fusion processor used in the iPhone 7. That chip contains both two high-performance cores for tasks that require serious horsepower, as well as two high-efficiency cores that use less power. Similarly, the MacBook Pro line has long offered machines with both discrete and integrated graphics chips, switching between them as needed. This is right out of Apple’s playbook. Enter the Fusion Mac? Now we jump into the ‘wild speculation’ part of proceedings. Apple is probably not ready to totally forgo Intel chips in its Mac line, though it certainly has some things to gain by that move: an internal development schedule that’s not dependent on a partner company, better power efficiency and a unified processor architecture with iOS, to name a few. However, ARM chips still aren’t ready to deliver kind of performance that Mac users are accustomed to. But by shipping Macs that include both Intel and ARM chips, Apple will have created hybrid Macs – or perhaps Fusion Macs would be a better name, following the pattern of the A10 Fusion processor and the Fusion drive. At the start, the capabilities of the ARM chips would likely be more limited, as described in the Bloomberg story, handling low-power tasks when the computer was asleep. But that doesn’t mean Apple couldn’t subsequently offload more tasks to the ARM chip as subsequent versions grow more powerful. Eventually, the ARM chip could be responsible for low-power tasks not only when the Mac is sleeping, but also when it’s active. In addition to Power Nap, Apple has a feature called App Nap that shifts an application into a low-power state when it meets a series of criteria, such as not being the foreground app, not updating content in a visible window, and so on. That reduces power consumption by limiting how often the app can get new data, read and write data to disk and so on. Apple If Apple wants to keep making its laptops thinner and thinner, it needs to find power efficiency everywhere it can. So rather than simply shifting them into a low-power mode on the primary processor, what if a Fusion Mac could shunt those napping applications onto the lower-power ARM chip? Not only would that help consume less energy, but because the ARM chips have lower power consumption overall, those apps may still be able to accomplish some tasks in the background. Road blocks There are certainly challenges to overcome with such a Fusion Mac, but probably none that are insurmountable. Apple has undergone a couple processor transitions in the past, going from Motorola’s 68k architecture to the PowerPC in the mid-90s, then to Intel processors in the mid-2000s. In both cases, Apple tried to mitigate the impact on developers and end users by offering solutions like fat binaries that contained code to run on both platforms. In the past, porting many Mac apps to a new architecture has in many cases been as simple as checking a box while compiling. Switching between processor architectures on the fly certainly seems radical, but looking back at Apple’s history of hybrid technologies, it hardly seems unprecedented. While the company has long pushed towards the aspirational, it’s never been hesitant to find ways to bridge it with the practical. And if the world isn’t yet ready for an ARM-based Mac, a Fusion Mac may be a bridge to get to that future.

The technology underpinning the Intel Shooting Star drone system is fascinating in and of itself, but its potential applications are even more so. The same drones that accompanied Lady Gaga will one day revolutionize search-and-rescue, agriculture, halftime shows, and more. First, though, let’s focus on the fun stuff. Drone Show Performing for a global audience of about 160 million or so people represents this drone platform’s biggest stage, but Intel has done this before. The company’s Shooting Star drone squad recently finished a three-week run at Disney World, and last year 500 synchronized drones flew in Sydney, setting the highly specific world record for “most unmanned aerial vehicles airborne simultaneously.” RELATED: Imagining Football’s Future Through the Super Bowl of 2066 Each drone is about a foot long square, weighs just over eight ounces, and sports a plastic and foam body to soften inadvertent impacts. They aren’t as flashy as consumer quadcopters, which is just as well, because you’re not supposed to notice them. Instead, you’re supposed to notice the four billion color combinations created by the onboard LEDs, and the aerial acrobatics choreographed with meticulous coding. Each drone communicates wirelessly with a central computer to execute its dance routine, oblivious to what the hundreds of machines around it are doing. The system can adapt on the, er, fly, too. Just before showtime, the computer checks the battery level and GPS signal strength of each drone, and assigns roles accordingly. Should a drone falter during the show, a reserve unit takes over within seconds. All of which is pretty cool in its own right. But making it work for the biggest television event of the year takes a whole different level of planning. Red Zones and Red Tape Student of Super Bowl security measures and FAA regulations may by this point have some questions. The government strictly forbids drones within 34.5 miles of Houston’s NRG Stadium, after all, and the FAA limits on how high drones can fly in any circumstance, let alone above 80,000 or so people. How on earth did Intel get away with it? The short answer is, it taped the show earlier this week.© Intel Intel The long answer is worth exploring though, because it provides insight into the evolution of Shooting Star system and where it might go from here. Preparations kicked off in early December, when Intel’s engineers started wading into the mind-numbing logistics of choreographing 300 dancing drones. Do they fly inside the stadium? How are they integrated into what Lady Gaga is doing onstage? Is stadium’s domed roof open or closed? “The whole halftime is a huge execution monster of an exercise,” says Anil Nanduri, who leads Intel’s drone efforts. READ MORE: How Astronauts Watch the Super Bowl in Space Once Intel and the Super Bowl creative team understood the restraints, they started storyboarding the show, settling on a sparkling array of stars that culminates in one giant, glittering, fluttering flag effect. Oh, and also the Pepsi logo, which was at least blue if not red and white. It was a brief performance, and secondary to Gaga’s onstage glitter and glam. Pulling it off, though, was a feat. The team required a dispensation from the feds—an especially tricky task given that NRG Stadium sits within Houston Hobby Airport’s air traffic control jurisdiction, and that Intel and the NFL had just weeks to put it all together. Swarm Hugs Synchronized programmable drones are entertaining for sure, and you can see them providing a wow factor like fireworks. They’re easier to control, allow for more elaborate effects, and are reusable. But the technology offers far more practical, and potentially life-saving, applications. “I see them searching for a lost hiker with multiple drones at night with the right payloads looking for them,” says Nanduri. “Or search and rescue efforts after a landslide, when it’s hard to get people on the ground.” There are commercial applications, too. Instead of sending humans to inspect hazardous areas of, say, a construction site, send a few dozen drones. And what better way to inspect hectares of crops than to outsource it to a fleet of quadcopters? All of this is at least a few away, though, and not just because of the technological limitations. FAA regulations, for instance, require that drone operators to maintain a line of sight with their charges, which makes it hard to deploy them in collapsed buildings or remote areas. And individually programmed drones may prove less effective than smart drones that can “think.” For now, though, there are light shows. And while they may not pack the punch of Prince serenading a stadium with “Purple Rain,” the drones did make for a memorable halftime show.

Those lights were actually Intel's Shooting Star drones, 300 of which were launched above NRG Stadium in Houston to bring an extra sparkle to Gaga's show. Lady Gaga performs during the halftime show of the NFL Super Bowl 51 football game between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, Sunday, Feb. 5, 2017, in Houston. Darron Cummings / AP It's the first time the colorful drones were used at an event of this scale. "Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience," Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group, said in a statement.

The secret behind the overhead display: The drone show was filmed last week. Intel received a waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates drones, allowing them to fly up to 700 feet and in more restrictive airspace. Related: A Real Flying Tinker Bell? Disney Parks Plan to Use Acrobatic Drones Each quadcopter has LED lights that can create 4 billion color combinations, according to Intel. The entire swarm is able to be controlled by a single operator and computer. One Shooting Star drone weighs less than a volleyball. Keeping safety in mind, Intel said the drones are made of flexible plastics and foam and do not contain any screws. If only our drones could drop the mic. #PepsiHalfTime #ExperienceMore #SB51 pic.twitter.com/VEVuNEe9Ex— Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 So now that the world is buzzing about Shooting Star drone technology, here's the bad news: You can't get your own fleet just yet. While Intel says the drones meet Federal Communications Commission specifications, they haven't been formally authorized. For now, Walden said it's all about inspiration. "The potential for these light show drones is endless and we hope this experience inspires other creatives, artists and innovators to really think about how they can incorporate drone technology in new ways that have yet to even be thought of," he said.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Intel may be planning Kaby Lake shake up to combat Ryzen launch Intel may be planning Kaby Lake shake up to combat Ryzen launch Matthew Wilson 4 days ago CPU, Highlights V It looks like Intel may be anticipating AMD’s Ryzen launch as much as the rest of us as the company is said to be already preparing a shake up of its Kaby Lake line. According to reports this week, Intel is currently planning a new Core i7 and a new Core i5 in hopes of stealing some away from the upcoming Ryzen processors, which will begin rolling out in March with an 8 Core/16 Thread SKU. The initial report comes from sources speaking with CPCHardware, claiming that a Core i7 7740K and a Core i5 7640K will be coming to disrupt AMD’s Ryzen rollout. Right now, AMD’s full Ryzen line up is rumoured to consist of several R7, R5 and R3 SKUs with R7 combatting Core i7s all of the way up to the 6900K. The R5 series will apparently be filled with 6 Core SKUs to combat the Core i5 and finally, AMD’s R3 series will consist of quad core CPUs. So Intel’s solution to AMD’s R7 Ryzen CPUs is said to be the Core i7 7740K, which is an overclocked 7700K with a 4.3GHz base clock and a higher 100W TDP. The boost clock is not known at this time but presumably it would also be 100MHz above the 7700K, bringing the 7740K up to 4.6GHz. However, given that the 7700K costs over £300 here in the UK, we can expect some fairly skewed pricing. Just to be safe, Intel also wants to bolster its Core i5 lineup with the 7640K, which will reportedly come with a 4GHz base frequency, making it 200MHz higher than the 7600K. To boot, Hyper Threading may also be on the table for this chip, which would make this the first Core i5 ever to use this technology. There is no word on when we can expect these two CPUs to appear on the market but if this rumour holds any weight, we should hear more after Ryzen’s launch in early March. Discuss on our Facebook page, HERE. KitGuru Says: While the Core i7 in this case isn’t particularly exciting, it would be interesting to see Intel release a higher clocked Core i5 with Hyper Threading. At that point, the chip may compete closer with the 7700K. Still, Intel’s pricing may need a shake up as there isn’t a ton of wiggle room between mainstream i7s and enthusiast grade chips.  Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Pinterest Tags Intel news Ryzen Previous Palit launches world’s first GTX 1050Ti with passive cooling Next Micron to launch GDDR6 graphics memory this year Check Also EVGA launches new ICX technology for GTX 10-series graphics cards EVGA this week has launched its all new ICX technology, which will serve as an … Jeffrey Byers Why would they hyperthread a desktop i5? That just ends up making it the same as the i7-7700K. All they would do is CONFUSE people with naming. It’s already a bit different on the LAPTOP side of things so no need to confuse people further. >savt correction, first quad core I5 to use hyperthreading Jone and we are back to the Pentium 4 era. Dave Bristel Intel should be more concerned that AMD will have quad core parts across the entire lineup, so all those dual-core chips will be completely obliterated on the Intel side. Most of us wouldn’t consider a dual-core chip for anything, but a good chunk of the Intel product line sales come from dual-core chip sales. The K chips are NOT where the bulk of the Intel sales come from. Mark Kinsella half the cores should be half the price Tyrann lol Tyrann tiny overclock and they keep price high lol.

The 300 Intel Shooting Star drones created a light show as they hovered over the singer during her opening number for the performance, as part of the biggest American football game of the year. Displaying an array of coloured LEDs, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) moved in formation to create images including the American flag, before Lady Gaga dropped into the arena on a harness and cables. Technology company Intel claims it was the first time that drones have featured in a televised event. "Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience," said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group.

Drones are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, with uses ranging from photography and gaming to delivery and transport. They are also being purposed for entertainment, for instance, they were adapted into dancing lampshades for a routine during a Cirque du Soleil show. The UAV models used for the Super Bowl were purpose-built autonomous quadcopters, programmed to move in sequence and change colour as a cohesive unit. Lady Gaga is no stranger to technology. In 2013, she piloted the "world's first flying dress" – which its designer Benjamin Males said would herald the beginning of a new era for human flight.

Don't leave your system open to attack. Blog :  Cazena Unfurls Data Science Sandbox in the Cloud Article :  Artificial Intelligence: Present Trends and Its Future Intel Extends Videoconferencing Experience Mike Vizard |   IT Unmasked   |   Posted 06 Feb, 2017          |         |     Share The most costly time that most organizations spend usually occurs in a conference room. The collective salaries of those present on an hourly basis are usually considerable. For that reason alone, it makes sense to make sure that time is as optimally spent as possible. To enable that to happen, Intel has been making the case for Intel Unite, high-definition video conferencing software that gets deployed on a hub based on Intel processors. Today, Intel announced it is making available Intel Unite client software for both Apple iPad and Android tablets alongside existing support for PCs running Windows and Apple MacOS. In addition, Intel has added a telemetry module that makes it simpler to track usage of hubs and their actual locations in an office complex. Finally, Intel is making available tools that can be used to limit who has permission to use Intel Unite, as well as support for static PIN number option. Tom Garrison, general manager for the Business Client Group at Intel, says Intel sees Intel Unite as an application that helps expand the number of use cases for its higher-end VPro Core processors. It’s priced at less than $1,000, and Garrison says Intel is trying to make HD video affordable for just about every organization by eliminating annual licensing fees. “There’s no need to buy a recurring software license,” says Garrison. Next up, Garrison says, Intel expects to see more organizations using Intel Unite to translate languages during a meeting in real time. Longer term, Garrison says Intel is also working toward embedding augmented and virtual reality capabilities within Intel Unite. The IT industry is clearly on the cusp of making major advances in terms of how individuals collaborate with one another. What effect those advances will have on productivity, of course, remains to be seen. But the way people interact with one another online will soon never be the same.          |         |     Share Add Comment      Leave a comment on this blog post Please enable Javascript in your browser, before you post the comment!

More by Jonathan Takiff Teched-up Wells Fargo Center shows make everybody a "player" Feb 8 Vizio's caught monitoring TV owners' viewing habits, selling info Feb 8 Pinterest and Curalate are now pinned - to each other Feb 8 At halftime during Sunday's Super Bowl, a light show behind Lady Gaga featured hundreds of twinkling stars magically rotating into an American flag, then spelling out the name of cosponsor Pepsi.  Intel put its branding on the spectacle and special effects, created by a formation of 300 small drone flying machines glowing with onboard LED lighting. But a pregame Facebook post by Gauravjit "Raj" Singh, founder and CEO of Philadelphia “drone-vertising” company DroneCast, suggests that his Market Street-based enterprise had more than a little to do with staging those aerobatic special effects, viewed by 113.7 million viewers: “To all who read my previous status about good exciting things happening at the halftime show,  here’s a hint. #thank youintel #thankyouGaGa #did someonesaydrones #dronecast," the post reads. In a phone chat Monday, Singh played it close to the vest. “We can only give general information when we work with Fortune 500 companies and our partner WPP,” a major global advertising company, “for clients like Ford and Ciroc,” the vodka maker. “Our clients don’t like for people to know who the service providers are.” Still, a study of its website suggests that DroneCast could have contributed a lot to the halftime spectacular, from designing 31-inch-wingspan custom-flying machines (the DroneCast SR1) to programming the gizmos and shepherding the show on-site. Though small in stature, DroneCast's website says, the SR1 is strong enough to fly 60 mph, counteract strong winds, and carry payloads of up to six pounds. It can fly in very tight formation, the website says, and is fitted with LED lights capable of changing color midflight where needed, creating pixilated pictures in the sky. To eliminate risk and the ire of the Federal Aviation Administration, the halftime drone segments were actually shot before the game, over several days above an empty stadium, Intel’s Natalie Cheung said in an interview with USA Today. “We were on site for nine days, so we got the proper waivers to fly in Class C airspace up to 700 feet.” A tinkerer for most of his 22 years,  the India-born, Princeton-raised Singh said he first dreamed of jump-starting the “drone-vertising” business after “reading about Amazon’s plans to deliver packages with drones, and I thought, ‘Well maybe they should carry signage, too, while they’re flying around.’ ” His prior claims to fame included a company begun before college, building “inexpensive but good” prosthetic devices. “That’s why I entered Drexel for bioengineering,” he said. “Six months later, I decided I hated medicine, dropped out, and started this company. The next year, the Close School of Entrepreneurship at Drexel invited me back. I went for six days. Then Ford paid us $55,000 for four hours' work – flying a couple hundred toy trucks down to table sitters at a North American International Auto Show event. I thought, wow, this is it.” Singh was so far ahead of the drone boom that the FAA “didn’t even have any rules about drone use when we started in 2014. We kind of owned our own territory. Then they came up with the FAA Part 333 exemption – every time you wanted to do an event, you would have to request permission and restrict the flights to under 500 feet and certain areas. Later came Part 107, which is like a driver’s license for drones.” DroneCast helps people get their working papers. Its $6,000 DroneCast Partner Program “includes instruction in Philly or online, one of our SR1 drones, and paid job opportunities with insurance coverage through our booking service.” It’s “like Uber for drones,” Singh agreed.   “Over the past two years, we’ve acquired 10 different resource companies, touching every aspect” of the drone-business, “from app development to financing, and have an accelerator program, Singh Ventures, with a fund of $5 million to invest.” The group employs more than 200.   Published: February 6, 2017 — 6:09 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: Philly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

Tech Culture by Shara Tibken February 6, 2017 1:53 PM PST @sharatibken Intel drones lit up the Houston sky in an American flag formation during the Super Bowl halftime show. Intel Lady Gaga's Super Bowl halftime show featured something never done before: 300 synchronized drones that danced and created the outline of an American flag. The only problem is, anyone shelling out thousands of dollars for their Super Bowl ticket didn't actually see the drone show. That's because Intel's Shooting Star drones and Gaga's terrifying leap from the roof of Houston's NRG Stadium were taped earlier in the week. Federal Aviation Association regulations about drones -- and a ban of drones within 34.5 miles of the stadium on game day -- meant Intel and Gaga had to film the halftime show's opening sequence early. Intel said other factors that played into the decision to pretape the opening scene were possible weather challenges and the fact the stadium is a dome. Drones, which are typically camera-equipped quadcopters, have become a new consumer and business phenomenon for those interested in remote-controlled vehicles, aerial photography and even aerial racing. As the aircraft have grown in popularity over the past several years, though, drones have become a concern for the government agency responsible for regulating the nation's airspace. The FAA estimates that by 2020, there will be 4.3 million hobbyist drones sold, up from about 1.9 million sold in 2016.

It received a special waiver from the FAA to fly the fleet up to 700 feet in the air. Intel also received an additional special waiver to fly the drones in the more restricted Class B airspace. "Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before, and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience," Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's new technology group, said Sunday in a press release. Intel designed the Shooting Star drones for festivals and entertainment events. The quadcopters are equipped with LED lights that can create over 4 billion color combinations and can easily be programmed for any animation. Each weighs only 280 grams, less than the weight of a volleyball, and can fly for up to 20 minutes. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

According to Wired, that section of Lady Gaga's performance was taped ahead of time because it required special federal approval to fly so many drones at once so close to Houston's airport – and to avoid flying the drones live over the heads of a Super Bowl audience. "They would be using some pretty rigorous GPS," said Adam Stephens, a digital media marketing specialist with Aeryon Labs Inc., the Waterloo-based company that makes unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial use as well as heavy duty drones for military, police and public safety work. "GPS technology, I imagine, would be a main element for them, as well as digital positioning technology. There might possibly be some obstacle avoidance technologies which are becoming prevalent in the consumer grade drone technology now, although I imagine they could probably operate without those," said Stephens.   Intel can program and control up to 500 drones at a time. 3-D time and space The real secret is not just the accurate positioning, but the programs that tell the drones where to be.  "They would have real-time 3-D modellers that would be issuing out commands for the drones to go ahead and hold positions at certain [places]," said Stephens. He added that the practical way to accomplish three dimensional changes in flight formation would require a "3-D modeller over-laced with some sort of chronological or time graph, similar to video editing or audio editing software." He said that the drones in Lady Gaga's show appear to be relatively small, about 12 inches (30 centimetres) across, and the propellers are encased in cages. For comparison, Aeryon's drones are usually about 42 inches across (about 107 centimetres), don't have a caged housing over the propellers and are able to stay airborne for long periods of time.

(NASDAQ: AMD) shares are soaring more than 10.7 percent on Monday after some positive headlines about the company and a potential deal with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) have surfaced. According to HardOC editor Kyle Bennet, Intel has licensed AMD graphics processing units (GPUs). Commentary “Intel is licensing AMD GPU technology No money has changed hands yet, so there is no financial impact until late in the year, hence nothing in the current earnings report [...] I would expect more collaboration between AMD and Intel in the future on the graphics side. And you can take all that to the bank,” Bennet said of the deal. While the companies haven’t officially reported the deal, it seems as if investors are, in fact, taking the info to the bank. At the same time, Barron’s Tiernan Ray published a new article over the weekend explaining why he believes AMD’s commitment to cloud computing is grounds for the company’s share price to double over the next year. The stock is sure off to a solid start with Monday’s 10 percent gain. Surprisingly, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), which AMD likely beat out for the Intel GPU deal, is also up more than 2.2 percent in Monday’s session. AMD and NVIDIA have been two of the hottest stocks in the market in recent months, up 94.0 percent and 64.3 percent since Election Day. At Last Check Shares of Advanced Micro Devices were up 9.97 percent at $13.46. Shares of Intel were down 0.85 percent at $36.21. Shares of NVIDIA were up 2.03 percent at $116.71.

Intel's Open-Source Driver Stack Now OpenGL 4.5 Certified, Complements Vulkan & GLES Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 6 February 2017 at 03:01 PM EST. 20 Comments Intel's open-source Mesa DRI driver has passed The Khronos Group's process for certifying it as a conformant OpenGL 4.5 implementation. This now rounds out the Intel open-source Linux stack with OpenGL 4.5, OpenGL ES 3.2, and Vulkan 1.0 certification. Intel's open-source Linux driver stack has managed the trifecta of certification from The Khronos Group for graphics: OpenGL 4.5, OpenGL ES 3.2, and Vulkan 1.0. This cannot be said for any other vendor with a completely open driver stack: AMD hasn't certified their open-source driver offerings, Nouveau hasn't yet reached GL/GLES certification though they are working on it with the X.Org Foundation acting as the entity behind it plus they don't yet have a Vulkan driver, and there isn't yet any other vendor with a fully-open driver stack covering multiple areas. Perhaps we'll see Freedreno and Raspberry Pi VC4 reach it one day. When it comes to proprietary drivers on Linux, NVIDIA has this certification too. This milestone today is about formal OpenGL 4.5 certification from The Khronos Group where as previously they had exposed OpenGL 4.5 support in Mesa but they hadn't been through the formal process until ensuring the OpenGL Conformance Test Suite fully-passes. Unrelated, The Khronos Group recently open-sourced their conformance test suite. Imad Sousou of the Intel Open-Source Technology Center announced this grand accomplishment today on 01.org. Splendid job to all those involved. Hopefully their next area of focus will be on OpenCL certification for Beignet, which recently hit OpenCL 2.0. 20 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

PST February 06, 2017 Intel Shooting Star drones light up the sky in the Pepsi logo following the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI Halftime Show. (Credit: Intel Corporation) (Photo: Intel Corporation, Intel Corporation) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl halftime show had no special guests — unless you count the drones. Intel Drones supplied Lady Gaga and the NFL with a show-stopping show-starter — 300 Shooting Star drones painting the night sky in a pre-recorded segment in Houston, as she sang “God Bless America.” The closing scene with the Pepsi logo also was those same pre-recorded drones. For The Win spoke to two of Intel Drones’ top people — general manager Natalie Cheung, who was on the ground in Houston running things, and vice president of business Anil Nanduri, who organized the collaboration — about the show and the future of drones in entertainment. Let Cheung and Nanduri answer all your questions now that you’ve seen their work in action. So how did this happen? Intel filmed the drone shoot over several days, with the main shoot — the one we saw — done on Jan. 30. There were reports of low-flying helicopters as part of security in Houston, but that was only part of the story. The top-secret drone usage was the other. “We were on site for nine days, so we got the proper waivers to fly in Class C airspace up to 700 feet,” Cheung said. “We got the waivers to do this at night with multiple drones per pilot through the FAA. We were testing out our drones, tweaking our animations throughout this whole process, and we filmed for one night, and it was perfect.” Our drones have returned to the ground after an amazing #PepsiHalftime show #ExperienceMore pic.twitter.com/Augpbt05u6— Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017   The setup was not so quick, but it all came together once the right people got to talking. “We worked a lot with the (NFL’s) creative team,” she said. “You can see there’s a lot of different stakeholders in this. We worked with NFL, Pepsi, Lady Gaga. She was very aware with what was happening with the story board from the very get-go, so it was a very constructive and very tight collaboration.” Why couldn’t it be done live? “So there’s a lot of weather and environment (issues),” Cheung said. “In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl day. We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team as well as the Super Bowl creative team felt this would be best to be filmed. Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium.” But Nanduri was quick to dismiss any thought that this couldn’t be a live show. “When we talked about Super Bowl, the primary weather issue was if they closed the dome,” he said. “If I had to simplify it, if you can do fireworks because of weather, so can our drones. … We’ve never had a situation where we can’t fly. The shooting star drone is water-resistant. It can handle light rain. It can handle a decent amount of wind — 8 meters per second, which is pretty decent wind speed.” What is the end goal here? Cheung explained, “It’s a different way of merging art and technology, which I think a lot of people haven’t seen. We started this effort maybe a year and a half ago, and it started with 100 drones in the sky and showed a simple Intel logo. We caught on pretty quickly that this was more than just fireworks. It could be branding in the sky. It could be an artistic event. There’s a lot of different ways that people could utilize this. The Disney team we worked with used it as a theme park attraction. The Super Bowl team utilized it as a way to emphasize and express Lady Gaga’s music. … It can create and mean many different things.” And Nanduri brought up the Guinness Book of World Records showcase as an example that led to this opportunity — and many more in the future.   “When we did the Guinness Book of World Records, the 500 drones, that was a huge viral phenomenon, and we had already started to fly at Disney, which was another uptick of what the light shows are all about. In that process, I think there was an awareness created, especially to the creative agencies around the world, what a canvas in the sky that they can now paint with lights could be as a value-add to their experience.” Don’t be surprised, then if you see Fourth of July shows and other holiday spectaculars using drones more and more. So are we pretty much talking about robot fireworks? No, but sort of. “It’s not exactly fireworks,” Cheung said, citing the speed — 30 minutes for a single animation — and repeatability of the show. They’ve been used at Disney, too, where they were deployed in a similar method to nightly … fireworks shows.   “There’s a good comparison of drones and fireworks, Nanduri said. “There’s a couple aspects of fundamental difference, though. With drones, I like to think of it as painting a canvas in the sky. You have the flexibility of creating animations, creating logos, creating storytelling. With the comparison to fireworks, yes, (both) can create a lot of formations, a lot of excitement — but it’s green. It’s reusable. No pollution. There’s a fundamental difference in precision and a difference of solving pollution and other issues with fireworks, and the last part is it’s reusable. Of course, you don’t get the boom of fireworks.” Drones! I’m still kind of weirded out by this … Nanduri: “With the notion of drones and the perception of the public, I think light shows are one good way to bring that perception back to (what a drone really is). … If I had to go back a year or two and look at what the perception of drones was then, I start to see a lot friendlier use of the term. You see the industries using the term as well. They’re more comfortable. And we look at light shows as … re-emphasizing that drones can be used in so many different ways.” Cheung: “Intel’s changing the perception and definition of drones here. No one ever thought that a drone could create such a beautiful art show and such an amazing experience for nighttime entertainment. It’s not something that we’re redefining the definition of a drone. You can see them being used in commercial applications. But when we talk about drones now, people get excited. They see it as a light in the sky.” (© 2017 KGW) KGW Tom Brady suspects Super Bowl jersey was stolen after game KGW 84 Lumber website crashes after commercial about immigration KGW Review: Lady Gaga preaches unity during high-flying Super Bowl set CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Flooding causes problems in Seaside Marijuana home deliveries start in Oregon Police shoot, kill robbery suspect in Portland New rooms and secret passage at Grand Lodge Trimet denies ICE agent raids on buses Raw: Sky8 over officer-involved shooting scene in Vancouver Slide cancels Amtrak trains to Seattle Travel ban blocked by court of appeals Semi crushes police car in Wyoming Second officer-involved shooting in Portland More Stories Girlfriend reacts to police shooting of 17-year-old… Feb. 9, 2017, 10:08 a.m. Washington company develops migraine prevention drug Feb 10, 2017, 9:00 p.m. Iranian baby will receive life-saving heart surgery… Feb. 2, 2017, 6:05 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather 7 Day Forecast Closings Weather Alerts Radars Live Cameras hyperlocal-radars More...

But the dazzling drone sequence that kicked off Lady Gaga’s glittery performance at Houston’s NRG Stadium was not actually live. The FAA ruled that drones were not allowed on game day anywhere within 34.5 miles of NRG stadium, dubbing the airspace a “no drone zone,” so the synchronized drone display was reportedly taped the previous week. If only our drones could drop the mic. #PepsiHalfTime #ExperienceMore #SB51 pic.twitter.com/VEVuNEe9Ex— Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 The airborne light show featured 300 lightweight, synchronized “shooting star drones” provided by Intel —the first time they’ve ever been used in a televised event, according to The Verge. Intel’s drone experts worked closely with the NFL and Lady Gaga to design and film the spectacle, a process that was shrouded in secrecy. The multicolored, brightly-lit drones buzzed into formation as an American flag and later were rearranged to spell out the Intel logo. Two leaders of Intel’s drone team told USA Today’s “For the Win” that they spent nine days on location, with the final shoot taking place on January 30.  A behind-the-scenes Intel video from November shows the same drones the company provided for the halftime show. The quadcopter drones are powered and controlled by a combination of computing, communication, sensor and cloud technology.

What started out as a sea of floating lights came together by the end of the bit to form an American flag. It was impressive, cool, and it was all thanks to the ever-growing interest in drones. The Super Bowl was the third public outing in the U.S. for Intel’s Shooting Star quadcopter drones following several weeks of aerial shows at Disney World in Florida. It was also a record-breaking moment for Intel’s drones, which were allowed to fly up to 700 feet for the first time after receiving special permission from the Federal Aviation Authority. Each drone weighs a little less than a volleyball and is equipped with LED lights that Intel says can create more than 4 billion color combinations in the sky. To make the drones actually operate and move the way they need to, Intel said it developed special algorithms to automate the animation process. But during show time, the drones can be operated by a single pilot from one PC. Why this matters: Although Intel says the drones were designed specifically for entertainment purposes, there may also be more practical applications for these drones in the future. Intel’s drone chief, Anil Nanduri, told Wired that he sees a future where these drones could be used for purposes such as search and rescue. Just plug in a search pattern and off they go. Intel wasn’t the only company talking drones on Sunday. Amazon also aired a Super Bowl commercial showing off drone-based Prime Air deliveries. Prime Air is not yet available in the U.S., but it is currently being tested in the UK. Although Intel’s Shooting Star drones are able to show up for special events, the devices aren’t yet available for sale; the quadcopters still have to get a stamp of approval from the Federal Communications Commission.

Hundreds of the devices helped this year’s performer, Lady Gaga, kick her show off, presenting a colorful, swirling backdrop as she stood on the roof of Houston’s NRG Stadium. But as Gaga herself seemed to leap from the roof, dropping down to the stadium to start her show proper, her army of drones didn’t follow. That’s because the drone shows were actually filmed earlier this week, as Intel confirmed to The Verge. That includes Gaga’s intro sequence, which saw her dancing in front of an American flag, and a later 10-second spot that featured the drones as they changed from the Pepsi to Intel logos. Restrictions placed on the area by the Federal Aviation Administration forbid drones from flying within a 34.5-mile radius of the NRG Stadium, in addition to other rules that bar drones from hovering too high, or from doing acrobatic maneuvers directly above hundreds of thousands of people. Our drones have returned to the ground after an amazing #PepsiHalftime show #ExperienceMore pic.twitter.com/Augpbt05u6— Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 Those rules would normally preclude a potentially dangerous drone show from taking place on the roof of a multi-billion-dollar building, but this is the Super Bowl, and the FAA was apparently willing to grant special dispensation for Lady Gaga. From there, it was up to the performer and Intel — who supplied 300 of its Shooting Star drones — to work out how to choreograph the show. A behind-the-scenes video posted in November shows off the drones that Intel provided for the performance: Intel first showed off its Shooting Star drones last year, revealing quadcopter devices about a foot or so long, and outfitted with LED lights that can shine in one of 4 billion colors. Each drone weighs about 280 grams, and can fly for up to 20 minutes. Unlike regular drones, Shooting Star swarms can be controlled by a single operator, making complicated aerial moves much easier than they would otherwise be for multiple pilots. The company used 500 Shooting Stars to break the world record for the most drones operating by a single user last year, and has held synchronized shows at Disney World over the past few months, but Lady Gaga’s performance marked the first time that they have been used in a televised event.

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Unite meeting tech comes to the iPad, and soon to Chromebooks Intel researches tech to prepare for a future beyond today's PCs Face-to-face without frustration: The HP Elite Slice for Meeting Rooms Video Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware At first glance, Intel's Unite software comes across as an anomaly. What lies ahead for the collaboration software in the chipmaker's future? For now, the software is linked to Intel's PC chips, which is a core business. But it's emerging as a component of the company's virtual reality, internet of things, and server businesses, which are all central to Intel's future growth strategy after a massive restructuring last year. Unite, which was released in 2015, allows remote and on-site users to log in to meetings and share documents and whiteboards. It works with Macs and Windows PCs as well as iPads and Android tablets, and it supports apps like Skype for Business. At the center of Unite is a hub PC in a meeting room with Intel's vPro chips. The hub PC logs in remote users and facilitates collaboration and communication. Unite is a free-to-low-cost way to communicate and collaborate, especially when competing conference-room technologies can cost thousands of dollars, said Tom Garrison, Intel's vice president and general manager for business client platforms and its Client Computing Group. So why would a chipmaker care about conference room software? One reason: It's a big part of workplace transformation, and it will ride a wave of business PC upgrades. Research firm Gartner has projected a minor growth in PC shipments in 2018, partly driven by upgrades to sleeker PCs. Intel last April laid off thousands of employees in an effort to cut its reliance on PCs and focus more on growing areas like data centers and the IoT. Despite its heavy reliance on PCs, Unite survived a brutal purge of low-margin and loss-making products like smartphone chips and wire-free technology. That's partly because Unite could fit into some of Intel's new areas of focus after restructuring, including IoT, data centers, and virtual reality. An updated version of Unite will be able to collect telemetry on the number of people in a meeting, the number of presentations in a day, and the average length of presentations. IT departments can use that data to determine productivity at meetings. Other IoT technologies could be used to enhance conference room experiences. Also, in the future, the software could determine the names and number of people attending a meeting, which can be logged. Intel is researching cameras that can be used detect faces, and that feature could come to Unite. Unite could also move tasks like speech translation and PIN generation to the server back-end. If two separate meeting rooms in different countries are talking to each other, a real-time translation service on cloud servers could facilitate communication. Real-time translation is one of the many Unite features capabilities that could be moved to servers, Garrison said. Perhaps the most exciting feature is bringing VR to meeting rooms via Unite. Remote users can put on a VR headset and be virtually present in a meeting room while sitting at home. "I can participate at a higher level than in the past," Garrison said. There are many possibilities for VR in a conference room, but there's no specific roadmap yet on when features will be rolled out, Garrison said. "We have technologies we are working on in the lab," Garrison said. In the meanwhile, Intel is making incremental updates to Unite. The latest updates include easier ways to moderate meetings and better security features so only authorized personnel can join meetings.

Microsoft wants all computer users to upgrade to Windows 10. Even so, Windows 7 still accounts for 40 percent of the desktop operating system market share. Neither Intel or Microsoft support Windows 7 with drivers for Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, but AMD is set to throw Windows 7 users a lifeline with its forthcoming Ryzen chips. The announcement of Windows 7 support for Ryzen processors was made during an information session held by AMD and reported by German-language website Computerbase (translated). Ryzen processors use the Zen microarchitecture, the AM4 socket, and are expected to launch in March this year. The 14nm chips support DDR4 memory and will offer between 2 and 8 cores for the consumer market and up to 32 cores for servers. The first Ryzen processor expected to appear in March is an 8-core, 16-thread performance desktop chip with a clock speed of at least 3.4GHz. It does not include an integrated GPU. Related 4K Netflix on Windows 10 Requires Kaby Lake Chip and Microsoft Edge 4K Netflix on Windows 10 Requires Kaby Lake Chip and Microsoft Edge As Microsoft will not add support for new processor architectures to Windows 7, it's up to AMD to produce all of the necessary drivers itself for both the processor and the AM4 socket chipset. It's unclear exactly why AMD would go to the trouble of doing this beyond making Ryzen accessible to the widest possible market. Even so, surely consumers upgrading to a Ryzen-based desktop PC would also opt for a move to Windows 10. It may be the case that Windows 7 is still required to run certain pieces of bespoke software in a business setting. Here AMD could see an opportunity to win some major corporate contracts because it can replace aging hardware while retaining the software platform a company relies upon.

What future does the collaboration software have in the chipmaker's future? For now, the software is linked to Intel's PC chips, which is a core business. But it's emerging as a component of the company's virtual reality, internet of things, and server businesses, which are all central to Intel's future growth strategy after a massive restructuring last year. Unite, which was released in 2015, allows remote and on-site users to log in to meetings and share documents and whiteboards. It works with Macs and Windows PCs as well as iPads and Android tablets, and it supports software like Skype for Business. At the center of Unite is a hub PC in a meeting room with Intel's vPro chips. The hub PC logs in remote users and facilitates collaboration and communication. Unite is a free-to-low-cost way to communicate and collaborate, especially when competing conference-room technologies can cost thousands of dollars, said Tom Garrison, Intel's vice president and general manager for business client platforms and its Client Computing Group. So why would a chipmaker care about conference room software? One reason: It's a big part of workplace transformation, and it will ride a wave business PC upgrades. Research firm Gartner has projected a minor growth in PC shipments in 2018, partly driven by upgrades to sleeker PCs. Intel last April laid off thousands of employees in an effort to cut its reliance on PCs and focus more on growing areas like data centers and the IoT. Despite its heavy reliance on PCs, Unite survived a brutal purge of low-margin and loss-making products like smartphone chips and wire-free technology. That's partly because Unite could fit into some of Intel's new areas of focus after restructuring, including IoT, data centers, and virtual reality. An updated version of Unite will be able to collect telemetry on the number of people in a meeting, the number of presentations in a day, and the average length of presentations. IT departments can use that data to determine productivity at meetings. Other IoT technologies could be used to enhance conference room experiences. Also, in the future, the software could be possible to determine the names and number of people attending a meeting, which can be logged. Intel is researching cameras that can be used detect faces, and that feature could come to Unite. Unite could also move tasks like speech translation and pin generation to the server back-end. If two separate meeting rooms in different countries are talking to each other, a real-time translation service on cloud servers could facilitate communication. Real-time translation is one of the many Unite features capabilities that could be moved to servers, Garrison said. Perhaps the most exciting feature is bringing VR to meeting rooms via Unite. Remote users can put on a VR headset and be virtually present in a meeting room while sitting at home. "I can participate at a higher level than in the past," Garrison said. There are many possibilities for VR in a conference room, but there's no specific roadmap yet on when features will be rolled out, Garrison said. "We have technologies we are working on in the lab," Garrison said. In the meanwhile, Intel is making incremental updates to Unite. The latest updates include easier ways to moderate meetings and better security features so only authorized personnel can join meetings.

If you happened to catch Lady Gaga's halftime show at the Super Bowl last night, you were treated to a pretty amazing light show. While you may have thought it was achieved using digital special effects, it wasn't. Those were 300 drones flying in unison. Meet Intel's Shooting Star drones, what they call "a new type of unmanned aerial vehicle." The drones are designed specifically for entertainment purposes and are equipped with LED lights capable of creating more than four billion colour combinations. They've already been used at Walt Disney World, but Super Bowl show was their largest audience yet. Did you see those @intel drones light it up? #PepsiHalfTime #SB51 pic.twitter.com/cyNtRhZ2II— @NFL (In case you missed it, you can watch the performance here.)  "Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience," Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel's New Technology Group said in a statement. Amazingly those 300 drones were controlled by just one computer and one pilot (however, a second is on hand as back-up). If only our drones could drop the mic. #PepsiHalfTime #ExperienceMore #SB51 pic.twitter.com/VEVuNEe9Ex— @intel The Super Bowl performance was the highest altitude Intel's drones have ever flown — 700 feet — and even required a special waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration.  How is it done? The company uses a computer program with a special algorithm that can calculate how many drones are needed, their placement, as well as flight paths. And amazingly, the software animation can map out a performance in a matter of days or weeks, depending on the show's complexity. And while those watching the Super Bowl live at NRG stadium were likely disappointed that they couldn't see the dancing drones for themselves above the stage, they didn't actually miss out on anything: it was taped a week earlier.

Video provided by Newsy Newslook If you caught Lady Gaga's performance during halftime of Super Bowl LI, then you witnessed an impressive display at the beginning featuring the American flag lighting up the sky. Only it wasn't done through the traditional lighting techniques. The display was pulled off by drones — 300 to be exact. The drones were supplied by Intel, zooming into the night sky before flying into formation to create the American flag. If only our drones could drop the mic. #PepsiHalfTime#ExperienceMore#SB51pic.twitter.com/VEVuNEe9Ex— Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 As Intel general manager Natalie Cheung, and vice president of business Anil Nanduri tell sister blog For The Win, the sequence was filmed on January 30. Because of potential issues with weather and environment, Intel decided to tape the segment instead of do it live. Right after the performance, Intel posted a video on Twitter showing the 300 drones make their descent back to the ground. It offers a great view of what these drones with attached lights look like up close.

(Credit: Intel Corporation) Three hundred Intel® Shooting Star™ drones were used to light up the sky over Lady Gaga at the start of the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI Halftime Show performance. The drones forming a Pepsi logo that morphed into an Intel logo was showcased by a 10-second Intel ad following the show. During the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI Halftime Show that took place on Feb 5, Intel Corporation joined with the NFL, Pepsi and six-time GRAMMY®*-winning music icon, Lady Gaga, in order to develop a unique drone light show experience to start off her performance. The sky was lit up with three hundred Intel® Shooting Star™ drones in a choreographed aerial performance, thus marking the very first drone integration during a Super Bowl and a televised event. As the icon’s performance started, Intel Shooting Star drones produced a backdrop of colorful formations in the sky together with twinkling stars that transformed into blue and red moving stars, before forming the American Flag for a dramatic finale that focused on bringing Lady Gaga to center stage on the field. The Intel Shooting Star drones further finished the halftime performance by creating the Pepsi logo in the sky. Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience. The potential for these light show drones is endless and we hope this experience inspires other creatives, artists and innovators to really think about how they can incorporate drone technology in new ways that have yet to even be thought of.

The purpose-built quadcopter drone has been constructed based on safety aspects and is made up of LED lights capable of developing more than 4 billion color combinations and can also be effortlessly programmed for any animation.

Atherton posted Feb 6th, 2017 at 10:27am Intel Corporation Intel Shooting Star Drones Form American Flag There is nothing more American than a swarm of robots making a flag for an advertisement. Intel, the venerable microchip maker, is a company built around mining an almost infinite resource: increasingly powerful, increasingly cheap computing power. In 2017, computers and smart devices are ubiquitous, and it’s been 26 years since the company launched its “Intel Inside” campaign to sell people on computer guts. How can an aging tech giant try and stay relevant? Drones, pop stars, and the biggest advertising night of the year. As Lady Gaga opened the halftime show at Super Bowl LI, she did so in front of a Houston sky, artificially lit by Intel’s drone swarm. This artful drone swarm is not the first, though it is probably the highest-profile spectacle of its kind in the United States. Drones and dance troupes appeared on talent shows, drones have danced with humans alone in a field, an earlier Intel drone swarm set an early Guinness World Record with a dancing display. And there is my personal favorite, a small swarm of just 20 aerial robots performing before Mount Fuji, lights and flights creating a vibrant, thick sky. At the end of their Half Time performance, Intel’s drones spelled out the name of the show’s other big sponsor, Pepsi. Technology repeats itself, first as art and then as advertising. When computers are ubiquitous, the need to showcase their potential in new and novel ways leads to such things as the specially-designed robotic entertainers. Each one of Intel’s “Shooting Star Drones” weighs under 10 ounces, can fly for up to 20 minutes, and flies at around 6 mph. Yet it’s the computing that really stands out: the whole swarm of 300 flying robots are controlled by one pilot and one computer, with a second pilot on hand in case of emergencies. Coordinating flying swarms has applications far beyond just entertainment. Revealed in a 60 Minutes segment in early January, the Pentagon tested an autonomous drone swarm in October 2016. Those robots, coordinating with each other and flying together towards set objectives, represent the first wave of military swarming, with smaller, cheaper flocks of robots replacing or complementing the jobs previously done by bigger, more expensive craft. For a swarm to work, each drone in the swarm needs enough computing power to keep track of where it is relative to its neighbors, and to communicate that location, while also flying together in a present plan and accounting for how wind may push them off course. It’s a delicate dance, and one only really possible because of advances in modern computing. How do you sell a microchip to a world where everyone has computers in their pockets? Cover it in lights, put it in the sky, and show people something they’ve most likely never seen: a brightly colored swarm, hung in the sky like a light-up pinboard.

(Credit: Intel Corporation) Some 300 drones lit up the sky in a spectacular synchronized display during Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl halftime show Sunday. The stunning light show kicked off Lady Gaga’s eagerly-anticipated performance with the drones creating eye-catching formations in the night sky. At one point the drones looked like twinkling stars before transforming into red and blue moving stars, creating an American flag. SUPER BOWL LI WILL TAP TECH TO GIVE VIEWERS A PLAYER'S POV Specially-designed for the entertainment industry, the drones are the brainchild of tech giant Intel. The quadcopters are equipped with LED lights that can create over 4 billion color combinations and can be easily programmed to create any animation, according to the Santa Clara, Calif.-based firm. “Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience,” said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s New Technology Group, in a press release. “The potential for these light show drones is endless and we hope this experience inspires other creatives, artists and innovators to really think about how they can incorporate drone technology in new ways that have yet to even be thought of.” MACY'S FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKS TAP TECH TO LIGHT UP SMARTPHONE SCREENS However, with a Federal Aviation Administration drone ban in place over Houston's NRG Stadium during the Super Bowl, Wired reports that the display was filmed earlier in the week, well before the big game. Intel’s Shooting Star drones have already been used by Disney to create light shows. Last year Intel also flew a synchronized fleet of 500 Shooting Star drones in Germany, setting a Guinness World Record for the most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously.

Who doesn’t long for the days when Intel and AMD went head to head in the battle for microprocessor supremacy? Back then Intel, was still operating under the Andrew Grove mantra of “Only the Paranoid Survive” and ultimately pounded AMD into submission. The battle officially started when IBM required a second source for the IBM PC x86 chips Intel is now famous for. Like Intel, the AMD founders also came from Fairchild and started AMD as a semiconductor second sourcing business for a variety of chips. It really was an epic semiconductor battle with Intel and AMD leap frogging down Moore's Law. In fact, I remember buying motherboards with an AMD 40Mhz processor versus an Intel 36Mhz chip just to keep the second source dream alive. Click here to read more ...

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming MWC 2017 GPS & Sat Nav Mobile Apps Mobile Phone Accessories Mobile Phones Tablets Wearables & Fitness Trending: Nintendo Switch Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 Google Pixel iPhone 8 Home / News / Tablet News / Is Intel working on a curved Surface Pro rival? Is Intel working on a curved Surface Pro rival? by Joe Roberts 06 February 2017 0 shares Read Comments A new patent has been revealed, which shows Intel could be working on its own hybrid notebook device with an innovative design. The patent, revealed by The Leaker, shows a curved 2-in-1 device, that could, if ever released, take the fight to Microsoft and its Surface range of devices. Intel's design comprises a detachable curved screen and keyboard, with the screen capable of being used as a tablet (we're intrigued to see whether a curved tablet would prove popular and a curved keyboard would, you know, work). Related: MWC 2017 As The Leaker states, according to the patent, it looks like there could be a battery in both the keyboard and the screen, with the keyboard section also said to be capable of housing extra storage and CPU power. It's also said that the screen could enter a low-power mode when removed from the base, to squeeze some extra life out of its cell. The curved aspect is something we've seen a lot in the TV industry, but although Acer unveiled the world's first curved-screen notebook in the form of the Predator 21 X last August, the curved design is yet to take off in the laptop/tablet industry. Which makes Intel's design all the more interesting, but, as with all patents, there's no guarantee the device will ever make it to market. Rumour has it that if the product does launch, it will come packing Intel's upcoming eighth generation processors, which will give it a real chance against Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 (or 5) – especially if it's priced competitively. For now, there's no official word on whether the hybrid detailed in the patent will actually arrive, but stay tuned for more in the near future. WATCH: MWC – What to expect Let us know what you think of the patent in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments fire115 February 6, 2017, 3:42 pm yes that what iv been missing all this time a curved device! forget about battery improvements, more ram, good price or 1tb-2tb ssd, who needs that crap...

Photo - http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/464938/Super_Micro_Computer_Microblade.jpg A technology-leading Fortune 100 company has deployed over 30,000 Supermicro MicroBlade servers, at its Silicon Valley data center facility with a Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.06, to support the company's growing compute needs. Compared to a traditional data center running at 1.49 PUE, or more, the new datacenter achieves an 88 percent improvement in overall energy efficiency. When the build out is complete at a 35 megawatt IT load power, the company is targeting $13.18M in savings per year in total energy costs across the entire datacenter. The Supermicro MicroBlade system represents an entirely new type of computing platform. It is a powerful and flexible extreme-density 3U or 6U all-in-one total system that features 14 or 28 hot-swappable MicroBlade Server blades. The system deliver 86% improvement in power/cooling efficiency with common shared infrastructure, 56 percent system density improvement and lower initial investment versus 1U servers. The solution has 280 Intel® Xeon® processor-servers per rack and achieves 45 percent to-65 percent CAPEX savings per refresh cycle with a disaggregated rack scale design. "With 280 Intel Xeon processor-servers in a 9-foot rack, and up to 86 percent improvement in system cooling efficiency, the MicroBlade system is a game changer," said Charles Liang, President and CEO of Supermicro. "Leveraging our Silicon Valley based engineering team and global service capabilities, Supermicro collaborated closely with the company's IT department and delivered a solution from design concept to optimally tuned, high-quality product with full supply chain and large-scale delivery support in five weeks.  With our new MicroBlade and SuperBlade, we have changed the game of blade architecture to make blades the lowest in initial acquisition cost for our customers, not just the best in terms of computation, power efficiency, cable-less design, and TCO." The Supermicro MicroBlade disaggregated architecture unlocks the interdependence between the major server subsystems enabling the independent upgrade of CPU+Memory, I/O, Storage and, Power/Cooling.  Now each component can be refreshed on-time to maximize Moore's Law improvements in performance and efficiency versus waiting for a single monolithic server refresh cycle. "A disaggregated server architecture enables the independent upgrades of the compute modules without replacing the rest of the enclosure including networking, storage, fans and power supplies, which refresh at a slower rate," said Shesha Krishnapura, Intel Fellow and Intel IT CTO. "By disaggregating CPU and memory, each resource can be refreshed independently allowing data centers to reduce refresh cycle costs. When viewed over a three to five year refresh cycle, an Intel Rack Scale Design disaggregated server architecture will deliver, on-average, higher-performing and more-efficient servers at lower costs than traditional rip-and-replace models by allowing data centers to independently optimize adoption of new and improved technologies." The MicroBlade provides the perfect building block for a Rack-Scale design data center solution. The networking across all server blades is aggregated into just two ports for uplink through an integrated switch, eliminating the need for Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches and complex cabling. With up to 99% cabling reduction for the MicroBlade system, airflow is significantly improved, which in turn reduces the load on the cooling fans, resulting in even lower OPEX. Up to 86 percent cooling fan power efficiency improvement is achieved by sharing four cooling fans and integrated power modules across all 14 MicroBlade server blades. The MicroBlade enclosure is configured with a Chassis Management Module for unified management and redundant 2,000 watt Titanium Level certified digital power supplies for 96% energy efficiency. Supermicro MicroBlade is shipped with industry standard IPMI 2.0 and Redfish API designed to lower management overhead in large scale data centers. The MicroBlade also supports DP Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4/v3 processors (MBI-6128R-T2/T2X blade server part numbers). In addition to the MicroBlade, Supermicro is introducing a new SuperBlade® architecture with more deployment options. The X10 Generation SuperBlade supports up to 10/14/20 ES-2600 v4 dual processor nodes per 7U chassis with many of the same features as the MicroBlade system. The new 8U SuperBlade® systems use the same Ethernet switches, chassis management modules, and software as the MicroBlade for improved reliability, serviceability, and affordability. The systems are designed to support DP and MP processors up to 205 watts in half-height and full-height blades, respectively. Similarly, the new 4U SuperBlade systems maximize performance and efficiency while enabling up to 140 dual-processor servers or 280 single-processor servers per 42U rack.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 February 2017 by Military News Supermicro Deploys 30,000+ MicroBlade™ Servers to Enable One of the World’s Highest Efficiency (1.06 PUE) Data Centers SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI), a global leader in compute, storage and networking technologies including green computing, has announced deployment of its disaggregated MicroBlade™ systems at one of the world’s highest density and energy efficient data centers. A technology-leading Fortune 100 company has deployed over 30,000 Supermicro MicroBlade servers, at its Silicon Valley data center facility with a Power Use Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.06, to support the company’s growing compute needs. Compared to a traditional data center running at 1.49 PUE, or more, the new datacenter achieves an 88 percent improvement in overall energy efficiency. When the build out is complete at a 35 megawatt IT load power, the company is targeting $13.18M in savings per year in total energy costs across the entire datacenter. The Supermicro MicroBlade system represents an entirely new type of computing platform. It is a powerful and flexible extreme-density 3U or 6U all-in-one total system that features 14 or 28 hot-swappable MicroBlade Server blades. The system deliver 86% improvement in power/cooling efficiency with common shared infrastructure, 56 percent system density improvement and lower initial investment versus 1U servers. The solution has 280 Intel® Xeon® processor-servers per rack and achieves 45 percent to-65 percent CAPEX savings per refresh cycle with a disaggregated rack scale design. „With 280 Intel Xeon processor-servers in a 9-foot rack, and up to 86 percent improvement in system cooling efficiency, the MicroBlade system is a game changer,” said Charles Liang, President and CEO of Supermicro. „Leveraging our Silicon Valley based engineering team and global service capabilities, Supermicro collaborated closely with the company’s IT department and delivered a solution from design concept to optimally tuned, high-quality product with full supply chain and large-scale delivery support in five weeks. With our new MicroBlade and SuperBlade, we have changed the game of blade architecture to make blades the lowest in initial acquisition cost for our customers, not just the best in terms of computation, power efficiency, cable-less design, and TCO.” The Supermicro MicroBlade disaggregated architecture unlocks the interdependence between the major server subsystems enabling the independent upgrade of CPU+Memory, I/O, Storage and, Power/Cooling. Now each component can be refreshed on-time to maximize Moore’s Law improvements in performance and efficiency versus waiting for a single monolithic server refresh cycle. „A disaggregated server architecture enables the independent upgrades of the compute modules without replacing the rest of the enclosure including networking, storage, fans and power supplies, which refresh at a slower rate,” said Shesha Krishnapura, Intel Fellow and Intel IT CTO. „By disaggregating CPU and memory, each resource can be refreshed independently allowing data centers to reduce refresh cycle costs. When viewed over a three to five year refresh cycle, an Intel Rack Scale Design disaggregated server architecture will deliver, on-average, higher-performing and more-efficient servers at lower costs than traditional rip-and-replace models by allowing data centers to independently optimize adoption of new and improved technologies.” The MicroBlade provides the perfect building block for a Rack-Scale design data center solution. The networking across all server blades is aggregated into just two ports for uplink through an integrated switch, eliminating the need for Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches and complex cabling. With up to 99% cabling reduction for the MicroBlade system, airflow is significantly improved, which in turn reduces the load on the cooling fans, resulting in even lower OPEX. Up to 86 percent cooling fan power efficiency improvement is achieved by sharing four cooling fans and integrated power modules across all 14 MicroBlade server blades. The MicroBlade enclosure is configured with a Chassis Management Module for unified management and redundant 2,000 watt Titanium Level certified digital power supplies for 96% energy efficiency. Supermicro MicroBlade is shipped with industry standard IPMI 2.0 and Redfish API designed to lower management overhead in large scale data centers. The MicroBlade also supports DP Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4/v3 processors (MBI-6128R-T2/T2X blade server part numbers). In addition to the MicroBlade, Supermicro is introducing a new SuperBlade® architecture with more deployment options. The X10 Generation SuperBlade supports up to 10/14/20 ES-2600 v4 dual processor nodes per 7U chassis with many of the same features as the MicroBlade system. The new 8U SuperBlade® systems use the same Ethernet switches, chassis management modules, and software as the MicroBlade for improved reliability, serviceability, and affordability. The systems are designed to support DP and MP processors up to 205 watts in half-height and full-height blades, respectively. Similarly, the new 4U SuperBlade systems maximize performance and efficiency while enabling up to 140 dual-processor servers or 280 single-processor servers per 42U rack.

Three hundred Intel Shooting Star drones performed a choreographed aerial show during the Super Bowl Halftime Show, dancing behind Lady Gaga. The sequence, which was pre-recorded, was the first time the devices were used to complement an entertainment act at an event of this scale. One computer and a drone pilot controlled all 300 drones. The US Federal Aviation Administration granted special permission for the fleet to fly up to 700 feet. Intel also secured an additional special waiver to fly the drones in the restrictive class B airspace. The software and animation interface on the Intel Shooting Star drone system enables to create a light show in several days or weeks based on the animation complexity. Intel said its algorithms automate the animation creation process by using a reference image, rapidly calculating the required number of drones, identifying the place of drones, and formulating the fastest path to create the image in the sky. READ NOW: How technology is disrupting the Super Bowl, RBS 6 Nations rugby & the Premier League Intel new technology group senior vice president and general manager Josh Walden said: “Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience. “The potential for these light show drones is endless and we hope this experience inspires other creatives, artists and innovators to really think about how they can incorporate drone technology in new ways that have yet to even be thought of.” After the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI Halftime Show, a 10-second ad showcased the drones forming a Pepsi logo that morphed into an Intel logo. The Intel Shooting Star drones are a new type of unmanned aerial vehicle, specifically designed for entertainment purposes like festivals and entertainment events. The purpose-built quadcopter drone is equipped with LED lights that can create more than 4 billion color combinations and easily be programmed for any animation.

Intel Considering Microsoft Surface Killer with Curved Display GO Patent hints at future device manufactured by Intel Feb 6, 2017 12:30 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Intel is one of the companies that are looking into ways to build a 2-in-1 device competing against Microsoft’s Surface, and a new report indicates that the firm has already patented a new design that would be specifically aimed at challenging Redmond’s own model. A patent discovered by The Leaker indicates that Intel developed a technology that would essentially be its own version of the Surface, but with one major difference: it would feature a curved screen. While it’s not clear if Intel is targeting the Surface Pro 4 or the Surface Book laptop, what the company is aiming for is building a 2-in-1 device that would support both laptop and tablet modes. According to patent documents, the detachable keyboard would itself incorporate a battery and storage options, adding to other capabilities that are integrated into the display. At first glance, Intel is looking for something similar to the Surface Book, as it wants the screen to be used independently, but the keyboard to also come with extra hardware for laptop mode. Two different batteries There could be two different batteries, one in the base (keyboard) and another one in the screen, with the latter to also come with a dedicated low-power mode that would be specifically aimed at optimizing battery life and giving more autonomy when the keyboard is detached. At first glance, this project sounds doable, and it’s believed that Intel would launch it when its eight-generation of Core processors see daylight, which means that it has big chances to go live sometime this year. Of course, since it’s just a patent for the time being, it’s hard to tell if Intel does want to push it to production or it’s just exploring some ideas, but for the moment, it’s just another proof that Microsoft’s 2-in-1 concept is becoming more appealing for companies across the world. On the other hand, Intel is clearly trying to bring something new with the curved display, although by the time the company introduces this model, some other OEMs could bring such screens to the market as well. #Microsoft#Surface#Intel#Surface Book#Surface Pro 4 subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft’s $15 DVD Player App Now Listed as Top Windows 10 App in the Store Windows 10 Cloud Will Support Upgrades to Windows 10 Pro Windows 10 Cloud ISOs Leaked Dev Abandons Windows Because “Microsoft Has No Strategy for Windows Phone” Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One Microsoft Teases New Windows 10 Security Announcements Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux    Microsoft's Surface could get a new rival soon New Apps Portable PeaUtils: A collection of file management tools that comprises checksum and hash tools, file and folder analysis, a file splitter and joiner, hex data preview, and more Jihosoft iTunes Backup Unlocker: Uncover the password of your encrypted iTunes backup using multiple cracking methods, with this novice-friendly piece of software ProgDVB Professional: Watch TV channels from around the world, listen to radio station from the comfort of your computer, and record your favorite shows to watch them later eBook Converter Bundle: Batch convert your ePub or DRM PDFs to other formats with this lightweight software solution that provides ease of use and support for Kindle, NOOK, Kobo file formats Portable Alternate Archiver: Manage multiple files in a folder by organizing them into sub-directories, with the help of this lightweight and easy to handle utility ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application xrecode III Portable: Converts audio files with ease and at high speed, supporting various input formats and providing a user-friendly working environment Reader comments Apple No Longer World’s Most Valuable Brand, Microsoft Very Close Behind more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Intel packs a tablet chip from yesteryear inside New Balance's new RunIQ smartwatch New Balance's Atom-powered smartwatch offers less battery life than some of its competition, however. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 06 February, 2017 23:00 0 - - - - print email You’re probably aware that the chip inside your smartphone contains more computing horsepower than the systems that helped launch a man to the Moon. Intel’s taken that in a slightly different direction: An Atom chip formerly used in smartphones and tablets now drives New Balance’s latest RunIQ smartwatch. Jerry Bautista, vice president and general manager of the New Business Group within Intel, said that the New Balance RunIQ fitness watch, which began shipping last week, contains a “Cloverdale Peak” chip inside of it. Specifically, that chip is part of the Z34XX family, Bautista said, which powered tablets and Intel’s smartphone efforts in 2014. “Powered” is the right word. Intel claimed that the original Z34XX family for tablets and smartphones had enough horsepower to run Asphalt 8, a fairly sophisticated 3D driving game for Android, iOS, and Windows phones. If the RunIQ ran the full Android OS rather than just the more limited Android Wear, you might be able to play some pretty hardcore games on a smartwatch. Why this matters: Intel has rapidly diversified beyond just a PC company, as chief executive Brian Krzanich likes to remind us at public events. A year or so ago, Intel was making waves with partnerships with Luxottica, Fossil, and Opening Ceremony for a number of stylish, smart devices. What’s interesting is that those devices were often powered by Intel’s Curie or Quark, small low-power edge processors Intel designed as the engines of the Internet of Things. New Balance went a different route, opting for Atom’s more powerful legacy and possibly trading off some battery life in return. Will Atom show up in other wearables, too? Gameloft A scene from Gameloft’s Asphalt 8 for Android. RunIQ: a rugged, waterproof fitness watch New Balance’s RunIQ doesn’t necessarily look like a former smartphone chip is hiding inside of it, though the $299 fitness watch is decidedly chunky. Intel and New Balance ruggedized and waterproofed the watch to 5 atmospheres. Its battery life is rated at 24 hours, though just 5 with GPS tracking and its real-time optical heart-rate feature turned on. That’s considerably less than what smartwatches like the Garmin Vivoactive line offer, however—or even the Basis Peak, which Intel began manufacturing in 2014, later recalling it after a sensor problem. Otherwise, the RunIQ watch can store your music with 4GB of onboard flash storage, then stream it wirelessly via Bluetooth. It can’t make calls, though it will display messages from a synced Android phone.   Behind its color AMOLED display, however, hides a surprisingly powerful Atom processor. According to Bautista, Intel repurposed and repackaged the Cloverdale Peak chip for RunIQ. The company isn’t disclosing the exact specifications of the chip, though the related Z3480 gives some idea: the Z3480 is a dual-core, dual-threaded chip, running at a whopping 2.13GHz.   “It’s a very, very capable platform,” Bautista said of the Cloverdale Peak chip. “Android is very, very snappy on this device. There’s no delay. It’s a very good experience.” Bautista said Cloverdale Peak was a legacy of Intel’s efforts in the smartphone business, which struggled without an integrated cellular radio. In 2016, Intel drastically cut its Atom line, essentially exiting the smartphone business.  So how in the world did Intel shoehorn a smartphone chip into a smartwatch? “Well, the good thing is that we do have very deep packaging expertise,” Bautista said. “So for us, to take a piece of silicon, repackage it, move the I/O differently...is just something that we can do. And it gives more life to a product that is quite fine. Performance is great per watt. So why not? Why not just use that?” Though Intel has seemingly prioritized Curie and Quark in recent years, Bautista said that Intel will pursue a hybrid strategy, repurposing older silicon like the Atom where it makes sense. Sometime, though, that’s not good enough. “In a number of cases, you do have to build purpose-built silicon from the ground up,” he said.

Despite this, engineers are facing real issues in how to continue to push system performance to cope with the growing demands of new and emerging datacentre workloads. This isn’t the first time the end of Moore’s Law has been proclaimed, but Intel and other chip makers have so far found new tricks for shrinking transistors to meet the goal of doubling density every two years, with a knock-on boost for compute performance. Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said at CES: “I’ve been in this industry for 34 years and I’ve heard the death of Moore’s Law more times than anything else in my career. And I’m here today to really show you and tell you that Moore’s Law is alive and well and flourishing. I believe Moore’s Law will be alive well beyond my career, alive and well and kicking.” Approaching physical limits Yet the pace is slowing as Intel works at developing 7nm and 5nm technologies to follow on from 10nm. The introduction of 10nm itself has already been delayed by a year because of difficulties with the manufacturing process, and these difficulties are likely to increase as the size approaches physical limits on how small the on-chip circuitry can be made. Read more about next generation datacentres More and more businesses are adopting a hybrid cloud strategy for their datacentre needs. Computer Weekly looks at what’s on offer. HPE has developed a concept computing architecture which it says will power future generations of applications. We find out how it will change IT. “I can’t see them getting much beyond 5nm, and Moore’s Law will then run out because we will have reached the end of the silicon era,” says Ovum principal analyst Roy Illsley. Some industry observers think this will happen in the next 10 years or so. As to what will ultimately replace silicon, such as optical processing or quantum computing, there appears no consensus so far. However, this does not mean that compute power will cease to expand, as both hardware and software in the datacentre have evolved since the days of single-chip servers and monolithic applications. “The way apps are written has changed,” says Illsley. “They are now distributed and scalable, so Moore’s Law is a rather pointless metric for what a computer can do, anyway.” In fact, the industry hit a similar crisis some time ago, when Intel discovered that its single-core chips simply overheated when ever-increasing clock speeds started to approach 4GHz. The solution then was to change tack and deliver greater processing power by using the extra transistors to put multiple processor cores onto the same chip, and comparable architectural shifts will enable the industry to continue to boost processing power. Such an approach can be seen in the growing interest in complementing conventional central processing units (CPUs) with specialised accelerators that may be better suited to handling specific tasks or workloads. A good example of this is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which has long been used to accelerate 3D graphics, but which has also found its way into high-performance compute (HPC) clusters thanks to the massively parallel architecture of a GPU which makes it excellent for performing complex calculations on large datasets. In 2016, Nvidia launched its DGX-1 server, which sports eight of its latest Tesla GPUs with 16GB memory apiece and is aimed at applications involving deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) accelerated analytics. “Nvidia’s system can do what would have taken a whole datacentre of servers a few years ago, at a pretty competitive price,” says Illsley. Another example is the field programmable gate array (FPGA), which is essentially a chip full of logic blocks that can be configured to perform specific functions. It provides a hardware circuit that can perform those functions much faster than can be done in software, but which can be reconfigured under software control, if necessary. One notable adopter of FPGAs is Microsoft, which uses the technology in its Azure datacentre servers to speed up Bing searches and accelerate software-defined networking (SDN). Intel is also working on integrating FPGA circuitry into some of its Xeon server chips, which could lead to broader adoption. In 2016, the firm showed off a Xeon coupled with a discrete FPGA inside a chip package, but its goal is to get both onto a single piece of silicon. Meanwhile, Intel prefers to push its Xeon Phi platform rather than GPU acceleration for demanding workloads. These “many integrated core” chips combine a large number of CPU cores (up to 72 in the latest Knights Landing silicon) which are essentially x86 cores with 512-bit vector processing extensions, so they can run much of the same code as a standard Intel processor. However, one issue with having so many cores on one chip is getting access to data in system memory for all those cores. Intel has addressed this by integrating 16GB of high-speed memory inside each Xeon Phi chip package, close to the CPU cores. The Machine HPE has shown a different approach with The Machine, its experimental prototype for a next-generation architecture. This has been described as memory-driven computing, and is based around the notion of a massive, global memory pool that is shared between all the processors in a system, enabling large datasets to be processed in memory. A working version, demonstrated at HPE Discover in December 2016, saw each processor directly controlling eight dual inline memory modules (DIMMs) as a local memory pool, with a much larger global pool of memory comprising clusters of eight DIMMs connected via a memory fabric interface that also links to the processors. In the demo, all the memory was standard DRAM, but HPE intended The Machine to have a non-volatile global memory pool. In fact, focusing on processors overlooks the fact that memory and storage are a bigger brake on performance, as even flash-based storage takes several microseconds to read a block of data, during which time the processor may execute millions of instructions. So anything that can speed memory and storage access will deliver a welcome boost to system performance, and a number of technologies are being developed, such as Intel and Micron’s 3D XPoint or IBM’s Phase-Change Memory, which promise to be faster than flash memory, although their cost is likely to see them used at first as a cache for a larger pool of slower storage. These are being developed alongside new I/O interfaces that aim to make it quicker and easier to move data between memory and the processor or accelerator. Examples include Nvidia’s NVLink 2.0 for accelerators and the Gen-Z standard that aims to deliver a high-speed fabric for connecting both memory and new “storage-class” memory technologies. Specific workloads One thing Illsley thinks we may see in the future is systems that are optimised for specific workloads. Currently, virtually all computers are general-purpose designs that perform different tasks by running the appropriate software. But some tasks may call for a more specialised application-specific architecture to deliver the required performance, especially if AI approaches such as deep learning become more prevalent. Moore’s Law, which started out as an observation and prediction on the exponential growth of transistors in integrated circuits by Intel founder Gordon Moore, has lasted five decades. We may be reaching the point where it no longer holds true for silicon chips, but whatever happens, engineers will ensure that compute power continues to expand to meet the demands thrown at it.

Year after year, the company has been constant in releasing new products to supplement the market demands. However, it might be that Intel’s heyday is now numbered. Especially now that AMD Ryzen processors are on their way. According to a recent report from Coolaler, AMD has intentions of releasing as much as 17 different versions of the new Ryzen chip. In general, the lineup is divided into three major versions, eight-core, six-core and four-cores. These processors will be called SR7, SR5 and SR3, respectively. The SR7, or Summit Ridge 7 processor will be in direct competition to the Broadwell-E i7-6900K chip for Intel. Just like the i7-6900K, the SR7 will have eight cores and 16 threads. The base frequency will be 3.0 GHz while the boost will be at 3.6 GHz. This chip will be available in four other subcategories.

(@TahaTURGUT2) February 4, 2017 The SR5 will compete with the i5-7500K Kaby Lake processor. It will have the same base and boost frequency as the SR7 but only running with six cores and 12 threads. There will be a total of six different SR5 types in the AMD processor lineup. Finally, the SR3 processor which will go head-to-head with the rest of Intel’s lower class processors. Unlike the SR5 and SR7, the SR 3 will have a base frequency of 3.2 GHZ and a boost of 3.4 GHz. It will come in four subclasses with varying performance ratings. According to AMD CEO Lisa Su, the AMD Ryzen processor will make their appearance into the market some time in March. At the moment, the company just launched a series of AM4-socket motherboards that will compliment the processors. AMD is adamant in selling the new Ryzen chips at a much lower cost than that of Intel’s mainstream processors. AMD is hoping that this, in addition to the superb processing power, will be enough to generate much interest. It will be interesting to see how the Ryzen processors perform in the real world. Knowing that it will be cheaper than the alternative, it gives hope to budding PC enthusiasts. Furthermore, it is, perhaps, high time that Intel get a good competition to shake things up and call for considerable improvements to its product line.

It's the technology behind that's far more impressive and advanced. Intel's Shooting Star program consists of an army of pre-programmed drones that are controlled by a set of computer programs. Intel says that it is currently capable of controlling over 10,000 drones at a given time. Intel's drones have an external shell made out of styrofoam with four propellers encased in a metal housing. The bottom of the dome has a LED light that can produce 1 out of 4 billion colours. The whole construction just fits which means there's no space for nuts and bolts. Intel has made the build fairly simple to account for the fact that a single one of these drones can be put together in 15 minutes. Intel's fleet of drones do no possess the hardware capabilities to sense other drones or prevent a collision but instead each move of every drone in action is handled by the software suites. The Super Bowl Half-time show isn't the first stint by the drone army. In fact, Intel has been working on its Shooting Star program since the last two years and have partnered with artists and researchers to make 100 drones take off in their first attempt. Thereafter, during the first official show in Disney World, Intel demonstrated its capacity to launch and control 500 drones simultaneously. Apart from being the outstanding dancers they are, Intel visualizes the Shooting Star technology on a much grander scale with the drones assisting in search and rescue operations such as during landslides or going through a collapsed structure and even analyzing an agricultural land. The ideas may be far fetched, but Intel has made something which has limitless applications. For now, let's just adore the drones half-time performance during the Super Bowl.

View All Pages Motherboard manufacturers have produced a comprehensive range of products for Intel’s latest-generation Z270 chipset, spanning a wide spectrum of prices. Yet it’s the mid-range Intel motherboards, like ASRock’s new Z270 Extreme4, that consumers typically end up buying. The Z270 Extreme4 is, on paper specification, a true all-rounder; a competitive price, plentiful connectivity options and a varied feature set, but can it keep up with its competition? ASRock, like other motherboard companies, runs multiple different product lines for Intel’s mainstream platform. The Fatal1ty series specifically targets a gaming audience while the Extreme Series is more generic in purpose. As such the Z270 Extreme4 is not Gamer-esque in appearance, though it certainly possesses an aesthetic that stands out from the ordinary. ASRock’s own website describes this product as being aimed at animators, artists, designers and editors, which might be optimistic. The headline feature for the Extreme4, and with many motherboards of this class, is RGB lighting. ASRock delivers this is two ways; onboard lighting and support for external RGB strips through a header. Rather uniquely, ASRock deploys the RGB controls through both software and the UEFI environment. Another notable attribute of the Extreme4 that will catch the attention of consumers is the provision of dual M.2 ports, both capable of running at PCI Express Generation 3.0 4X speeds. While NVMe M.2 drives are still expensive per GB compared to traditional SATA III SSDs, the cost is coming down with each subsequent release from SSD manufacturers. The default connectivity provisioned with Intel’s mainstream Z-series chipsets has been generous for a while now so the fact ASRock has USB 3.1 Type-A and C is a tick on the checklist rather than a unique selling point. ASRock does, however, attempt to differentiate itself by throwing in an additional two SATA ports, taking the total to 8, for users with a larger-than-average storage array. ASRock includes a number of other in-fashion features for motherboards of the current moment including PCIe slot shielding and improved audio based on the Realtek ALC1220 codec. A good start then for the Z270 Extreme4 which finds itself priced in-line with motherboards such as the ASUS Prime Z270-A,  Gigabyte Z270-X Ultra Gaming and MSI Z270 Gaming Pro.

By Graham Lanktree February 6, 2017 09:10 GMT Close Trump's battle with judges over travel ban deemed 'constitutional crisis' IBTimes US President Donald Trump's controversial travel and immigration ban "inflicts significant harm on American business" argued America's most valuable tech companies – including Apple, Facebook, Google, and Intel– in a legal brief on Sunday (5 February) Lawyers representing 97 companies filed the court documents in support of a legal challenge against the president's executive order limiting travel and immigration from seven majority Muslim countries on 27 January. Other companies including Microsoft, Levi Strauss & Co., eBay, Netflix, and Uber were also on the brief. It provides legal arguments against the executive order. Trump's order has drawn several legal challenges after it blocked people and refugees with valid visas and residency cards from from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days. His order sparked protests at airports throughout the country and around the world. "The order makes it more difficult and expensive for US companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees," argued the court brief issued largely by American tech companies. Trump's order, it said, "disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States." On 30 January Washington State sought an injunction to stop Trump's executive order. A federal judge in Seattle granted it on Friday 3 February, stating that the president's action "adversely affects the States' residents" employment, education, business, family relations, and freedom to travel. The Trump administration must justify the president's order in the court on Monday 6 February. The supporting brief sent by the companies is just one of several similar supporting documents, including ones sent by the State of Hawaii and US law professors. Over the weekend President Trump railed against the court's decision in a series of tweets, and challenged the validity of the judge, stating that "potential terrorists" could flood into the US as a result. "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!" Trump said on Saturday. Yet "immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies," argued the tech firms legal filing on Sunday. "Immigrants are among our leading entrepreneurs, politicians, artists, and philanthropists."

Lenovo's Yoga A12 Android 2-in-1 has futuristic touch panel keyboard The Yoga A12 replaces the hard keyboard with a touch panel one Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 06 February, 2017 16:01 0 - - - - print email Lenovo is ditching the hard keyboard for a cool new touch one on its new Yoga A12 2-in-1, which can be an Android tablet or a laptop. But for those seeking the latest and greatest hardware, there's a disappointment. It runs on an old chip from Intel, which has rolled back its development of Android, raising questions on the frequency of OS updates. The highlight of Yoga A12 is the versatile touch panel that can be a smartphone-like virtual keyboard. It's a feature adapted from the Yoga Book, which was introduced last year. The Yoga A12 has a 12.2-inch touchscreen, and a back-lit input touch panel replaces the hard keyboard. Lenovo said the virtual keyboard provides a user experience similar to on-screen ones on smartphones and tablets. Lenovo is betting that those comfortable with mobile typing will adapt quickly to this touch keyboard. The Android OS also provides a familiar mobile interface. The Yoga A12 has Android 6.0.1, and will ship in many countries this month starting at US$299.99. But there are some disappointments. The screen has a resolution of 1200 x 800 pixels, and its components are aging. It has Intel's Atom X5 tablet processor, code-named Cherry Trail, which the chip maker is now phasing out. Intel is replacing Atom X5 chips with newer Celeron and Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake, which are mainly going into Windows tablets and 2-in-1s. Intel in May last year discontinued Atom smartphone chips. Lenovo had an explanation on why it used Atom X5 in Yoga A12. "When Intel made its announcements about Atom, the Yoga A12 was already well in development. Intel has nevertheless committed to keeping the Atom X5 in the market to support the Yoga A12 and other products," a spokesperson said in an email. Lenovo said there's a clear upgrade path from Atom to Apollo Lake processors. That's an indication that Lenovo may use Apollo Lake chips in the successor to Yoga A12. Most Android devices today are based on ARM chips. Only a handful of Android tablets have Cherry Trail chips, including Lenovo's Yoga Book and Panasonic's ToughPad FZ-A2. PC makers are also quickly cutting Atom chips from tablets. Dell isn't selling Android tablets with Atom chips, and Microsoft has discontinued Surface 3, which had a Cherry Trail chip. Lenovo said it plans to upgrade Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0 in the next couple of months. Yet, there are questions on the frequency of OS upgrades. Intel -- which was responsible for developing Android updates -- has scaled back development of the OS for mobile devices, and is focusing more on Windows and Chromebooks. Lenovo may have to take on the development of a custom Android 7.0 for Yoga A12, which could be a challenging task. It could get some help from Intel and the open-source community. Current Atom-based Android mobile devices are mostly stuck at Android 5 or 6, and won't get Android 7.0. With 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, the Yoga A12 has features similar to that of a Chromebook -- except it is for Android users. But Chromebooks are now getting the ability to run Android applications. In the future, Lenovo plans to bring its virtual keyboard to Chromebooks as well.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: February 6, 2017 4:52 pm At the end of Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI Halftime Show, Intel ran a 10-second spot where the drones transformed from the Pepsi logo into the Intel logo. Houston’s skyline lit up with hundreds of Intel drones during the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl LI halftime show at NRG Stadium on Sunday, as Lady Gaga belted out her hit numbers on stage. Three hundred Intel Shooting Star drones were seen doing aerial acrobatics above the stadium’s retractable rooftop with syncronised precision. This makes it the ‘first-ever drone integration during a televised event and a Super Bowl’. The drones added colour to Gaga’s performance with multiple formations, which included twinkling stars, red and blue moving stars, American flag and and Pepsi logo. According to Intel, its Shooting Star drones are a new type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The devices are specifically designed for entertainment purposes. Each quadcopter drone packs LEDs, creating over four billion colour combinations.

Watch all our videos from Express Technology “Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience,” Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager, New Technology Group, Intel said in a press statement. According to a report in The Wired, each drone is a foot long and weighs around eight ounces. They are made of foam and plastic. “Each drone communicates wirelessly with a central computer to execute its dance routine, oblivious to what the hundreds of machines around it are doing,” the report explains. This is one of the biggest drone shows by Intel, seen by close to 160 million global audience. Given the large number of drones involved in the show, the performance needed meticulous planning. Intel began preparations early in December to put on a brief show on Sunday.  However, this was not the first time when drones were used in such large numbers. A similar synchronised drone show was organised in November last year for Disney with the same Intel drone squad. The ‘Starbright Holiday Drone Show’ bagged the world record for ‘most unmanned aerial vehicles airborne simultaneously.’ © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: drones Super Bowl Election 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 Phase 1 Live Updates: Polling begins in 73 constituencies of western region UP Assembly Elections 2017: Battle for heartland begins in west that may hold the key UP Assembly Elections 2017: Day before first phase, Muslim clerics back Mayawati Best of Express Setback for Sasikala as TN education minister Pandiarajan joins Panneerselvam camp EntertainmentJolly LLB 2 movie review : Akshay Kumar, Saurabh Shukla make this an unalloyed delight EntertainmentShah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan's first selfie in 25 years is one of a kind.

That seems to be the journey that Intel has taken as it tries to gain some ground in markets outside its traditional PC silicon market. Although it’s not exactly taking on more established drone makers like DJI head on, it is aiming for a more niche segment where it might actually stand uncontested for some time. And what better way to make a big splash than by launching 300 of those drones above the Super Bowl Halftime show. The Super Bowl has become a prime chance for companies, even tech ones that don’t exactly have direct connections to the sport, to advertise their wares. Intel, of course, is no different but it managed to trump them all by getting the most coveted halftime spot. Of course, it had to share that spot with Lady Gaga who is really the center of attraction. But, even for a few brief moments, Intel was able to grab the crowd’s attention with a choreographed light show. That was made possible by Intel’s “Shooting Star” quadcopters, basically drones equipped with very bright LED lights that can be programmed to display any color of choice. Being drones, these Shooting Stars can be programmed to fly in certain formations and change colors at certain times. The end effect is a dazzling though brief light show with the drones forming the US flag at the start of Lady Gaga’s performance and, in the end, sponsor Pepsi’s logo as well as Intel’s. Our drones have returned to the ground after an amazing #PepsiHalftime show #ExperienceMore pic.twitter.com/Augpbt05u6 — Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 The Shooting Star drones themselves won’t hold a candle to professional commercial drones, but that’s hardly Intel’s intention anyway. Instead, these drones are going to be marketed towards entertainment uses, practically replacing more expensive, more dangerous, and harder to control fireworks and similar materials. The drones, however, may need a bit of work on the legal side, considering current regulatory restrictions on when and where drones can fly. Intel, in fact, had to tape part of the performance earlier to get around those limitations. But, at least for now, with no other similar drone system in the market, Intel can claim the entertainment drone throne.

Twitter Facebook Lenovo's Yoga A12 Android 2-in-1 has futuristic touch panel keyboard The Yoga A12 replaces the hard keyboard with a touch panel one Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 06 February, 2017 16:01 - - - - print email Comments Lenovo is ditching the hard keyboard for a cool new touch one on its new Yoga A12 2-in-1, which can be an Android tablet or a laptop. But for those seeking the latest and greatest hardware, there's a disappointment. It runs on an old chip from Intel, which has rolled back its development of Android, raising questions on the frequency of OS updates. The highlight of Yoga A12 is the versatile touch panel that can be a smartphone-like virtual keyboard. It's a feature adapted from the Yoga Book, which was introduced last year. The Yoga A12 has a 12.2-inch touchscreen, and a back-lit input touch panel replaces the hard keyboard. Lenovo said the virtual keyboard provides a user experience similar to on-screen ones on smartphones and tablets. Lenovo is betting that those comfortable with mobile typing will adapt quickly to this touch keyboard. The Android OS also provides a familiar mobile interface. The Yoga A12 has Android 6.0.1, and will ship in many countries this month starting at US$299.99. But there are some disappointments. The screen has a resolution of 1200 x 800 pixels, and its components are aging. It has Intel's Atom X5 tablet processor, code-named Cherry Trail, which the chip maker is now phasing out. Intel is replacing Atom X5 chips with newer Celeron and Pentium chips code-named Apollo Lake, which are mainly going into Windows tablets and 2-in-1s. Intel in May last year discontinued Atom smartphone chips. Lenovo had an explanation on why it used Atom X5 in Yoga A12. "When Intel made its announcements about Atom, the Yoga A12 was already well in development. Intel has nevertheless committed to keeping the Atom X5 in the market to support the Yoga A12 and other products," a spokesperson said in an email. Lenovo said there's a clear upgrade path from Atom to Apollo Lake processors. That's an indication that Lenovo may use Apollo Lake chips in the successor to Yoga A12. Most Android devices today are based on ARM chips. Only a handful of Android tablets have Cherry Trail chips, including Lenovo's Yoga Book and Panasonic's ToughPad FZ-A2. PC makers are also quickly cutting Atom chips from tablets. Dell isn't selling Android tablets with Atom chips, and Microsoft has discontinued Surface 3, which had a Cherry Trail chip. Lenovo said it plans to upgrade Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.0 in the next couple of months. Yet, there are questions on the frequency of OS upgrades. Intel -- which was responsible for developing Android updates -- has scaled back development of the OS for mobile devices, and is focusing more on Windows and Chromebooks. Lenovo may have to take on the development of a custom Android 7.0 for Yoga A12, which could be a challenging task. It could get some help from Intel and the open-source community. Current Atom-based Android mobile devices are mostly stuck at Android 5 or 6, and won't get Android 7.0. With 32GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, the Yoga A12 has features similar to that of a Chromebook -- except it is for Android users. But Chromebooks are now getting the ability to run Android applications. In the future, Lenovo plans to bring its virtual keyboard to Chromebooks as well.

Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumour Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Contact Us The Bitbag Gaming News PS4 Xbox One Nintendo PC Gaming Mobile Gaming What’s Hot Rumors Gameplay Guide Patch Tech News Mobile Tablet Desktop OS Tech Rumors Trending Anime Movies TV Series Entertainment Sports Social Media World News Sports Tom Brady Super Bowl Commercial For Intel As Patriots Play The Big Game By Michael Jay Toledo on February 6 2017 02:14 PM Football superstar Tom Brady is appearing in a 30-second Super Bowl commercial for Intel. This is the very first ad for the company during the game since 2010. Obviously, they have picked the right man to do the commercial. Watch the full video below. Jeff Hopper, the general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, recently talked with the Associated Press. There he shared why Intel chose Brady to be the perfect person to publicize their new technology. “It’s something that fans have always dreamed about: ‘What did Tom see when he threw that pass?’ Everyone wants to be the player, to see what it’s like to see it from the point of view,” he said, as reported by Heavy. The commercial features the Intel’s 360-degree replay technology called “Be the Player.” Fox has already been using it during their broadcasts. Also, according to Ad Meter, the company installed cameras in Houston’s stadium that will film game highlights from the every player’s point of view. The technology also includes a zoom “freeD” system, which NBA and baseball All-Star games are using. Tom Brady’s Seventh Super Bowl Appearance Super Bowl LI is already the seventh time Brady is playing in the event. Although he could be quarterback with the most rings in history, that is not exactly what’s on his mind right now. These past few weeks, the New England quarterback mentioned his mother’s health. He did not disclose any specific details about it, but he described that it as “challenging.” As a result, Brady told Jim Gray of Westwood One, via Fox Sports, that he is dedicating this game to his mom. “She’s the one I want to win for,” the quarterback added. Prior to that, the football superstar as well shared that his mother’s condition is the reason why she has not attended any of his games this year. Clearly, Brady’s situation will make him more focused during the game. He would want to make his mother proud so it is safe to say that he will be putting it all out there. Hopefully, his efforts would be converted into another Super Bowl win for the superstar. Let us just wait and see whether or not the Patriots will beat the Atlanta Falcons. How about you? Who do you think would win Super Bowl XI? Do you think Brady would be successful in helping the Patriots get the W? Or will the Falcons dominate the match?

As the Dancing in the Dark hitmaker opened up the show, hundreds of drones soared behind her, flying high into formation to create stunning visuals over the Houston skyline. Intel was behind the stunning pre-recorded art display that transformed bobs of lights into a glittering flag and shimmering stars during the show on Sunday night. Scroll down for video  Lady Gaga's incredible Super Bowl halftime show was due in part to Intel's fleet of 300 drones that helped create her dazzling performance over the Houston skyline on Sunday night  The performance saw hundreds of the devices swirl and transform into different displays, including the Intel logo (left) and the American flag (right)  The project, dubbed Shooting Stars, was first used in a three-week run at Disney World over the holiday season.  They are all controlled by a single operating system, reported Tech Crunch. Although the halftime show only used 300 devices, the system is capable of controlling up to 10,000 drones at a time.

Share this article Share However, because of strict FAA regulations around the Superbowl, it was actually filmed earlier this week. Restrictions placed on the area by the Federal Aviation Administration forbid drones from flying. 'Temporary Flight Restrictions will prohibit certain aircraft operations, including unmanned aircraft operations, or drones, within a 34.5-mile radius of NRG Stadium in downtown Houston, Texas on game day,' the FAA said. The drones have previously been used by Disney for 'Starbright Holiday Show – An Intel Collaboration' a 12 minute 'virtual firework' show that ran for eight weeks. 'The restrictions will be in effect from 4 p.m. to 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 5.'  As Lady Gaga's performance began, Intel's Shooting Star drones created formations in the sky including twinkling stars that transformed into red and blue moving stars, before creating the American Flag for a dramatic finale that brought Lady Gaga to center stage on the field, before forming the Pepsi logo in the sky. The drones are a new type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), specifically designed for entertainment purposes such as festivals and entertainment events, Intel said. They have previously been used by Disney for 'Starbright Holiday Show – An Intel Collaboration'  a 12 minute 'virtual firework' show that ran for eight weeks. The purpose-built quadcopter drone is built with safety in mind and equipped with LED lights that can create over 4 billion color combinations and easily be programmed for any animation. Each drone communicates wirelessly with a central computer to execute its dance routine, oblivious to what the hundreds of machines around it are doing, according to Wired.  'Lady Gaga and the Super Bowl creative team wanted to pull off something that had never been done before and we were able to combine Intel drone innovation with her artistry to pull off a truly unique experience,' said Josh Walden, senior vice president and general manager, New Technology Group, Intel.  'The potential for these light show drones is endless and we hope this experience inspires other creatives, artists and innovators to really think about how they can incorporate drone technology in new ways that have yet to even be thought of.'  Intel's Twitter account congratulated the performer on her mini concert and took credit for their involvement in the night's show.  The stunning pre-recorded art display that transformed bobs of lights to a glittering flag and shimmering stars Intel is reported to be launching the move from individual drone usage to larger fleet operations.  The light show was pre-recorded due to possible 'weather and environment issues' but Intel insists that doesn't mean the drones can't be used for live shows in the future, For The Win reported. The drones are lightweight and much less fancy looking than everyday drones. To take flight, they are propelled from launchpads Intel has been working on the drone project for the past two years with hopes its take on aerial performance would not just be limited to large-scale events, but expand to Fourth of July celebrations and 'sky branding'. The drones are lightweight and much less fancy looking than everyday drones.  To take flight, they are propelled from launchpads. The purpose-built quadcopter drone is built with safety in mind and equipped with LED lights that can create over 4 billion color combinations and easily be programmed for any animation. Tech Crunch reports that they take only 15 minutes to assemble, meaning hundreds can be put together in a relatively short time period. The news outlet also says the company plans for their fleet devices to be used also to complete tasks, such as rescue operations and inspecting goods.  Lady Gaga was the performer during the Super Bowl halftime show. The light show was pre-recorded due to possible 'weather and environment issues' but Intel insists that doesn't mean the drones can't be used for live shows in the future Read more: Intel powered the drones during Lady Gaga¿s Super Bowl halftime show | TechCrunch Yes, those were drones at Lady Gaga¿s Super Bowl 51 halftime show | For The Win Share or comment on this article e-mail 6.5k shares Most watched News videos Danielle Bregoli throws punches while boarding Spirit Airways Cameraman 'zooms in' on woman's breasts in 'see-through' swimsuit Caught on camera: Bystanders watch topless men fighting in street Moment Lindsay Hoyle and Alex Salmond scream at each other Danielle Bregoli discusses fighting a 'crack head' with her mom 'I don't take no s***': Bus driver kicks drunk man off bus Watch Barack Obama wipe out in kite surfing battle McConnell blocks Warren from reading letter from MLK's wife Footage shows hostile environment that Alexander Blackman endured Melissa McCarthy nails screeching Sean Spicer on SNL Danielle went viral after appearing on Dr Phil in 2016 Moment woman pops open her shirt by flexing her boobs Socialite Tara Palmer-Tomkinson, 45, dies at her London...

Mesa Threaded OpenGL Dispatch Finally Landing, Big Perf Win For Some Games Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 5 February 2017 at 09:37 PM EST. 53 Comments Four years ago Intel developers were working on a threaded OpenGL dispatch mechanism for Mesa, but it never ended up being merged. Now, prolific Mesa contributor and AMD developer Marek Olšák is looking to merge this code and clean it up. The "glthread" work started 4+ years ago by Intel to queue and execute OpenGL calls in a different CPU thread. This effort was designed to deal with higher CPU overhead of Mesa, but at the time it wasn't too helpful with the available Linux games of the time. The Mesa threading plan... Back in 2013, finally being realized in 2017. A few years later and the increasing number of demanding Linux games, Marek is looking to revive the "glthread" code and ship it in mainline Mesa. Several modern Linux games can now run better with this threaded OpenGL dispatch feature, such as Borderlands 2 is one game that's named for seeing much better performance. Borderlands 2 can be faster by around 70% in some cases, Marek has been working on the revised code on and off the past few months. Marek is planning to land this code soon into mainline Mesa and from there to clean it up and further enhance its abilities while in the Mesa Git code. This threaded GL dispatch mode is disabled by default but once it lands can be turned on via a drirc toggle (glthread) or environment variable. This will work with all Gallium3D drivers while Marek is leaving it to the Intel developers if they want to land the patches that would allow the support for their classic Mesa DRI driver. 53 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Intel powered the drones during Lady Gaga’s Super Bowl halftime show Posted Feb 5, 2017 by Matt Burns (@mjburnsy) 0 SHARES Next Story Keys to ascending the consumer-internet throne There were 300 drones dancing behind Lady Gaga during the Super Bowl halftime show. They’re called Shooting Stars and were previously used in a holiday show at Disney World. These hundreds of Shooting Star drones flash, fall and flock in unison and are all controlled by one person — or rather one computer. This is the latest project in Intel’s quest to take drones from individuals to fleets. This is Ender’s Game brought to life. Just as in Orson Scott Card’s book, one person commands the group, sending instructions and monitoring the drones’ health. And Intel says its limitless in its scale, able to control more than 10,000 drones at a time. One of the secret to Intel’s Shooting Star program is a desktop software suite of programs. The drones’ routes are pre-programmed and each drone does its own thing. The drones do not talk to each other and they lack the hardware to detect collisions. The software determines routes that eliminates collisions. The drones are simple. They’re about the weight of a volleyball. The housing is Styrofoam and there are simple metal cages around the four props. They are designed to be assembled in less than 15 minutes and Intel builds the drones in a facility in Germany. There are no screws and everything snaps together. And then on the bottom of the drone is the large, multicolored LED light that paints the sky. intel-shooting-star-4-of-4 intel-shooting-star-5-of-4 intel-shooting-star-3-of-4 intel-shooting-star-2-of-2  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Intel turned to Disney to first showcase the technology and in December I got a behind the scenes look at the program prior to its first show. The show itself is neat, as everyone who watched the Super Bowl saw, but the most impressive part wasn’t broadcasted on TV. The drones take off from launchpads like fireflies. Several drones sit an inch apart on each launchpad. The Shooting Star drones rest in divots designed to cup the round LED housing, which also features the charging contacts for the drones. And they take off, en masse. One after another, seemingly randomly throughout the cluster of launchpads. A quick moment separates each launch as the drones take their position in the air prior to the show. At the Disney show, Intel had twice the amount of drones on site and ready to fly resulting in 600 drones sitting on these launchpads. The software determines which drones are best charged and ready for flight. Intel has been working on this program for the past two years. In late 2015 Intel partnered with small group of artists and technology researchers at Ars Electronica Futurelab in Linz, Austria, and sent 100 drones into the air. Four pilots controlled the 100 drones, that launched from four different airfields. Then in late 2016, prior to the first show at Disney World, Intel demonstrated a new generation of the platform, launching 500 drones at once. Intel envisions a future where drones fly in fleets to accomplish tasks. The same software that Intel and Disney are using to put on a colorful aerial show could be used in search and rescue operations or inspecting equipment and goods. Imagine a squadron of several drones using scanning software — like Intel’s RealSense platform — to inspect an airplane or water tower. Or a force of these drones creating a floating LED screen. But right now the drones are simply flying backup dancers.

Intel Drones supplied Lady Gaga and the NFL with a show-stopping show-starter — 300 Shooting Star drones painting the night sky in a pre-recorded segment in Houston, as she sang “God Bless America.” The closing scene with the Pepsi logo also was those same pre-recorded drones. For The Win spoke to two of Intel Drones’ top people — general manager Natalie Cheung, who was on the ground in Houston running things, and vice president of business Anil Nanduri, who organized the collaboration — about the show and the future of drones in entertainment. Let Cheung and Nanduri answer all your questions now that you’ve seen their work in action. So how did this happen? Intel filmed the drone shoot over several days, with the main shoot — the one we saw — done on Jan. 30. There were reports of low-flying helicopters as part of security in Houston, but that was only part of the story. The top-secret drone usage was the other. “We were on site for nine days, so we got the proper waivers to fly in Class C airspace up to 700 feet,” Cheung said. “We got the waivers to do this at night with multiple drones per pilot through the FAA. We were testing out our drones, tweaking our animations throughout this whole process, and we filmed for one night, and it was perfect.” Our drones have returned to the ground after an amazing #PepsiHalftime show #ExperienceMore pic.twitter.com/Augpbt05u6 — Intel (@intel) February 6, 2017 The setup was not so quick, but it all came together once the right people got to talking. “We worked a lot with the (NFL’s) creative team,” she said. “You can see there’s a lot of different stakeholders in this. We worked with NFL, Pepsi, Lady Gaga. She was very aware with what was happening with the story board from the very get-go, so it was a very constructive and very tight collaboration.” Why couldn’t it be done live? “So there’s a lot of weather and environment (issues),” Cheung said. “In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl day. We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team as well as the Super Bowl creative team felt this would be best to be filmed. Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium.” But Nanduri was quick to dismiss any thought that this couldn’t be a live show. “When we talked about Super Bowl, the primary weather issue was if they closed the dome,” he said. “If I had to simplify it, if you can do fireworks because of weather, so can our drones. … We’ve never had a situation where we can’t fly. The shooting star drone is water-resistant. It can handle light rain. It can handle a decent amount of wind — 8 meters per second, which is pretty decent wind speed.” What is the end goal here? Cheung explained, “It’s a different way of merging art and technology, which I think a lot of people haven’t seen. We started this effort maybe a year and a half ago, and it started with 100 drones in the sky and showed a simple Intel logo. We caught on pretty quickly that this was more than just fireworks. It could be branding in the sky. It could be an artistic event. There’s a lot of different ways that people could utilize this. The Disney team we worked with used it as a theme park attraction. The Super Bowl team utilized it as a way to emphasize and express Lady Gaga’s music. … It can create and mean many different things.” And Nanduri brought up the Guinness Book of World Records showcase as an example that led to this opportunity — and many more in the future. “When we did the Guinness Book of World Records, the 500 drones, that was a huge viral phenomenon, and we had already started to fly at Disney, which was another uptick of what the light shows are all about. In that process, I think there was an awareness created, especially to the creative agencies around the world, what a canvas in the sky that they can now paint with lights could be as a value-add to their experience.” Don’t be surprised, then if you see Fourth of July shows and other holiday spectaculars using drones more and more. So are we pretty much talking about robot fireworks? No, but sort of. “It’s not exactly fireworks,” Cheung said, citing the speed — 30 minutes for a single animation — and repeatability of the show. They’ve been used at Disney, too, where they were deployed in a similar method to nightly … fireworks shows. “There’s a good comparison of drones and fireworks, Nanduri said. “There’s a couple aspects of fundamental difference, though. With drones, I like to think of it as painting a canvas in the sky. You have the flexibility of creating animations, creating logos, creating storytelling. With the comparison to fireworks, yes, (both) can create a lot of formations, a lot of excitement — but it’s green. It’s reusable. No pollution. There’s a fundamental difference in precision and a difference of solving pollution and other issues with fireworks, and the last part is it’s reusable. Of course, you don’t get the boom of fireworks.” Drones! I’m still kind of weirded out by this … Nanduri: “With the notion of drones and the perception of the public, I think light shows are one good way to bring that perception back to (what a drone really is). … If I had to go back a year or two and look at what the perception of drones was then, I start to see a lot friendlier use of the term. You see the industries using the term as well. They’re more comfortable. And we look at light shows as … re-emphasizing that drones can be used in so many different ways.” Cheung: “Intel’s changing the perception and definition of drones here. No one ever thought that a drone could create such a beautiful art show and such an amazing experience for nighttime entertainment. It’s not something that we’re redefining the definition of a drone. You can see them being used in commercial applications. But when we talk about drones now, people get excited. They see it as a light in the sky.” More Super Bowl!

Though they still cooperate from time to time, they have since viewed each other as competitors. The rivalry is about to heat up this year now that Intel is planning to launch an advanced 2-in-1 laptop hybrid that will likely be a strong opponent for Microsoft’s Surface Pro 5.  The Leaker disclosed this weekend that Intel has already patented an electronic device with detachable display. The sound of detachable display alone is enough to tell us that Intel is going after the market that the Surface and Surface Pro lines have established. Interestingly, Intel clearly wants to lure more consumers to its laptop hybrid that’s why it is using a curved display — something that Microsoft has yet to try with its Surface devices.  The illustration in the patent shows a very similar configuration to that of Microsoft’s Surface Pro devices. The only thing that separates it from the latter is the curvaceous display and the keyboard that’s designed to complement the form factor of the screen. The Leaker noted that Intel could be going for curved displays because the technology is pretty common among television systems and PC monitors lately.  Related Stories Rumored Windows 10 Cloud To Rival Chrome OS? Why The NFL Uses The Microsoft Surface Pro During Games Microsoft Surface Phone Might Be Foldable 2-In-1 Other renders emphasized how the curved 2-in-1 has a unique look compared to other mainstream hybrid laptops on the market. The keyboard is also depicted to be just as thick as the display, so it is being speculated that it will contain another battery, a separate storage space and another processing unit. Since this is going to be Intel’s first entry into the 2-in-1 market, the company will likely use its next-generation processors to give it distinction from other hybrids out there. There isn't any clue yet on when can consumers expect Intel's laptop hybrid to arrive. Meanwhile, there are numerous rumors surrounding Microsoft’s upcoming Surface Pro 4 successor. Aside from giving the device a decent specs upgrade, it is also expected to come with Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor. The screen is rumored to have 4K resolution. A previously leaked patent also hinted at a rechargeable Surface Pen. According to Alphr, Microsoft will most likely launch the Surface Pro 5 this April.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

 Lady Gaga's jump from the top of the Super Bowl stadium was actually an edited illusion Paul Schrodt Feb. 7, 2017, 9:56 AM 86,796 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Lady Gaga seemed to fly seamlessly from the top of NRG Stadium in Houston to a platform below during her stunning Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday. But it turns out the drop from the top of NRG was actually a prerecorded stunt. USA Today spoke to two top people at Intel Drones — which provided the drones in the sky behind Gaga that displayed the US flag and the Pepsi logo — who confirmed that her stunt was done in advance. The Intel sources said the opening jump was filmed ahead of time because of "weather and environment" issues. Basically, if it had rained during the Super Bowl, the roof of the stadium where Gaga was standing would have been closed. While the drones still could have operated, they said, Gaga couldn't have flown down from a closed stadium roof. But Gaga did drop from the top of NRG Stadium in the prerecorded bit and didn't use a stunt double, so we can still be impressed. Clever editing made it appear both at home and on the jumbotrons at the stadium that Gaga's drop from the top of the stadium led directly to her flight on cables in the middle of the stadium. But on Sunday, Gaga started from a lower point, as you can see in this video from TMZ and another video from inside the stadium: Lady Gaga started her live descent at the Super Bowl from a lower point in the stadium. Her jump from the top was prerecorded. TMZ LADY.

The device’s new Touch Bar wowed, whereas its price for the parts inside certainly did not. Just four months since that tumultuous release, reports and rumors of what Apple’s MacBook Pro 2017 follow-up will be like have surfaced, and all signs point to better parts for the price. However, there is also so much that we don’t know, so check back on this space every once in a while, as we’ll be updating it with the latest regarding the would-be 2017 MacBook Pro. Cut to the chase What is it? The new MacBook Pro’s successor When is it out? Anywhere between spring and fall 2017 What will it cost? Likely as much as – if not more than – current models Anticipate seeing the Touch Bar on the next MacBook Pro models MacBook Pro 2017 release date Sadly, this is one of the facets to the new MacBook Pro story that we know very little about. The closest thing to an idea is a report from famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that the next MacBook Pro models will go into production in Q3 2017, so around July. That would logically place the new MacBook Pro in an October 2017 release window, which would make a whole lot of sense considering when the updated MacBook Pro released in 2016. (Hint: it was in October.) However, Apple has debuted new MacBooks in the past during the months of March and April as well as during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in early June. Without an alluring email invitation from Apple, anything is possible. MacBook Pro 2017 price Considering the backlash to the price hike we saw coming from the generation of MacBook Pro’s into the current one, we wouldn’t expect to see major changes in MacBook Pro pricing. Of course, we wouldn’t anticipate them coming down in price by comparison. That would just be ludicrous. So, it would be safe to expect the next line of MacBook Pro models to start at $1,499, £1,449 or AU$2,199 – starting with the lowest-power, non-Touch 13-inch model – and top out around $2,799, £2.699 or AU$4,249 for the highest-end, 15-inch model with Touch Bar. Then again, Apple has a way of introducing new, exciting features to dull the blow of an increased price, if last year is any indication. In this age of Apple, be prepared for a wild, new feature that could potentially drive the price up. The 2016 MacBook Pro in an exploded view (Image: © iFixit) MacBook Pro 2017 specs Probably the biggest point of discussion regarding the new MacBook Pro is what Apple will choose to place inside. This is one of the most divisive points surrounding the current range of MacBook Pro’s and continues to be so as long as Apple continues its particular trend of price per part. The current line of MacBook Pro’s has been criticized for its low RAM, or memory, threshold of 16GB as well as its use of “dated” 6th generation (Skylake) Intel Core i-series processors. Naturally, the latest rumor surrounding the would-be new MacBook Pro is that it will contain both the latest, 7th generation ( Kaby Lake) Intel Core i-series chips as well as room for up to 32GB of RAM. These details were first brought to the public via the same aforementioned report in which Ming Chi-Kuo projected the release window for the new MacBook Pro’s. But since, evidence of these Kaby Lake-equipped models has allegedly appeared within the code of the macOS Sierra 10.12.4 beta – the one currently underway, as of this writing. Further to this scuttlebutt regarding what will be inside the new MacBook Pro’s is a Bloomberg report citing sources with claims that Apple is working on its very own Mac processor to work in tandem with Intel chips for future Mac products.  According to the report, this chip will be a logical extension of the ARM-based T1 processor currently used to power the new MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar. This chip would reportedly take on more power management tasks that Intel's processors currently handle, with the goal of increasing battery life. For starters, we'd like to see even sharper screens MacBook Pro 2017: what we want to see Beyond these reports, we know little else about what the new MacBook Pro will be capable of. Of course, we’ve drafted up a brief wish list for Apple’s next pro-bent laptop. Longer battery life This is no doubt low-hanging fruit, but being one of the primary complaints lobbed toward Apple for the MacBook Pro’s of today, we couldn’t help ourselves. After all, Apple once prided itself on the longevity of its laptops. And, the firm has quite a lot going for it in this direction. Between rumors of more power-efficient Kaby Lake processors inside and those of a special power management chip, longer battery life should be in the bag for the new MacBook Pro. Sharper screens Apple no doubt spurred the obsession with screen resolution in all consumer electronics once it unleashed its “Retina” screen standard years ago with the iPhone 4. But, the rest of the technology world has at last caught up to the firm’s screen sharpness. Frankly, in computing, Apple’s Retina display was surpassed years ago, and it’s about time that its standards for “Retina” were updated. Especially for the price, the new MacBook Pro’s should come sporting 3,200 x 1,800 QHD+ displays at least – and that’s at 13.3 inches. Naturally, what we’ll see is some incredibly particular resolution that hovers around industry standards but doesn’t get too close. Jokes aside, it’s time for sharper MacBook Pro screens. More (and more varied) ports Throwing a glut of Thunderbolt 3 ports, while impressive, at a laptop doesn’t solve the users’ problem of not having compatible connectors or accessories to use them with. To that end, we need to see either more variety in the ports that the new MacBook Pro offers or for Apple to include more adapters in the box. Professional users need to be bridged between where they are technologically right now and where a creator like Apple envisions them being in the next few years. At the very least, a few more USB-C adapters would go a long way. These are the best laptops that the new MacBook Pro is up against Tags MacBook Pro ABOUT THE AUTHOR Joe Osborne Joe has worked in games and technology media for nearly a decade for several publications.

Intel Linux Graphics Stack Certified for OpenGL 4.5, OpenGL ES 3.2 & Vulkan 1.0 GO Supports Khronos' 3D industry-defined 3D graphics APIs Feb 7, 2017 22:54 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Intel's Imad Sousou has proudly announced that the open-source Intel Graphics Stack for Linux is now fully certified for the latest Khronos 3D industry-defined 3D graphics APIs, which include OpenGL 4.5, OpenGL ES 3.2, and Vulkan 1.0. Intel currently provides the Linux community with industry-leading open source 3D graphics drivers for various GNU/Linux distributions, supporting all the Intel graphics platforms that have been released in the past ten years. These are usually integrated into all popular Linux OSes, including Ubuntu and Google's Chrome OS for Chromebooks. Khronos Group, the non-profit organization chartered to promote the deployment and development of open standard APIs, which are known for bringing us the powerful Vulkan API for the next-generation 3D graphics in games, have announced last week the OpenGL 4.5 certification for three generations of Intel Core graphics platforms. OpenGL 4.5 is the most advanced version of the widely-used 3D graphics API and introduces numerous enhancements and new security features. Intel Haswell GPUs already received OpenGL 4.5 support in the Mesa 3D Graphics Library stack for the open-source Intel 3D graphics driver, which are fully certified and integrated into Intel's Clear Linux operating system for Intel Architecture and Android IA. "I would like to acknowledge our industry partners who closely collaborate with us to deliver our graphics drivers on a wide variety of Linux-based operating systems," said Imad Sousou, Vice President and General Manager of Intel Open Source Technology Center. "I would also like to thank the large community of volunteers and enthusiasts who support our efforts in delivering dependable, high-quality graphics drivers." Latest Intel open source 3D graphics drivers coming soon to a distro near you In the press announcement, Intel promises that its now fully-certified open source Intel 3D graphics drivers for OpenGL 4.5, OpenGL ES 3.2, and Vulkan 1.0 APIs are coming soon to a distro near you. The company says that they will be integrated into upcoming major releases of the Chrome OS on Intel-based Chromebooks featuring the Google Play Store, as well as SteamOS operating systems. Of course, you can also download the latest Intel Graphics Stack for Linux from Intel. Plese note that OpenGL ES 3.2 is currently supported on the Intel i965 driver for Gen9 Intel Skylake and later graphics platforms. The Intel Graphics Stack for Linux currently supports Mesa 13.0 3D Graphics Library, X.Org Server 1.19.0 display server, and Linux kernel 4.8.11. #Intel Graphics Stack#OpenGL 4.5#OpenGL ES 3.2#Vulkan 1.0#Linux graphics subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Univention Corporate Server 4.2 Enters Development Based on Debian 8 & Linux 4.9 Mesa 17 3D Graphics Library Could Land by the End of the Week, RC3 Is Out Now Kurdish Hacker Posts Anti-ISIS Message on openSUSE's Website, Data Remains Safe KDE Plasma 5.9 Desktop Environment Gets First Point Release, over 60 Bugs Fixed Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One Microsoft Teases New Windows 10 Security Announcements Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux    Intel Graphics Stack for Linux New Linux Apps FFmpeg: The leading audio/video codec library for all Linux and UNIX-like operating systems Linux Kernel: The core of the Linux operating systems, created and maintained by Linus Torvalds antiX MEPIS: An unofficial derivative of the MEPIS Linux operating system, based on Debian GNU/Linux Elive: A Live CD based on Debian and designed to demonstrate the functionality of Enlightenment Calibre: A graphical ebook library management software compatible with many devices and platforms exGENT: A free Gentoo based Linux operating system for 32-/64-bit architectures, featuring LXDE and Xfce Linux Kernel: What you are about to download is the core of all the Linux operating systems in the world Reader comments Civilization VI Launches for Linux & SteamOS, AMD GPUs Not Officially Supported more on: Civilization VI i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Mesa 17 3D Graphics Library Could Land by the End of the Week, RC3 Is Out Now GO Will implement OpenGL 4.5 support on Intel Haswell Feb 7, 2017 22:11 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Collabora's Emil Velikov announced the availability of the third RC (Release Candidate) development snapshot of the upcoming Mesa 17.0.0 3D Graphics Library for GNU/Linux distributions. The Mesa 17.0.0 RC3 milestone comes two weeks after the release of the second RC build, and it brings numerous improvements across all the supported graphics drivers included in the stack. According to the release notes, a total of 66 changes have been implemented in this third, and probably the last Release Candidate. "The third release candidate for Mesa 17.0.0 is now available. Note that we have a couple of issues that I'd like to see fixed. If those are [to] be sorted by this Friday the final release will be out, regardless," said Emil Velikov, Software Release Engineer at Collabora, in the mailing list announcement. Mesa 17.0.0 3D Graphics Library will bring major changes We already talked here about the upcoming features of the major Mesa 17.0.0 3D Graphics Library release, which include OpenGL 4.5 support for Intel Haswell graphics cards, as well as many other enhancements for the Intel ANV and Radeon RADV Vulkan drivers, which translates into a better gaming experience for Intel and AMD Radeon users. As Collabora's Emil Velikov noted above, if those last remaining blockers are fixed this week, we should be able to get our hands on the final Mesa 17 packages by the end of the week, and it won't be long until they also land in the stable software repositories of your favorite GNU/Linux operating systems. Mesa 17 will be available in the coming weeks in popular rolling distributions like Arch Linux, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Solus, and others that offer users up-to-date technologies, but it will take a while until it lands in the Ubuntu repos, which still use Mesa packages from the Mesa 12.0 series. For now, Ubuntu is still the recommended platform on Steam, along with Valve's SteamOS, so unless Canonical's developers don't keep up with the development of the Mesa 3D Graphics Library, you'll have to rely on third-party PPAs that offer you stable Mesa 17 updates or bleeding-edge daily builds. Early adopters can download the Mesa 17.0.0 Release Candidate 3 tarball right now from our website if they want to take it for a test drive on their GNU/Linux distributions. However, please try to keep in mind that this is a pre-release version, which shouldn't be installed on a production machine. #Mesa 17.0.0 RC3#Mesa 17#Mesa 3D Graphics Library#Mesa 17 Release Candidate 3#Linux graphics subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Kurdish Hacker Posts Anti-ISIS Message on openSUSE's Website, Data Remains Safe KDE Plasma 5.9 Desktop Environment Gets First Point Release, over 60 Bugs Fixed New CloudLinux 7 Kernel Released to Beta with Fix for "Kernel Panic" Issue, More DiRT Rally on Linux to Support AMD Radeon GPUs with Mesa 13.0.2, Nvidia Cards Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One Microsoft Teases New Windows 10 Security Announcements Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux    Mesa 17.0.0 RC3 released New Linux Apps FFmpeg: The leading audio/video codec library for all Linux and UNIX-like operating systems Linux Kernel: The core of the Linux operating systems, created and maintained by Linus Torvalds antiX MEPIS: An unofficial derivative of the MEPIS Linux operating system, based on Debian GNU/Linux Elive: A Live CD based on Debian and designed to demonstrate the functionality of Enlightenment Calibre: A graphical ebook library management software compatible with many devices and platforms exGENT: A free Gentoo based Linux operating system for 32-/64-bit architectures, featuring LXDE and Xfce Linux Kernel: What you are about to download is the core of all the Linux operating systems in the world Reader comments UBports Community Successfully Ports Canonical’s Ubuntu OS to the Fairphone 2 more on: Canonical i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Mwahaha Time to put these ol' ATI patents to use, mini-Chipzilla chuckles 7 Feb 2017 at 21:18, Shaun Nichols Advanced Micro Devices has accused a handful of companies of infringing patents it holds on graphics processor technology. The beleaguered designer of CPUs and GPUs claims that LG, Vizio, MediaTek and Sigma Designs have ripped off three rather generic-looking patents it has owned since it acquired ATI in 2006. AMD wants the United States International Trade Commission to investigate [PDF] its allegations, and ban the four from importing, selling and marketing any products that infringe the chip architect's designs. As well as dobbing the four into the commission, AMD has also launched civil lawsuits demanding damages and its legal bills paid: the Zen processor biz has sued LG [PDF], Vizio [PDF], and Sigma [PDF] in the Delaware US District Court, alleging patent infringement. It appears AMD hasn't yet dragged MediaTek into court. Two of the patents at the heart of this legal war were applied for in 2003 by ATI, and were granted several years later after AMD gobbled up the GPU outfit, while the third was applied for in 2011 after the merger. The three US patents describe general graphics processor operations, and they are: 7,633,506: Parallel pipeline graphics processing, granted in 2009. It defines a processor "back-end configured to receive primitives and combinations of primitives (i.e., geometry) and process the geometry to produce values to place in a frame buffer for eventual rendering on a screen. In one embodiment, the graphics system includes two parallel pipelines." 7,796,133: Unified shader for processing and displaying textures, granted in 2010. 8,760,454: Graphics processing architecture and unified shader, granted in 2014. It describes "a graphics processor that employs a unified shader that is capable of performing both the vertex operations and the pixel operations in a space saving and computationally efficient manner." All three, to El Reg, sound like technical descriptions for all modern GPUs. AMD reckons TVs, phones, gadgets and chips produced by the aforementioned four corporations are using its technology without permission – and, crucially, without any royalty checks being cut. "These common infringing graphics systems are generally available for purchase on the open market in the form of smartphones, tablets, smart watches, televisions, graphics processors, integrated circuits, and consumer products containing such components and systems," AMD says in its complaint to the trade commission, filed at the end of January. How much does AMD expect from its legal clash? While AMD does not say precisely how much it makes from licensing its technology, its intellectual property business is part of its larger Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom unit that turned a $283m profit from $2.3bn in sales last year. That was the rare bright spot in what has been an otherwise dismal financial year in which the Intel antitrust shield managed to lose $481m.

Kelly’s predecessor Jeh Johnson designated federal and state election and voting systems as critical infrastructure during the final days of the Obama administration despite objections from some state officials who worried about a federal power grab. Critical infrastructure is an official DHS designation that comprises 17 industry categories, including chemical and power plants, transportation systems and dams. » Get the best federal technology news and ideas delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here. Johnson’s move came days after then-President Barack Obama imposed additional sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies and officials for hacking Democratic political organizations in an effort to aid the electoral chances of President Donald Trump and to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “I believe we should help all of the states, provide them as much help as we can to make sure their systems are protected in future elections, so, I would argue that, yes, we should keep that in place,” Kelly said of the designation during a hearing on border security before the House Homeland Security Committee. That designation makes it easier for DHS to provide grants and other funds to state election systems to ward off physical and cyberattacks. Cyber experts from the U.S. and other nations have also endorsed a rule of the road for international cybersecurity that states critical infrastructure should be off limits from cyberattacks. Kelly was less bullish on the designation in advance of his confirmation, saying in a questionnaire that “the notion that DHS can or should exercise some degree of influence over state voting systems is highly controversial and appears to be a political question beyond the scope of DHS’ current legislative cyber mandates.” While U.S. officials have long feared a destructive cyberattack on critical infrastructure, only a few are known to have occurred, including the U.S.-linked Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear program, the Iran-linked attack on a Saudi oil company and the Russia-linked attack on Ukraine’s power grid. recommended for you Threatwatch Alert Payment device infection Arby’s Confirms Payments System Breach See threatwatch report ADD A COMMENT Data Analytics Can Improve DoD Decision Support Remove Cloud IT “Blind Spots” with Application Visibility Augmented Intelligence Requires Human Direction A-123 Aims to Strengthen Government with Enterprise Risk Management FROM OUR SPONSORS sponsored Get Smart.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Laptops The best 12-inch MacBook alternatives Emily FerronFebruary 8th, 2017 6 pictures New Atlas rounds up the best alternatives the the 2016 12-inch MacBookView gallery - 6 images The 12-inch MacBook is Apple's lightest and thinnest laptop – it also has its smallest display, only one USB-C port and a starting price of US$1,299. Before you take the plunge, what are your other options? New Atlas has rounded up a few. Asus Zenbook 3 With its sleek stylish chassis, 12.5-inch display and yes, a single USB-C port, the Asus Zenbook 3 is clearly angling itself as a MacBook competitor. Depending on what you're looking for, it does have a few advantages. Most notably, it packs in significant processing power. It uses the latest seventh-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, as opposed to the MacBook's more modest (but still capable) dual core m3, m5 or m7 chips. It also packs in 512 GB of flash storage, 8 GB or 16 GB of RAM, as well as impressive-sounding speakers. It also comes with a splitter accessory that plugs into your USB-C port and converts it into a USB-C, HDMI out and a legacy USB 3.0 port. Of course, the Zenbook is a Windows 10 device, which could be a benefit or a disadvantage depending on your feelings about macOS. It also has relatively poor battery life and a slightly lower resolution display. Starting price is $999 for the i5/8GB RAM version, or $1,599 for the version sporting an i7 chip and 16 GB of RAM. MacBook Air When it was introduced, the MacBook Air was Apple's ultra-slim laptop with a greater focus on luxury than functionality. Now that the 12-inch MacBook has overtaken the compact title, you could think of the MacBook Air as a slightly larger, older option with some more user-friendly details. MacBook Air has a 13.3-inch display, but at 1,440 x 900, it's lower resolution than the MacBook. As the oldest laptop in Apple's current lineup, it lacks some recent updates – but that could be a good thing. It still has a hinged trackpad as opposed to the newer solid state Force Touch models, but it's also one of the last MacBooks with a dedicated MagSafe charging port and legacy USB 3.0 ports (it has Thunderbolt/USB-C x 2 and USB3 x 2). Although it still has fifth-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors, it can be configured with additional RAM and storage so as to be very forward-friendly, without driving you crazy with dongles in the process. MacBook Air starts at $999. Huawei Matebook It seems strange to think of an accessorized Windows-10 running tablet (coming from a Chinese manufacturer little known in the US) as an alternative to an Apple laptop, but hear us out. The sleek 12-inch tablet has several features in common with the MacBook in a convertible form factor. If you add on Huawei's keyboard cover and MatePen, the Huawei Matebook tablet becomes a super portable 2-in-1 that stands in well for a laptop in many situations. Its m3/m5 processor options aren't as powerful as some other desktop-running tablets, but they rival the MacBook's. This spec comparison shows a more direct side-by-side look at the two machines. Of course, you can also use the tablet alone, which is a nice feature if you want a truly versatile machine. Take note, however, that the type cover – which props up the tablet in laptop mode – has only two positions and can be flimsy. It doesn't have the 360-degree movement of higher-end 2-in-1s. Huawei Matebook starts at $699 for just the tablet; the MatePen stylus is an additional $59, while the keyboard cover is $129. Buy Huawei Matebook on Amazon Microsoft Surface Pro 4 If the MateBook's tablet-into-laptop form factor caught your eye, but you want something slightly more heavy-duty, check out the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. Its entry-level processor is Intel core m3, but (unless you really care about the silence of a fanless machine) we recommend the i5-sporting variant for its processing boost. The Surface Pro 4 comes with the pressure-sensitive Surface Pen; the keyboard cover is sold separately. For both the tablet and the keyboard, the m3 variant starts at $1,030 while the i5 version starts at $1,130. The Surface Pro 4 also has a lone USB port, but it's a legacy USB 3.0 port and not the newer USB-C. It also sports a microSD slot and mini DisplayPort. Its 2,736 x 1,824, 12.3-inch display is slightly more pixel dense than that of the MacBook. We do expect Microsoft to release the Surface Pro 5 (or its equivalent) sometime in the first part of 2017. It could be worth seeing what the new generation brings. Even if you don't end up purchasing the latest edition, its release will likely drive down the price of the Surface Pro 4. Buy Microsoft Surface Pro 4 on Amazon 13-inch MacBook Pro (non-Touch Bar) Paying just $200 more will get you the latest 13.3-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar, and it's worth considering. It offers the latest Apple tech, sans the debatable Touch Bar and its associated price hike. The MacBook Pro is heftier than the MacBook, but as you can see, this is still a slim device with the same characteristic Apple unibody. There are many spec and build similarities, but the MacBook Pro's main advantages are a larger display, much faster i5 processor, one more USB-C port and a higher resolution webcam. You may have noticed we included both Apple laptops and Windows 2-in-1s, but not the iPad Pro, Apple's only offering that could qualify as a 2-in-1. Because the iPad Pro is a strictly mobile machine that runs iOS 10 instead of macOS, we don't consider it a true laptop alternative. If you want to investigate this option, check out our iPad Pro (12.9-in) review and roundup of alternatives. If you're still deciding about the 12-inch MacBook, refresh yourself with New Atlas' review of the 2015 model. We've also summarized the 2016 edition's incremental upgrades.View gallery - 6 images The best 12-inch MacBook alternatives 1 / 6 Tags #Asus #Laptop #Apple Share this article Post a comment   Over 255,000 people receive our email newsletter See the stories that matter in your inbox every morning Your Email Top stories Harley-Davidson’s Road King Special gets the bagger treatment Three new uranium-rich minerals unearthed in Utah LG Watch Sport vs. Samsung Gear S3 Walking robot takes first steps into the market Recommended for you Latest in Laptops The best MacBook Air alternatives The best 12-inch MacBook alternatives Review: Asus Zenbook 3 is an ultra-portable mini powerhouse The best Microsoft Surface Book alternatives The best MacBook Pro (2016) alternatives Dell's latest laptops are built to survive the classroom Samsung Notebook 9 vs. Apple MacBook Pro (13-inch) 12-inch MacBook case would add ports, power, protection Hands-on: An accessory that gives the MacBook Air a touchscreen Hands-on with the updated Gram, LG's light and capable laptop Hands-on with Samsung’s Chromebook 2-in-1 and fleet of 2017 laptops Dell's new laptop leaves the power cord in the past Editors Choice How do you solve fake news problem in the post-truth era?

At least 127 United States companies -- including Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Intel and other tech giants -- filed a friend of the court brief in a lawsuit the state of Washington brought against President Trump, which argues that his executive order to halt the entry of refugees and all travelers from seven Muslim nations would inflict significant harm on U. S. businesses. The brief, filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, asks the court to consider the disruptive impact that the ban would have on the conduct of business in the U.S. "The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for U.S. companies to recruit, hire and retain some of the world's best employees," the brief states. "It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business and investment to the U.S." The signatories include a number of major non-technology companies as well, among them Levi Strauss & Co. and Chobani Global Holdings. The executive order is antithetical to everything Levi Strauss -- itself founded by an immigrant -- stands for, said CEO Chip Bergh in an online post last week. Restraining Order in Place The companies filed the brief just days after a U.S. District Court judge in Seattle imposed a temporary restraining order on the executive order. President Trump signed it on Jan. 27, temporarily blocking any incoming travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations in the Middle East and Africa, and also suspending the government's Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days. The order includes an exception for those facing persecution as members of a minority religion should the program resume. The countries involved all have predominantly Muslim populations. A DoJ request for an emergency stay of the TRO later was denied, and a number of airlines announced they would allow visa holders to resume travel to the U.S. while the legal case moved through the court system. The DoJ was filed another brief Monday evening, arguing that the executive order is lawful and in the national interest. "We'll decline to comment beyond our public filings," Peter Carr, a spokesperson for the Department of Justice, told the E-Commerce Times. Supporters Line Up A coalition of 16 state attorneys general, including those representing Iowa and Pennsylvania, which Trump carried in the presidential election, filed a brief in support of the Washington state and Minnesota cases against the Trump administration. Their brief argues that the executive order has had a direct impact on foreign students, researchers and faculty at a number of local colleges and universities; has disrupted state medical institutions; and has caused the states to lose tax revenue from students, tourists and business travelers. Iran, one of the countries subject to the temporary travel ban, sent more than 11,000 students to the U.S. during the 2014-15 academic year, the brief notes. Silicon Valley officials have expressed major concerns about Trump's immigration policy -- and his tweets -- since early in the campaign, as the technology industry depends heavily on H-1B visa holders for many of its professional class of engineers and programming talent. "The Internet may be wonderful for daily communication, but eventually all sectors need face-to-face meetings," noted Amie Stepanovich, U.S. policy manager at AccessNow. "This travel ban will not only undermine business, but it will harm the growth of all international movements," she told the E-Commerce Times. Billions in Business Deals at Risk The order created turmoil at airports across the country late last month, as more than 100 travelers were removed from airplanes, detained, or otherwise disrupted due to the ban. More than 100,000 visas were revoked in the aftermath of the ban. Major technology companies, including Google, and other firms saw major disruptions of travel that impacted workers attempting to return home from overseas. Some of the companies' employees who worked on government visas reportedly were not allowed entry. The order could result in the loss of major business deals, the companies maintain. For example, U.S. diplomats have warned that General Electric may lose out on business deals in Iraq worth billions of dollars as a result of the order, according to a Feb. 1 story in Politico. Further, the ban could force foreign companies to grow their operations outside the U.S., and U.S. companies to staff their operations outside of the U.S., they argue. High-Tech Holdouts Although many high-profile tech companies have joined in the court battle, some have remained on the sidelines, noted Derecka Mehrens, cofounder of Silicon Valley Rising. "We hope tech will continue to resist attacks on all immigrant workers, including the largely Latino army of service workers who cook, clean and protect their campuses," she told the E-Commerce Times. "However we were disappointed to see that some of the core tech companies -- such as Dell, HP, Tesla and Oracle -- didn't sign onto the brief. These companies must recognize how integral immigrants are to their success and to a strong economy," Mehrens added. "HPE shares the technology industry's serious concerns about the travel ban," the company said in a statement provided to the E-Commerce Times on Monday by spokesperson Kate Holderness. "In the coming days, and through public means, we'll be adding our voice to the efforts of other companies and industry associations that have expressed similar concerns." HPE currently is not a signatory to the brief, but HP Inc. added its name on Monday. Tesla also joined the brief on Monday. Headed for the High Court The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to hear arguments in the case Tuesday afternoon. "It's relatively difficult to predict how the [court] will rule, but since the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals is in the heart of the technology industry, they often rule in support of the technology companies," noted Peter Vogel, a partner in the Gardere law firm. "Nonetheless, it seems likely that no matter what happens in the [appellate court], the final decision will be made by the U.S. Supreme Court," he told the E-Commerce Times. "Given the separation of the judicial, executive and legislative branches," Vogel said, "it is entirely possible the U.S. Supreme Court will be mindful of all amicus briefs and the social impact of the immigration ban."

Apple blog Pike’s Universum has discovered (via MacRumors) three motherboard identifiers that don’t correspond to any current MacBook Pro model, but also have the same power management data as the current 13 and 15-inch MacBook Pros. The plist file does not exist in prior versions of macOS. An update to the MacBook Pro will more than likely be sporting Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, which is the natural successor to the Skylake processor in the Late 2016 MacBook Pros. This would fall in line with another report several weeks back suggesting that the 2017 refresh will come with minor spec bumps. Mac-B4831CEBD52A0C4C would likely be for two new 13-inch MacBook Pro models with function keys. The models would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3400 MHz and 4000 MHz respectively. Mac-CAD6701F7CEA0921 would likely be for three new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. These notebooks would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3500/3700 MHz and 4000 MHz respectively. Mac-551B86E5744E2388 would likely be for three new 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. These notebooks would likely have Kaby Lake processors with a maximum Turbo Boost of 3800/3900 MHz and 4100 MHz respectively. The report says that according to performance numbers, it’s not possible that these boards will be used for any desktop Macs including the iMac and Mac Pro. There is also no details regarding the GPU chipset yet. Cross-referencing Intel’s current Kaby Lake processor lineup, the blog was able to determine that these processor will indeed be used in the next MacBook Pro. 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6360U 2.0 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.1 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7260U 2.2GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) Intel Core i7-6660U 2.4 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.4 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 540 (15W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7660U 2.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 640 (15W) 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i5-6267U 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.3 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7267U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i5-6287U 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i5-7287U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.7 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) Intel Core i7-6567U 3.3 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Graphics 550 (28W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7567U 3.5 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.0 GHz) with Intel® Iris™ Plus Graphics 650 (28W) 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.5 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7700HQ 2.8 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6820HQ 2.7 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.6 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7820HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.9 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) Intel Core i7-6920HQ 2.9 GHz (max Turbo Boost 3.8 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 530 (45W) Will be replaced by the: Intel Core i7-7920HQ 3.1 GHz (max Turbo Boost 4.1 GHz) with Intel® HD Graphics 630 (45W) It’s highly unlikely that Apple would release the new machines while macOS 10.12.4 is still in beta. The release is expected to drop sometime in late-February or March. However, with the Late 2016 MacBook Pro being fairly new, it’s more likely that Apple will wait until WWDC 2017 in June to release new MacBook Pros, if not later.

View Latest Posts >>> The Debate – Trump Iran Policy By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on February 7, 2017 ___________ by Jim W. Dean, VT Editor,   … with Press TV, Tehran Netanyahu with his American defense minister [ Editor’s Note: It’s always a pleasure to be on The Debate show with Larry Korb as I don’t have to listen to the silly activists grandstanding comments that they feel elevates their careers. I prefer “the grownups”, even if we disagree on some issues. Larry is also ten years my senior and I hope to be going as strong as he still is at 77. I had been waiting for Trump to pick his Iran club back up, but must say I was surprised with this “Iran is the biggest exporter of terror” silliness. I cannot believe that he actually got briefed on this really being the case. The Donald was working for Israel on this one, not the American people. We don’t have a soul among our extensive Intel community contacts that really believe this. They are long used to sham threats like this being trotted out to the public to soften them up for getting their pockets picked for defending America from manufactured threats. Business is booming on that now. The Iran case is a sad one as what we see missing in the context of the threat discussion is not a single word about how the G5+1 Iran agreement exposed that the claims of Iran’s secret nuclear weapons program had always been a complete hoax. All the Iran haters in Congress who had had top level briefings confirming that claim could have gone public to kill the deal, or leaked it. Even Israel, who had claimed for over two decades that Iran was a year or two away from “da bomb”, could have killed the deal by putting their confirmed Intel on the table. It did not because it never had any. The world public not only got scammed on this, but there was no real outrage over the long term lie being proven. There was not even a whimper. Americans got hosed on Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons program So why should not the liars keep lying, as it appears there is no reputational risk to them whatsoever? And whose fault is that? Not a single institution that I am aware of made a big deal of the hoax being exposed, the problem I suspect was because Israel was involved so it was better to keep quiet. A people on its knees will never have any security, from either external threats, or the internal ones here at home. When is the last time the FBI broke up an Israeli espionage network here, when we know they are everywhere, in media, academics, the military, and in Congress? Will there ever be one? As long as we all go along with the elephant in the living room being ignored we will be part of the problem, like a substance abuser that has not been able to kick an addiction, despite the long term damage being done. Both the Alchoholics  and Narcotics Anonymous organizations will tell you that you can’t even begin to help a person who will not admit they have a serious problem. I wish I knew what the secret solution is to snap people out of their stupor, the organizations I mean. A lot of individual folks “get it”. We have always had them here at VT, and we have plenty among our extended network. But when it comes to institutional America, it is missing in action, and we all suffer that failure… JD ] ___________ – First published … February 06, 2017  – Broadcast date: 2.6.2107 By putting Iran “on notice,” the new U.S. administration is laying the groundwork for a more confrontational approach toward the Islamic Republic. Add to that sanctions, travel ban which includes Iran, and you have a recipe for tensions and friction adding up to confrontation. Russia and China don’t like it, so much that Russia has announced it will do its best to reduce tensions. In this debate, we’ll discuss why the US is setting up a confrontational approach with Iran.

FaceBook Comments 21 Responses to "The Debate – Trump Iran Policy" JohnZ  February 8, 2017 at 5:38 am Not one shred of evidence has ever been produced by the zio-cons or their puppets that Iran has nuclear weapons. Yet, the masses of Americans have been convinced Iran is ready to nuke israel. Such are the lies Bibi has been spewing for decades now, even though he has been wrong on every count the American people continue to believe this psychopath. Is it because of some protestant guilt over the holohoax? Yet, here we go again; No matter how much technical evidence that proves the war mongers wrong, it is simply ignored. Like Galileo trying to convince the Church of his findings, he was still threatened with death. To make matters even worse Drumpf has chose two of the worst for his defense team. Mad Dawg Mattis appears to be a psychopath who take great pleasure in slaughtering innocent people who can’t fight back and bishop Boykin, the religious whack job, right arm of John Hagee and Tim LaHaye. This is the person that scares me. No one is more dangerous to others and himself as well, that someone who claims to be some deity’s right hand. As someone who talks to this deity and claims he gets answers in return, the people of this nation should demand Boykin be removed to an asylum for the mentally ill where he can be given the appropriate treatment: heavy on the meds, straight jacket and possible lobotomy. Boykin should not be allowed to roam free among society much less be in any position of authority regarding the military. He is dangerously crazy.

How effing dare they even infer or refer to Hezbollah in the same breath as terrorists when we have eyes to see all truth unfolding and hearts recognize Hezbollah now on the very front lines with the tip of the spear in fighting the REAL terrorists it is up to us to rip the roots out of the backers and stagers of it …… Hezbollah are legitimate, sons of Lebanon ….those who seeks to rip out the very heart of Lebanon are not “Staging” and to falsely accuse, frame and blame is all part of it….Hezbollah not guilty in the Courts that matter the 1983 US Barracks 283 dead 1983 US Embassy +60 dead added to the same list as the USS Liberty ….. the real terrorists Log in to Reply ayelyahbenjamin  February 7, 2017 at 4:23 pm Iran is guilty only of coming to the aid her brothers and neighbours, her eyes are not set on greed or occupation of others lands Edward Longshanks  February 7, 2017 at 4:36 pm I think Hezbollah’s target Israel is wasted energy. They should bring war to Saudi-Arabia and Qatar, a more profitable target. Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  February 7, 2017 at 4:59 pm Edward, Hezbollah, like Iran, but in a different way, are totally on defense. Hezbollah’s missiles are for the next time Israel attacks Lebanon, and under international law they have a right to retaliate, and they will. They and Iran both know that not having a defense and a major retaliation capability reduces you to an elevated West Banker. That is how the West likes to deal with its adversaries, have them defenseless so they are easier for their respective hoodlums to rob. Only the biggies that can run up $20 trillion debts can do offense, and they use “threats” to get the hapless public to fund it. Look at Britain, broke as it is, a broken and badly in need of maintenance military, and it wants to put billions into new nuclear subs. It is beyond stupid for all those everybody but the ones that put the money in their pockets. bryguy  February 7, 2017 at 5:56 pm That’s a good point Jim, also quite logical when one thinks it through in regards to Hezballah’s capabilities. It’s also another strong reason as to why the US, Trump is determined to escalate with Iran, since the Israelis appear quite aware of Hezballah’s defensive capabilities after the 06 failed invasion. Israel knows Iranian weapons are backing Hezballah, through Syria which really does explain everything when one understands Israels expansionist desires. They can’t occupy Lebanon under the current situation. Taking away Hezballah’s defensive capabilities by eliminating it’s major supplier in Iran and it’s transit via the Bekka valley in Syria renders Lebanon defenseless. This reason alone, although there are other motivations, seems obvious to me why Trump and the US are escalating with Iran, on behalf of Israel, as per usual Edward Longshanks  February 7, 2017 at 8:41 pm Thank you, Jim, understood. About the British subs, if do you have someone with connections to the Frenchies, get their Submarine logs. It is many years ago, i read an article about the French subs. It seems that they use their subs in dealing with greater powers. They cruise at the mouth of the Delaware or in the Chinese Sea. JohnZ  February 8, 2017 at 5:43 am Regarding the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks, it has been determined a small tactical nuke was used. Not long ago I listened to Mike Harris and Gordon on Mike’s radio program and Mike also had a Russian expert on tracking nukes and how to spot them when they are used which has been dozens of times since WWII. The subject of the Marine barracks bombing was brought up and the Russian stated that a small nuke was used. So who was that supplied the nuke? You get three guesses and the first two don’t count. bryguy  February 8, 2017 at 9:50 am John, I remember reading about a US officer of some rank during the peace keeping mission the US was providing filing complaints against Israelis for I believe credible threats against their mission. The IDF was openly hostile against the US presence there in Lebanon. I also remember Imad Mughniyeh took a lot of the blame for that act…..not sure about any particular details though bryguy  February 7, 2017 at 3:31 pm Not much of a debate. If Trump continues along a path of war, along with this military advisers, I think he’ll lose a ton of support from his base. They’re sick of perpetual war, regardless if they understand the particulars that the US wages war on behalf of Israel. Log in to Reply bryguy  February 7, 2017 at 3:35 pm I real concern is that Trump, as you mentioned, has been using threatening rhetoric since his campaign in regards to Iran and terror. He has said repeatedly he will be tough, that the US has been weak and not respected. He’s boxed himself in with these silly testosterone laden statements to where he pretty much has guaranteed an escalation to war. That is the dangerous part. For all of Obama’s faults, he had the sense to hold that “red line” for example in Syria despite all of the threats and preparations for war when it was obvious Assad was being set up. Trump won’t hold back and that is indeed a dangerous reality Edward Longshanks  February 7, 2017 at 4:33 pm bryguy, i do not share this view, but i do not know the future. I think that Mr. Trump, as a former TV guy, knows very well the mood of his followers. I assume, he uses those speeches to produce reference points to balance the cowboys and the kippah-wearers. ht tp://arnoldzwicky.s3.amazonaws.com/WuerkerComplex.jpg bryguy  February 7, 2017 at 5:24 pm Edward, I think a lot of people that are with him on things like immigration would be against him on war with Iran. It’s my opinion and perhaps I’m giving people too much credit for independent thinking, but I suspect people are sick of wars and Iran would be a big one, especially with Russia involved. As you said, who knows the future Edward Longshanks  February 7, 2017 at 8:53 pm bryguy, the costs. As you said, Iran is not Iraq. And Jim said it, Trump underestimate politicians who rule the economy, and not the opposite. The Russians know exactly where their interests are. Attacking Iran will be never a good deal. And Trump needs every US$ for real economy and has nothing left for Bolshevik ideology. So, for me, war with Iran is not probable. Think about, if the US would have been able to do business with Iran, it would have been very profitable. The cowboys and the Bolshevik Kippah-wearers in your administration, denying a good Iran-policy are often either boneheads or insane psychopaths. bryguy  February 7, 2017 at 9:12 pm Edward, I agree with you, I think anyone would agree with you that attacking Iran would be a horrible idea. Doing business with Iran would be very profitable, as the Europeans are experiencing. That is logical, sensible but I am doubtful about it being probable. I see Israel, having their way with Trump. I wish it wasn’t so but I haven’t seen Trump in any way shape or form push them aside. He was all over Obama for the UN vote, for moving Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, pandering to AIPAC and more. The escalating words and threats with Iran is alarming as with his rhetoric, he is boxing himself into a situation where he forces himself to go through with it. Israel wants rid of Iran, as do the Saudis. We know this. Israel can’t move on Lebanon while Hezballah is there, armed, through Iran therefore Iran must be eliminated as an arms exporter to Hezballah or he route through Syria. It isn’t working so well in Syria at hte moment. Again, just my hypothesis. I just don’t have any faith in Trump being truly independent. He’s certainly a tough one to read as some things he does say I agree with. BTW, it isn’t my administration. I’m north of the US, in the multiculti capital of the world Edward Longshanks  February 7, 2017 at 12:50 pm Jim, this was not a debate, more one speech with 2 senior rotating speakers 🙂 I do not doubt, that Mr. Trump is a narciss. And he simply likes to direct himself on a Broadway theatre stage. And he thinks he has to offer his audience some entertainment. “I am the great pretender…..”…. If an US president needs always an external enemy, why they do not select Israel? Israel is the prototype of an ideal enemy, better than any other in human history. Log in to Reply Amelius  February 7, 2017 at 2:49 pm The show is called “The Debate”, but it’s often more like a civilized discussion between two informed individuals. Personally, I like the show and by stating the facts, Jim often makes it tough for anyone to objectively disagree with him. Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  February 7, 2017 at 5:16 pm Sometimes we get a slugfest and other times they want two people to fill in around what is not being reported in the news. I only figured out this past year that getting old has some benefits, like being put on with Larry who is 77 and written 20 books on national security, as matching one of the activist pretenders would be an embarrassment to everybody their but the activist. I got stuck with one of those once on rolling coverage after an Obama State of the Union speech, an early 30’s fast talking NY City kid that hogged the mic. So I tore into him a bit to try to teach him some manners that you don’t hog the show from the host on a big event. He did not get it. So I ended up giving PressTV a short list at the time of people I never wanted to be on with as I could not use the material for reposting because I would be promoting air heads. They understood. Although Larry is the penultimate Washington insider, I respect him because he has done the work with good intentions, and I might have done just what he has if I had that ability and opportunity. My magic mystery tour has brought me here, something 100% foreseeable ten years ago. Edward Longshanks  February 7, 2017 at 12:36 pm Greetings wjabbe, the comparison with Hitler is not reasonable. Hitler had to promote in the face of the Germans the liberation of Germans and German regions. Trump has not to liberate anybody than the US people from the Jews. But there are no US American regions occupied, only the US themselves. The only similar effect on both characters is, that both learned propaganda and holding speeches from the Jewish communists. Hitler had not really an army. Trump leads the major terrorist country on the planet, the major nuclear threat to everyone, the nation, most addicted to war more than any other nation. Hitler was, caused by his personal experiences as a messenger in WW1 a pacifist. He was 3x wounded, blinded, and get the medal for it and the iron cross 2nd class. Trump never made such an experience. Mr. Duff made it. The US spend sanctions and boycotts. Hitler was threatened by sanctions and boycotts. Log in to Reply wjabbe  February 7, 2017 at 10:39 am Some excellent comments Jim and Mr. Korb also. Adolph Hitler was a master at propaganda. Trump has many similar characteristics. He is a bully, a con artist, a liar. Talk can quickly turn into violence and WWIII. This is the big worry with Trumpy Dumpty. I am not sure he really knows himself where he is going with all this and the possible consequences. Other than the 9/11 false flag, America has been very lucky over the years to have avoided the kind of bombing we have inflicted on so many other countries. If and when the next war begins, this luck will most certainly run out. Look at the sorry “defense” the corrupt four star generals put up on 9/11. They couldn’t even defend their own building. Obviously they stood down or were ordered to do so. As you said the other day, we are in deep doo doo. Most Americans are not prepared for a real attack on them like we routinely inflict everywhere else in the world.

Laptops by Joshua Goldman February 7, 2017 7:11 AM PST @ByJoshG An Intel design patent shows a curved screen for a 2-in-1 laptop/tablet. Intel Intel's processors power the majority of laptops, but it doesn't actually make laptops. That hasn't stopped the chipmaker from patenting a design here and there. Among the company's latest is a 2-in-1 laptop/tablet hybrid with a detachable curved display according to a design patent. The US Patent and Trademark Office granted the patent in November, but apparently it went noticed until TheLeaker.com published details about the patent on Sunday. Curved displays on TVs and phones are nothing new. However, with the exception of Acer's $9,000 Predator 21 X, they haven't been used for laptops and tablets. Unlike the Acer's, Intel's design features a curved keyboard base, which may not be ideal on all surfaces. Likewise, such a curve on a tablet could prove awkward for drawing or writing. Demand for personal computers has been in steady decline for the past five years, though, so it may just be designs like this that spark consumer interest. Does the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care. Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

Lady Gaga’s death-defying leap into Houston’s NRG Stadium was prerecorded ahead of her epic Super Bowl LI halftime show performance Sunday, February 5. PHOTOS: Lady Gaga's Craziest Stunts and Most Outrageous Controversies As viewers saw on Sunday night, Mother Monster, 30, kicked off her career-spanning spectacle by standing on the roof of the venue and singing “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land” as 300 Shooting Star Intel drones painted the sky red, white and blue. Following the patriotic intro, Gaga seemingly jumped off the top of the stadium — which has a retractable roof — to descend onto the stage. via GIPHY In an interview with USA Today on Sunday, Intel General Manager Natalie Cheung revealed that Gaga’s daring stunt was taped on Monday, January 30, nearly a week prior to her performance. According to Cheung, the bit was prerecorded not because the “Poker Face” singer couldn’t pull off the tour de force, but simply because of weather and time. PHOTOS: Hottest NFL Hunks: Tom Brady, Eric Decker, Russell Wilson and More! “So there’s a lot of weather and environment [issues],” Cheung told USA Today. “In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl day. We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team, as well as the Super Bowl creative team, felt this would be best to be filmed.” Lady Gaga performs during the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show at NRG Stadium on Feb. 5, 2017 in Houston. Patrick Smith/Getty Images She added: “Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium.” PHOTOS: 2000s Pop Stars, Then and Now Even though the superstar’s intro wasn’t live, she still wowed the crowd with a 13-minute medley of her greatest hits, including “Just Dance,” “Born This Way” and “Bad Romance.” Gaga reportedly broke down in tears — the good kind! — after ending her performance with a triumphant mic drop. Sources told Billboard on Sunday that the pop diva was “very emotional” and “crying” as she exited the stage and “dove right into her sister’s [Natali Germanotta] arms.” The morning after her performance, the Grammy winner announced her plan to embark on the Joanne world tour later this year, which begins in Vancouver, British Columbia, on August 1.

Forums Join   127 Tech Companies File Brief Opposing Trump Immigration Ban by Karl Bode Tuesday Feb 07 2017 10:10 EST 127 companies (including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel and others) have filed an amicus brief opposing Donald Trump's highly-controversial travel ban. The brief calls the ban both unconstitutional and illegal, highlighting the contributions of immigrants to the tech economy while highlighting the extensive immigration controls already in place to weed out violent extremist threats. It also claims the ban makes it more difficult and expensive for companies to hire new employees, and will make it more difficult for existing employees to conduct business because of travel restrictions. "Skilled individuals will not wish to immigrate to the country if they may be cut off without warning from their spouses, grandparents, relatives, and friends -- they will not pull up roots, incur significant economic risk, and subject their family to considerable uncertainty to immigrate to the United States in the face of this instability," the brief says. Notably absent from the brief are any telecom companies whatsoever. In fact, outside of Comcast's decision to let its employees protest (for or against the ban, Comcast stated), telecom companies have been dead silent on the controversial restrictions entirely. That's in notable contrast to companies like Uber, which have created a $3 million fund to help defend drivers impacted by the ban. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick also stepped down from his role on Trump's advisory committee after customer backlash. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, whose companies also signed the brief, has defended his participation on Trump's advisory team, arguing it's a better opportunity to impact policy. The brief was filed in support of a case brought by both Minnesota and Washington state, which challenges Trump’s executive order. The brief is quick to highlight previous immigration law attempts that were struck down for being unconstitutional, including the Literacy Act and the Johnson-Reed Act."The march of time has discredited these laws and policies," the brief states. tags: business · Politics · world · content · consumers · cellular News Jump Sprint's Owner Continues to Talk Sale or T-Mobile Merger AT&T Workers Authorize Strike as Contract Standoff LoomsForum Topic: Tracking the Progress of Altice's Fiber BuildVerizon Disputes Study Claiming T-Mobile's Gaining GroundFriday Morning LinksCharter Sued For Post Merger Billing Screw UpsWeekend Open Thread!Comcast Told to Stop Lying About 'Fastest Internet' Ad ClaimsAs T-Mobile Network Improves, Verizon Needs To Stop BullshittingAT&T Plans 5G Wireless Tests at 3.7-4.2 GHz And Above----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 147 comments Harddrive Proud American and Infidel since 1968.

Why can't anyone understand this. It is a TEMPORARY 90 day stop of immigration from seven countries because they can't supply reliable information for background checks on people requesting visas. They have also stopped refugees for 120 days while they come up with ways to vet these people. The information that's obtained from these countries is incomplete or false and the administration is looking for ways to correct this instead of just letting everyone in on their word. · actions · 2017-Feb-7 10:36 am · Apophis Jaffa Kree Premium Member join:2001-12-27 Holmen, WI Apophis Premium Member 2017-Feb-7 11:52 am Big tech wants cheap labor The only reason these companires are filing a complaint is because they want the free flow of cheap labor. · actions · 2017-Feb-7 11:52 am · tc1uscg join:2005-03-09 Wahiawa, HI 1 edit tc1uscg Member 2017-Feb-7 10:38 am Show us the proof "Skilled individuals will not wish to immigrate to the country if they may be cut off without warning from their spouses, grandparents, relatives, and friends -- they will not pull up roots, incur significant economic risk, and subject their family to considerable uncertainty to immigrate to the United States in the face of this instability Here's an idea for the tech companies. How about you show us some numbers on how many people from those 7 countries can't report to work because of this ban. Set aside the religion argument because it doesn't hold any water. Same view towards Muslims can apply to people who are christens but belong to the Black Panther party or KluKluxKlan. But I would like to see these tech companies show us they can't find a one for one replacement from the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the UK even, and fill these "talented" spots they fear they can't fill. They won't. Because they don't people to know the underlying reason behind their "brief" is the money they will loose if they have to hire from the before mentioned countries.

Firstly, foreigners dont have a Constitutional right to come here. People in other nations dont have Constitutional rights, so saying this E.O. is unConstitutional is a joke. Secondly, this Presidential power has been written into Federal law, the US Congress gave the President this authority to shut down immigration from certain foreign nations as long as the President sees fit. These same seven nations were identified by the Obama Administration to be havens of state sponsored terror. Also, this travel ban is only temporary at 90-120 days. When judges rule against the E.O. you can tell they're putting their political ideology over their duty to write findings dispassionately. That's part of the problem we have today....too many activist judges who are trying to legislate from the bench. The uber-liberal 9th circuit will most likely rule against Trump, but the SCOTUS will most likely rule in his favor. What's troubling is the fact that so many tech companies have stood opposed to this E.O.....they'd rather hire cheap foreign labor over Americans who need work. · actions · 2017-Feb-7 10:55 am · TheMasterFab join:2016-02-17·Frontier Communi..

Contray to the Trump's statements, one can not simply board a plane from these countries and enter the United States. It is terribly difficult even for those who have been employed by the United States government to help aid in military or intelligence efforts. Individuals who had obtained those difficult VISAs or resident Green Cards were denied access to America and would be further denied entry if they left the country (Google employee, for example). Some, mere weeks away from approval for proper citizenship. The H1-B Work VISA should be a separate issue, to all nations, -- India, China, etc. And not tied to the executive order related to seven small countries. The deployment of this executive order was fundamentally flawed. · actions · 2017-Feb-7 2:01 pm · Anonfd1b3 @briworks.net Anonfd1b3 Anon 2017-Feb-7 12:30 pm LOL So, a temporary halt on people coming in from 7 countries who have no real political structure, and therefore it’s impossible to check the information of people coming in. If Trump does that, temporarily, these companies are damaged.

Feb 07, 2017, 08:30 ET Share this article NEW YORK, Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A total of 97 companies -- including Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter -- filed a court motion Sunday night declaring that Trump's executive order on immigration "violates the immigration laws and the Constitution." The ban represents "a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies," says the court document. Independently from the previously signed Executive Order, a draft Order that could dramatically overhaul the H-1B visa process for skilled foreign national workers has sparked additional concerns and uncertainty on the part of American tech companies who rely on H-1B visas to staff critical jobs. Already, some U.S. companies report that they have postponed crucial hires until there is more clarity on how the Trump Administration will proceed.   Alex Konanykhin, CEO of TransparentBusiness Amid this uncertainty, TransparentBusiness offers effective alternatives to importing tech talent. "While I strongly believe that curtailing business immigration is a policy detrimental to the U.S. economy, many U.S. companies import tech talent out of habit, without considering the alternatives recently made possible by Internet technologies," says Alex Konanykhin, CEO of TransparentBusiness. Designated by Citigroup as the "Top People Management Solution," TransparentBusiness.com platform greatly increases productivity of remote work, allows for easy monitoring and coordination of geographically distributed workforce and provides real-time information on the cost and status of all tasks and projects. "We make it easy for U.S. companies to access the global talent pool without having to physically bring workers into the United States," Konanykhin. "The managers can see all remote work progressing in real time and provide immediate feedback. This level of coordination is far superior to traditional 'on-campus' approach of assembling workers in one location." The rapid growth of TransparentBusiness has been fueled, in part, by limitations imposed by the existing H-1B program, which annually holds a lottery that grants only 65,000 H-1B workers entry into the U.S.; a quota that turns away roughly two-thirds of those who apply. With TransparentBusiness, which is simple to use and provides CIA-grade security, foreign employees and contractors can skip the H-1B lottery entirely, working remotely from their home countries, whereas U.S. companies need not delay hiring essential employees or risk losing them to tightening entry regulations. By eliminating travel and relocation expenses, and the need to support the living costs of an employee based in the United States, companies that rely on TransparentBusiness can have access to the world's finest talents at a fraction of the cost of physically relocating those employees and contractors to the United States. "A programmer who would be paid $160,000 a year or more in New York or San Francisco, can be hired in Belarus or Ukraine for roughly $40,000 a year, so wide is the spread in talent cost throughout the world," Konanykhin says. Allowing key employees to work remotely also reduces the office space cost and related overheads. And by making every work minute accountable, TransparentBusiness increases productivity of remote work by 15-40%, without intruding on privacy of the worker.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 7 February 2017 by Military News TransparentBusiness Offers Companies an Effective Solution to the Uncertainty Surrounding H-1B Visa Reform NEW YORK, Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — A total of 97 companies — including Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter — filed a court motion Sunday night declaring that Trump’s executive order on immigration „violates the immigration laws and the Constitution.” The ban represents „a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies,” says the court document. Independently from the previously signed Executive Order, a draft Order that could dramatically overhaul the H-1B visa process for skilled foreign national workers has sparked additional concerns and uncertainty on the part of American tech companies who rely on H-1B visas to staff critical jobs. Already, some U.S. companies report that they have postponed crucial hires until there is more clarity on how the Trump Administration will proceed.   Amid this uncertainty, TransparentBusiness offers effective alternatives to importing tech talent. „While I strongly believe that curtailing business immigration is a policy detrimental to the U.S. economy, many U.S. companies import tech talent out of habit, without considering the alternatives recently made possible by Internet technologies,” says Alex Konanykhin, CEO of TransparentBusiness. Designated by Citigroup as the „Top People Management Solution,” TransparentBusiness.com platform greatly increases productivity of remote work, allows for easy monitoring and coordination of geographically distributed workforce and provides real-time information on the cost and status of all tasks and projects. „We make it easy for U.S. companies to access the global talent pool without having to physically bring workers into the United States,” Konanykhin. „The managers can see all remote work progressing in real time and provide immediate feedback. This level of coordination is far superior to traditional ‚on-campus’ approach of assembling workers in one location.” The rapid growth of TransparentBusiness has been fueled, in part, by limitations imposed by the existing H-1B program, which annually holds a lottery that grants only 65,000 H-1B workers entry into the U.S.; a quota that turns away roughly two-thirds of those who apply. With TransparentBusiness, which is simple to use and provides CIA-grade security, foreign employees and contractors can skip the H-1B lottery entirely, working remotely from their home countries, whereas U.S. companies need not delay hiring essential employees or risk losing them to tightening entry regulations. By eliminating travel and relocation expenses, and the need to support the living costs of an employee based in the United States, companies that rely on TransparentBusiness can have access to the world’s finest talents at a fraction of the cost of physically relocating those employees and contractors to the United States. „A programmer who would be paid $160,000 a year or more in New York or San Francisco, can be hired in Belarus or Ukraine for roughly $40,000 a year, so wide is the spread in talent cost throughout the world,” Konanykhin says. Allowing key employees to work remotely also reduces the office space cost and related overheads. And by making every work minute accountable, TransparentBusiness increases productivity of remote work by 15-40%, without intruding on privacy of the worker. TransparentBusiness is a founding participant of the Partnership of Refugees, which was presented by President Obama to the Leaders’ Summit on Refugees in the wake of the UN General Assembly in September of 2016.  Other contributors to the Initiative include Accenture, TENT Foundation, Airbnb, Citigroup, Facebook, Goldman Sachs, Google, HP, IBM, IKEA, Johnson&Johnson, LinkedIn, MasterCard, Microsoft, Pearson, SAP, Twitter, Uber, UPS and Western Union.

Eric Jhonsa Feb 6, 2017 3:30 PM EST This article originally appeared on Real Money on Feb. 3, 2017. Rumors that Apple (AAPL) will eventually stop using Intel (INTC) CPUs within its Mac lineup in favor of internally developed, ARM-based chips have been around for several years. Though a recent Bloomberg report does provide a little grist for the mill, it's important to keep in mind what it does and doesn't say. Bloomberg sources state Apple is working on a new chip for future MacBooks that would handle their Power Nap feature, which allows current Apple laptops to do things like receive e-mails, sync calendar and contact data and update a system's location while in sleep mode. If plugged into an outlet, Power Nap can also download software updates and perform data backups. The move would follow Apple's integration of its ARM-based T1 chip in new MacBook Pro models. The T1 powers the Touch Bar, an OLED touch strip which provides different controls and functions from one app to another, found on the two most powerful Pro models. But those notebooks still rely on Intel's Core CPUs as their main processors, and the new chip responsible for Power Nap will also reportedly complement an Intel part. As Apple is undoubtedly aware, abandoning Intel would bring with it some big challenges. The company's macOS would have to be re-written to run on ARM processors. And developers would have to do the same for their macOS apps, at least unless they were run on emulation software that would result in a performance hit.

[x] HOME TECH GAMING BUSINESS CONSUMER MOBILE HEXUS.TV TRUST COMPETITIONS FORUMS SEARCH You are here: CPU Components General Business News 21 Intel finalising Ryzen spoiler Core i7 and i5 chip designs says report by Mark Tyson on 7 February 2017, 10:01 Tags: Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), AMD (NYSE:AMD) Quick Link: HEXUS.net/qadd2s Add to My Vault: PC enthusiasts and gamers are getting pretty stoked up about the upcoming launch of AMD Ryzen processors, scheduled for 2nd March. Yesterday we looked over a leaked product matrix that contained a full range of 17 AMD Ryzen processors, with 8C/16T R7 chips at the high end through to 4C/4T chips at entry level. Of course pricing is key to how disruptive AMD's launch will be but it looks like Intel is pre-empting some trouble as rumours circulate about it implementing a "last-resort solution that represents a confession of indisputable weakness". Intel Core i5 with Hyper-Threading? French computer publication Canard PC is the source of the above quote. Its magazine editors have been informed that Intel is planning to adjust its Kaby Lake prices and introduce new chips to fend off the AMD challenge. For the scale of the price cuts to be seen I guess we will have to wait for AMD to show its hand, however insider sources have indicated to Canard PC that two new unlocked Kaby Lake chips have been designed to help fully answer AMD's new lineup. There will be a new unlocked Core i7 and Core i5 as outlined below, asserts the magazine. Intel Core i7-7740K: Base frequency of 4.3GHz, Turbo of 4.6GHz. 8MB of L3 cache. TDP of 100W. Intel Core i5-7640K: Base frequency of 4.0GHz. 6MB of L3 cache. TDP of 100W+. Plus last but not least - Hyper-Threading SMT support. Above you will note that, if the rumours are correct, this will be the first modern Core i5 to have Hyper-Threading enabled. Indeed, as the source says, this feature is traditionally the dividing line between the i5 and i7 chip ranges. However, Intel has already shown that it is willing to blur boundaries in its seventh generation Core processor range with the unlocked Core i3-7350K and the Hyper-Threading enabled Pentium G4560. Hyper-Threading on the Intel Core i5-7640K is not confirmed by all Canard PC sources but the magazine promises to clear up the uncertainty by the end of the week when it says one of these unannounced processors will arrive at its labs in France for testing.

Posted by shaithis - Tue 07 Feb 2017 10:11 this will be the first modern Core i5 to have Hyper-Threading enabled this will be the first modern desktop Core i5 to have Hyper-Threading enabled Posted by DanceswithUnix - Tue 07 Feb 2017 10:12 Pfft, if they cared they would have given us some fresh desktop Iris products where the nice big L4 cache would boost some game benchmarks rather nicely. Instead they just overclock the existing chips? That seems lame, almost to the point of insulting to the consumer. Will be interesting to see where “100W+” ends up as a real measured power consumption. Let's hope the lack of effort here means there is a team beavering away somewhere trying to come up with something new so no-one has time for refresh products like this. shaithis this will be the first modern desktop Core i5 to have Hyper-Threading enabled Are you referring to the laptop chips which only have two cores so really just an i3 with an i5 label on it? Posted by Ozaron - Tue 07 Feb 2017 10:25 DanceswithUnix Let's hope the lack of effort here means there is a team beavering away somewhere trying to come up with something new so no-one has time for refresh products like this. You bet - these SMT enabled i5s will be interesting for a small number of people, but the real prize is the ground-breaking new architecture coming up that will change everything: by adding 2 more cores to each product level and matching AMD and returning status quo one more time. You know it to be true. Posted by Gunbuster - Tue 07 Feb 2017 10:26 In fairness Intel's mobile chip line up is insane. I have an i7 thats dual core and hyperthreaded at work.

AMD’s Ryzen Processors to Support Windows 7 GO The firm will release drivers for the 2009 Windows version Feb 7, 2017 10:36 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Unlike Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, which work exclusively on Windows 10, AMD’s upcoming Ryzen series will also support Windows 7 thanks to drivers dedicated to this old operating system. While this decision is not yet confirmed, HotHardware reports that AMD revealed in an information session that it intends to develop Windows 7 drivers for the Ryzen lineup of processors and make them compatible with the operating system launched in 2009. Microsoft itself used this as a method to convince users to upgrade to Windows 10, saying on several occasions that new processors would exclusively work on this OS version. This is one of the reasons Intel sticks with Windows 10 for its Kaby Lake chips, as neither Microsoft nor Intel provides drivers for any other Windows version. In the case of AMD, however, the firm wants to work on Windows 7 drivers on its own, so even though Microsoft itself doesn’t wish to make the Ryzen magic happen on any other Windows version besides 10, there’s a good chance that this would actually come true. Windows 7, the king On the other hand, it’s important to mention that aside from generic drivers, Microsoft doesn’t specifically develop drivers, but only gives them the certification for a specific OS version, so it’ll be interesting to learn how the software giant sees AMD’s intention to invest in Windows 7 at a time when Windows 10 is the only focus. And yet, the decision to develop Windows 7 drivers is not at all surprising, especially because this version of the operating system continues powering a hefty part of the world’s PCs. Depending on the analyst firm, Windows 7 powers between 35 to 48 percent of the world’s PCs, and although it’s indeed losing ground, there’s no doubt that it’ll remain at the top of the charts for a little longer. Windows 7 reaches end of support in January 2020, and by that time, Microsoft expects most of the users to already be running Windows 10 and thus help the firm avoid another Windows XP moment when people simply refuse to upgrade. #AMD#Ryzen#Windows 7#Windows 10#Microsoft subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Lenovo Launches New Windows 7 Laptops Windows 10 Close to Becoming Number 1 in Europe Too Microsoft Kills Off Old Versions of Skype, Update or Else Windows 10 Overtakes Windows 7 for the Very First Time in the United States Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux Windows Close to Defeating Linux: Munich Could Give Up on LiMux Samsung Galaxy S8’s Bixby To Be Based on S Voice, Not Viv Labs’ AI Tech Microsoft Brings Windows 10 Mobile’s File Explorer on Xbox One Microsoft Teases New Windows 10 Security Announcements Apple iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Feature An Iris Scanner Let’s Chat: Windows vs. Linux    Windows 7 still running on a big number of PCs New Apps Portable PeaUtils: A collection of file management tools that comprises checksum and hash tools, file and folder analysis, a file splitter and joiner, hex data preview, and more Jihosoft iTunes Backup Unlocker: Uncover the password of your encrypted iTunes backup using multiple cracking methods, with this novice-friendly piece of software ProgDVB Professional: Watch TV channels from around the world, listen to radio station from the comfort of your computer, and record your favorite shows to watch them later eBook Converter Bundle: Batch convert your ePub or DRM PDFs to other formats with this lightweight software solution that provides ease of use and support for Kindle, NOOK, Kobo file formats Portable Alternate Archiver: Manage multiple files in a folder by organizing them into sub-directories, with the help of this lightweight and easy to handle utility ReaConverter Lite: Batch convert image files, add watermarks, edit photos and save them to a selected output format with this intuitive application xrecode III Portable: Converts audio files with ease and at high speed, supporting various input formats and providing a user-friendly working environment Reader comments Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile RS2 Now Feature-Complete, Countdown Begins more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

More specifically, each drone measures approximately a foot long square, weighs just over eight ounces, and sports a plastic and foam body. They communicate with each other wirelessly using a central computer to execute its dance routine, while the computer checks the battery level as well as the GPS signal strength of each drone just before showtime, and assigns roles accordingly. Reserve units were put on standby, and ready to take over within seconds should one (or many) falter. One thing you may not have known is that Intel had to tape the drone display long before the Super Bowl to avoid violoating airspace rules.

It was the latest chapter in a saga which began on January 27, when Trump issued a blanket ban on all refugees, and travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.Silicon Valley giants such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter filed a legal brief late Sunday in support of a lawsuit against the travel ban, which was suspended by a federal judge on Friday. The 97 companies which signed onto the brief, most of them from the US tech industry which heavily employs immigrants, charged that the ban “inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth,” according to a copy of the document published on Monday by US media outlets. A group of prominent Democrats including former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright joined their voices to the criticism on Monday, calling for a federal appeals court to continue blocking the ban which they argued harms national security. Trump, who spent the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida, has unleashed a string of fiery tweets defending his policy and attacking the Seattle judge who blocked his travel ban.“Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!” he wrote. “I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!”The appeals court over the weekend ruled against immediately reinstating the ban, a decision that Vice President Mike Pence called “frustrating”. “We will move very quickly,” he told Fox News on Sunday. “We are going to win the arguments because we will take the steps necessary to protect the country, which the president of the United States has the authority to do.” Trump’s executive order slapped a blanket ban on entry for nationals of the seven countries for 90 days and barred all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were blocked indefinitely. The Trump administration has appealed the suspension of the ban to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, saying the halt was causing “irreparable harm” to the American public. The appeals court has asked both the state of Washington, which filed the suit challenging the travel ban, and the Trump administration to file more documents bolstering their arguments, before it decides how to proceed. The 97 companies speaking out against the travel ban said it harms recruiting and retention of talent, threatens business operations, and hampers the firms’ ability to attract investment to the United States. Other tech companies that are part of the coalition include AirBnb, Dropbox, eBay, Intel,Kickstarter, LinkedIn, Lyft, Mozilla, Netflix, PayPal, Uber and Yelp. Kerry and Albright in their court filing called for the appeals court to continue blocking the travel ban, arguing that Trump’s order was “ill-conceived, poorly implemented and ill-explained.” “We view the order as one that ultimately undermines the national security of the United States, rather than making us safer,” they said.“Reinstating the executive order would wreak havoc on innocent lives and deeply held American values.” Specifically, the Democrats said Trump’s travel ban could endanger US troops in the field and disrupt counterterrorism cooperation.It also feeds Islamic State group propaganda that the United States is at war with Islam, they said. The brief was filed by Kerry, Albright and several top aides to ex-president Barack Obama. Among them were national security adviser Susan Rice, CIA chief and defence secretary Leon Panetta, and homeland security chief Janet Napolitano. With the travel ban suspended as of Friday, travelers from the targeted countries holding valid visas have begun arriving on American soil.In New York, 33-year-old Sudanese doctor Kamal Fadlalla rejoiced — after a week blocked in his home country, he was back in the Big Apple with friends and colleagues. “It feels great,” Fadlalla said on Sunday at John F Kennedy International Airport. “It was a tough week actually.”Iranian graduate student Sara Yarjani, who was initially deported under Trump’s order, arrived in Los Angeles. “I am so grateful to all the lawyers and others that helped me,” she said tearfully. The State Department has said visa holders from the seven countries are allowed to travel to the US as long as their documents have not been “physically canceled.”The restrictions fueled weekend protests at home and abroad — from London and Hong Kong to Washington and Palm Beach, where Trump spent the weekend. 0 0 97 US tech companies rally against Trump was posted in Top Story of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on February 07, 2017 and was last updated on February 07, 2017.

A total of 127 companies -- including Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Facebook (FB, Tech30), Google (GOOGL, Tech30), Intel (INTC, Tech30), Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30), Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) -- filed court papers declaring that Trump's executive order on immigration "violates the immigration laws and the Constitution." The wave of opposition came in two court filings, one on Sunday and one on Monday. Almost all the companies that signed on in support are tech companies. The few exceptions include yogurt producer Chobani, snack maker Kind and fashion brand Levi Strauss. All three companies were founded by immigrants.The ban represents "a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies," says the court document.It's the latest move by the tech industry to oppose Trump's controversial order, which has run into hurdles in the U.S. court system. The motion was filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Sunday morning denied the U.S. government's emergency request to resume Trump's travel ban. The appeals court has asked for both sides to file legal briefs before it makes a final decision. The lawsuit in question was filed by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota. The motion from the companies seeks permission to file what's known as an amicus ("friend of the court") brief in the case.The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation. No matter how it rules, the next stop for the case is likely be the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump's executive order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days and all refugees from entering for 120 days. It also indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.Tech companies have been at the vanguard of businesses opposing the ban. Their court motion emphasizes the important role of immigration in the U.S. economy. "Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies," it says. "At the same time, America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm," it adds. "But it has done so while maintaining the fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country."It's not the first legal move by tech firms over Trump's ban. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and Expedia (EXPE) filed motions last week in the Washington attorney general's lawsuit. They argued the immigration order will hurt their employees and their businesses. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick on Thursday dropped out of Trump's business advisory council, citing the ban."The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," Kalanick wrote in a memo to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants."Uber and its rival Lyft both support the motion filed Sunday. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has defended his decision to take part in the advisory council, saying it's better to be on the inside where he can push Trump on issues like immigration and climate change. Tesla was not a signatory to the motion initially but signed on to the brief Monday evening.CNN   More than 100 companies join legal fight against Trump travel ban Independent Online Desk Americas biggest tech firms have stepped into the legal fight against President Donald Trumps travel ban.

As Tom Brady and Matt Ryan faced off, so did the advertisers. This year’s ‘tech’ bowl brought out the best in technology advertisers, including Amazon, Google, Hulu, Intel, Mobile Strike, Netflix, Nintendo, T-Mobile, Sprint, Squarespace, Wix and World of Tanks. Accompanying the tech-themed advertisements, Intel brought the latest in GPS-controlled drone technology to join Lady Gaga during the halftime show. Commercial content spun the gamut, from cute and comedic to sweet and sentimental, often including celebrity faces and sports star cameos. Bai Brands ranked the highest overall in engagement with an appearance by Christopher Walken, who dramatically delivered the lyrics to Bye Bye Bye alongside Justin Timberlake. Top 10 commercials and promotions The following are the top 10 commercials and promotions from the big game, according to TiVo: Bai Brands – BaiBaiBai Kia – Hero’s Journey It’s a 10 Haircare – It’s a 10 Haircare T-Mobile – Its All That and More Honda – Yearbooks Anheuser-Busch – Born the Hard Way Paramount – Transformers: The Last Knight General Motors – If That’s a Buick Disney – Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Wonderful Company – Ernie Gets Physical TiVo uses second-by-second data and measurement tools to rank the top commercials from this year’s championship game, based on commercial retention compared to overall programme viewership. “As one of the biggest broadcasting events of the year, this epic showdown represents the perfect opportunity for brands and advertisers to attract and engage with fans on the grandest sports stage in the world,” said Paul Stathacopoulos, vice president of strategy, TiVo. “Marketers are often searching for the most efficient and effective platforms to reach their customers but even as commercial content continues to get flashier, strategic placement is key. Using advertising analytics and data-driven audience insights can further nurture viewer engagement, leading to better entertainment experiences.” Top moment of the broadcast For the seventh consecutive year, TiVo found viewership for the halftime show exceeding that of the overall game. Known for her over-the-top ensembles and electronic dance moves, Lady Gaga’s high-tech halftime performance was exceedingly well-received, generating 41 thousand tweets per minute. The pyrotechnic showcase ended with this year’s top moment of the broadcast including a theatric mic drop and jump off the stage. Based on data from the last nine years, this year’s halftime show ranked third right behind 2012’s performance by Madonna and 2015’s halftime show featuring Katy Perry and Lenny Kravitz. Top three in-game moments The most engaging in-game moments all took place within the last 30 minutes of the game: (1) At second and goal from the 2-yard line in overtime, Brady tosses the ball to James White, who scores a touchdown for the Patriots’ victory. (2) With three seconds left in regulation time, Brady hands off to Dion Lewis, who goes out of bounds at the New England 48-yard line, leading to the first overtime in NFL championship history. (3) At the 1-yard line, Brady hands off to James White, who crosses the goal line for a touchdown. After the 2-point conversion, the game is tied at 28-28 with less than a minute remaining in the game. TiVo subscribers can view all this year’s top commercials from their TiVo devices.

Lady Gaga's Super Bowl Roof Jump & Drones Were Pre-Recorded 2/6/2017 by Colin Stutz FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Tom Pennington/Getty Images Lady Gaga performs during the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show at NRG Stadium on Feb. 5, 2017 in Houston.  It was a perfect illusion. Turns out Lady Gaga's epic opening to her Super Bowl halftime performance on Sunday where drones flew over her head and lit up to make the American flag before she jumped off the roof into the NRG Stadium in Houston was pre-recorded.  The reasoning they didn't attempt the stunt live was uncertain weather and environmental conditions an Intel spokesperson told USA Today.  "There's a lot of weather and environment (issues)," Intel general manager Natalie Cheung said. "In February, you don't know what it will be like during Super Bowl day. We'd hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it's raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team as well as the Super Bowl creative team felt this would be best to be filmed." But just because it was pre-recorded, doesn't mean it was fake. They just pulled it off in conditions they could control.  "Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it's a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium," Cheung continued.  Watch Gaga's performance here: WOW.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) By NAN Contributor News Americas, LOS ANGELES, CA, Tues. Feb. 7, 2017: Late Sunday, some 127 tech companies, including Airbnb, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Intel, Netflix, Snap and Uber, filed an impassioned legal  amicus brief in  The United States Court Of Appeals For The Ninth Circuit in Washington, condemning Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration. Here are ten things the companies credit immigrants with in the brief: 1: Immigrants make many of the US’ greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies. 2: There is no denying the contributions inclusive immigration policies have made to the American economy. 3: Immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list, including Apple, Kraft,Ford, General Electric, AT&T, Google, McDonald’s, Boeing, and Disney. Collectively, these companies generate annual revenue of $4.2 trillion and employ millions of Americans. 4: Immigrants are among our leading entrepreneurs, politicians, artists, and philanthropists and 19.1 percent of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa were entrepreneurs. 5: The experience and energy of people who come to our country to seek a better life for themselves and their children—to pursue the “American Dream”—are woven throughout the social, political, and economic fabric of the United States. 6: The tremendous impact of immigrants on America—and on American business—is not happenstance. People who choose to leave everything that is familiar and journey to an unknown land to make a new life necessarily are endowed with drive, creativity, determination—and just plain guts. The energy they bring to America is a key reason why the American economy has been the greatest engine of prosperity and innovation in history. 7: Immigrants are leading entrepreneurs. The American economy stands apart because, more than any other place on earth, talented people from around the globe want to come here to start their businesses. 8: While accounting for 16 percent of the labor force nationally and 18 percent of business owners, immigrants make up 28 percent of Main Street business owners. These are “the shops and services that are the backbone of neighborhoods around the country. 9: Immigrants also fuel the growth of the economy as a whole. When immigrants enter the labor force, they increase the productive capacity of the economy and raise GDP. Their incomes rise, but so do those of natives. 10: Immigrants do not take jobs away from U.S. citizens—they create them. Thus, immigration “expand[s] the American work-force, and encourage[s] more business start-ups”—ensuring that [b]usinesses ranging from Apple Corporation to apple growers would be able to find the workers they need in America.

Skip to content People Music Beyoncé Knowles Kanye West Lady Gaga Taylor Swift Gwen Stefani Lady Gaga’s Illusion: How Her Super Bowl Halftime Show Jump from the Stadium Really Went Down By Stephanie Petit Posted on February 6, 2017 at 4:40pm EST Share Tweet Email The New England Patriots may have pulled off the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history, but Lady Gaga‘s jump into her halftime performance had everyone — sports fan or not — talking. However, it turns out the songstress’ leap into NRG Stadium was truly a perfect illusion. The start of Gaga’s performance appeared to show her on top of the stadium as she sang a medley of “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land” while Intel drones created an American flag behind her. However, the millions watching on television were fooled when the performer seemed to leap into the stadium and slowly descend to the stage. Those inside, however, had a behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of the stunt. “It was pre-recorded — she wasn’t on the roof,” onlooker Nathan Michaud tells PEOPLE. “She came out on the field at the start of halftime, and they raised her up on cables in the dark as the video played. As soon as the clip showed her jumping, the spotlight focused on Gaga suspended in the air and they brought her down. She absolutely nailed it — before Tom Brady stole the rest of the show.” RELATED VIDEO: Lady Gaga on Her Way Up to the Roof (Courtesy Scott Herman) Patrick Smith/Getty GAGA DIDN'T JUMP!

I AM SHOOK. pic.twitter.com/NuqkvrSwBL — Mike T (@majtague) February 6, 2017 RELATED VIDEO: Lady Gaga Drops Into the Super Bowl (Courtesy Jayne Centeno Kelly)   Intel drones’ general manager Natalie Cheung confirmed that the drones were shot over several days, noting that several factors prevented the perfectly choreographed stunt from happening live. “There’s a lot of weather and environment [issues],” Cheung told USA Today. “In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl day. We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team as well as the Super Bowl creative team felt this would be best to be filmed. Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium.” Kevin C. Cox/Getty Cheung explained that although it wasn’t live, the feat was still an impressive show. “It’s a different way of merging art and technology, which I think a lot of people haven’t seen,” she said. “We started this effort maybe a year and a half ago, and it started with 100 drones in the sky and showed a simple Intel logo. We caught on pretty quickly that this was more than just fireworks. It could be branding in the sky. It could be an artistic event. There’s a lot of different ways that people could utilize this. The Disney team we worked with used it as a theme park attraction. The Super Bowl team utilized it as a way to emphasize and express Lady Gaga’s music. … It can create and mean many different things.” RELATED VIDEO: Lady Gaga Announces Joanne World Tour   The singer-songwriter has announced her Joanne World Tour after performing during the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday night.

The tour kicks off in August in Vancouver and will run through December making stops all around North America and Europe, before wrapping up back in the U.S. for a final date on Dec. 14 in Salt Lake City.

In the span of a weekend, President Trump's travel ban sent the country into crisis. There is passion on both sides of the issue, and as provisions and court orders and changes to the executive order fly from every direction, it's time to step back and... By Jethro Mullen HONG KONG (CNNMoney) -- America's biggest tech firms have stepped into the legal fight against President Donald Trump's travel ban. A total of 127 companies -- including Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter -- filed court papers declaring that Trump's executive order on immigration "violates the immigration laws and the Constitution." The wave of opposition came in two court filings, one on Sunday and one on Monday. Almost all the companies that signed on in support are tech companies. The few exceptions include yogurt producer Chobani, snack maker Kind and fashion brand Levi Strauss. All three companies were founded by immigrants. The ban represents "a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies," says the court document. It's the latest move by the tech industry to oppose Trump's controversial order, which has run into hurdles in the U.S. court system. The motion was filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Sunday morning denied the U.S. government's emergency request to resume Trump's travel ban. The appeals court has asked for both sides to file legal briefs before it makes a final decision. The lawsuit in question was filed by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota. The motion from the companies seeks permission to file what's known as an amicus ("friend of the court") brief in the case. The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation. No matter how it rules, the next stop for the case is likely be the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump's executive order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days and all refugees from entering for 120 days. It also indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Tech companies have been at the vanguard of businesses opposing the ban. Their court motion emphasizes the important role of immigration in the U.S. economy. "Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies," it says. "At the same time, America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm," it adds. "But it has done so while maintaining the fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country." It's not the first legal move by tech firms over Trump's ban. Amazon and Expedia filed motions last week in the Washington attorney general's lawsuit. They argued the immigration order will hurt their employees and their businesses. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick on Thursday dropped out of Trump's business advisory council, citing the ban. "The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," Kalanick wrote in a memo to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." Uber and its rival Lyft both support the motion filed Sunday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has defended his decision to take part in the advisory council, saying it's better to be on the inside where he can push Trump on issues like immigration and climate change. Tesla was not a signatory to the motion initially but signed on to the brief Monday evening. -- Rob McLean, Ariane de Vogue and Laura Jarrett contributed to this report.

Of course Welcome to my world of The Unexplained – yes, you're welcome to it More like this Intel Cisco Data Centre Intel's Atom C2000 chips are bricking products – and it's not just Cisco hit Chipzilla and Switchzilla won't confirm connection but the writing is on the wall 6 Feb 2017 at 22:34, Thomas Claburn Updated Intel's Atom C2000 processor family has a fault that effectively bricks devices, costing the company a significant amount of money to correct. But the semiconductor giant won't disclose precisely how many chips are affected nor which products are at risk. On its Q4 2016 earnings call earlier this month, chief financial officer Robert Swan said a product issue limited profitability during the quarter, forcing the biz to set aside a pot of cash to deal with the problem. "We were observing a product quality issue in the fourth quarter with slightly higher expected failure rates under certain use and time constraints, and we established a reserve to deal with that," he said. "We think we have it relatively well-bounded with a minor design fix that we're working with our clients to resolve." Coincidentally, Cisco last week issued an advisory warning that several of its routing, optical networking, security and switch products sold prior to November 16, 2016 contain a faulty clock component that is likely to fail at an accelerated rate after 18 months of operation. Cisco at the time declined to name the supplier of that component. When asked on Monday whether Intel supplied the faulty electronics, a Cisco spokesperson told that The Register that the networking giant does not intend to publicly name the supplier. Intel indicated in a January 2017 revision of its Atom C2000 family documentation that the chip line contains a clock flaw. Errata note AVR.54, titled "System May Experience Inability to Boot or May Cease Operation," explains that the Atom C2000 Low Pin Count bus clock outputs (LPC_CLKOUT0 and LPC_CLKOUT1) may stop functioning. Permanently. An Intel spokesperson in an email to The Register characterized the issue as "a degradation of a circuit element under high use conditions at a rate higher than Intel’s quality goals after multiple years of service." "If the LPC clock(s) stop functioning the system will no longer be able to boot," Intel's documentation explains. This consequence is precisely what Cisco says may happen to its devices given enough time. "Once the component has failed, the system will stop functioning, will not boot, and is not recoverable," Cisco's advisory states. The Register asked Intel whether it could confirm that Cisco's advisory could be attributed to an Intel component. Intel said it could not confirm or deny whether its chip issue is the one affecting Cisco gear, citing a policy of not commenting on customers. We note that the affected Cisco ASA 55xx products use Intel's Atom C2000 system-on-chips at least. Radio silence We asked Intel to provide specific details about when it began and stopped shipping Intel Atom C2000 processors with faulty clock outputs. Intel declined to comment. The official errata says the B0 stepping of C2xxx Atoms are vulnerable to failure, and these parts began shipping in 2013. The specific SKUs are: C2308, C2338, C2350, C2358, C2508, C2518, C2530, C2538, C2550, C2558, C2718, C2730, C2738, C2750, and C2758. We asked Intel how many affected Atom C2000 chips have been shipped and how much fixing the issue will cost the company. Intel declined to comment. Intel did, however, provide some insight on how the Atom C2000 flaw might be addressed. "A board level workaround exists for the existing production stepping of the product which resolves the issue," a company spokesperson said in an email. "Additionally, Intel will implement and validate a minor silicon fix in a new product stepping that resolves this issue." Many other technology vendors make products with Intel Atom C2000 processors, including Dell and Synology. The Register pinged Dell via email, and it was not immediately available for comment. People with Synology DS1815+ storage boxes have been reporting complete hardware failures; the DS1815+ is powered by an Intel Atom C2538. Other vendors using Atom C2000 chips include Asrock, Aaeon, HP, Infortrend, Lanner, NEC, Newisys, Netgate, Netgear, Quanta, Supermicro, and ZNYX Networks. The chipset is aimed at networking devices, storage systems, and microserver workloads. If you know of any affected or failed gear, please let us know. According to this Intel data-sheet [PDF], LPC_CLKOUT0 and LPC_CLKOUT1 are driven by the processor to provide essential timing signals to hardware on the board, including the boot ROM. If these signals stop ticking, the rest of the electronics stops, too. ® Updated to add at 14:29 UTC, February 7 Synology told The Reg it was "investigating this issue together with Intel," saying it would "provide more detailed information in the week as it becomes available." It added: "At this time Synology has not seen any indication that this issue has caused an increase in failure rates for DiskStation or RackStation models equipped with Intel Atom C2000 series processors. However once additional information is available, Synology will post an advisory on this topic. "In the meantime it is still safe to continue to use your device, however should you encounter any issues these will be handled via our support teams and all the devices are still covered under the standard warranty provided with all our units. Technical Support can be reached via www.synology.com/ticket." Updated to add at 15:36 UTC, February 7 Synology subsequently asked to have its statement above revised to omit any mention of Intel. Updated to add at 18:23 UTC, February 8 Once again, Synology has been in touch, seemingly now able to use the I word, to say: "Intel has recently notified Synology regarding the issue of the processor’s increased degradation chance of a specific component after heavy, prolonged usage. "Synology has not currently seen any indication that this issue has caused an increase in failure rates for DiskStation or RackStation models equipped with Intel Atom C2000 series processors compared to other models manufactured in the same time frame not equipped with the affected processors."

A total of 127 companies — including Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter — filed court papers declaring that Trump’s executive order on immigration “violates the immigration laws and the Constitution.” The wave of opposition came in two court filings, one on Sunday and one on Monday. Almost all the companies that signed on in support are tech companies. The few exceptions include yogurt producer Chobani, snack maker Kind and fashion brand Levi Strauss. All three companies were founded by immigrants. The ban represents “a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies,” says the court document. It’s the latest move by the tech industry to oppose Trump’s controversial order, which has run into hurdles in the U.S. court system. The motion was filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Sunday morning denied the U.S. government’s emergency request to resume Trump’s travel ban. The appeals court has asked for both sides to file legal briefs before it makes a final decision. The lawsuit in question was filed by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota. The motion from the companies seeks permission to file what’s known as an amicus (“friend of the court”) brief in the case. The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation. No matter how it rules, the next stop for the case is likely be the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump’s executive order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days and all refugees from entering for 120 days. It also indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Tech companies have been at the vanguard of businesses opposing the ban. Their court motion emphasizes the important role of immigration in the U.S. economy. “Immigrants make many of the Nation’s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies,” it says. “At the same time, America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm,” it adds. “But it has done so while maintaining the fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants — through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.” It’s not the first legal move by tech firms over Trump’s ban. Amazon and Expedia filed motions last week in the Washington attorney general’s lawsuit. They argued the immigration order will hurt their employees and their businesses. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick on Thursday dropped out of Trump’s business advisory council, citing the ban. “The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,” Kalanick wrote in a memo to employees. “Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there’s a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.” Uber and its rival Lyft both support the motion filed Sunday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has defended his decision to take part in the advisory council, saying it’s better to be on the inside where he can push Trump on issues like immigration and climate change. Tesla was not a signatory to the motion initially but signed on to the brief Monday evening. — Rob McLean, Ariane de Vogue and Laura Jarrett contributed to this report.

From figuring out the target voltage you need to picking out an adequate cooling solution, there are tons of variables to account for. The minds over at Asus's EdgeUp blog have done a bunch of research on overclocking Kaby Lake CPUs, and have come away with some interesting results. Cranking your Kaby Lake CPU to 5GHz with just air cooling is within reach—if you're lucky. The people at Asus found that about 20% of Core i7-7700K CPUs were stable at the 5GHz mark when put under AVX workloads. Even then, the chips begin to run out of thermal headroom and throttle around 1.35V—something that's reasonably consistent with our own experiences here. Asus did have some luck with improving cooling by de-lidding the CPU and swapping in a more conductive thermal compound. This operation allowed Asus' testers to reduce core voltages at a given overclocked frequency. Asus noted in its breakdown that DDR4-3600 RAM appears to be the upper limit for plug-and-play overclocking. In our review, we were able to use DDR4-3866 RAM without major issues. Maybe we got lucky, though. It's also worth mentioning that Asus is porting its Windows-based Thermal Control Tool to its Z270 boards' firmware. The Thermal Control Tool can help chips plugged into those boards behave better at the upper limits of voltage and frequency by clocking the chip down when it hits a certain preset temperature limit. Once it drops back down far enough, the CPU will clock back up. That should help keep the chip running within safe ranges and potentially extend its lifespan. Asus's guide is extensive to say the least, and worth taking a look at if you're hoping to squeeze some extra juice out of your CPU.   Tags: CPUs Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

More Masthead About Lawfare Comments Policy Subscribe to Lawfare The Job Board Calendar Donald Trump Draining the Valley Instead of the Swamp By Andrew Keane Woods Monday, February 6, 2017, 5:03 PM Google+ Reddit LinkedIn Yesterday, most of the U.S.’s biggest technology firms joined the legal fight in the 9th Circuit over the President’s immigration ban, filing a brief arguing that the ban imposes “significant harm” to U.S. businesses.  Over ninety firms signed the brief, including Airbnb, Apple, Box, Citrix, Dropbox, eBay, Facebook, Google, Intel, Lyft, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Snap, Twitter, and Uber, and many more.   The brief is notable for a few things.  First, it makes a few weak legal arguments but focuses mostly on the policy and economic arguments against the immigration ban.  Second, the brief is notable in that it was filed at all.  American tech firms have been in a delicate balancing act, attempting to assuage their customers’ concerns on the one hand without going so far as to “poke the bear” on the other; the brief is a sign that the balance has tilted. President Trump has tried very hard to make his White House both (1) friendly to American technology companies, and (2) intolerantly isolationist.  But as the tech sector’s brief highlights, these are increasingly incompatible goals.   Isolationism is Bad for Tech In Particular The brief makes a big deal out of the fact that we live in a globalized world (“The marketplace for today’s businesses is global.”) This is hardly news.  One need not be a regular at Davos to recognize that the tech sector, more than others, depends on access to global markets.  This is so for a number of reasons.  First, isolationism makes it hard to attract top talent. Internet firms are constantly searching for the best talent worldwide, and that often means hiring immigrants.  President Obama was the regular recipient of calls from the tech community to reform draconian immigration policies that made work visas unusually hard to get. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg even helped found a lobbying group, FWD.US, which filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court in connection with the litigation over Obama’s deferred action policies. Of course, part of the challenge is that isolationist immigration policies make it hard to actually hire people who already want to come to the U.S.  But just as importantly, even if you can manage to jump through all of the bureaucratic hoops, policies like this make it hard to get people to want to come.  If you had a choice—as you likely do if you are being recruited by Google—why would you choose to come to the U.S., if this is how we treat even those immigrants who do everything by the book?  As Matt Levine over at Bloomberg put it: One upshot of Trump's executive order is that United States lawful permanent residents, who have jumped through years of hoops to comply with the intricate immigration rules enshrined in U.S. law, are no longer protected by that law. They can be deported at the whim of the President, or his advisers, or a Border Patrol agent. Matt’s point is that this is “bad for business.”   Isolationism is Particularly Bad for American Internet Firms While the brief makes the business case against an immigration ban in a globalized world, it does not fully explain how isolationism hurts American internet firms in particular.  What the brief leaves out is the simple fact that American efforts to exclude are inconsistent with the message of American internet firms—Facebook, remember, wants to “connect the world”—and the fact that American firms dominate the global internet.  The U.S. makes up a tiny percentage of total internet users (around eight percent), yet in many, many countries, at least half of the most popular websites are managed by American firms.  In France and India, the figure is eight of the ten most popular websites.  In Brazil, it is six of ten.  In Nigeria, it is five of ten.  Website statistics like these do not tell the whole story, of course, but they are corroborated by other evidence.  One estimate suggests that only 13% of Facebook’s users are in the U.S. If you want evidence of how isolationist policies can harm internet firms, ask yourself how many Chinese apps are running on phones outside of China.  China is a huge country with a massive tech sector, yet so far its global reach is largely limited to hardware (much of which is made on behalf of foreign firms like Apple or Samsung).  One effect of China’s isolationist internet policies—some of which are technological and some of which are jurisdictional—is to effectively cleave China from much of the global market for internet services.  Perhaps you look at China and draw the opposite conclusion: just look at that their hardware firms, which are thriving despite strict government oversight!  Good point.  But Foxconn could never survive under Trump-style isolationism.  China’s hardware sector thrives because labor costs are low, and while China is isolationist with regard to internet content, it is decidedly not isolationist with regard to trade of manufactured goods.  (You probably don’t have a Chinese app on your phone, but your phone probably was made in China.)  So American firms that make most of their money-making hardware—firms like Tesla and Apple—also depend on easy access to a global market.   The Tech Industry’s Uneven Response Given the above, it is somewhat surprising that it took this long for the tech industry to react to Trump’s policies. Don’t get me wrong—plenty of the employees at top firms have been vocal in their opposition to Trump’s policies, but this could simply suggest that tech firms employ liberals who dislike Trump.  It was hardly industry-level recognition of the threat posed by Trump’s proposed policies.  And while some tech firms have issued statements ranging from furrowed brows to hair-on-fire outrage, others in the tech sector have not done much to distance themselves from Trump.  Elon Musk blandly tweeted that the President’s Executive Order is, like, probably not great:  The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2017 But one wonders how much of this concern is mere posturing to reassure customers in the U.S., rather than recognition of a long-term threat to the industry.  For example, Uber was caught flat footed this weekend by a #deleteUber campaign after the firm appeared to drop surge pricing in order to bypass the taxi boycott at JFK—a campaign that quickly vaulted Lyft to the top of the most-downloaded apps list this weekend.  Uber, scrambling, pledged to do nice things for immigrants—the behavior of a firm that listens to its customers, but does not see the immigration ban as bad for the firm independent of public outrage. Perhaps the industry’s response has so far been tamer than it might otherwise be because the stock market rally has people feeling pretty good. Or perhaps tech leaders are looking hard for silver linings.  Let’s consider the possible silver linings for the tech sector of a Trump presidency. It is true, in theory, that not all of the Trump administration’s stances are bad for the entire sector. For example, if the Trump administration makes good on its pledge to invest in infrastructure, this could spur innovation in certain fields—such as robotics and autonomous vehicles.  But to hold onto the hope that this infrastructure plan (if it can even be called a plan) will (a) become a reality and (b) be such a boon for the industry that it merits ignoring the costs outlined above—that is really to grasp at straws. Perhaps, then, some Silicon Valley leaders are thinking that Trump, whatever the merits of his policies, will radically change the status quo, and that will create opportunities to innovate or, in Valley lingo, to “disrupt.”  And hey: disruption is good!  One problem with this view is that it is far from clear that disruption is in fact good for the tech sector as a whole, and it is especially not clear that disruption is good for the more established firms like Microsoft, Google, and Apple—that is to say, the firms that are established enough to have gone public and now be a part of your retirement portfolio.  The only people that I can imagine would take such a view about widespread disruption are those poised to take advantage of it.  That is to say, the nimble and capital-rich—folks like billionaire Trump advisor Peter Thiel.  As Thiel told Maureen Dowd: “Everyone says Trump is going to change everything way too much …Well, maybe Trump is going to change everything way too little. That seems like the much more plausible risk to me.” That statement has not aged well. The bigger problem with the disruption-brings-opportunity thesis is that it seemingly justifies anything – including self-destruction. Here, the target of the disruption is the very mechanism by which we ensure that the United States is able to attract talent, disseminate its technology, and engage in cross-border collaboration and innovation. It would be perverse to welcome the decimation of U.S. norms of inclusiveness and connectedness as a form of innovation. Indeed, of all the areas where the U.S. actually needs to innovate, one would think that the last place is its norms of inclusiveness and connectedness.  We can imagine innovators coming up with creative ways to narrow the delta between our current practices and our strongest principles in a number of areas – such as in our elections, our classrooms, and our healthcare system, to name just a few.  But to revisit the very principles themselves—principles that created an environment where refugees like Sergey Brin could find asylum, an education, and the capital to create the world’s most innovative technology firms?  I can’t think of a better way to drain the Valley.

The stock hit an all-time high when Hasbro posted record annual revenue and breezed past Wall Street expectations, thanks largely to having sales in the girls category jump more than 50 percent last year. Hasbro wrested the rights from Mattel for Disney’s Princess and “Frozen” dolls in late 2014, and the company started producing and shipping the Disney lines last year. Intel drones went Gaga When Lady Gaga sang “God Bless America” during the Super Bowl halftime show, she had Intel outside. USA Today reported that Intel drones provided the prerecorded background — 300 Shooting Star drones showing the flag (and eventually the Pepsi logo). There were too many variables, such as weather, to do it live, but the company did a lot of testing in Houston before filming the display in one night, the newspaper reported. Is this the Super Troll? San Mateo’s Tile Inc. knows that fans of the Atlanta Falcons suffered a big loss, so it’s offering them a hand — and maybe a bit of a troll job. It will donate 51,000 Tiles to fans at various Atlanta locations Feb. 24, giving them a chance to use its devices, which you attach to keys, wallets or whatever else to make sure that nothing is lost.

PC Gamer News Reviews Hardware Pro Best Of More Magazine Meet the team Newsletter Signup Community Guidelines Affiliate Links About PC Gamer Search Popular Valve News Overwatch Call of Duty Hardware Guides Games of 2017 PC Gamer Weekender Intel patent shows a hybrid 2-in-1 with a detachable curved display By Paul Lilly Let's hope it's cheaper than Acer's Predator 21 X. Shares Microsoft's message to its hardware partners is clear—come up with "cool" designs and build more gaming PCs in 2017. Well, if it's innovation Microsoft wants, Intel may be the one to oblige with a laptop sporting a detachable curved screen display. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted Intel its requested patent for such a device, as was discovered by The Leaker. There are several diagrams visible in the patent application that show the laptop from multiple angles. Each one highlights the curved aspect of the 2-in-1 device, both the display portion and the base of the chassis. This is not the first time we've seen a laptop with a curved panel. Acer used one on its Predator 21 X that it showed off at CES earlier this year. However, that beastly configuration rings up at a dollar shy of $9,000. It's also big, presumably heavy, and doesn't allow for the screen to detach. It is a bit of an odd design. One angle seems to indicate that the keyboard is curved, though another diagram shows it with straight edges. It's not clear if perhaps the keyboard might bow so that only the edges make contact with the surface. That doesn't make a lot of sense to us though. To our knowledge, there are not any curved tablets out there, so that would be another first here (when detaching the display). We're not sure what the upshot would be—perhaps a curved display would rest easier on a lap?—but apparently Intel has something in mind. The patent also suggests that Intel is thinking about building its own hardware. If that is the case, it will be interesting to see if Intel goes the gaming route with discrete GPUs or highlights its own integrated graphics.

Besides the Patriots winning in a stunning comeback victory and Lady Gaga’s epic half-time performance, many people tuned into the football game of the season for nothing but the commercials.   With close to 100 million viewers, advertisers want to make a serious impression on the Super Bowl audience, whether it turns out for the best or worst. We have gathered the top 10 commercials of Super Bowl LI. Intel Commercial featuring Tom Brady Considering Tom Brady pulled off the comeback of the century and received his fifth title yesterday, he deserves endless praise. His performance in the Intel commercial, moreover, showed off his talented acting capabilities. In the commercial, the extremely good looking athlete completed routinely activities – like brushing his teeth – and Intel made these trivial experiences look epic. Bai’s Beverage Commercial Christopher Walken and Justin Timberlake starred in the advertisement for Bai . The commercial began somewhat uncomfortably, with Walken reciting what turns out to be NSYNC lyrics, it finishes hilariously in awkward silence as both stars look into the camera. It’s sure to be a crowd pleaser because anyone can appreciate Timberlake’s “bye, bye, bye” throwback and a clever pun. Honda CRV Ad The All-New Honda CRV commercial featured celebrities like Tina Fey, Amy Adams, Missy Elliott and Steve Carrell in pictures from their high school yearbooks. The moral of the commercial was to “chase your dreams,” even if it meant playing the clarinet in a colonial-looking suit (we appreciate you, Jimmy Kimmel). Sexy Mr. Clean Mr. Clean, the animated “Cleaner of Your Dreams” commercial was unexpected to say the least. Mr. Clean might as well have been named “Mr. Dirty” with his provocative cleaning moves in this commercial. But audiences seem to have no complaints. This humorous commercial offered some comedic relief during the nail biter of a game. Melissa McCarthy’s KIA Commercial Melissa McCarthy was a strong asset to the array of Super Bowl commercials this past weekend. Her charismatic personality immediately drew fans in, so watching her be the “hero” for Kia’s new Niro was one of the best parts of Super Bowl Sunday. T-Mobile featuring Snoop and Martha Stewart T-Mobile’s “Bag of Unlimited” commercial featured the stars Martha Stewart and Snoop Dog. Though Stewart seems to be talking about unlimited data, she actually is making marijuana related puns throughout the commercial. For example, she says “can of bisque,” instead of cannabis which was just one of the priceless jokes. This isn’t the first time Snoop and Stuart partnered up considering their show called “Martha and Snoops Potluck Dinner Party,” on VH1 in 2016. Bud Light Commercial This Super Bowl Commercial was witty, cute and ensured a living room full of laughter. The commercial focused on two men doing manly activities like playing sports, grilling, and drinking Bud Light. They are expressing how much they care for each other, whilst knee-deep in a bromance, and Guns N Rose’s “sweet child of mine” is playing in the background. Justin Beiber for T-Mobile Many were excited about T-Mobile’s commercial featuring the famous pop sensation, Justin Bieber. However, this commercial was down right strange. Bieber is a “celebration expert,” and claimed there are unlimited [dance] moves. On the other hand, one can appreciate Bieber’s dance moves in any circumstance. Turbo Tax’s Humpty Dumpty Turbo Tax strived to advertise taxes can be done anywhere, however, this commercial was too far-fetched for most people. Humpty Dumpty was seen doing taxes on his wall, but fell and ended up needing to go to the hospital with severe injuries. If you can’t handle vomit, I wouldn’t recommend watching this advertisement considering Humpty disgustingly vomits egg yolk. Airbnb makes a statement Last but not least, Airbnb’s advertisement was touching, especially considering the current divide in politics. With the mantras “we accept” and “we belong, it was moving and heartfelt to watch. Furthermore, Airbnb is currently offering housing for refugees in need in response to the travel ban recently ordered. If you don’t look closely, you may not even notice what company the ad is for. Simple and understated. Good job Airbnb!

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Feb 6, 2017 at 3:46PM What happened Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped on Monday in an apparent reaction to a bullish article that appeared on Barron's over the weekend. At 2:30 p.m. EST, the stock was up about 10.5%. So what The Barron's article argues that shares of AMD, which quadrupled last year, could double this year as the company launches new GPUs and CPUs that aim to challenge both NVIDIA and Intel. Ryzen, AMD's upcoming CPU, is set for an early March launch, while Vega, its high-end GPU, will be out sometime during the second quarter. The article argues that AMD is now a more focused and streamlined company under CEO Lisa Su, one that won't repeat past mistakes. AMD was a major force in the PC CPU market in 2006, but its market share has collapsed since then following a series of missteps. Intel has been able to run away with the high end of the market as a result. Image source: AMD. On the GPU side, NVIDIA has spent the past few years consolidating its lead. AMD has shown some progress with Polaris, its mainstream line of graphics cards launched last year, but the real test will be the high-end Vega. But its competitor owns the high end, and it won't take kindly to AMD's attempted intrusions. NVIDIA has found great success selling its GPUs into enterprise markets as accelerator cards, and the article argues that this presents an opportunity for AMD as well. Late last year, Alphabet's Google announced that it was installing AMD's GPUs into its cloud platform along with its competitor's, a big cloud win that AMD now needs to repeat with the other major cloud computing vendors. The article ends in an optimistic tone: "Supplying a brand-new market like cloud computing, where the rules are still being written, gives AMD an opportunity that lies well beyond being a second banana to Intel and Nvidia. It could even make AMD a much more strategic company with an importance all its own." Now what AMD still posted a loss in 2016, and its revenue is well below peak levels. Ryzen and Vega will need to do well in order to justify the current stock price, let alone another 100% increase. In the absolute best-case scenario, where both Ryzen and Vega are smash hits and AMD makes up some serious ground in the data center, a doubling of the stock price could make sense. But that seems like a long shot to me, especially given AMD's long history of disappointing investors.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Lenovo's ThinkPad P-Series mobile… Lenovo's ThinkPad P-Series mobile workstations pack Ultra HD, Quadro options By Kevin Parrish — February 6, 2017 11:30 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you Lenovo's new ThinkPad mobile workstations pack lots of power for on-the-go professionals, but could cost a hefty price for higher configurations. During the Solidworks World 2017 conference focusing on 3D CAD applications, Lenovo introduced three new mobile workstations sporting the latest processor from Intel for professionals. They fall under the company’s ThinkPad P-series family of devices packed with optional Nvidia Quadro graphics, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, and Ultra HD resolutions. Lenovo ThinkPad P71 Mobile Workstation Pictured above, this is the meatiest model of the trio and officially deemed as virtual reality ready. That is because customers have the option of choosing Nvidia’s Pascal-based Quadro P5000M discrete graphics chip for mobile workstations. It consists of 2,048 CUDA cores clocked at 1,513MHz, and a 256-bit memory interface supporting 16GB of dedicated GDDR5 memory. Other notable features in Lenovo’s new workstation include support for up to 64GB of system memory and four internal storage options consisting of two hard drive connections and two PCIe SSD slots.

While the Patriots were looking to be well on their way to an embarrassing, deflating defeat at the hands of the Atlanta Falcons, the Pepsi Zero Sugar Halftime Show was a distracting spectacle. In particular, the fleet of drones was very interesting. Unsurprisingly, the quadcopters featured at halftime are special drones. The Intel Shooting Star drone system created a 300-drone American flag in the night sky over Houston during the halftime show, which you can see in full here. “Each drone is about a foot long square, weighs just over eight ounces, and sports a plastic and foam body to soften inadvertent impacts.” The drones have onboard LEDs which can create up to four billion color combinations. How do they fly in formation? Lots of programming and preparation. The drones communicate wirelessly with a central computer and if a drone fails, perhaps due to a battery failure or losing GPS signal, a reserve drone flies in and takes its spot in mere seconds. It isn’t just the programming that requires extensive planning; it isn’t a matter of packing up 300 drones and launching them as you see fit over a football stadium. There are many rules and regulations in place, such as no drone flying within 34.5 miles of NRG Stadium, the site of Super Bowl LI, during the big game. What did Intel do to deal with the red tape? They filmed that portion of the halftime show earlier in the week.   Image credit: Intel Intel’s Anil Naduri, who oversees the company’s drones, hopes that the incredible technology might have more socially-impactful uses in the future. The drones could be used to save lives, such as when searching for lost hikers or trying to find people following a landslide where conditions which can be very dangerous for people on the ground. It’s difficult to predict when the Shooting Star drones might turn their attention away from entertainment and toward humanitarian work, but the potential is there and Intel is serious about it. In any case, for football fans and causal viewers alike, Super Bowl LI was one for the ages and Lady Gaga’s halftime show – and Intel’s drones – played a role in that.

The company is introducing the new Lenovo ThinkPad P51s, the P51, and the P71 at the event. The P51s is a workstation with a Ultrabook build thanks to its lightweight design — the device features a 4K UHD IPS display, comes with Intel’s latest 7th gen processors, and it also sports Nvidia’s Quadro GPU. Lenovo is also going to sell an optional IR camera with the device, and it also sports Thunderbolt 3. Moving on to Lenovo’s ThinkPad P71, you will be glad to know that it’s actually a VR-ready workstation, which means you can enjoy virtual reality experiences on the device by connecting a virtual reality headset. The device comes with Nvidia’s Pascal-based Quadro GPUs which makes it powerful enough to be able to power virtual reality headsets. It isn’t clear which processor the P71 comes with, but it likely includes Intel’s 7th gen processors. Bob Pette, the Vice President of Professional Visualization at Nvidia stated: “Content creators working with demanding VR workflows require the most robust and reliable performance possible. Lenovo’s VR-ready ThinkPad P71 with Quadro Pascal-based GPUs for mobile workstations provides the performance, features and memory required for creating the most compelling VR experiences anywhere.” In addition to the ThinkPad P71, the company is also introducing the P51. The P51 comes with a 4K IPS display that has a 100% color gamut. Both the P71 and P51 also comes with Intel’s latest Xeon processors, 2400MHz DD4 memory, and they are MIL-SPEC certified. Lenovo announced that the ThinkPad P51s will be available in March, starting at $1,049. The ThinkPad P51 and P71 will be available in April, starting at $1,399 and $1,849, respectively.

Top News U.S. News World News Voices Entertainment Movies Music TV Odd News Defense Energy Sports Fantasy Football NFL NBA MLB NHL Golf Tennis College Football College Basketball Science Health Photos Latest Photos 2016 Olympics News Entertainment Sports Features Archives Archive The Almanac Search Home / Top News / U.S. News Apple, Facebook, Microsoft among 97 companies fighting Trump legally on travel ban By Allen Cone   |   Feb. 6, 2017 at 1:06 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo Feb. 6 (UPI) -- Ninety-seven U.S. companies, including Apple, Facebook, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter, filed a legal callenge to President Donald Trump's executive order on entry into the United States because it "violates the immigration laws and the Constitution." Most on the list are tech companies. Non-tech firms include include yogurt producer Chobani, snack maker Kind and fashion brand Levi Strauss, which immigrants founded. The motion, filed Sunday night with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, seeks permission to file an amicus, or "friend of the court," brief. The appeals court is considering an appeal by the U.S. government after a federal judge in Seattle on late Friday issued a temporary restraining order halting the entry ban. On Sunday morning, the appeals court denied the U.S. government's emergency request to immediately resume the travel ban. The executive order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Earlier, Amazon and Expedia joined the Washington attorney general's lawsuit, arguing the order will hurt their employees and businesses. Because Amazon is part of the original suit, a company spokesperson said that Washington state's attorney general preferred that it not join the other suit. The tech firms' legal challenge says the ban is "a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies." "Immigrants make many of the nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies," the brief says. "At the same time, America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm but it has done so while maintaining the fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country." Uber is part of the challenge and its CEO, Travis Kalanick, on Thursday dropped out of Trump's business advisory council, citing the executive order. Tesla did not join the other companies and CEO Elon Musk, who also runs SpaceX, remains part of the advisory council, saying he wants to deal directly with Trump on immigration issues. The original 19-member Strategic and Policy Forum will "meet with the president frequently," according to an announcement by the transition team in December. "America has the most innovative and vibrant companies in the world, and the pioneering CEOs joining this forum today are at the top of their fields," Trump said in a statement at the time.

She didn't do it when everyone thought she did. 02/06/2017 12:09 pm ET | Updated 4 days ago 3.6k Cavan Sieczkowski Deputy Director, News & Analytics Lady Gaga’s roof jump at the Super Bowl was one of the most surprising moments of her halftime show, but apparently there was some Hollywood magic involved. On Sunday night, after singing verses from “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land” surrounded by drones, Gaga appeared to jump off the roof of Houston’s NRG Stadium from hundreds of feet in the air, suspended by only a few cables with a microphone in hand.  Fox/NFL While the live broadcast made it look to people watching on TVs across the country as if Gaga had catapulted off the roof, TMZ revealed Monday that it was actually just a perfect illusion. Her jump was pre-recorded.  A video posted by Jill Knipp Faucher (@jillyknipp) on Feb 5, 2017 at 5:16pm PST Intel spoke with USA Today about needing to pre-record the opening portion of the Super Bowl halftime show because of particular uncertainties, like rain or wind.  “There’s a lot of weather and environment (issues),” general manager Natalie Cheung said. “In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl Day. We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team, as well as the Super Bowl creative team, felt this would be best to be filmed. Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium.” Live or not, Gaga deserves some serious credit for getting up there at all.  Also on HuffPost: Super Bowl Halftime Show 2017 Super Bowl Halftime Show 2017 1 of 20 HOUSTON, TX - FEBRUARY 05: Lady Gaga performs during the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston, Texas.

If something happens blame him and court sysImage Credit: AFP U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump reacts as a marching bad performs while they arrive aImage Credit: Reuters‹› Published: 15:32 February 6, 2017 Agencies   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Washington: Nearly 100 companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, banded together on Sunday to file a legal brief opposing President Donald Trump’s temporary travel ban, arguing that it “inflicts significant harm on American business.”  The brief, filed in the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, included Facebook, Twitter, Intel, eBay, Netflix and Uber, as well as non-tech companies such as Levi Strauss and Chobani. Lawyers for Washington state and Minnesota have told the federal appellate court that restoring the ban  would “unleash chaos again.” The filing  in San Francisco came after the White House said it expected the federal courts to reinstate the ban. Washington and Minnesota said their underlying lawsuit was strong and a nationwide temporary restraining order was appropriate. If the appellate court reinstated Trump’s ban the states said the “ruling would reinstitute those harms, separating families, stranding our university students and faculty, and barring travel.” “The order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than fifty years,” the brief from 97 companies stated. “Immigrants or their children founded more than 200 of the companies on the Fortune 500 list.”  The rapid-fire legal manoeuvres by the two states were accompanied by briefs filed by John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former secretaries of state, along with former national security officials under President Barack Obama. The government had until 3pm PST (2300 GMT) yesterday to submit additional legal briefs to the appeals court in support of Trump’s executive order.  Related Links US warns Iran against testing Trump’s resolve Trump’s attack on US judiciary indefensible Is Europe parting ways with the US? Help comes from US for Iranian hardliners Trump’s actions come under the scanner Trump’s rollercoaster promises a wild ride Following that, the court is expected to act quickly, and a decision either way may ultimately result in the case reaching the US Supreme Court. Trump immigration ban bound for supreme court President Donald Trump’s effort to bar travellers from seven mostly Muslim nations is on a track to the US Supreme Court, which may eventually decide whether the executive branch has top authority on immigration and national security. The ban affecting business travellers, students, immigrants and refugees may be re-imposed as early as Monday if an appeals court freezes a judge’s temporary restraining order blocking it while the legal fight continues over whether it’s constitutional. “Overturning the ruling would cause such anguish and confusion at the borders,” said Jayashri Srikantiah, a Stanford Law School professor who specialises in immigration. She said it’s “extremely hard to bet” as to what the appeals court will do, “but one can imagine the confusion caused by reversing the TRO is something the court is taking into consideration.” The Trump administration is asking the liberal-leaning US Court of Appeals in San Francisco to throw out the restraining order won by Washington state and Minnesota, which contend the travel ban hurts their residents and employers including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and the Mayo Clinic. Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin filed a motion on Sunday to join Minnesota and Washington in the lawsuit opposing Trump’s travel ban. Minnesota and Washington met a deadline early Monday morning to file their argument against that request, while the US Justice Department has until 3pm. Monday to make its final argument. A decision could come anytime after that and the losing side may make a quick run to the Supreme Court. “Those who were abroad were blocked from returning home,” the two states said in the filing. “Husbands were separated from wives, brothers from sisters and parents from their children.” Trump has reacted with attacks on the federal judge and then the wider court system which he blames for stymieing his efforts to restrict immigration, a central promise of the Republican’s 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats, meanwhile, sought to use Trump’s attacks on the judiciary to raise questions about the independence of his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. Protests, Lawsuits Trump’s January 27 executive order blocked or delayed travellers, including those with visas and permanent residents with green cards, from entering the country. The detention of dozens and the return of others to their departure points set off spontaneous protests and a storm of litigation, mostly on behalf of individuals. The cases including those involving state attorneys general have led to mixed rulings, some of them blocking parts of Trump’s executive order. The case brought by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson and joined by Minnesota made the most sweeping arguments against the ban, citing the economic damage as well as the personal toll on residents of the state. US District Judge James Robart, in granting the restraining order on Friday, concluded the states were likely to win the case when the substance of their arguments was reviewed in more depth later when a longer-lasting order is considered. The president has discretion in matters of national security involving immigration, the Justice Department contends. In its appeal, the Justice Department said the Seattle ruling should be put on hold because it conflicts with a 1982 Supreme Court opinion stating that immigrants’ constitutional privileges must be approved by the US upon initial entry. The judge also failed to “confront” Congress’s judgement that the “president should have the unreviewable authority to suspend the admission of any class of alien,” it said. The states contend the president’s edict discriminates against immigrants and permanent US residents and violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The states allege that Trump’s executive order violates the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which protect rights to religious freedom and equal protection. Supreme Court If the federal government fails to persuade the appeals court to block the order, it might petition the Supreme Court to intervene. Five of the eight justices would be needed to reverse that decision. “I think it’s unlikely this makes it to the Supreme Court,” said Kathleen Kim, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “I believe that if the Supreme Court wants to maintain its integrity as a majoritarian body serving as a legitimate system for checks and balances, it will not consider an appeal.” That would leave the merits of the arguments to be debated in a Seattle courtroom, with the case and perhaps others making their way to the top court for review in months or even years — especially if appeals courts issue conflicting rulings on whether it’s legal. The immigration case has already cropped up in the confirmation process for Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, with Democrats questioning whether he would be able to check Trump’s exercise of executive power. Gorsuch, a conservative who favours originalism when interpreting the Constitution, could be the tiebreaking vote on the currently split court. Liberal Leaning Before then, the San Francisco appeals court might be hard to predict, too. The court covers most of the western US, with jurisdiction over Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, covering about 20 per cent of the US population. All but a quarter of its judges were appointed by Democratic presidents. The court’s reputation as a liberal bastion was reinforced by some of its rulings in the past year. In November, the court blocked Arizona from enforcing its ban on so-called ballot harvesting, a practice favoured by Democrats because it allows voters in remote areas to have their ballots brought to the polls by another person. In June, the court threw out an earlier ruling striking California’s strict laws on who can carry concealed weapons. Still, a three-judge panel may be reluctant to allow the temporary order to remain in effect because the law is very restrictive when it comes to allowing states to represent others, said John Banzhaf, a professor at George Washington University Law School. “The idea that one judge in one jurisdiction after a relative brief hearing shut down an entire governmental operation directed by the president is somewhat disconcerting to many people,” Banzhaf said. “It is very unusual, almost rare but not unprecedented, for a district court to issue an order covering not only the United States of America but dozens of people in foreign countries. The court may blanch at that.” More from USA Rain Enhancement Science winner files patent The titanium clue... What comes next in Trump travel ban case?

Google got things started with a minute-long spot that touted its voice-activated assistant, Google Home (which apparently also set off the devices in people’s houses, thanks to the ad’s repetition of “Okay, Google”). Not to be outdone, Amazon plugged its own version, the Echo, and threw in a teaser for the arrival of its drone delivery service. Airbnb got political, which is a bit ironic given its problems with racism. Hyundai and Intel, meanwhile, each went big on 360-degree video. Even IBM’s Watson (whatever it is) made an(other) appearance, as did services ranging from web hosting to robotic investment advisors. As for the business of Super Bowl advertising? It’s booming: a record $5 million for each thirty seconds of air time proved that cord-cutting isn’t harming America’s biggest night in television—at least not yet. Do you need The Download?

Companies Come Out in Support of Immigration With the Trump administration’s immigration ban on hold since Friday, Tech companies have taken the opportunity to weigh in. News emerged last night that 97 companies—from Apple to Zynga, as Bloomberg put it—had filed an amicus brief in federal appeals court in support of the State of Washington’s case against Trump. Apart from quoting John F. Kennedy and arguing that ban of immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations violates the Constitution, the brief states that the ban “is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies,” mainly because it “hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent” and “makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace.” You can read the brief in its entirety here. A decision on the Department of Justice’s appeal is expected sometime this week, after which the case may end up before the Supreme Court. Encryption Fight, Redux Last year’s showdown between Apple and the FBI over an encrypted iPhone fizzled without a clear resolution. Encryption in consumer services and devices is only growing, though, and our own Mike Orcutt examines how things could play out when (not if) the issue rears its head again. Among the possibilities: If the feds don’t want a repeat performance of the Apple standoff, they might instead seek to compel a messaging service like WhatsApp to help investigators read messages written by suspected criminals. Failing that, action could come from Congress or the Trump administration—last year, Donald Trump called for a boycott of Apple when it defied the feds, while an encryption working group in the House of Representatives said weakening encryption was “against the national interest.” No matter where things head next, one thing is sure: this fight is far from over. Ten Fascinating Things That swarm of 300 drones flying above Lady Gaga at the Super Bowl halftime show was pretty cool. But there are two things you should know about it: First, it was pre-recorded, mainly because of FAA restrictions. Second, Intel and Disney have been collaborating on the Shooting Stars, as they’re called, for a while now. They’ve been putting on a show at Disney World, and Intel upped the swarm to a Guinness record 500 drones during a flight over Sydney last year. The company says its system could handle a swarm of up to 10,000 at once. Boeing has announced that its next-generation crewed space capsule, the Starliner, will be built using hundreds of 3-D printed parts. In the last week, the new FCC chief Ajit Pai has quiety rolled back a slew of regulations that businesses fought for years. With policies like net neutrality on the chopping block, we examined what the Internet might look like in the near future. It’s a simple question, with profound implications: Does AI pose a threat to Christianity? So, China now leads the world in installed solar energy capacity. But don’t be fooled—the country’s solar boom has resulted in huge amounts of clean power going to waste. A vigilante hacker has executed a massive takedown of a Dark Web hosting service, apparently in retaliation for allowing child pornography sites to proliferate. France will hold its presidential election in April, and Facebook is partnering with eight French media companies to set up a system for fighting fake news. Can the federal government order tech companies to cough up records stored overseas for use in U.S. investigations? Microsoft and Google have fought big court battles over this question—Microsoft won theirs, but Google just lost. As the center of China’s plans to strengthen its military is a new reliance on the power of AI. Quote of the Day "Everybody is concerned about trade wars. If trade stops, war starts." —Alibaba CEO Jack Ma speaking over the weekend about his concerns that the Trump administration’s opposition to global trade deals could lead to more than just disputes over the exchange of goods.

Two former Secretaries of State, John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, have also backed the challenge saying Trump's order undermines national security and will endanger US troops in the field, even as the matter is headed to the U.S Supreme Court. The amicus curiae (literally, friend of the court) brief that allows someone who is not party to the case to pitch in with arguments was filed after a federal judge in Seattle temporarily suspended Trump's order pending a wider legal review. The ruling has opened the door for refugees and visa holders from seven red-flagged Muslim-majority countries to re-enter the US again, amid outrage from President Trump who on Sunday said the judge had put the country in peril and suggested he and the court system should be held responsible ''if something happens.'' ''The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!" Trump tweeted on Sunday, after mocking what he termed as a ''ridiculous'' ruling of the ''so-called'' judge. Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 ''Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!'' he added. But the best of American businesses stood up for immigrants, who many believe are the eventual targets of the travel restrictions that has begun with the ban on nationals of the seven Muslim-majority countries. There have been sporadic reports of immigrants, including Indians, being targeted by hate groups who believe the Trump election is a mandate to roll back immigration and what they see as the ''browning of America.'' That fringe view, prevalent mostly in Middle America, is being vigorously contested by US businesses, mostly based on the East Coast and West Coast that have thrived on immigration. Some of the concern also goes back to widely cited remarks by Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon during his days as a radio host that there are far too many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley and a country is more than its economy. In their brief, US tech companies argued that ''Immigrants make many of the nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies,'' while maintaining that the tremendous impact of immigrants on America -- and on American business -- is not happenstance. ''People who choose to leave everything that is familiar and journey to an unknown land to make a new life necessarily are endowed with drive, creativity, determination - and just plain guts,'' they said, adding that ''The energy they bring to America, is a key reason why the American economy has been the greatest engine of prosperity and innovation in history.'' The brief also recognized the importance of security saying America ''has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm...but it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants - through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country.'' The brief was filed late on Sunday with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco and is expected to come up for hearing on Monday evening. Legal experts see the matter landing very quickly in the US Supreme Court which is currently tied at 4-4 between liberal and conservative justices with a Trump nominated conservative judge yet to be confirmed by the Senate where Democrats have pledged to oppose him. A tie in the Supreme Court will leave the decisions of the lower courts intact. The signatories to the brief include non-tech companies such as jeans legend Levi Strauss &co and yogurt-maker Chobani, besides familiar new-age Silicon Valley names such as AirBnB, PayPal, LinkedIn etc. Some of the companies have been rattled by pressure from users who are typically better-educated and higher-earning than Trump constituents.

In total, more than 120 companies are backing an 'amicus brief', a legal document offering official support to the State of Washington in its case against the president's 90-day travel ban affecting seven countries whose populations are mostly Muslim. The executive order, issued by the president in late January, blocked travellers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the US, before being temporarily struck down by a federal judge. A fierce battle is now underway in attempts to determine the legitimacy of the ban. As well as public condemnation from activists, civil rights groups and world leaders, the travel ban has also drawn sharp criticism from Silicon Valley. Virtually every major tech company has slammed the order, and the list of firms officially opposing it is now a who's-who of top tech talent. Alongside luminaries like Google, Facebook, Citrix and Microsoft, the list is now joined by HP Inc, Adobe, Slack, Brocade and more. In what may be a particularly embarrassing blow to the president, Elon Musk's companies, Tesla and SpaceX, are also part of the latest batch of additions. Musk sits on the president's Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory panel that meets with Trump regularly. Although Musk's role on the panel has drawn condemnation from some quarters, he maintains that he does not support or endorse the current administration, He also argued that it was important he advise Trump - precisely because he does not agree with him. Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 5, 2017 The brief was filed on Sunday on behalf of 96 tech signatories, saying Trump's travel ban was harmful to business. Travellers from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia were affected by the ban, but a Washington state legal challenge led to a federal judge temporarily blocking the order. An appeals court rejected a White appeal, and now a full case must be heard from the justice department as well as two states who mounted the legal challenge, Washington and Minnesota. A decision is expected later this month, but will only determine whether the travel ban should be kept on hold or not while courts decide on its legality. 06/02/2017: 100 tech firms say Trump's travel ban is bad for business Nearly 100 tech companies including Apple, Box, Intel and Google have signed a legal document saying their "operations are affected" by US President Donald Trump's travel ban. The executive order imposing the 90-day ban on travel from seven Muslim-majority countries is already the subject of several legal challenges, including one from the state of Washington, which has called it "unlawful and unconstitutional". A total of 97 tech firms filed an amicus brief to the US's Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the travel ban is economically harmful and that it represents a significant break with the US's previous immigration stance. "The Order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than fifty years," the brief, also signed by the likes of Airbnb, Microsoft and Lyft, states. "The Order inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth as a result. The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for US companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees. It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States." By filing the brief, the companies hope to demonstrate the travel ban will harm US businesses' operations and that it is unlawful. Trump's executive order, issued on 27 January, banned travellers and refugees from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia. Critics claim the ban is anti-religious, something the Trump administration denies. During his campaign, Trump discussed the idea of building a database of Muslims. Washington state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, filed the legal challenge to Trump's travel ban that resulted in a Seattle federal judge temporarily blocking the order from being enforced nationwide last Friday. An appeals court rejected the White House's appeal on Saturday, meaning the case must be heard in full, with both Washington and Minnesota states, as well as the justice department, being asked to give more evidence today, before an expected decision later this month. That decision only concerns whether the ban should remain on hold while courts decide on its legality.

Bezos explained he's supporting the Washington State attorney general, the first state official to say they will be suing Trump over his executive order. “We reached out to congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle to explore legislative options. Our legal team has prepared a declaration of support for the Washington state attorney general who will be filing suit against the order. We are working other legal options as well,” said Bezos. On Saturday evening, Amazon issued its first letter to employees saying anyone affected by Trump's immigration policy will recieve the full support of the company. It urged those affected by the ban not to leave the country and said it would offer legal resources for those originating from the seven countries Trump has blacklisted, as well as their families. "From the very beginning, Amazon has been committed to equal rights, tolerance and diversity – and we always will be," the company said in its statement. Bezos joins other tech leaders including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who have both offered their support for company employees who may be affected by the policy. Travel service Expedia's boss also announced his distaste for Trump's executive order. “The president’s order represents the worst of his proclivity toward rash action versus thoughtfulness. Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen.” 30/01/2017: Tim Cook slams Trump's immigration policies Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has hit out at US president Donald Trump's immigration policies, saying the company would not exist if it weren't for immigrants being allowed to move freely across borders. “Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,” wrote Cook in an email to Apple staff obtained by tech website Recode. “I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support.” He quoted civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King in the email, saying: "We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now," which at least went some way to explain how Apple would support those who may no longer be able to re-enter the country or could be subjected to tougher reforms in the future. He told employees Apple would support any employee who feels they are at risk and he will work closely with the company's HR, legal and security teams to give them the help they need to remain in the country. "As I've said many times, diversity makes our team stronger," he said. "And if there’s one thing I know about the people at Apple, it’s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It’s as important now as it’s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued." President Trump's executive order restricts immigration from seven Muslim countries for 90 days, suspends any refugees trying to enter the country for 120 days and bars all Syrians seeking refuge indefinitely.

A total of 97 companies -- including Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix and Twitter -- filed a court motion Sunday night declaring that Trump's executive order on immigration "violates the immigration laws and the Constitution." Almost all the companies that signed on in support are tech companies. The few exceptions include yogurt producer Chobani, snack maker Kind and fashion brand Levi Strauss. All three companies were founded by immigrants. The ban represents "a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies," says the court document. It's the latest move by the tech industry to oppose Trump's controversial order, which has run into hurdles in the U.S. court system. The motion was filed with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on Sunday morning denied the U.S. government's emergency request to resume Trump's travel ban. The appeals court has asked for both sides to file legal briefs before it makes a final decision. The lawsuit in question was filed by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota. The motion from the 97 companies seeks permission to file what's known as an amicus ("friend of the court") brief in the case. The San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit has a reputation as one of the most liberal in the nation. No matter how it rules, the next stop for the case is likely be the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump's executive order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days and all refugees from entering for 120 days. It also indefinitely halts refugees from Syria. Tech companies have been at the vanguard of businesses opposing the ban. Their court motion filed Sunday night emphasizes the important role of immigration in the U.S. economy. "Immigrants make many of the Nation's greatest discoveries, and create some of the country's most innovative and iconic companies," it says. "At the same time, America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm," it adds. "But it has done so while maintaining the fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants -- through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country." It's not the first legal move by tech firms over Trump's ban. Amazon and Expedia filed motions last week in the Washington attorney general's lawsuit. They argued the immigration order will hurt their employees and their businesses. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick on Thursday dropped out of Trump's business advisory council, citing the ban. "The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America," Kalanick wrote in a memo to employees. "Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants." Uber and its rival Lyft both support the motion filed Sunday. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has defended his decision to take part in the advisory council, saying it's better to be on the inside where he can push Trump on issues like immigration and climate change. Tesla is not a signatory to the motion. Copyright 2017 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Abstract: As new use cases emerge in the personal electronics market, the processors that run them must evolve to meet the changing requirements. In 1990, the productivity era drove growth in personal computers and laptops. In 2000, the connectivity era brought with it smart phones and tablets. And in 2010, with assistance of WiFi, the world became connected in real time everywhere through social media (FaceTime, IM, Skype, Twitter), live streaming, and interactive gaming. A new era of essential devices to improve quality of life is now upon us. These essential devices, also known as the Internet of Things (IoT), require a step function improvement in power and performance efficiency together with extreme reliability requirements. This paper will explore how processors have evolved with attributes such as configurability and extensibility to enable the next generation of electronics. I. INTRODUCTION In the productivity era of the 1990s, PCs and laptops eventually reached a point that more performance from their processors did not add any value. Other features and electronics started to evolve around the PC/laptop such as thin, light, large screen monitors, portable mice, faster modems and routers. Then came an era focused on connectivity and mobility where the smart phone and tablet were at the center of innovation. But now even they are reaching maturity, any further performance improvement for the microprocessor seems unnecessary. The maturity is evident by: The smart phone camera goes over 10 mega pixels The audio and video quality of smart phone is as good as business video conferencing Kids watch video on smart phone rather than TV More games are played on smart phone than portable game consoles Now we are seeing the emergence of new connected devices such smart cars, medical monitors, and smart cards that are becoming “life-essential” [1]. Many fall into the category commonly known as the internet of things (IoT) and are driving processor requirements beyond what was needed by PCs and smart phones. Some of the unique requirements for life-essential devices include financial and medical security and reliability, ultra-low power capabilities for weeks/months of battery life, support for safety standards to enable autonomous driving, and reliability to sustain device lifespans of 15+ years. These requirements are driving the evolution of a new type of processor in which application optimized with configurability and extensibility. This paper explores the evolution of processors over the years and explains the reason for the genesis of a new wave of processors for the next-generation applications for the next 20 years II. BACKGROUND Microprocessors are an important differentiation for many companies [2]. Intel® became the largest semiconductor company in the world with X86 processors. Intel and AMD are integrated circuit producers that provide microprocessor design, full software support, fabrication, assembly, packaging, and production test. The microprocessor chip can be purchased off the shelf and built into the PC/laptop. For smart phones and tablets, a new model emerged – processor as an intellectual property (IP) where the customer pays for a license to use the core in the design of a chip and pays a royalty fee based on the number of chips sold. The business model is completely different, with the processor IP becoming part of system-on-chip (SoC) design. This processor IP business is successful as illustrated by the recent acquisition of ARM® by Softbank for 32 billion dollars. The processor IP was still a fixed design and compiler that was provided off the shelf. Customers could not modify the RTL and had very limited options in terms of configurability. The SoC design is harder to copy, but most components on the SoC are off-the-shelf IPs. As the market evolves to include more life-essential devices such as smart cards, medical devices and fitness monitors, yet another type of processor IP is needed. The ability to configure and extend a processor to meet the requirements of the application is a promising new technology model for processors. It provides high degrees of flexibility with the ability for the SoC developer to include custom instructions that are unknown to their competitors. The SoC design can also reach the optimal tradeoffs in performance, power and area by customize the processor IP to the application requirements. Also, the customization of processor technology provides the ability to meet evolving standards. With the wide variety of applications and requirements today, from consumer to automotive, there are just too many different types of applications to standardize on a single fixed processor IP. Synopsys’ DesignWare® ARC® processors are an example of a configurable and extensible processor that is well positioned to ride the wave of the era of lifeessential devices. III. BUSINESS MODEL FOR CONFIGURABLE PROCESSOR Design flexibility is enhanced in this wave of processor designs. The IP model allows significant customer adaptation in the SoC design where power, performance, and area (PPA ), security, and flexibility are the highest priorities. Key attributes of a processor to drive successful next-generation designs include: Significant improvement in power and area. With configurability, processors can be tailored to achieve an optimum PPA for a given target application and specific type of memory. Ease of adding custom instructions and hardware accelerators. Ability to add security features that can be customized to an application as well as to the semiconductor; using obfuscation techniques known only to the SoC developer and no one else. Processor IP that comes with certification from industry recognized consultants or standards bodies, for example ISO 26262 ASIL D ready certification. Highly integrated synthesis flow for optimal PPA. Simple business model, in which the processor IP is licensed with mix and match of hardware accelerators per the customer’s need. Having the same processor IP platform with many possible configurations makes it easier for customers to provide product variation and support future upgrades. As previously stated, the configurability provides the customers with (1) product differentiation and (2) faster time to market without the burden (and expense) of hiring a full processor design team. This generation of processor covers all aspects of PPA for the specific application, resulting in a tailored processor within the PPA triangle as shown in Figure 1. The optimal solution for a design is moving toward the center of the PPA triangle. The configurable processor IP allows simpler trade-offs to reach the optimal design. Fig. 1. Microprocessors PPA Triangle An SoC generally consists of many cores, one or multiple application CPUs, a graphic processing unit, hardware accelerators for audio/video/imaging, and a power-management core. The configurable and extensible processor can provide options to unify many of these cores. All the cores could use variants of a single ISA and both hardware and software can be reused. Synopsys’ ARCv2 ISA is an extensible instruction set, with support for optional and predefined extensions, and a mechanism for creating variable-length extensions. The compiler technology includes the extensible instructions. IV. APPLICATIONS OF CONFIGURABLE MICROPROCESSOR A. Advantages of configurable processors One key advantage of configurable processors is that the same processor ISA can used for all designs. Processors can be adapted to the application with the addition of custom instructions and configurable functional units. The advantages of adding custom instruction that are included in the compiler are: Ease of software pipelining, the custom instructions are part of the instruction set which are optimized by the compiler. Ease of adding custom instructions and hardware accelerators, the hardware accelerator operations are part of the instruction pipeline execution; no need for interrupts or status polling. Ease of adding and removing functional units, i.e. if integer divide is not used in application code, then it should not be part of the processor. Ease of configuring instruction and data memories. The exact size and type of memory, close coupled or cache, are used for optimal size and power. The configurable microprocessor provides the exact requirements for an application with ease of integration. Another main goal of configurable and extensible microprocessor is to shorten the customers design B. Extremely Low Power and Security Many applications, such as drones, smart cards, medical monitor devices, and wearable devices, need extremely low power to operate because of its size or extended required operation time. Some applications devices such as medical devices and smart bank cards require security features which should be known only by the developer. The combination of low power and security is a very tough goal to achieve. The below example of SHA-256 cryptographic standard implementations help demonstrate the trade-offs achieved through the use of extensibility to create a hybrid hardware/software. The diagram below illustrates the performance and area trade-offs of a “pure” software implementation of SHA- 256 (running on a baseline core), a “pure” hardware solution, and the hybrid solution based on using hardware extensions to accelerate a software algorithm. As seen in Figure 2, with the addition of simple extension instructions allowing specific bit manipulation and shifting tailored to the algorithm, significant performance can be achieved with very low gate count. In the hybrid solution, the SHA-256 algorithm instructions are part of the ISA with inline execution and minimal hardware addition; the control logic and state machine of the hardware SHA solution is part of the microprocessor. Fig. 2. ARC EM processor Security Options C. Tools and Design Flow As mentioned earlier, Synopsys ARC processors exemplify the qualities of a processor ideal for the next generation of SoC design. As an example, the ARC EM processors exhibit leadership PPA with 1.81 DMIPs/MHz performance efficiency, as little as 3uW/MHz power consumption, and as low as 0.01mm2 area in a 28-nm HPM process. ARC EM processors also provide a full range of configurable features such as the ability to tailor the design to the specific application requirements, extensibility with custom instructions/hardware through APEX technology, and certifications for automotive safety applications. Furthermore, Synopsys’ ARChitect configuration tool eases the process of putting it all together (Figure 3). The ARC processor environment includes compilers, debuggers, simulators, synthesis, backend and development systems. It is important for a processor IP vendor to supply all necessary tools to shorten the time to market for customers. Click to enlarge Fig. 3. Architect Tool for SoC Configuration Two things that life-essential devices generally have in common are that they incorporate sensors to collect data and connectivity to transmit and receive data. For example, the smart band design includes medical monitoring, a gyroscope to detect falling, and Bluetooth to connect to the internet for sending information directly to medical providers. As noted above, the exact configuration and extensibility to include the sensors as part of the processor provide the optimal power for these applications. As many SoC developers know, designing a system does not stop at the core. Memory, peripherals, drivers and software libraries all factor into the design process. This is a key reason that Synopsys offers ARC-based subsystems, including the DesignWare Smart Sensor and Control Subsystem, which consist of an ARC EM processor, tightly-coupled peripherals and memory, application specific hardware accelerators, and production ready software libraries (Figure 4): Host Interface: AHB bus, JTAG, UART, I2C Slave Sensor and Actuator Connectivity: Power Management UART DAC/ADC GPIO SPI I2C APB Interface CREG Hardware accelerators: Filtering Accelerators Interpolation Vector Processing Fast Math Accelerators Fig. 4. DesignWare Smart Sensor and Control Subsystem [3] The ARC EM processor based subsystem targets many different types of applications, including: Industrial: real-time control, robotics Automotive: ABS, digital motor control, electric power steering, in-vehicle networking Consumer: mobile phone/tablet sensor, E-metering, home automation, connected appliances, Portable medical devices: blood-pressure monitors, heart-rate monitor, digital thermometer D. Intelligent Sensor Application Example Intelligent Sensor, a reference design, provided in the ARC Databook [4] is shown in Figure 5. The following ARC EM5D processor features are configurable, allowing the customer to remove them if not required: DSP fixed point functions: SINCOS, SQRT 16-bit program counter (PC) 8-bit loop counter (LC) registers Sixteen core registers 16 KB closely coupled memories for instructions 4 KB closely coupled memories for data Seven external interrupts I/O functions: ADC Master, CREG Control, CREG Observation, I2C Slave Software drivers that are part of the I/O library Implement a process that frequently processes raw sensory data that is acquired by the AD Controller. Fig. 5. Intelligent Sensor Hardware Block Diagram Figure 6 shows the energy consumption comparison between the Synopsys’ Smart Sensor and Control Subsystem and the ARM M0 & M4, demonstrating the power efficiencies that can be achieved through the use of the ARC configurable and extensible architecture optimized to sensor domain applications. Fig. 6. Performance Comparison SUMMARY The characteristic of the last two generations of the microprocessor-related products, the PC/laptop and the smart phone/tablet, is the mass worldwide appeal to young and old and for personal and business use. The next big market is not a single product but an explosion of a multitude of life-essential applications. The processor market is faced with a variety of challenges as demands for higher performance coupled with longer battery life and the need for security grow in emerging applications. The configurable and extensible processor is the next generation in the processor family tree. It is exciting to talk about the evolving capacities enabled by the new class of processors for smart automobiles, smart cards, smart homes, drones, and connected medical monitoring devices. This new class of processor enables many possibilities and many opportunities to enhance the quality of life. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Acknowledge contributions from marketing department of Synopsys.

Massive memory capacity flattens server costs You don't have to wait for Intel and Micron. Diablo's Memory1 DIMMs are now qualified with several vendors and the price/performance is stunning. Here's what you need to know. By Robin Harris for Storage Bits | February 6, 2017 -- 13:22 GMT (05:22 PST) | Topic: Storage There are new peaks to scale.Robin Harris We don't have to wait for Intel and Micron. Diablo's Memory1 product is now qualified on HP's Cloudline, SuperMicro, and Inspur servers for internet service providers. It's real and it's here today. Currently, a Memory1 DIMM is 128GB, but expect 256GB versions later this year. Even with the current kit, a 1U server can support up to 2TB of physical memory - perfect for Big Data applications. Spark! special feature The Evolution of Enterprise Storage How to plan, manage, and optimize enterprise storage to keep up with the data deluge. Read More Big Data apps hammer storage subsystems because their bandwidth demands swamp high-end I/O capacities. Putting mass storage on the even faster memory bus solves that problem. You could use 128GB DRAM DIMMs, but they are both costly and power/cooling hungry. Memory1 uses NAND flash, which is much cheaper than DRAM, in conjunction with their Linux DMX driver, to provide massive capacity at an affordable price, while using far less power. Tests run on the Apache Spark analytics platform show what massive memory capacity can do for cloud economics. A financial customer ran a Spark SQL test and found they got 24 percent faster response times with one quarter the number of servers. Obviously, that's a major financial benefit. MySQL In another customer benchmark, the large capacity of Memory1 increased MySQL performance by 13x, response time latency by 10x, while reducing capital expense by 86 percent. That last number will put a smile on even the most dour CFO's face. The Storage Bits take After decades in the industry, I'm a confirmed skeptic of all shiny new technologies. But I see a straight line benefit from high-capacity flash-based memory to your bottom line: more performance; fewer servers; lower costs; equals more bang for the buck. This is NOT a PC technology today, but Diablo stresses that their DMX driver, which handles data placement to maximize performance, is technology independent. When and if 3D XPoint makes it to the market, or any other DRAM substitute, such as Nantero's carbon nanotube memory, DMX can optimize it for server use. If Big Data is giving you headaches, you owe it to yourself to see what Diablo's Memory1 can do for your servers. In a world where CPU performance is flat, putting massive capacity on the memory bus is the Next Big Thing for performance and cost improvement. Courteous comments welcome, of course.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MARKETING Guest Mixed reality will soon mean big business for brands Keith Curtin, See Digital@kfcurtin February 6, 2017 5:40 AM Tags: Apple, AR, augmented reality, brands, iPhone, marketing, Marketing Weekly, Mixed Reality, MR, ve, virtual reality Image Credit: See Digital Are brands ready for mixed reality? The answer is a resounding no!  Fortunately, there’s still time left to prepare for one of the biggest digital transformations of all time. Reports suggest that a collection of the world’s leading tech companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, Huawei, LG, Acer, Intel, Meta, Magic Leap, and ODG are all planning to double down on mixed reality (MR) this year by bringing affordable devices to the masses. In particular, excitement continues to grow over speculation that Apple may be ready to unveil its MR device in the coming months to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone. Tim Cook has recently made bold statements about augmented reality (AR), indicating his company will have a major horse in the race. Many analysts believe that horse will be the dominant front-runner. ‘AR is going to be as important as eating three meals a day, and once it’s arrived, we will wonder how we ever lived without it, similar to how we feel about our phones’ – Tim Cook If rumors are true, Apple could instantly flip the switch on mixed reality and seed the globe with first-weekend sales that potentially exceed 40-60 million units, based on prior iPhone launch statistics. Having AR-capable devices delivered at such speed and scale would certainly send both brands and consumers into a frenzy over the immediate demand for readily available content. (This is the same issue we are currently seeing with VR.) ‘Users will start expecting brands to have mixed reality experiences in 2018. The big money will show up in 2020’ – Robert Scoble To prepare, every brand needs to have an AR strategy now! Some unique brand benefits: Products become “Always On” digital media channels Products and objects will extract valuable and unique consumer data sets Spatial mapping and eye sensors will allow brands to “see” much further Targeting and retargeting capabilities will become more precise and relevant Engagement rates and dwell times will tip the scale Engagement and exposure will trigger increased consumer spending on goods Products = next-gen websites and portals Consumers will soon ditch today’s clunky devices in favor of mixed reality glasses with spatial computing powers. These new lenses will pull up interactive 3D holograms, games, websites, video, telecommunications, virtual desktops, and much more. What this means for brands is that products and objects are going to become next-generation websites filled with 3D content that users can touch, hold, speak to, and learn from. This entirely new medium will give brands and advertisers the ability to engage with – and learn about – their consumers in ways that never existed before. It will close the gap between the physical and digital, allowing brands to create platforms and communities that far exceed limitations posed through today’s existing media channels.  This will also profoundly impact product sales, brand loyalties, and consumer engagement at unimaginable rates. As adoption ignites and MR becomes scalable, consumers will soon expect digital content from every product they come in contact with. For example, a Coca-Cola product will now deliver a realistic 3D gaming, music, or sporting event experience. Food products like Hellman’s Mayonnaise or Extra Virgin Olive Oil will be able to deliver exclusive 3D recipe tutorials given by a Rachel Ray hologram (You may even want to hold and interact with a 3D catalog of her cookware set). Many of the items that make it into your grocery cart will have digital discounts and product benefits displayed straight from the package as you walk down the aisle and shop. For brands, mixed reality means that everything in the world can now become a media channel and ANY creative concept imaginable can be executed. Next-gen search engine = visual search Because we will rely on these new MR glasses for practically everything we do, and because we could potentially wear them throughout most of our day, there will be a significant increase in the amount of content we consume on a daily basis. For brands, this could mean more advertising opportunities that allow them to capture — and learn from — behavioral data. Ultimately, however, this will also mean that trillions of physical objects in our world must be indexed in order to have some type of relevant content associated with them. So how will all this messaging and content be segmented so that it’s delivered in all the right places and to all the right audiences? Eye Tracking This is certainly not a new feature; Samsung has included eye tracking in its phones for several years, but it’s quickly becoming a very important ingredient in mixed reality headsets. Eye-tracking technology has seen heavy investment from the world’s largest tech companies, including Google (Eyefluence), Apple (Primesense), Facebook (The Eye Tribe), Microsoft (in-house development), and several others. This means MR devices will have the ability to track exactly where and what you are looking at. Machine Learning In addition to understanding where you are looking, a computer’s ability to determine what we are actually looking at is another important factor. [In simple terms, machine learning is when a computer is trained to act based on recognizing patterns rather than being explicitly programmed.] The more examples a computer sees, the better it gets at understanding what it’s seeing. Coupled with advanced computer vision, eye tracking and machine learning are vital ingredients for implementing the next-generation of “visual” search engines. Below is a word cloud taken from a massive dataset that Google and YouTube-8M recently released for developers to help facilitate machine learning capabilities. IoT in mixed reality = the ‘Internet ON Things’   Imagine the ability to look at your dog or cat and instantly activate important information needed to care for your pet. You might learn about nearby veterinarians and dog parks or research and purchase Purina pet supplies straight from Amazon Prime. Data collected will allow further content to be contextual and precisely targeted back to your dog’s breed, age, gender, exercise habits, diet, etc. There will even be content and virtual products that you can hold and interact with through hand gestures within this new search interface. Brand marketing in Visual Search will become incredibly intuitive, establishing personal and emotional connections with consumers like never before. Data collection and ad targeting Brands will collect BIG data within our personal environments. With most recent technological advancements, there are concerns about privacy and the collection of data. What’s being collected, and who knows what about us? Mixed reality will have its share of privacy concerns. Who will initially own and distribute this data is still a big question. Because MR devices work by scanning and mapping our physical spaces, the amounts of data collected within our personal environments will be staggering. Soon marketers and corporations will be able to actually “see” into consumers homes and gather knowledge they can leverage by targeting ads and products with pinpoint accuracy. For example, the baby high chair in the background will likely be indexed and stored as meta-data somewhere in the cloud while you are busy trying out new sofas from a 3D IKEA catalog. When passed off to marketers, that data will let retailers like Target, for example, understand there are young children in your household, paving the way for targeted ads, products, and content options from Gerber, Huggies, Fischer Price, etc. But remember, much of this content can be delivered in a more immersive way, making it desirable and helpful. This type of marketing will be less perceived as spam than today’s web banners and pop-ups. Spam and governance  Brands will now have the ability to leave content waiting for you, sitting on top of real-world objects and locations, similar to Pokémon Go. This can be done through geolocation, or by simply dropping pixels into previously mapped environments so that they can activate 3D experiences and branded content when viewed. Much of the content we engage with through our new MR lenses will be content consumers actually want, so it will be pull-based through interactions with objects and products, becoming valuable to both the advertiser and consumer. But, as with all quality advertising and messaging, there will also be fierce competition by advertisers looking to push as much unwanted messaging directly within your line of sight as possible. Because everything in the world will now become prime real estate for brand marketing, new filters and restrictions will need to be put in place and adhered to in an effort to protect consumers and their privacy. In a recent article, Behance founder and VC investor Scott Belsky offered five predictions for the future of tech (all of which I agree with). He suggests that ad blockers may be a suitable solution for these concerns. He also cites the need for industry governance through a professional association that can establish a clear set of rules and guidelines for advertising within the new world of mixed reality. Brands should start with mobile AR in 2017 While we await further news surrounding advancements and mass market distribution plans for these highly anticipated first-gen MR devices, mobile AR is still the best solution for brands looking to test and learn for the short term. The good news is mobile AR has been around for a number of years, and unbelievable innovation already exists that can be readily implemented at mass scale, with a sizable number of solutions to choose from. Now is a great time for brands to start developing strategies and learning what works with consumers and what doesn’t so they are ready to make the transition and to commit to longer-term investments when the optics market ignites.
