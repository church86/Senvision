By Kiko Antonio https://twitter.com/kikoTBB on April 24, 2017 02:02 PM It is quite obvious that Microsoft has been lacking when it comes to tablet offerings lately. For more than a year, the Redmond company has not released an update for its Surface Pro line of tablets. This delay only makes Surface Pro fans more impatient. In fact, many now have reasons to believe that the Surface Pro 5 might not happen at all. However, recent events suggest that Microsoft maybe planning something of a surprise for the Surface Pro 5. By now, anyone would know that Microsoft has been working closely with Qualcomm. Qualcomm has provided Microsoft with a Snapdragon 820-based engineering device it can use to port the Windows 10. Only recently, it was reported that, coming from Qualcomm, a Snapdragon-based Windows 10 device will be released later this year. This news now begs to answer the question, “is Microsoft releasing a Snapdragon-powered Surface Pro 5?” Unfortunately, nobody can answer that now apart from Microsoft. ARM-powered Surface Pro 5 This idea actually makes sense. Every year, more and more mobile devices with Snapdragon chips are released in the market. Also, year after year, these Snapdragon chips are getting better in terms of performance and efficiency. Some of these newer Snapdragon chips can even go head to head with an Intel mobile processor like the m3 and m5 series. This is why, one can say that an ARM-based Surface Pro 5 is a possibility. Granted, an ARM SoC will never be as powerful as a full-blown desktop processor, at least for now. Over the years, the performance of ARM chips have been increasing steadily. And while desktop processors are the same, the disparity between an ARM and a desktop processor has already started to blur. Perhaps Microsoft can still offer the Surface Pro 5 with entry level specs. But instead of using an Intel M series processor, it might equip the tablet with a Snapdragon 835 instead. Kaby Lake-based Surface Pro 5 There is no denying that the main reason why Surface Pro fans are waiting for the update is the new Kaby Lake processor from Intel. It has long been rumored that the upcoming tablet will sport the seventh generation processors from Intel. However, due to delays in both the chips and the Windows 10 operating system, Microsoft did not release the Surface Pro 5 last year. The Kaby Lake series processors are undoubtedly far more superior in terms of performance and efficiency than the Skylake processor. This is due to the fact that the former is made with the 14nm process technology instead of 28nm. That means, the overall chip area has been reduced by as much as 50 percent. The new processor family also boasts native support for 4K video playback and processing. This is why many tablet enthusiasts are quite excited about the Surface Pro 5. The prospect of being able to consume 4K videos on a tablet with ease is a big plus for them. Surface Pro 4 (via microsoftstore.com) What to expect from the Surface Pro 5? Right now, the release date of Microsoft’s next generation Surface Pro tablet is still uncertain. The Redmond giant has done well in keeping the lid shut when it comes to news about the tablet. However, a recent Twitter post from Paul Thurott claims that nothing new will come with the Surface Pro 5 apart from the Kaby Lake processor. He also said that Microsoft is keeping the Surface Connector and will not upgrade it to a Thunderbolt 3 or USB type-C. While this news may seem upsetting to some, the Kaby Lake processors will surely introduce new battery saving features to the upcoming Surface Pro tablet. This has been one of the major concerns of Surface Pro users ever since the third generation. Perhaps this time around, Microsoft will be able to prolong the battery life of the Surface Pro like it promises on its marketing materials.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Review MSI’s latest gaming laptop with Kaby Lake is a multitasking beast Jeff Grubb@jeffgrubb April 23, 2017 6:10 PM Above: The MSI GT62VR kicks ass with the seventh-gen i7. Image Credit: MSI I’ve said before that gaming laptops are starting to make a lot of sense once again, but that’s only if the companies that manufacturer these products take advantage of breakthrough technologies from partners like AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. That brings us to the $1,800 MSI GT62VR, which straddles some of the lines that separate old gaming laptops from the new crop, but the end result is still a machine that never struggles to play modern games and should easily last for the next four to five years. What you’ll like It’s a multitasking beast MSI has packed in the latest chips from Intel and Nvidia into this laptop, and that makes it smart enough to handle all kinds of tools at once. Here’s a look at the specs of the system I used: Intel Core i7-7700HQ @ 2.8GHz 15.6-inch IPS display 1080p (it also comes in 2160p) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 with 8GB GDDR5 memory 16GB of RAM 1TB HDD storage 264GB SSD storage SteelSeries backlit keyboard 2 Dynadio speakers and 1 subwoofer Above: It’s a blazing machine for gaming and work. Image Credit: MSI As an example of an extreme situation where the laptop excels, I run a weekly podcast that I livestream and record simultaneously. To do this, I need to have Chrome and Xsplit open simultaneously, and I have both programs slam the CPU and GPU with requests for video rendering, Google docs, and a million tabs. It’s often too much for the old 4th-generation i5 and the new GTX 1080 Ti that I have in my desktop right now. As a work machine, this notebook is clearly capable of handling just about anything you’ll throw at it. And if you’re doing any video, photography, or audio processing, that seventh-gen Kaby Lake processor is nearly a must-have for anyone who does their work on the go or someone who wants desktop power in a form factor that can easily leave the desk. It’s a VR and gaming powerhouse At the same time, this is clearly a gaming laptop first. And where some of the GeForce GTX 1060-based notebooks were mostly hitting 60 frames per second at Ultra settings and a 1080p resolution, the 1070 is enough to get you over the hump for games like Watch Dogs 2. Here’s a test I run to see whether or not the system can handle some of the more demanding games at 1080P60, and it easily surpassed that marker: And here’s how the GT62VR compares to the MSI GS43VR, which illustrates how much more performance you get from the 1070 and the Kaby Lake processor: I tested the 1080p variation of the GT62VR, but you can get it with a 2160p display or plug it into a 1440p monitor if you like. It can handle some games at those higher resolutions. At 4K with Ultra settings, you’ll still do fine in some of the multiplayer games like Rocket League and Overwatch, but this is where The Division and Watch Dogs 2 will start to fall off sharply. But I never like to hold that against a laptop because they’re mostly built as enclosed gaming systems dedicated to doing 1080p60 — especially when it comes to a 15-inch screen. Instead of trying to position this generation of gaming laptops as 4K machines, companies like MSI are instead leaning much more heavily into virtual reality. And it’s there that this laptop excels. I had some trouble getting the machine working with VR due to a troublesome Windows 10 update, but once I got over that, I was getting smooth experiences in every game I tried. Again, thanks to that Kaby Lake i7, I was also able to get away with having apps like Chrome open in the background at the same time without having to worry about taking a performance hit. At this point, even if you don’t care about the technology, it’s difficult to avoid getting a decent gaming laptop without also coming away with an excellent VR machine. And MSI’s device is one of the better laptops for powering your head-mounted displays. Nice screen, keyboard, and I/O options Beyond the internals, the laptop has a crisp display and a responsive SteelSeries keyboard. These are crucial aspects for a gaming machine, and they deliver a strong enough experience to support the idea of making this your primary machine for games like World of Warcraft, The Witcher 3, or Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds. The IPS monitor does lose a lot of clarity at sharp angles, but that never turned into a problem during typical use. Instead, using this on my lap, desk, or table, I was impressed with the bright images that relatively accurate color reproduction. The GT62VR also has enough USB ports and video outputs to support peripherals like an HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. It has 3 USB 3.0 ports on the right, 1 USB 2.0 on the left, and even a USB-C option on the back. You can also output to a monitor using the HDMI option or the Mini-DisplayPort. What you won’t like Trackpad still requires fiddling The sad state of Windows trackpads continues. Out of the box, the GT62VR’s trackpad was a miserable thing to use. What’s especially frustrating is that the hardware is not actually the culprit — instead, it’s something to do with the drivers because installing the default Microsoft software fixes everything. Two-finger scrolls, something that would almost never work before some tinkering, now works perfectly for me. But I shouldn’t have to dive into Device Manager to fix this junk. Above: It looks slimmer in pictures than it really is. Image Credit: MSI Bulk might not be worth the extra power over the 1060 models I doesn’t follow in the footsteps of what MSI has done with its gaming laptops that use the GeForce GTX 1060 cards. The GS43VR, for example, is compact and sleek whereas this model is much bigger and bulkier. Sure, that’s to fit in the 1070 card, but it’s still disappointing that the GT62VR looks more like an older gaming laptop than something new and modern. Personally, if I were traveling a lot, I’d probably go with the smaller, less powerful option because I’m not sure the power justifies the size and weight. Conclusion While the GT62VR features the latest tech from MSI, Intel, and Nvidia, it still feels a bit stuck in the past in terms of design. But if you’re OK with lugging around a larger laptop, this device will deliver flawless 1080p60 gaming in a machine that can also easily handle VR. At $1,800, that’s not a lot of portable power for a rather reasonable price. MSI lent the laptop to GamesBeat for the purposes of this review.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Beaten-Up Virtual Reality Stocks: Are They Bargains? Ambarella, Intel, and GoPro are all making separate pushes into virtual reality, but only one looks like a solid VR bet. Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 23, 2017 at 2:48PM The market size for virtual reality is expected to reach $33.9 billion by 2022, and hit nearly 100 million headsets shipped worldwide by 2021 for both augmented-reality and virtual-reality (VR) devices. But not everyone is benefiting from all of that potential just yet.  GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) are three companies that have all made plays in the VR space, but their share prices aren't booming along with other VR players like NVIDIA, AMD, and others. So let's take a look at what these companies are doing to expand their virtual-reality offerings, and whether or not they look like bargains in the space.  Image source: Intel. GoPro  There was a lot of chatter last year surrounding GoPro's move into the virtual-reality market with its Omni rig. The cube-shaped device holds six HERO cameras to capture video from nearly every angle, and is used in combination with the company's Kolor software -- a VR software company GoPro purchased -- to stitch the video together for VR and 360-degree viewing. Image source: GoPro. I was skeptical that GoPro's rig would have much of a splash in the broader VR market, mainly because of its high cost. The rig itself is $1,500 and the full system (with six cameras) totals $5,000. That's clearly too high for most consumers, and only appeals to those who want to create VR content, not those who want to consume it.  Rigs aside, GoPro doesn't appear to be doing much else in the VR space at the moment, perhaps because it's busy trying to put out the fires from its botched release of its Karma drone and dealing with its less-than-stellar earnings reports. The Karma drone, along with some production problems with its HERO5 camera, have caused the company's share price to tumble. Take a look: Source: YCharts. Considering that GoPro's only foray into virtual reality involves a rig that holds six cameras and some software that most people have never heard of, I think betting on GoPro as a VR investment is a bad idea. Additionally, until the company can get back on its feet with camera production and prove that it can find new revenue streams, the stock has a lot to prove before investors should give it a look. Intel Intel is constantly looking to new markets to spur sales of its chips as PC sales continue to slow. One such opportunity is in selling faster -- and more expensive -- processors into PCs, which can handle the requirements of high-end VR headsets. Fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa pointed out recently that Intel mentioned at its recent investor meeting that it's hoping that the growth of VR headsets will be a catalyst for future chip sales. Intel appears to be already focusing on this for some of its chips, and on its website, it describes its Core i7 chip as having a "great VR experience" and has "the power to deliver amazing game physics, rich 360 degree 3D visuals, precise controls, and immersive 3D sound."  The company also has its own VR headset, called Project Alloy, which comes with an Intel chip embedded inside the device. That's a huge differentiating feature from other high-end headsets, which have to be tethered to a computer. The device is only offered as a developer kit right now, but it shows that Intel is thinking of new ways to convince device makers that its chips should be at the forefront of the VR market.  Source: YCHARTS. Intel isn't exactly the most obvious beaten-up stock, considering that it's gained more than 13% over the past year. But compared to the nearly 12% gains the S&P 500 has made over the past 12 months, there's certainly room for improvement. It's still very early in Intel's VR push, but the company is making some smart moves in the space that could eventually help boost its chip sales. Considering Intel's massive reach in the semiconductor space, its low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 17, and its ongoing push into new markets like VR, I think the company looks like a bargain compared to the other players right now.  Ambarella Another chipmaker that's moving further into the VR space is Ambarella. The company is best known for supplying chips for GoPro's action cameras, but earlier this year, it released its new H3 system-on-a-chip (SoC), which it believes is an ideal chip for virtual-reality cameras. The SoC is capable of delivering 8K Ultra HD at 30 frames per second and 4K Ultra HD at 120 frames per second. Ambarella says that it's expecting increasing, but slow, growth from the VR market. The company's CEO, Fermi Wang, said on the fiscal Q4 2017 earnings call in February: We are still watching the virtual reality market. We have announced several customers previously and we continue to see design win activity, and in terms of the market development, I think it's still at a very early stage and it's still hard for us to tell how big the market is, so while we continue supporting our key customers for this market, we are still conservative on the revenue outlook for this.  Over the past year, Ambarella's stock has been on a wild ride, and recent price changes have been moving in the wrong direction. Ambarella's stock-price gains over the past 12 months have just barely beaten the S&P 500. But compared to other VR processor plays, like AMD (up 376%) and NVIDIA (up 172%), it's also not that impressive. Source: YCharts. Ambarella certainly has some prospects in the VR market, but I'm still concerned with the company's strong reliance on selling chips to GoPro.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman 3 Beaten-Up Virtual Reality Stocks: Are They Bargains? The market size for virtual reality is expected to reach $33.9 billion by 2022, and hit nearly 100 million headsets shipped worldwide by 2021 for both augmented-reality and virtual-reality (VR) devices. But not everyone is benefiting from all of that potential just yet. GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO) , Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Ambarella (NASDAQ: AMBA)  are three companies that have all made plays in the VR space, but their share prices aren’t booming along with other VR players like NVIDIA , AMD , and others. So let’s take a look at what these companies are doing to expand their virtual-reality offerings, and whether or not they look like bargains in the space. Image source: Intel. GoPro There was a lot of chatter last year surrounding GoPro’s move into the virtual-reality market with its Omni rig. The cube-shaped device holds six HERO cameras to capture video from nearly every angle, and is used in combination with the company’s Kolor software — a VR software company GoPro purchased — to stitch the video together for VR and 360-degree viewing. Image source: GoPro. I was skeptical that GoPro’s rig would have much of a splash in the broader VR market, mainly because of its high cost. The rig itself is $1,500 and the full system (with six cameras) totals $5,000. That’s clearly too high for most consumers, and only appeals to those who want to create VR content, not those who want to consume it. Rigs aside, GoPro doesn’t appear to be doing much else in the VR space at the moment, perhaps because it’s busy trying to put out the fires from its botched release of its Karma drone and dealing with its less-than-stellar earnings reports . The Karma drone, along with some production problems with its HERO5 camera, have caused the company’s share price to tumble. Take a look: Source: YCharts. Considering that GoPro’s only foray into virtual reality involves a rig that holds six cameras and some software that most people have never heard of, I think betting on GoPro as a VR investment is a bad idea. Additionally, until the company can get back on its feet with camera production and prove that it can find new revenue streams, the stock has a lot to prove before investors should give it a look. Intel Intel is constantly looking to new markets to spur sales of its chips as PC sales continue to slow. One such opportunity is in selling faster — and more expensive — processors into PCs, which can handle the requirements of high-end VR headsets. Fellow Fool Ashraf Eassa pointed out recently that Intel mentioned at its recent investor meeting that it’s hoping that the growth of VR headsets will be a catalyst for future chip sales. Intel appears to be already focusing on this for some of its chips, and on its website, it describes its Core i7 chip as having a „great VR experience” and has „the power to deliver amazing game physics, rich 360 degree 3D visuals, precise controls, and immersive 3D sound.” The company also has its own VR headset, called Project Alloy, which comes with an Intel chip embedded inside the device. That’s a huge differentiating feature from other high-end headsets, which have to be tethered to a computer. The device is only offered as a developer kit right now, but it shows that Intel is thinking of new ways to convince device makers that its chips should be at the forefront of the VR market. Source: YCHARTS. Intel isn’t exactly the most obvious beaten-up stock, considering that it’s gained more than 13% over the past year. But compared to the nearly 12% gains the S&P 500  has made over the past 12 months, there’s certainly room for improvement. It’s still very early in Intel’s VR push, but the company is making some smart moves in the space that could eventually help boost its chip sales. Considering Intel’s massive reach in the semiconductor space, its low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 17, and its ongoing push into new markets like VR, I think the company looks like a bargain compared to the other players right now. Ambarella Another chipmaker that’s moving further into the VR space is Ambarella. The company is best known for supplying chips for GoPro’s action cameras, but earlier this year, it released its new H3 system-on-a-chip (SoC), which it believes is an ideal chip for virtual-reality cameras. The SoC is capable of delivering 8K Ultra HD at 30 frames per second and 4K Ultra HD at 120 frames per second. Ambarella says that it’s expecting increasing, but slow, growth from the VR market. The company’s CEO, Fermi Wang, said on the fiscal Q4 2017 earnings call in February: We are still watching the virtual reality market. We have announced several customers previously and we continue to see design win activity, and in terms of the market development, I think it’s still at a very early stage and it’s still hard for us to tell how big the market is, so while we continue supporting our key customers for this market, we are still conservative on the revenue outlook for this. Over the past year, Ambarella’s stock has been on a wild ride, and recent price changes have been moving in the wrong direction. Ambarella’s stock-price gains over the past 12 months have just barely beaten the S&P 500. But compared to other VR processor plays, like AMD (up 376%) and NVIDIA (up 172%), it’s also not that impressive. Source: YCharts. Ambarella certainly has some prospects in the VR market, but I’m still concerned with the company’s strong reliance on selling chips to GoPro. The chipmaker is diversifying its sales so that it can wean itself off its GoPro dependence, but that hasn’t fully happened yet, and its virtual reality chip won’t do much to accelerate it. For those reasons, I don’t think Ambarella is a bargain VR stock right now. Investors looking to get started in VR certainly have their pick of stocks. Tech companies both small and large are betting on this burgeoning market, and investors needing a primer on how to get started should consider following this quick five-point checklist  for investing in VR. 10 stocks we like better than Ambarella When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Earlier this week, the rumor mill was churning out reports that the silicon giant would show off Basin Falls at Computex at the end of May. Benchlife is adding fuel to the fire today with more specific details about the replacements for Broadwell-E and X99. Based on a reading of an automated translation, the page appears to contain four specific pieces of information that were not a part of the rumors we reported on earlier. The story contains reportedly-leaked information that Intel senior vice president Navin Shenoy will deliver a keynote speech at Computex 2017. The fact that an Intel senior VP will be delivering the keynote suggests that it may be a major announcement. The company has already shown off its first wave of 3D XPoint products for servers and client computers, and the launch of the mainstream successor to Kaby Lake is still months away. That leaves the launch of HEDT processors and chipsets as the most likely subject for the rumored speech.  Previous rounds of rumors have speculated on the public announcement of the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors and accompanying X299 chipset, but today's grist is the first to speculate on a specific retail availability date. Benchlife says that products will hit the retail channel on June 26. The latest wave of speculation also suggests that the Skylake-X family of processors will include 12-core versions in addition to the previously-rumored six, eight, and 10-core versions. Meanwhile, the Kaby Lake-X family of CPUs is still expected to contain only quad-core variants with dual-channel DDR4 memory controllers. The last specific detail is speculation that the Skylake-X CPUs will have "up to 44" PCIe 3.0 lanes. The least-expensive Broadwell-E chip, the Core i7-6800K, has 28 lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity, while its three siblings all get 40 lanes to work with. The use of the phrase "up to" suggests that Intel will continue with its tiered approach to PCIe bandwidth in its HEDT platform. Kaby Lake-X is rumored to be limited to the same 16 lanes of PCIe connectivity as Intel's mainstream desktop parts, adding further uncertainty to what exactly the benefits of Kaby Lake-X will be versus the existing offerings. As Computex draws closer, the loose lips will doubtless let slip more information about whatever it is that Intel plans to show off at the largest computer hardware show of the year.

Freedman April 22, 2017 Pros / Sleek design; Comfortable keyboard; Strong gaming and productivity performance; Useful software Cons / Dull display; Oddly shaped touchpad Verdict / The Lenovo Legion Y520 offers strong performance for its price and a sleek design. But its screen is dull, and its touchpad places form over function. Lenovo Legion Y520 from $849.00 Visit Site from Lenovo The Legion Y520 ($849 to start; $1,249 as tested) isn't Lenovo's first gaming laptop, but it marks a fresh start for the company in that market. The Y520 is the inaugural member of the new Legion series, and it makes a strong first impression. The laptop's sleek, tapered look and the strong performance of its Intel Core i7 CPU and Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti GPU make it easy to recommend this machine to gamers on a budget. However, users will have to overcome some annoyances, including a dull screen and a poorly designed touchpad. Specs Design: Plastic Kevlar I'm a fan of the subtle look Lenovo is going for with its new "Legion" line of notebooks. The lid is black plastic with a woven pattern and a few lines that make it look aggressive but still approachable. A series of grates on the back wrap around to the bottom of the computer and frame two sets of vents, which makes them seem more like an intentional decoration than a technological necessity. Although it's made of plastic, the Legion Y520 feels solid. It's unsurprising to see the material used in the chassis for a budget gaming notebook, but I do appreciate that it feels like I can jam it in a bag and not have to worry about it. When you lift the lid, you'll find the 15.6-inch, 1080p display with a thick bezel; a red, backlit, island-style keyboard; and a touchpad. The touchpad is surrounded by a red line and, oddly, some plastic that frames it as a trapezoid rather than a rectangle (more on that later). At 15 x 10.4 x 1 inches and 5.6 pounds, the Legion is nice and portable. The Dell Inspiron 15 7000 is slightly larger and heavier, at 15.2 x 10.8 x 1 inches and 5.8 pounds, and the MSI PE60 Prestige is similarly sized, at 15.1 x 10.2 x 1.1 inches and 5.4 pounds. The Asus ROG Strix GL753VE, which has a 17-inch display, is unsurprisingly larger and heavier, at 16.3 x 10.7 x 1.3 inches and 6.4 pounds. Lenovo Legion Y520 from $849.00 Visit Site from Lenovo The left side of the Legion has a Kensington lock slot, a power jack, an Ethernet jack, a USB 2.0 port and a headphone jack. On the right side, you'll find a USB Type-C port, an SD card reader, a pair of USB 3.0 ports and an HDMI output. Specs Display: Dark and Dreary Any setting less than maximum brightness makes it nearly impossible to see what's on the Legion's 15.6-inch, 1080p screen. On top of that, the display suffers from dull colors. When I watched a full-HD trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, Gamora's green skin was pale and insipid, as if she had just seen a ghost. Meanwhile, the purple stripe down Nebula's face was clear, but the blue on the sides of her head blended into her brown and red vest. The screen was still a little dark when I played Mass Effect: Andromeda, as areas in the shadows were almost completely black. A few colors popped, though, like an Asari duelist's violet armor when she stood in a gray hangar. Any setting less than maximum brightness makes it nearly impossible to see what's on the screen. The Legion's screen covers just 68 percent of the sRGB color gamut -- a poor showing that barely surpassed the Inspiron's 67 percent, and that screen was horrible. The average mainstream notebook shows off 94 percent of the sRGB color gamut, while the Strix (124 percent) and Prestige (133 percent) were more vivid. MORE: The Best Laptops for Every Need But the colors you can see are accurate. The Legion has a Delta-E score of 0.2 (0 ideal), which is far better than the average (2.4), as well as scores from the Inspiron (12), Prestige (5) and Asus (2.2). The panel on Lenovo's notebook isn't very bright, either. It measured 220 nits on our light meter, falling below the average (276 nits), the Strix (285 nits) and the Inspiron (253 nits). Of this group, only the Prestige was dimmer, at 192 nits. Keyboard and Touchpad: Form Over Function There's nothing like a good Lenovo keyboard, and the Legion Y520's is a pleasure to type on. It's similar to the great set of keys you'll find on the company's consumer products, like the Yoga 710. With 1.8 millimeters of vertical travel and 77 grams of force required to press the keys, the keyboard is supercomfortable. I sped along on the 10fastfingers.com typing test at 115 words per minute (higher than my average range of 107 to 112 wpm) with my usual 2 percent error rate. I appreciated the soft-touch deck, which kept my wrists nice and cozy. My favorite addition to the keyboard, though, is the dedicated button to record gameplay. My only real complaint is that it's backlit only in red. The touchpad, though, is awkward. It's an upside-down trapezoid with pieces of plastic filling in what would be the rest of the usual square shape. This is a classic case of form over function, and it was a real pain to use. The top of the trackpad is 4.1 inches long, and the bottom is 3.5 inches (making it a trapezoid), and it's 2.2 inches tall. While navigating Windows, I often found myself bumping into the plastic and quietly cursing to myself. If you don't hit the sides, it's great at recognizing gestures. Audio The speakers next to the Legion's hinge are just loud enough, but you don't get all of the detail in your music. When I listened to Yellowcard's "Sing For Me," the guitars and vocals were clear, but the drums were on the quiet side and the bass was almost indistinguishable. I wish the speakers were just a smidge louder, but at max volume, the sound easily filled a small meeting room. I had a similar experience in Mass Effect: Andromeda. The loud, pulsing electronica in the multiplayer lobby sounded great, but some of the radio calls during the game were too quiet and were overpowered by gunfire. The laptop comes with the Dolby Audio app and a few sound profiles to choose from, but I found that leaving it on the default Music setting offered the best results. Audio options are also available in Lenovo's Nerve Center (see Software and Warranty, below). Gaming and Graphics: Budget Powerhouse For an entry-level graphics card, the Legion Y520's Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of VRAM is no slouch. I played on Mass Effect: Andromeda's multiplayer mode, fending off hordes of Remnant robots with my teammates on High settings at 1080p, and the game stayed between 38 and 50 frames per second. The Legion ran Rise of the Tomb Raider (1080p, Very High settings) at 46 fps, sailing past the mainstream average (34 fps), the Inspiron and the Strix (both at 22 fps with 1050 Ti GPUs), and the Prestige (18 fps, GTX 1050). Of the four, only the Legion ran the game over our 30-fps playability threshold. MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops It was also the only system that could handle Metro: Last Light on High at 1080p. The Legion played it at 31 fps, just above the threshold. The Inspiron (29 fps), the Strix (28 fps) and the Prestige (26 fps) were lower, and the average is 34 fps. Lenovo's laptop rendered Hitman (1080p, Ultra settings) at a smooth 60 fps, beating the average (56 fps)  the Strix (40 fps), the Prestige (39 fps) and the Inspiron (35 fps). Performance Packed with a 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU; 16GB of RAM; a 256GB PCIe SSD; and a 2TB, 5,400-rpm HDD, the Legion is primed to get work done once you've finished gaming. I had 40 tabs open in two instances of Google Chrome, including one streaming a 1080p episode of "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah" and didn't see even a hint of lag when scrolling or switching tabs. The Legion notched a score of 13,037 on the Geekbench 4 overall performance test, handily surpassing the mainstream-notebook average (11,455) and the competition. The Inspiron (10,363, Intel Core i5-7300HQ), the Strix (12,394, Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU) and the Prestige (12,678, Intel Core i7-7700HQ) all had lower scores. Lenovo Legion Y520 from $849.00 Visit Site from Lenovo The Legion transferred 4.97GB of mixed media files in 14 seconds, which translates to a rate of 363.5 MBps. That outpaces the average (193.9 MBps) as well as the Prestige (231.3 MBps), the Strix (221.3 MBps) and the Inspiron 15 (106 MBps). It took 3 minutes and 19 seconds for the Legion to complete our OpenOffice spreadsheet macro benchmark, which pairs 20,000 names and addresses. That's the same as the Strix, and ahead of the average (3:57). The Inspiron completed the test in 3:37, and the Prestige finished in 3:39. Battery Life The Legion might be portable, but you'll need to bring a charger with you. It endured for just 3 hours and 39 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which browses the web continuously over Wi-Fi. The average for mainstream notebooks is 7:06, and all of the competition outlasted the Legion. The Prestige endured for 4:13, the Strix survived for 6:25 and the Inspiron ran for a whopping 11:23. MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life Heat: Cool Under Pressure The Legion stayed nice and cool in our regular testing. After streaming HD video from YouTube for 15 minutes, it measured 83 degrees Fahrenheit on the bottom, 80 degrees at the center of the keyboard and 77 degrees on the touchpad. It was still comfortable after I played Mass Effect: Andromeda, measuring 77 degrees on the touchpad. The keyboard and bottom of the system measured 87 degrees (except for the bottom vent, which hit 105 degrees). We consider anything under 95 degrees to be comfortable. Webcam The 720p webcam's photos are on the soft side in terms of detail, but the colors are accurate. In a photo I took in our labs, my periwinkle shirt appeared as it does in real life. It caught some fine details, too, like the subtle pattern in our lab tech's shirt as he photobombed me, and my dimple stood out. Some light coming in from the windows was blown out, but not to a degree that distracted from the focus of the photo. Software and Warranty: On My Nerves Lenovo is introducing some new software on the Legion. Its new app is called Nerve Sense, and it serves as a hub for anything related to gaming. It has options to turn on stronger cooling, give specific apps priority on your network, disable the Windows key and touchpad while playing, and manage gameplay videos. You also get some better-known Lenovo apps, like Companion to update your system and check its health, and the Settings app to customize the machine to your liking. MORE: Best Lenovo Laptops There's a bit of bloatware, too, but it's the kind you get on any Windows 10 laptop: Candy Crush Soda Saga, Paradise Bay, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Twitter, Facebook, and Sling. Lenovo sells the Legion Y520 with a one-year warranty. See how the company performed in our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Words Brands ranking. Configurations The Legion Y520 we reviewed costs $1,249.99 and comes with an Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU; 16GB of RAM; a 2TB, 5,400-rpm HDD; a 256GB PCIe SSD; and an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of VRAM. If you don't need that much space, you can get a $1,179.99 version that has the same specs, except it uses a 1TB HDD and a 128GB SSD. Lenovo Legion Y520 from $849.00 Visit Site from Lenovo The base model costs $849 and features a Core i5-7300HQ CPU; 8GB of RAM; a 1TB, 5,400-rpm HDD; and an Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of VRAM. Bottom Line The Lenovo Legion Y520 is a budget gaming laptop with a sleek, tapered design and a comfortable keyboard. And, most importantly, it offers strong performance for the price. If only it had a brighter, more vivid screen and didn't have annoying plastic around the trackpad, it would be even better. If you want a laptop that screams "gaming PC," consider the Asus ROG Strix GL753VE, which is $1,229 and has a much better display and longer battery life. Just know that its design isn't as nice, and its gaming performance isn't as good. If you can look past the screen, though, the Legion Y520 is a solid choice that will serve you well when you're gaming and while you're at work.

On Black Friday 2016 Target was shifting 3,200 TVs per minute, and in the first few hours of Black Friday Amazon had sold over 100,000 children’s toys. In the US, Adobe reports that online sales hit $3.34 billion, with $1.2 billion of that coming from people using mobile devices. The most popular purchases? iPads and 4K Samsung TVs. It’s ironic that Black Friday drives so much traffic to websites, because it used to be about more traditional traffic: the name was used by US police to describe the chaos when everybody hit the sales on the same day. Black Friday still happens on the High Street, but increasingly the best deals - and the most shoppers - are online. When is Black Friday 2017? Black Friday is the Friday immediately after the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, so Black Friday 2017 will be on November 24th. It’s the starting gun of the Christmas shopping season, and it’s famous for what retailers call “ doorbusters”: deals so good that shoppers will try and break down the front doors to get at them. Inevitably that means it’s also famous for shoppers battling one another, with each Black Friday bringing a new bunch of YouTube clips showing people fighting over flat-screen TVs. Things got so bad on Black Friday 2014 that ASDA, Wal-Mart’s UK brand and the firm largely responsible for bringing Black Friday to the UK, decided not to do Black Friday 2015 or Black Friday 2016 at all. That proved to be an expensive decision. Like for like sales in the 13 weeks to January 1 2016 were down 5.8%, the firm’s worst quarterly sales ever. By comparison, in 2014 John Lewis UK reported that its Black Friday sales were the highest weekly sales in the company’s 150-year history. Why Black Friday matters Black Friday has transformed the Christmas shopping season, for better and for worse. James Miller, senior retail consultant at Experian Marketing Services, told the BBC that “there is little doubt Black Friday has dramatically changed the way people shop in the run-up to Christmas and has created an expectation of deep discounts that arguably did not exist before,” while a report by LCP Consulting found that nearly one-third of UK and US retailers believe that Black Friday is “unprofitable and unsustainable." Before Black Friday became a big deal, the run-up to Christmas was a great period for retailers: we’d buy loads of presents for others and for ourselves, and retailers would make huge piles of money. Then Black Friday happened, and all of a sudden many of us were browsing the bargains for the presents to put in Santa’s sack. Money spent on deeply discounted products in November is money that won’t be spent on more profitable products in December. According to research by Verdict Retail, there is “no evidence” that Black Friday “stimulated demand”: Black Friday is essentially a black hole that sucks in a big part of people’s pre-Christmas shopping. We buy more but pay less for it. According to Mike Watkins of Nielsen UK, “Whilst Nielsen analysis shows that Black Friday in November 2014 did not deliver incremental food sales it did serve to kick start what was the slowest start to Christmas trading in over 10 years. Perhaps that’s the primary objective in these changing times.” Gary Booker, CMO at Dixons Retail, told Marketing Week that Black Friday negatively affects purchases in the following weeks: “It takes sales out of what would have been key early weeks in December,” he said, and multiple reports show that since Black Friday has taken off in the UK we’re spending less money on Boxing Day, our previous favourite for bargain hunting. That means retailers need to think very carefully about Black Friday: they can discount in the hope they’ll make up for the lower margins with higher volumes, or they can decide not to take part in Black Friday and potentially lose sales to rivals who do. Black Friday 2017 won't be so crazy Black Friday 2014 was particularly silly in the UK: while grown men and women knocked each other over to try and get cheap Polaroid TVs in supermarkets, men and women knocked over loads of websites too. Many retailers weren’t prepared for the volume of online traffic and their servers couldn’t cope. Other firms that hadn’t thought Black Friday was a particularly big deal tried to get in on the action. The result felt rather like some firms were running around with a pricing gun, discounting whatever they spotted. Black Friday 2015 was very different. Websites coped just fine - although some raised eyebrows with “oh! We’re so busy you’ll have to queue!” warnings that seemed more about marketing than reflecting actual demand - and retailers had a strategy in place. Where previous Black Fridays were crazy, Black Friday 2015 was calm. The difference? Planning. Retailers knew what to expect, had struck deals with suppliers well in advance and approached Black Friday like any other shopping event. There were still bargains to be had, but it certainly didn’t feel like bargain-conscious customers were getting one over on panicking retailers. Black Friday 2016 was different again: for many big-name retailers, instead of everything happening on one day, their sales were spread over an entire week from the Monday before Black Friday to Cyber Monday, the Monday immediately after. Cyber Monday used to be a separate event, the day everybody panicked and thought “oh no! It’s nearly Christmas and I haven’t bought any presents!” before visiting Amazon on their work PCs. But in 2016 it was just another part of Black Friday Deals Week. As Experian’s Richard Jenkings told the BBC, “The Black Friday promotions at the end of November are the start of a longer, more drawn-out peak season, which begins with most of the activity online and then moves in-store as we get closer and closer to Christmas day.” The best Black Friday deals from last year: Every year, we load up with pizza and energy drinks to scour the entire internet for Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals. These were some of our favourite deals from Black Friday 2016. £125 off the iPhone 7 Apple’s iPhone 7 may have been new but that didn’t mean you couldn’t get a Black Friday deal. With the code BLACKNOV125 you could get £125 off the up-front cost of an iPhone 7 - and no, the contract wasn’t more expensive to compensate. £130 off the PS4 The PlayStation 4 is a brilliant console, and last Black Friday it was a brilliant bargain too: there was £130 off the 1TB model and bundles costing as little as £189. Very chopped 34% off the price of some of its PS4 bundles and Amazon cut 20%. £40 off the iPad Air There were lots of iPad bargains on Black Friday 2016 including £40 off the iPad Air, £30 off iPad Pros and up to £50 off iPad Minis. Apple wasn’t offering those discounts, but it did bundle gift cards with various products. £900 off an LG OLED TV How’s this for a discount: Black Friday meant a massive £900 off the LG OLED55B6V TV, bringing its price down to a much less frightening £1,899. There was also £550 off Sony 4K TVs and up to £300 off Panasonic TVs. Huge savings on Xbox One bundles The 4K Xbox One S was just £199 with Minecraft and Forza Horizon thrown in, and prices were slashed all over the place for every conceivable combination of console, controllers and games. There were good deals to be had on accessories too. Why to expect from Black Friday 2017: The last few Black Friday deals periods saw many retailers taking baby steps, but in 2017 they’re all grown up. That means they’ve been poring over their spreadsheet models since the last Black Friday, and they know exactly what they’ll be doing this year. And the first thing they’ll be doing is trying to beat Black Friday by starting their deals early. What started as Black Friday weekend became Black Friday week, and this year we expect some big-name retailers to start discounting long before that. That makes sense for many reasons: it spreads the load on their websites and shops, and more importantly it means the news of their deals won’t be buried amid the avalanche of Black Friday announcements. So keep your eyes peeled - and keep visiting our deals page - from early November, and maybe even earlier than that. Something we saw a lot of in 2016 and expect to see even more of in 2017 is a sliding scale of discounting: we noticed deals got bigger and better as the month progressed. That’s likely to recur in 2017, with reasonable deals at the beginning of the Black Friday period and more exciting but limited quantity deals on Black Friday itself. The emphasis will be on the more expensive products where retailers can cut prices but still make a decent profit. Predicting the best Black Friday deals of 2017: iPhone 8 We know that Apple’s 2017 iPhone 8 is likely to be dramatically different from the current model, we can reasonably expect it to go on sale in September or October at the latest, and we know that iPhone 8 Black Friday deals will be very popular - so this one’s a slam-dunk. Expect similar discounts to 2016 chopping £100-plus off the up-front price, and Apple to offer gift cards across the range. We’d expect some decent deals on iPads too as Apple refreshes the line-up this year. Samsung Galaxy S8 Black Friday 2016 saw really good deals on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, with the Black Friday voucher code BLACKFRI2 wiping out the upfront cost altogether on a £29.99 per month contract. That was a fantastic deal, and we’re expecting to see similarly great Galaxy deals on the Samsung Galaxy S8 in 2017. PS4 Pro Black Friday 2016 was all about the PS4 Slim, and Black Friday 2017 will be all about the PS4 Pro. As with 2016 we’d expect the very best deals to be on bundles, with some of them costing only a little more than the PS4 Pro itself, so start working on your game wish list: a bundle’s only a good deal if it includes the games you actually want to play. Up to now, the PS4 Pro is holding its RRP but you can expect that to change later this year, particularly when Microsoft has launched Scorpio... Xbox One + Project Scorpio Microsoft’s got a pro console too, and unless something goes wrong with the release schedule it should be on sale long before Black Friday 2017. As with the Xbox One in 2016 we’d expect to see the very best deals on bundles, rather than on the console itself: there’s more wiggle room for the retailer there, so they can afford to be more daring with the discounts. 4K HDR OLED TVs Black Friday 2016 was positively packed with TV deals, including nearly half-price deals on selected OLED TVs. High-end sets are where the really expensive RRPs are, and the ever-advancing world of telly tech means those prices can only be sustained for a fairly short time. If you’re in the market for the kind of TV whose price tag wouldn’t look out of place on a car, Black Friday 2017 could be a very good day for you indeed. Black Friday 2017 FAQ: what it is, when it happens and where to get the best deals What is Black Friday? Black Friday is the Friday immediately after Thanksgiving. It’s a day when retailers offer big discounts to kick-start the holiday shopping season. When is Black Friday 2017? Black Friday 2017 will be Friday, 24 November.What is Cyber Monday?Cyber Monday is the Monday immediately after Black Friday. When is Cyber Monday 2017? Cyber Monday 2017 will be on Monday, 27 November.What is Black Friday deals week?It’s the week that includes Black Friday. Retailers are increasingly offering deals before and after Black Friday itself so they stand out from the crowd. Are Black Friday deals real? Yes, although in some cases the discounts have been negotiated well in advance with suppliers. As with any sales you’ll see a mix of genuine bargains, discounted end-of-line stock and mysterious things found in the back of a warehouse somewhere. In 2016, consumer magazine Which? accused retailers of some pretty dodgy behaviour. Where can I find the best Black Friday deals? Right here on TechRadar of course! We scour all the top retailers’ Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals so that you don’t have to - and we tell you whether the deals are worth getting excited about too. Whether it’s a 4K HDR OLED TV or an Xbox One controller, if it’s discounted we’ll have the details here. How do I get the best Black Friday 2017 deals? Know what you want, know what you can afford to spend and know the market: you’ll often spot retailers charging higher than usual prices in October so they can offer amazing discounts on Black Friday. Pay particular attention to real prices, not RRPs: TVs are particularly bad for this, with sets whose RRP is eleventy billion pounds routinely selling for five hundred quid. Sites such as CamelCamelCamel and PriceSpy enable you to tell if you’re looking at a legitimate bargain or some timed tomfoolery. It’s also a very good idea to be flexible: for example, if you fancy a Sony 4K TV then think about the features you want rather than a specific model number: the BRV123ABD54-88C-9218-B may not be discounted on Black Friday, but an almost identical set with the specification you want probably will be. Can I get cashback on Black Friday deals? Sometimes, yes. Your debit card or credit card may offer cashback on purchases, and sites such as Quidco often offer cashback for new customers of big-name online shops. It’s definitely worth looking into, not just for Black Friday but for any online shopping. Am I protected when I buy on Black Friday? Yes. In the UK, anything you buy from a company online is covered by a wealth of consumer protection legislation including the Consumer Contracts regulations, which give you the same rights as with any other online purchasing. How can I stay safe on Black Friday? Black Friday brings out the scammers as well as the sellers, so be wary of unsolicited emails or links to deals on social media no matter how legitimate they look: anything asking for card details or login details is a scam. Phishing sites do big business on Black Friday, so be extra suspicious - and if you’re on a PC, make sure your security software is up to date. Many suites automatically block known scam sites.

Casey | April 22, 2017 MORE $1607 from Editors' rating: The Pros Comfortable keyboard; Excellent battery life (with 6-cell battery); Fast PCIe SSD; Great port selection The Cons Dim display; Gets hot Verdict The ThinkPad T570 is a great productivity notebook hampered by a poor display. Review A 15-inch laptop for professionals, Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 has the full numeric keypad and larger display that you won't find on its little brother, the ThinkPad T470, while offering similar durability and (optional) long battery life. Starting at $1,073 ($1,607 as tested), the T570 offers more than enough performance for heavy multitasking, along with a comfortable keyboard and just about every port you could possibly need. article continued below Design: Keeps it simple, smart The ThinkPad aesthetic is a simple, clean, time-tested look, and Lenovo didn't tweak it on the T570. The raven-black lid features a soft-touch coating (though it's not as luxurious as the coating on the ThinkPad T470), while the bezel deck and underside are made of a sturdy-feeling black plastic. Weighing 4.2 pounds and measuring 0.8 inches thick, the 15-inch ThinkPad T570 is lighter than the 15-inch Dell XPS 15 (4.6 pounds, 0.7 inches) and heavier than the 2016 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro (4 pounds, 0.6 inches). Due to their smaller chassis, the 14-inch ThinkPad T470 (3.5 pounds, 0.8 inches) and the Dell Latitude 5480 (4 pounds, 0.9 inches) are lighter. Switching the default, 3-cell battery out for Lenovo's 61++ extended battery adds a hump to the back bottom of the T570, raising the far end. The extended battery also adds about 0.45 pounds of weight and and about 0.3 inches of height. Lenovo placed the T570's power port, the Thunderbolt 3 port and one USB 3.0 port on the machine's left side. Over on the right, you'll find two more USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI-out port, an Ethernet jack, a headphone jack and an SD memory reader. The fingerprint reader is to the right of the touchpad. Of the T570's competitors, all but the Latitude 5480 offer Thunderbolt 3, while the MacBook Pro and XPS 15 are the only ones that lack an Ethernet port. Durability and Security: Strong, with decent protection The ThinkPad T570 is designed to pass several MIL-SPEC durability tests, including those for operating in extreme temperatures (minus 4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and surviving shocks and vibrations. All configurations of the ThinkPad T570 feature a TPM chip, for securing sensitive information, and a fingerprint reader, for Windows Hello logins. If you configure the laptop with a CPU that supports it (Core i5-7300U or Core i7-7600U), you'll get Intel's vPro remote-management technology. Display: I find this lack of brightness disturbing Streaming the Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer on the ThinkPad T570's 15.6-inch panel, I noted the display offers passable color, minimal brightness and decent detail. The 1080p panel offered rich, inky-black tones and allowed me to see the fine rock particles Rey levitated during Force training. But the blue skies looked washed out, and the normally red dust clouds were rendered in a maroon hue.  According to our colorimeter, the ThinkPad T570 produces 73 percent of the sRGB spectrum. That's tied with the ThinkPad T470's score (73 percent) and near the showing by the Latitude 5480 (71 percent). The 95-percent category average is much higher, and you'll also find more color in the MacBook Pro (116 percent) and XPS 15 (188 percent).  MORE: Best Lenovo Laptops The ThinkPad T570 emits only 212 nits (a measure of brightness), a score that's somewhere between the 234 nits from the ThinkPad T470 and the 202 nits from the Latitude 5480. The mainstream-notebook average (277 nits) is brighter, as are the marks from the 440-nit MacBook Pro and the 282-nit XPS 15. This dimness leads to poor viewing angles on the T570, as the panel darkens at 30 degrees to the left or right. The ThinkPad T570's touch-screen panel accurately tracked my touch as I navigated the desktop and doodled in Paint. It also recognized left and right swipe-in gestures for app navigation and opening the Action Center. Keyboard, Trackpoint, Touchpad: Comfy, but we expect more The T570's keyboard offers a strong typing experience that compares favorably to most laptops but doesn't match up to the the best ThinkPads. Testing it out on the 10fastfingers.com typing test, I click-clacked my way to 82 words per minute, exceeding my 80-wpm average. While its keys offer a decent 1.6 millimeters of travel and 61 grams of required actuation force (we hope to see 1.5-2.0mm and more than 60 g), the ThinkPad T470's keyboard was much snappier, with 2mm and 70 grams, respectively. The ThinkPad T570's red TrackPoint nub offers the industry-leading accuracy and comfort we've come to expect from Lenovo pointing sticks. Its convex shape makes it easier to move than the concave-shaped sticks we find on some Dell and HP business laptops. The notebook's 3.9 x 2.6-inch touchpad and the trio of buttons above the pad provide a solid feel in each click. The smooth surface offers easy two-finger scrolling and speedy responses to Windows 10's three-finger app-switching gestures. Audio: Sweet sound in need of tweaks The ThinkPad T570 provides high-quality, Dolby Audio-enhanced sound, provided you adjust its presets. When the laptop filled our large conference room with Paramore's "Hard Times," I noted that bass sounded strong and synths hit accurately. However, singer Hayley Williams' voice sounded muffled by ambient instrumental noise. I fixed this by opening the Lenovo Settings app, tapping on the Audio/Media section and switching the preset from Music to Voice. Performance: Good enough for mainstream multiasking The ThinkPad T570 configuration we tested features a Core i5-7300U CPU, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB PCIe SSD, which together offer strong multitasking capabilities. I saw no stutter after splitting my screen among a 1080p YouTube video and 12 Chrome Tabs (including Slack, TweetDeck and Google Docs). This ThinkPad earned a respectable score of 7,347 on the GeekBench 4 general performance test, which is just above the 6,739 mark from the ThinkPad T470 (Core i5-7200U, 8GB). It's below the 11,390 category average, the 8,999 from the Latitude 5480 (Core i7-7600U, 8GB), the 13,911 from the XPS 15 (Core i7-7700HQ, 16GB) and the 13,215 from the MacBook Pro (6th Gen Core i7, 16GB). The 256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD in the ThinkPad T570 is speedy, duplicating 4.97GB of multimedia files in 21 seconds, for a rate of 242.3 MBps. That's close to the 267.8MBps showing by the ThinkPad T470 (256GB PCIe SSD) and better than the 190.9MBps mainstream-notebook average, as well as the 137.55MBps achieved by the Dell Latitude 5480 (256GB M.2 2280 SATA SSD). Faster speeds came from the MacBook Pro (512GB, PCIe SSD) and XPS 15 (512GB PCIe SSD), which notched 727 MBps and 339.3 MBps, respectively. The ThinkPad T570 finished our OpenOffice productivity test in 3 minutes and 34 seconds, placing narrowly behind the times from the Latitude 5480 (3:12) and the XPS 15 (3:23). Still, it's faster than the 3:58 category average and the ThinkPad T470 (4:01). You can play videos on this laptop, but you probably shouldn't try playing games. The integrated Intel HD 620 graphics in the T570 helped it earn a modest score of 64,581 on the Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test. This is below the 88,221 mainstream notebook average but within the range of other laptops that have integrated graphics, like the ThinkPad T470 (62,912) and Latitude 5480 (73,623). Battery Life: 15+ hours The ThinkPad T570 lasts a long time on a single charge, provided you use the optional 6-cell battery. With the extended battery on board, the T570 lasted an epic 15 hours and 37 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test. That's not quite as long as the time of the T470 with 6-cell battery (17:25), but it beats the tar out of the category average (7:11), and the showings by the Latitude 5480 (11:37), MacBook Pro (10:32) and XPS 15 (8:23).  MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life However, if you don't get the 6-cell battery and its 0.4 pounds of additional weight, you'll have to deal with far lower battery life. With the 3-cell unit on board, the ThinkPad T570 lasted just 6 hours and 11 minutes on our test. Whichever battery you get, you can always swap it out. The T570 uses Lenovo's Power Bridge technology, which combines an internal 3-cell battery with the removable 3 or 6-cell unit, so you can change batteries without ever shutting off your laptop. Webcam: Acceptably average The T570's 0.9-megapixel webcam is on par with the cameras on other business laptops. When I shot a selfie, the laptop accurately reproduced the red wall behind me and my white and blue dress shirt. However, as with most built-in webcams, there was an overall fuzziness and plenty of visual noise. Heat: Warm bottom, cool top As long as you don't place the T570 on your lap, it feels cool to the touch. After we streamed 15 minutes of HD video on the notebook, our heat gun registered temperatures of up to 107 degrees Fahrenheit on the laptop's underside, which obliterates our 95-degree comfort threshold. That's not a huge problem, because this laptop is too large for most people to balance it on their legs. Its touchpad (82 degrees) and G & H keys (87 degrees) didn't present such a problem. Software: Minimal, but still there Lenovo preloads the ThinkPad T570 with a standard set of software, including the company's proprietary apps. Lenovo Settings houses a ton of options, such as Dolby Audio presets and Battery Stretch mode for extending your endurance. You also get Candy Crush Soda Saga, March of Empires and Sling TV, so get ready to uninstall some bloatware. Configuration Options At publication time, Lenovo.com was not yet selling the ThinkPad T570. CDW sells the $1,607 ThinkPad T570 we tested, which features a Core i5-7300U CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 1080p touch screen and a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD. The $1,073 entry-level T570 includes a Core i5-7200U CPU, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB and 7,200rpm HD, and a 1080p nontouch display. For the most speed, check out the $1,678 T570, which packs a Core i7-7600U CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD and a nontouch 1080p display. None of the CDW laptops come with the 6-cell battery, which costs $139 when purchased separately from Lenovo.com. When Lenovo.com starts selling the ThinkPad T570, you'll likely be able to configure the laptop to order, choosing the screen, CPU, storage, battery, RAM and other features you want. Upgrading to the 6-cell battery during the config process will probably cost no more than $25 extra. Bottom Line The Latitude T570 offers a comfortable keyboard, fantastic battery life and solid multitasking performance. A dim screen and warm bottom mean that this laptop is good enough for the office, but not quite sleek enough for frequent business travel or good enough for creative professionals. Productivity workers who are willing to consider a smaller, 14-inch laptop will get longer battery life, a bright screen and a better typing experience from the ThinkPad T470. High-end users and creative types will prefer the 15-inch Apple MacBook Pro, which offers a fantastic display, but that machine starts at a whopping $2,399 ($800 more than the T570). Those who don't need a business notebook will prefer the Dell XPS 15 , which costs a bit more but is much thinner and has a far better screen. However, if you're looking for a durable, powerful 15-inch business laptop, the ThinkPad T570 could be your best choice.

That’s why we suggest you take a hard look at your major and make sure that your laptop of choice can accommodate the tasks at hand. Not sure what those are? Speak to your guidance counselor and email your professor. If they’re an invested educator they’ll be happy to provide guidance around this subject matter. After all, the more prepared you are for the class, the easier the job. Our Top Laptops for College Picks Best for a Computer Science Degree Dell XPS 13 The Dell XPS 13 laptop might be on the pricier side, but with that you get ultrabook performance. Price: $942.39 | Read Full Review: Dell XPS 13 Review | Features: InfinityEdge display, touchscreen, Intel i5-6200U 2.3 GHz Processor WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Dell XPS 13 puts portability and power in a punchy, flexible package. A little on the pricier side – though cheaper than the Surface Book – Dell’s XPS13 is entirely worth it, and is truly one of the best laptops for college students in price and tech specs. With a 13.3-inch Full HD Infinity display, 4GB of RAM, 128GB SSD, the XPS 13 is the perfect mix of power and flexibility that college students need from their daily driver. The Dell XPS 13 will be able to keep up with even the most demanding tasks, whether that’s using tools like Photoshop and AutoDesk 3DS Max, or programming software like Android Studio and Eclipse. The Dell XPS 13 is also the perfect entertainment machine. With its 13.3-inch Infinity display, it has one of the sharpest images you’ll see on a portable machine. It’s perfect for the media professional, but also great for watching movies, TV shows, and even doubles as a halfway decent gaming laptop. View on Amazon – $942.39 Best Creative Arts College Laptop Apple Macbook The Macbook first got cool on college campuses, and it still hasn’t lost its edge Price: $1,269.00 | Features: Force Touch trackpad, Retina display, 10hr battery life WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: No other laptop has the same “cool” factor as a new Macbook. Although Apple and its ubiquitous Macbook line of laptops may not be the dominant force among college students these days, the company still knows how to make a solid machine that goes the distance when it comes to software integration and unique hardware tweaks. Apple still makes the Macbook Pro in both 13″ and 15″ flavors, but unless you know you’ll be doing a lot of heavy rendering or running intensive applications, the regular 12″ model should handle nearly any job you can throw at it with ease. The inclusion of the Force Touch mousepad is perfect for students who need to navigate through a lot of content quickly and easily, while OSX continues to be the operating system of choice among departments dedicated to the creative arts. If you have to run OSX for your particular program, or just want a dependable all-around laptop that’s perfect for any kind of project, the Macbook is still king with college students everywhere. View on Amazon – $1,269.00 Best Durable College Laptop HP Stream 13 The HP Stream 13 is a low-end laptop, intended for basic tasks like paper writing and spreadsheet construction. Price: $219.00 | Features: Durable shell, 32GB of SSD storage, one-year subscription to Office 365 WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The HP Stream 13 wins on its raw ability to take a punch. If there’s one thing parents know about their kids, it’s how clumsy they can be when it comes to keeping their technology in one piece. The HP Stream is definitely the most durable (and colorful) laptop on this list, available in Cobalt Blue, Orchid Magenta, Violet Purple, and Horizon Blue. With a 13.3-inch display, an Intel Celeron N3050, 2GB of RAM, and 32GB of SSD storage, the Stream 13 is decidedly low-end, making it one of the cheapest laptops for college on our list. But what makes the HP Stream 13 one of the best laptops for college students? It’s ultra portability and the fact that it comes with a free year of Office 365, something that costs almost as much as the laptop itself. View on Amazon – $219.00 Best for Design/Photoshop Microsoft Surface Book The Microsoft Surface Book is our #1 laptop for college pick. Price: $1,399.99  | Features: Convertible design, touchscreen, 13.5″ display WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: If you’re in creative design, the Surface Book loves to get drawn on. With Microsoft’s Surface Book, you’re in for a treat. Fast, portable, and easy to set up.  The Surface Book also offers two different uses – laptop, and tablet (or “clipboard” mode). This adds to the portability, making it fantastic for the on-the-go student. With the base unit starting with a 13.5-inch display, an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of SSD storage, the Surface Book is perfect for the student that can handle the demands of Graphic Design and/or demanding software tools like CAD and Photoshop. And the ability to transform the Surface Book into a tablet is another great feature because it removes the need for another device.  It’s truly one of the best laptops for college students. View on Amazon – $1,399.99 Best Midrange College Laptop  ASUS X551MA The ASUS X551MA is the perfect blend between low-range and high-end laptops. Price: $315.00 | Features: 4GB RAM, 500GB storage, 15.6″ display WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The X551 is a solid all-around laptop for any class you have on your schedule. ASUS’ X551MA makes our list of the best laptops for college students as its a perfect blend mid-range and is only $50 more than the HP Stream 13. Specs include a 15.6-inch display, an Intel dual-core Celeron N2830, 4GB of RAM, and 500GB of internal storage. It doesn’t have any special technology, but it’s a standard mid-range laptop that’ll handle basic tasks (and some demanding) with ease, whether that be writing papers or playing the occasional game. It’s one of the best affordable laptop for college students too, coming in at well under $300. View on Amazon – $315.00 Best Option for Students On the Go Samsung Chromebook 3 The Samsung Chromebook 2, next to the Acer Chromebook 15, is one of the most powerful Chromebooks on the market. Price: $179.00 | Features: 2.5lbs, Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The ultra-portable Samsung Chromebook 3 fits inside any backpack. College students are known for lugging around backpacks packed to the zipper with textbooks that can sometimes weigh 50lbs or more, which is why sometimes portability is key when looking for your next laptop to take with you to university. Not only does the Samsung Chromebook 3 have an Intel Celeron N3050 processor, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and Intel HD Graphics, it does it all at a feather-light 2.5lbs. It also has Google’s suite of apps built-in, allowing you to put together papers, spreadsheets, and presentations online or offline if you’re out of range of the local dorm Wi-Fi connection. It comes with 100GB of free Google Drive storage, removing the need to keep any files on the machine itself. Prospective students should note, however, that with just an 11.6-inch 1366×768 display, the Samsung Chromebook 3 may not the perfect solution for streaming any sort of media content for too long without suffering from eye strain. View on Amazon – $399.99 Best Budget Pick  ASUS C201 The ASUS C201 is a compact and lightweight Chromebook, dedicated to all things Google. Price: $179.00 | Features: 13hr battery life, Rockchip CPU, Chrome OS WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The ASUS C201 is a light, cheap Chromebook for all students out there. This Chromebook is quite the popular buy, and we can see why: it’s a one of the best cheap laptops for students. It weighs a meager 2lbs, sports up to 13-hours of battery life, and has a Rockchip 3288-C quad-core processor, making the ASUS C201 Chromebook one of the most reliable machines you can get your hands on. The aspect that sets this Chromebook apart from everything else is it’s ability to last up to 13-hours on battery. View on Amazon – $179.00 Best Chromebook for College  Acer Chromebook 15 The Acer Chromebook 15 is one of Acer’s most powerful Chromebooks yet. Price: $499.99 | Read Full Review: Acer Chromebook 15 Review | Features: Intel Core i5-5200u CPU, 15.6″ FHD LED screen WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: The Acer Chromebook 15 is perfect for work or play on campus. Acer’s Chromebook 15 is lightweight for perfect portability, has a 2.16GHz processor, and falls just under $500. Add that to the sleek, modern design and you have a solid all-around machine for any member of the family. Although the Toshiba Chromebook 2 beat the Acer 15 in screen quality, the Acer is still great for college students because it packs in just a few more of the features that kids want like big speakers to share media with their friends, and a slightly roomier display if they need to multitask on multiple projects at once. Whether you need to write a paper or collaborate in Google Drive, the Chromebook 15 will perform without a problem. And, just like any Chromebook, it comes with a free 100GB of Google Drive storage to give you plenty of room to store documents and other files while on the go. View on Amazon – $499.99 How We Chose the Best Laptops for College When looking for the best laptops for college students, we pulled from a wide range of options both in price and features to give you the broadest spectrum of options available. Just like every college student is different, so is the laptop choice that’s right for them. Some don’t need a lot of power and prefer portability over everything else, while others might require a machine that can render 3D models and watch lectures streaming online at the same time. Because laptops go everywhere with their corresponding college student, every choice we’ve made here is durable enough to stand up to punishment for all four years they’re earning their degree, but also light enough to slide into a backpack quickly and easily without any hassle. A laptop for college needs to boot quickly, run smoothly, and be able to run almost any program you can think of (in case next semester you decide you want to pursue VFX design instead of biochemistry). Ultimately the laptop that’s right for you or your kids will combine all the best aspects of a laptop into one complete package at a cost that’s manageable for your expectations. Key Factors to a Top Laptop For College Performance: There’s no need to overbuy in power. Find the right power for your needs. For instance, if you’re just picking up a laptop for writing papers, you might not need something with a large capacity SSD, a hefty processor, and 8GB of RAM..and with it a hefty price tag. Likewise, if you’re buying something for a Graphic Design or CAD class, you’ll likely need something much heftier than just 4GB of RAM and a dual-core processor. Find a laptop that meets your needs and sets you up for success. Portability: Make sure to purchase a thin and lightweight laptop. There’s nothing worse than carrying around a chunky laptop that’s awkward and heavy to lug around campus or to the library. It’s also good practice to make sure your laptop has a small footprint, allowing you to easily put it in most backpacks or carrying bags alongside textbooks and other study materials. Battery: Find a laptop with a good battery, preferably one that’ll last you all day and then some. For instance, the ASUS C201 has a battery that lasts up to 13-hours, giving you plenty of study time during the day and then some. While you might not need that much, it’s good to search for laptops that will last a little over three hours. Who Should Buy a Laptop for College Of course, you don’t have to be straight out of high school to be in the market for a new college laptop. Whether you’re unpacking your bags in a dorm away from home for the first time or returning after a long hiatus to finish up your master’s degree, buying a fresh laptop before classes start in the fall is always a solid investment. What classes you plan on taking, as well as the degree you’re pursuing should have an impact on the laptop you eventually choose to go with. If you need something sleek and powerful that can turn on instantly for rapid-fire notetaking, the Dell XPS 13 or Zenbook UX360AC should suit the job just fine. But, if you’re worried about spending a ton of cash on a laptop that not might last more than a few months without getting beer spilled in the keyboard, the HP Stream 13 and Acer C201 are cheaper, durable options that can weather any alcohol-related storm. Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a College Laptop Don’t make the mistake of buying the wrong operating system. Some school programs will specifically require either a Windows or OSX-based laptop (be sure to check your syllabus) for programs like Photoshop and Gimp. If your learning is strictly reading books, writing papers, and taking quizzes, then you might not need the aforementioned operating systems. In that case opt for a Chromebook, especially if all your activities will be Web based. Another thing to avoid is having too little RAM or hard drive space. The a solid laptop for students will have just enough storage capacity and RAM for studying, completing assignments, and play. If your degree program requires a lot of heavy duty software, find a laptop that has 4GB of RAM or more and a hard drive with 500GB of storage space or more. This will be enough to ensure that any software you throw on your computer runs smoothly without any hiccups.  And keep in mind that an SSD hard drive will increase speeds as well, especially start up time. And never buy at full retails.  As a student always be on the look for those student discounts, even if something already seems cheap! Most Important Features Hard Drive As far as Windows laptops go, and you don’t use many programs, look for a hard drive with a capacity of 256GB or higher. It’ll meet your needs and then some. If you’re a power user, look for 500GB or higher so there’s more than enough space for other content. If most of your activity takes place on the Web, then you might not need a hard drive larger than 32GB, which is just enough space for the operating system and storing a handful of documents offline. If possible, find a solid-state drive over a traditional hard drive. Performance and speeds will increase astronomically. RAM If you need to do anything more demanding than just using a web browser, find a laptop that has at least 4GB of RAM or more, ideally 8GB, especially if you plan on using programs like Photoshop. If you’re just using a web browser, look for a laptop with a minimum of 2GB of RAM. Your computer, whether it be Windows or Chrome OS, won’t even use that much, but it still ensures the speed and responsiveness of your machine. Alternatively, find a machine that you can upgrade the RAM yourself, which can save you money during the initial investment. Operating System It’s important to find the right operating system for your College program. If you’re in Computer Science or something that requires you to use Windows or Mac applications, it’s good to shy away from Chromebooks. If your studying takes place online and doesn’t require you to use any Windows or Mac applications, jump the gun and get a Chromebook. Processor A lower clocked dual-core processor below 2GHz won’t slow down your laptop if you’re using it for minor tasks like writing papers, browsing the web, watching media, and so on. If you’re in a degree program that has some demanding programs (e.g. Photoshop, Autodesk 3DS Max, and medical software), make sure you look for a quad-core processor with a clock speed of 2GHz or higher. Not only will it last you longer running these types of programs, but rendering and general speed will be a lot faster and more efficient than a dual-core CPU below 2GHz. At the same time, don’t overbuy in processor clock speed. For instance, there aren’t many differences between a quad-core 3.7GHz processor and a quad-core 3.9GHz processor. The only real difference is the much higher price tag. There’s little effect as far as processing power and efficiency goes. Display Finding a good display has much to do with the size that you’re comfortable with and need to work with. Whether it be 11-inch or 17-inch displays, they’re all good as long as they have a resolution of 720p or higher. Anything below that is often blurry and has very little clarity. You’ll want to make sure your display has a refresh rate of at least 60Hz to avoid any screen tearing or altered graphics when playing games and watching movies. The display you purchase should have built-in features for reducing eye strain, such as dimming the brightness or even having a feature for night use. This will help a lot as far as eye strain goes. Battery Some lectures can last over four hours in a single sitting, which is why you’ll want a laptop that can at least double up on two of those a day without needing a recharge. Most good quality laptops will have built-in power saving features that can stretch their life to 10 hours or more. You should be able to get a full charge in just two to three hours, allowing you to quickly get back to work whenever needed. Ports The best laptops for college students will have more than a single USB port. More manufacturers are headed towards just including one USB port, but it’s truly a hassle to deal with, as you can’t really plug in any extra peripherals or accessories without connecting a USB hub first. Make sure the laptop you buy has an HDMI, DVI, VGA, or Display Port. You never know when you might need to switch to a bigger screen, and having one of these ports will let you do that, with VGA being the most common for projectors you’d find in the average classroom. Which Best Laptops for College Students are right for you? Need something powerful that can handle the demands from Photoshop and/or CAD? Then the Microsoft Surface Book and Dell XPS 13 are laptops that are right up your alley. Alternatively, if you’re looking for something more humble for doing your everyday tasks at college and maybe a little media consumption when you have some time off, then the ASUS X551MA or HP Stream 13 are both laptops to consider. And, then there are Chromebooks, web-based laptops. Some are hesitant to jump on the Chromebook bandwagon, and might not consider them the best laptops for college students, simply because you can’t use Windows-based software on it. You might be surprised, but more often than not, we just don’t use the programs on Windows, strictly using web browsers like Chrome and Firefox for all of our computer use. Still not sure if these are the best laptops for college students? Then take a look at our laptops for college reviews, as they might just be able to help you make that final decision.

I,m old enough to be absolutly lost when you talk about anything pertaining to CPU requirements. All I want is a 17 inch screen, fast recovery , CAD capable , DVD capable and software to write a book. I surf the net looking at Ancient history and I need the top of the line junk protection. I get so many viruses everyday that I run x2 different scans every day. AVG and Malwarebits. I also work late at night and would like a lighted key board. HP lap tops are a piece of dodo. What do you recommend? Reply Chris Stobing on Hey Les, Unfortunately Windows will always have problems with viruses, and are also the only machines (under $3,000) that can run CAD software effectively. Lighted keyboards generally only come on Dell ultrabooks (which don’t push past 15″ these days), so with all those factors in mind my best recommendation would be the Predator 17 from Acer. It is a gaming laptop, but it will also have enough power to run CAD without any problems!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Stocks for Retirees Why CVS Health, Intel, and United Parcel Service stand out as great stocks for retired investors. Keith Speights (TMFFishBiz) Apr 23, 2017 at 7:22AM If there's one thing you don't want in your retirement portfolio, it's a high level of uncertainty. The ideal stocks are those that should do relatively well over the long run and pay nice dividends along the way. Three stocks especially fit the bill: CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Here's why these are three top stocks for retirees.  Image source: Getty Images. CVS Health: A prescription for success More retired Americans means good news for CVS Health. As people age, they tend to need more prescription drugs. CVS Health operates over 9,600 retail pharmacies in 49 states plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Brazil. These pharmacies should be well-positioned to gain more business over the coming years. CVS Health also claims the second-largest pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business in the U.S. PBMs help control prescription drug costs for payers by negotiating lower costs with drugmakers, managing high-cost specialty medications, promoting use of generic drugs, and reducing waste. As you might imagine, the opportunities for PBMs, particularly large ones like CVS Health, are expected to grow as the number of older Americans increases. The company projects average annual earnings-per-share growth of 10% over the long term. That's not bad, especially considering that CVS Health also pays a solid dividend with a current yield of 2.55%. The pharmacy services giant uses only 34% of earnings to fund its dividend program, which means there's plenty of room for future dividend hikes. Intel: Changing with the times Intel stands out as a technology company that has effectively changed with the times. The company initially developed semiconductors but switched to focus on making microprocessors. Intel is now a leader in powering cloud-based data centers and in the Internet of Things.  Investing in technology stocks could be scary to retired investors. Intel's size and ability to adapt should minimize any worries. The company generated $10.3 billion in profit last year on $59.4 billion in revenue. Intel has used its deep financial resources to expand into new areas, most recently announcing plans in March to acquire self-driving car technology pioneer Mobileye. While many tech stocks are priced at stratospheric levels, Intel stock trades at only 12 times expected earnings. That valuation is made even more attractive by the company's dividend yield of 3.08%. Intel has a good track record of increasing its dividend and expects to continue dividend hikes in the future.   United Parcel Service: Delivering for investors United Parcel Service (UPS) delivered an astounding 4.9 billion packages last year. The company expects that volume to keep on rising in the coming years as e-commerce continues to reshape the retail industry. UPS is investing in several areas that should fuel additional growth. The company is developing new solutions that enable its customers to create highly flexible supply chains for supporting mass customization. It has focused on expanding capabilities to support the rapidly growing healthcare industry. And UPS has continued to build out its global network. In 2016, the company's fastest-growing markets were China, Vietnam, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.  When it comes to operating profitably, UPS leads the industry with an operating margin of 14.6%. That helps the company pay out a nice dividend, which currently yields 3.2%. UPS also spent nearly $2.7 billion on share repurchases last year and expects to buy back another $1.8 billion of its stock in 2017.  Best pick All three companies are well run. All three should deliver growth and solid dividends. If you could only pick one of these three stocks, though, my view is that CVS Health would be the best bet.  CVS Health is in an enviable position to benefit from an unstoppable demographic trend. The stock is also attractively valued. In addition, CVS Health is in a better position than either Intel or UPS to increase its dividend in the future. Retirees shouldn't go wrong with any of these stocks, but CVS Health could be the biggest winner over the long run. Keith Speights has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel launches a slightly faster Core M3 Kaby Lake CPU (and a new 4.5 watt Core i5 chip too) 04/21/2017 at 9:19 AM by Brad Linder 2 Comments Intel launched the Core M line of processors a few years ago, to offer a low-power chip that offers significantly better performance than the company’s Atom processors. Core M chips can be used in fanless computers and/or offer opportunities for long battery life due to their low power consumption. When Intel launched its 7th-gen Core “Kaby Lake” chips, the company only had a single model with the Core M name: the Core M3-7Y30. It used Core i5 and Core i7 names for more powerful variations of the chip, to indicate that the higher-end models offered a significant performance boost. But now there’s a second Core M Kaby Lake chips: the Intel Core M3-7Y32. So what’s the difference between the Core M3-7Y30 nd 7Y32? Not much, actually. Both are 4.5 watt, dual-core processors. The TDP can be adjusted up to 7 watts or down to 3.75 watts for higher performance or improved energy efficiency, depending on a system builder’s needs. Here’s the difference: both chips support burst speeds that are much higher than the base clock speed, allowing them to operate at higher frequencies for a short period of time (which is part of why these chips offer performance that’s closer to what you’d expect from a Core i3 chip than an Atom or Celeron processor). But the Core M3-7Y30 processor has a base clock speed of 1 GHz and a top burst speed of 2.6 GHz. The newer M3-7Y32 starts at 1.1 GHz and tops out at 3 GHz. Both chips support up to 16GB of memory and feature Intel HD 615 graphics with base clock speeds of 300 MHz and top speeds of 900 MHz. In related news, it looks like Intel also added a new low-power Core i5 chip to its lineup earlier this year. The Core i5-7Y57 processor is a close relative to the Core M3 Kaby Lake chips, but it’s even closer to the Core i5-7Y54 processor that launched last year. In this case, the only real difference is the maximum burst speed, which has gone up from 3.2 GHz to 3.3 GHz. via CPU World   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 2 Comments on "Intel launches a slightly faster Core M3 Kaby Lake CPU (and a new 4.5 watt Core i5 chip too)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest sportniik Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement HP’s new ZBook Mobile Workstations pack big power into small packages 04/21/2017 at 11:55 AM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment HP has unveiled four new mobile workstations as part of the company’s ZBook line of business laptops, and a few of them are surprisingly compact. The new HP Zbook 15 and ZBook 17 are high-power notebooks with support for up to Intel Xeon chips and NVIDIA Quadro graphics. But if you’re willing to sacrifice a bit of CPU power for portability, the ZBook 14u G4 is a smaller 3.6 pound model with a 14 inch display, a 15 watt Intel Kaby Lake dual-core processor, and AMD FirePro graphics. There’s also a 4.6 pound premium model called the HP ZBook Studio G4 which features a 15.6 inch display, up to a Xeon processor, and NVIDIA graphics. HP ZBook Studio G4 The ZBook Studio is a premium laptop that measures about 0.7 inches thick, but which supports processor options ranging from a Core i5-7300HQ quad-core CPU to a Xeon E3-1535m v6. It also supports solid state storage, comes with 1920 x 1080 pixel or 3840 x 2160 pixel display options, and features Intel HD 630 graphics and NVIDIA Quadro M1200M graphics. HP offers several different SSD storage options including SATA and PCIe options. Prices for this model start at $1399. The ZBook 14u, meanwhile, will likely have a lower starting price when it goes on sale this summer. It will be available with 1366 x 768 pixel and 1920 x 1080 pixel display options, Core i5-7200U through Core i7-7600U CPU options, Intel HD 620 and AMD FirePro W4190M graphics. HP ZBook 14u G4 HP ZBook 14u G4 HP ZBook 14u G4 Both laptops are available with up to 32GB of RAM, but the 14 inch model supports SATA hard drives, M.2 SATA solid state storage, or NVMe PCIe SSDs. While the Zbook 14u is the lightest of HP’s new mobile workstations, it’s not the thinnest. The laptop measures about 0.9 inches thick.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Zotac introduces CI327 nano fanless PC with Celeron N3450 Apollo Lake processor 04/22/2017 at 8:00 AM by Brad Linder 4 Comments I’m still waiting for the Intel Kaby Lake-powered Zotac ZBOX mini-desktops introduced at CES to hit the streets. But Zotac has just unveiled a new model worth keeping an eye out for. The Zotac ZBOX CI327 nano is a small, fanless desktop with an Intel Celeron N3450 Apollo Lake quad-core processor. Zotac will offer several different models, including a barebones version, a Plus model that comes with memory and storage, and a “with Windows” model that has all of the above, plus, you know, Windows. The system features HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.2, and VGA ports with support for up to 3 displays. There’s an M.2 slot for solid state storage and a 2.5 inch drive bay for a hard drive or solid state drive. And there are two DDR3L-1866 SODIMM slots for up to 8GB of memory. Each model includes 802.11ac WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, an external antenna, and two Gigabit Ethernet ports, two USB 3.0 ports, a USB 3.0 Type-C port, and two USB 2.0 ports. There are also separate mic and headphone jacks and an SD card reader. The Zotac ZBOX CI327 Plus has all of the above, but also comes with 4GB of RAM and a 2.5″ 128GB SATA solid state drive. And the Zotac ZBOX CI327 with Windows has 4GB of RAM and a 32GB M.2 SSD (the 2.5″ drive bay is empty, allowing you to add your own storage). According to Fanless Tech, the ZBOX CI327 is a follow-up to the best-selling fanless ZBOX mini PC to date, which is the last-gen model featuring an Intel Celeron Braswell processor. The new model should offer a modest performance boost while still selling for a relatively affordable price. Older ZBOX CI323 desktops with Celeron N3150 Braswell chips currently sell for as little as $134.

CPU use is rarely ever above 15%, with all kinds of stuff turned on like IPS/Traffic Shaping/nTop/Darkstat/Squid/etc, but my connection is pretty slow. The only hiccup I’ve seen with it is that the broadcom chipset it uses sometimes has issue and I have to reboot the box but there’s a patch for that which has been confirmed to remove the issue. It’s pretty much overkill for what I have now but Gigabit up/down is in my near future so I built something to future proof.

If this review is anything to go by, then the memory type is definitely game changing, although not entirely in the manner most of us thought it would be. It definitely gives an upgrade over traditional SSDs in terms of endurance, speed and latency but probably the most critical update lies in the consistent performance this memory type can offer, which is miles ahead of what any conventional SSD can currently achieve. Intel’s 3D XPoint based DC P4800X SSD blows away the competition with sustained performance under heavy loads Before we go any further, the benchmarks below have been sourced from Tom’s Hardware and you can head over to their site to read the full review should you want to (I definitely recommend doing so). While this review was conducted by a third party, it’s not a completely independent one. Intel only allowed remote access to the drive and did not even give them the user manual to consult, which limits the amount of information they can report on. While I am sure all the tests were run on a real Optane SSD, it does create an unnecessary air of uncertainty which should usually be avoided.  In any case, this will have to do for now and boy are the preliminary numbers good! Without any further ado, lets jump in. Related Intel Launches Optane SSD DC P4800X, Enters Revenue Quarter For 3D XPoint, Storage Roadmap Detailed Endurance rating of the Intel 3D XPoint DC P4800X. Table courtesy of Tom’s Hardware. The first thing you will notice is that the Intel DC P4800X easily has the most endurance around, as compared to traditional SSDs, but this isn’t a structural break in the trend by any means. In fact, the DC P3700 is based on plain ol NAND memory and offers 20% less endurance for almost 4.2x times the amount of total memory. Of course, the DC P3700 will set you back 2 grand ($2065) while as the DC P4800X will retail at around $1520 so you are basically paying around $4 per GB on the DC P4800X and around $1.69 per GB for the DC P3700. This is a steep price to pay for what is essentially, ultra fast storage. Advertisement Read/Write Latency of the Intel Optane DC P4800X. Courtesy of Tom’s Hardware. Up next, we have the 70/30 Read/Write latency benchmark for the 3D XPoint Memory based SSD and it is here that we see the first signs of a complete structural break from the existing trend. The P4800X Intel Optane SSD is miles ahead of its competition in terms of sustained Read/Write latency as well as the average count! In fact, it is exactly 36x times faster in sustained latency than the DC P3700 and almost 71 times faster than the DC P3608. This is a trend that we will continue to see in the next few benchmarks as well. All benchmarks below are courtesy of Tom’s Hardware. Related Intel Optane Memory Specifications and Roadmap Update – Intel 8000p Revealed, Will Have Sequential Read of up to 1600 MB/s Whereas traditional SSDs hit peak performance during the initial moments after a load is applied, they quickly settle down to a performance level that is many tiers below the original speed. The Intel Optane memory appears to be completely immune to this effect and has no trouble delivering the rated speed consistently throughout the testing done by Tom’s Hardware. In fact, this might be the first SSD where you actually get the performance that is advertised 24/7. Looking at the Random Read, Write and Mixed benchmarks as well we see the same trend: The Optane memory based DC P4800X is in another league when compared to its NAND based siblings and can be safely called a disruptive innovation in this area. Intel has successfully innovated a new memory standard. Currently however, the tech is a bit too expensive for the average consumer. Dropping a grand and a half for a measly 375 GBs of memory is not something the vast vast majority of consumers would do – even in the high end segment. But what these performance numbers do achieve is a proof of concept. This is real live testing done by real world reviewers that show the Optane Memory does manage to deliver on the hype, albeit at a very steep price. While it is bleeding edge tech at the moment, the price will eventually come down to more palatable levels and I have no doubt it will be able to disrupt the NAND industry then. That said, if Intel’s own plans with traditional SSDs is anything to go by, this is not something that is likely to happen for the next couple of years.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Gigabyte has a new Brix-branded bare-bones PC with… Gigabyte has a new Brix-branded bare-bones PC with a seventh-generation Intel CPU By Kevin Parrish — April 20, 2017 11:01 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Customers who need a mountable, compact PC based on the latest technologies should find what they are looking for in Gigabyte's latest Brix-branded unit. Gigabyte recently updated its Brix-branded portfolio with the GB-EKi3A-7100. It’s the first in the family to use a seventh-generation “Kaby Lake” processor from Intel, and follows Gigabyte’s GB-EACE-3440 in packing a similar overall design based on an older Intel N3450 “Apollo Lake” chip. Both are ideal for those who need a powerful, quiet PC that’s mountable under a desk or on the backplate of a monitor. Gigabyte’s new Brix unit is based on a compact, fanless design. It includes a VESA mounting bracket, Wireless AC connectivity, plenty of ports for peripherals and additional displays, and even two USB 3.1 Gen2 ports providing transfer speeds at up to 10Gbps. These ports are great for connecting additional displays when the HDMI and Mini DisplayPort connections just aren’t enough. Here are the specs: Processor: Intel Core i3-7100U Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 Memory: 2x DDR4 1.2v slots (2,133MHz, 32GB maximum) Storage: 1x M.2 slot PCIe/SATA (2280) Connectivity: Wireless AC (Intel 3165) Audio: Realtek ALC255 Ports (front): 1x Microphone/headphone combo jack 1x USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C 1x USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-A !x RS232 COM port Ports (back): 2x USB 3.1 Gen1 1x gigabit Ethernet 1x Mini DisplayPort 1.2 1x HDMI 2.0 Ports (side): 2x antenna SMA connectors Motherboard size: 4.13 x 4.52 inches Dimensions: 1.42 x 4.61 x 7.09 inches Weight: 2.15 Price: ~$380 What’s important to note here is that customers are required to purchase memory and storage in addition to the bare-bones unit. The device supports up to 32GB of DDR4 memory clocked at 2,133MHz, but the company doesn’t provide any information about the storage capacity of the M.2 SSD slot. That “2280” number refers to the dimensions of the M.2 SSD stick, as you just simply install any M.2 SSD into the slot. Another feature we’d like to point out is the use of USB 3.1 Gen2 tech. When the second generation of USB 3.0 hit the scene, the conglomerate that regulates the USB standard decided to mix things up and rename both generations. That said, the old USB 3.0 ports are now called USB 3.1 Gen1, which still speeds along at 5Gbps. The newer generation clocking speeds at 10Gbps is now called USB 3.1 Gen2. To visually distinguish the two generations, USB 3.1 Gen1 (formerly USB 3.0) continues with the blue theme. The USB 3.1 Gen2 tech apparently relies on red so that customers can quickly tell between the two connections. But that’s only when the ports rely on the larger Type-A rectangular size, and not the newer miniature Type-C port size. Remember, Type-A and Type-C have absolutely nothing to do with port speed, but with port size. The Type-A model relies on a single-sided “this side up” connector whereas Type-C boasts a dual-sided “any side up” reversible connector. On the processor font, Intel’s seventh-generation dual-core chip has a base clock speed of 2.40GHz, and no turbo. Other highlights include four threads, a cache of 3MB, and a maximum power draw of 15 watts. It’s an ideal chip for a miniature, mountable PC that doesn’t rely on internal fans to cool the innards. In this case, the heat is simply distributed by the unit’s vented exterior.

Microsoft flagged its new policy early last year, telling the users that Windows 10 will be the only supported Windows platform on Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) based CPUs. The policy effected bady to the business oriented users who had a good reason to run old Windows on new PCs. Microsoft eventually changed the policy so that people who are running Windows 7 or 8.x will still get security updates until those OSes reach end-of-life, but won't get other fixes. Zeffy, who on his GitHub page describes the policy as just Microsoft's way of telling everyone who'd rather keep using Windows 7 or 8.1 on their Intel Kaby Lake or AMD Ryzen systems and not be eligible for future updates other than security bug fixes. His solution targets the new CPU-detection bits that Windows has added to help Windows Update know when not to ship new code. His GitHub page explains it all in detail. Rate this story Rating: 1 ...

Using latest hardware and still sticking win8/7 mean that the individual is happy with the OS, does not want to get win10. They produce handmade, intentional problems so people will develop urges to upgrade to win 10 so Micro$oft can gather everything about you without your permission for upcoming worldwide events.

The announcement would be May 30th with availability June 26th opposed to a release in August. The X299 chipset will be compatible with Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X Intel Core X series processors. Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X, will include 12, 10, 8, 6 and 4 core products. That 12-core version is a new one and seems to be a bit of a panic reaction from Intel towards AMD who might be releasing 12 and 16 core parts.    Kaby Lake Broadwell-E Kaby Lake-X Skylake-X CPU cores 4 6, 8, 10 4 6, 8, 10, 12 Cache 8MB Up to 25MB 8MB 13.75MB PCIe support PCIe 3.0 (16 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (40/28 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (16 lanes) PCIe 3.0 (44/28 lanes) Integrated graphics Yes No No No TDP 95W 140W 112W 140W Socket LGA 1151 LGA 2011-v3 LGA 2066 LGA 2066 Chipset KBL PCH-H X99 KBL PCH-X KBL PCH-X Memory support Dual-channel DDR4 Quad-channel DDR4 Dual-channel DDR4 Quad-channel DDR4   The X299 will bring quad-channel DDR4 support to compatible 14nm processors and 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes with Skylake-X procs. Kaby Lake-X procs will support dual-channel DDR4 and 24 PCIe 3.0 Lanes. Before you ask, why release both Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X at the same time and what is the difference? Well, Skylake-X thus can offer 12, 10, 8 and 6 core processors, the other (Kaby lake-X) remains to be a quad-core part. Skylake-X are the extreme edition like the 6950X series currently on Skylake-X. These processors will get a 140 Watt TDP, the quad-core Kaby Lake-X is rumored to be a 112 Watt part. Since the processors once again will need a new socket, LGA 2066t hat means that once again you have to purchase a new motherboard. There is a rumor right now that Intel is tweaking the cache sizes to increase performance. The new platform thus also offers support for Intel Optane and quad channel DDR4-2667 MHz memory.  Thanks to SH SOTN for the news-submit Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ...

What I'm more interested in are the rumors about Coffee Lake 6 cores coming this summer already on the 370 platform. This CPU/Chipset series was originally planned for the Q4 Christmas 2017 season. Ryzen launched and it already got moved to August. Rumors of 12/16 core Ryzen parts appeared and all of the sudden Intel makes a move to Computex and invested reportedly spent over US$100 million to accelerate its pace of manufacturing. Yes panic reaction, these parts might have been designed ready, but where not ready for fabbing this soon already.

They really have to or they will not sell this new HEDT platform to anyone but their devoted fanbois. That said if the entry level 8 core product comes in around r7 1800x price they could be viable options. How I would price these. 7740k (KLX) 16 lanes 4.2-4.5 $280 7800k 6/12 28 lanes 3.8-4.0 $350 7850k 6/12 44 lanes 3.8-4.1 $415 7900k 8/16 44 lanes 3.7-3.9 $550 7950k 10/20 44 lanes 3.6-3.9 $800 7990k 12/24 44 lanes 3.5-3.9 $1200 This is not based on any facts just my fantasy. zer0_c0ol Ancient Guru Posts: 2877 Joined: 2007-04-12 #5423090 Posted on: 04/21/2017 03:29 PM Quote: Originally Posted by nevcairiel Panic reaction?

As long as AMD can match the features such as quad channel etc, Intel will have to keep responding. Great news for us consumers in the long run, but for right now anything you buy might be surpassed far quicker than normal.

This^^ Intel´s high end pricing structure was broken by Ryzen and the only way to change the situation is lower the prices of their cpus to reasonable terms. I wonder if Intel still remembers what reasonable prices look like... In my opinion Intel would be better cutting the prices of their current high end cpus than releasing newer ones but that´s me.

The PMS scheme has given 36.8% annualised returns in the past 5 years, beating the benchmark Nifty by 25 percentage points. However, experts feel small investors should stay away from portfolio management services (PMS). The large ticket size (the minimum investment is `25 lakh) is a deterrent. Further, most PMS schemes have only matched the performance of the best performing equity diversified funds. The PMS structure and investing philosophy may not suit the risk appetite of the average investor. "PMS is mainly for seasoned HNIs who understand direct equity well," says Tarun Birani, Founder & CEO, TBNG Capital Advisors. Small investors find SIP investments through mutual funds to be more rewarding. PMS managers themselves say that investors should not enter this space unless they are ready for the risks. Unlike mutual funds, PMS can levy higher charges, though competition keep the charges within a reasonable band. PMS charges can be a fixed fees or a profit-sharing arrangement based on fund performance. Porinju Veliyath's Equity Intelligence, for instance, charges a fixed anagement fee of 2% per year, and additional performance fees of 10% of the returns above 10% per annum. Experts say that since the PMS manager has his skin in the game in the profit-sharing model, it helps generate alpha. There is also an exit load if you withdraw early . According to portfolio managers, higher charges are incurred only if the portfolio is churned too often. "We typically hold stocks for 4-5 years and our churn rate is only 15%, compared to 100% for mutual funds," says Sonthalia. However, some experts say that PMS should not be compared with mutual funds at all, because the two are very different.

When the company announced its Snapdragon-for-Windows-10 plans in December 2016, the company said “The first devices running the full Windows 10 experience based on Snapdragon processors are expected to be commercially available in the second half of 2017.” But in last week's Q2 2017 earnings call, CEO Steve Mollenkopf said “Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into Mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year.” Also on the call Mollenkopf said, adding that “We remain on track for commercial shipments of our server processors by the end of the calendar year and we continue to receive good feedback from our customers.” Previously the company had said we could expect that kit by the latter half of 2017. Qualcomm announced its plans to build Windows-10-capable Snapdragons in December 2016. It's since worked with Microsoft to port Windows Server to ARM. Mollenkopf told financial analysts the company still feels “we have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the PC and the datacenter.” If the company can't start that disruption of the PC space by Christmas, that opportunity will shrink because PC sales are declining and ARM CPUs offer little obvious advantage for PC users. Microsoft and Qualcomm think they're on a winner because the planned CPUs and SOCs should be power-misers. But they'll also have to run either Universal Windows Apps, x86 emulation or API bridging to ensure users can run the apps they use on other Windows devices. If that's not done flawlessly, Qualcomm-powered PCs have a strong chance of becoming an historical footnote to rank with the unloved and unmourned Windows RT. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments MORE Qualcomm Arm Windows 10 More from The Register BlackBerry wins $814m Qualcomm patent-cap arbitration Besties still 4 Comments Apple goes global in Qualcomm license war: Patent spat hits China One-billion Yuan lawsuit in Middle Kingdom alleges further royalty wrongdoings 11 Comments Qualcomm takes $1bn BlackBerry bite like a champ, struts away Patent royalty check dings profits but nothing Snapdragon biz can't handle 3 Comments Ha ha, OK, fun's over.

Home News First Call of Duty: WWII screenshots emerge First Call of Duty: WWII screenshots emerge An update to Call of Duty: WWII's website has brought about its first screenshots ahead of the official reveal on April 26. By Adam Byrne on 21 April 2017 We're still a couple of days out from the official reveal of Call of Duty: WWII on April 26 but that hasn't stopped Internet sleuths from picking up on in-game screenshots recently posted as part of an update on the official website. Spotted by dedicated Call of Duty website, Charlie Intel, the low-resolution screenshots, seen below, relate to the perks received once you sign up to Call of Duty's official website and can be found on the log-in page. Relating to 'Exclusive rewards', 'Community', and getting the 'Latest Intel', the images detail the use of a Thompson submachine gun, as well as an up-close shot of a soldier, and a company overlooking a battle. It's also worth noting that in the third image, the soldier has a 1st Infantry Division patch on his shoulder; that division was nicknamed 'The Big Red One' – or 'The Fighting First' – and was at the forefront of the campaign in Call of Duty 2: Big Red One. Though most likely not a remake, perhaps Call of Duty: WWII is a retelling of that of that division's valour in World War II. It's not much but we're already looking forward to getting boots to the ground. Call of Duty: World War 2 to be released on November 3 Call of Duty: WWII will receive its official reveal on April 26 at 10:00am PDT (6:00pm GMT) and we're expecting a trailer spliced with some gritty gameplay. Typically, the latest Call of Duty titles are revealed in May but you won't hear us complaining that we get to see this earlier.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search The Best All-In-One Windows PCs: Seriously, They’re Actually Good Now By Michael Crider on April 23rd, 2017 All-in-one PCs are the domain of the novice, the hotel business nook, or the interior decorator who can’t stomach seeing a “real” PC in a pristine living room. With the exception of the iMac, they were seen as boring, underpowered boxes with laptop components stuffed behind a cheap screen. But that’s changing. It’s true that all-in-one machines are mostly cheap and simple, but the form factor has been undergoing a quiet revolution for the last couple of years. While Apple has been comfortable to trim dimensions and call it a day, manufacturers like Microsoft, Lenovo, HP, and others are filling the space with new and exciting designs. You should really check some of these models out before making your next desktop purchase. Microsoft Surface Studio The first desktop machine from Microsoft’s self-branded hardware initiative, the Surface Studio is surely the poster child for this new generation of all-in-one machines. Combining a 28-inch touch screen, a fold-down artist’s easel hinge, and the much-praised Surface Pen from the tablet line, the Studio makes a compelling argument for Windows as an artist’s platform. Prices start high and go higher, but with a GTX 965 graphics card and an optional 980 upgrade, the all-in-one can also double as a competent gaming machine (albeit a not-very-upgradeable one). The $3000 starting price (with a rather paltry 8GB of RAM, no less) and slightly older Intel processors are two bummers in an otherwise amazing hardware package. Ditto for the unique Surface Dial: this rotating wireless tool can be placed directly on the screen for digital manipulation, but it’s a separate $100 purchase and currently limited to only a few applications. Even so, for those who want the absolute cutting edge in desktop design, the Surface Studio might be worth its steep asking price. HP Envy The Envy series has long been HP’s showcase for its more bombastic designs, and the latest all-in-one machines to wear the badge are no exception. These desktops combine huge, small-bezel displays with a horizontal component body that integrates a quad-speaker Bang & Olufsen soundbar. At a glance, the design looks like a high-end home theater setup that’s been shrunk down to desktop size, and that’s basically what it is, with a mid-range Windows machine crammed into the package. The latest Envy designs are also surprisingly affordable, considering their displays. The base configuration for the massive 34-inch model starts at around $1800, though those who want more RAM, a bigger SSD+HDD combo, and a more capable graphics card can spend a bit more. The Envy design also comes in 24-inch and 27-inch versions, some of which offer touch screens, which isn’t an option on the largest version. Digital Storm Aura, CyberPower PC Arcus, and Origin Omni Even among these next-gen designs, gamers looking for truly high-end graphics can find their options a bit limited, thanks to the tight packages and non-upgradable components. Boutique PC makers are getting around that by cramming a full desktop into a 34-inch ultrawide monitor, in three separate products that seem to come from the same OEM supplier: the Digital Storm Aura, the CyberPower PC Arcus, and the Origin Omni. Slip off the back cover and you’ll be able to swap out every component, including a massive full-size PCIe desktop graphics card, RAM DIMM slots, SSD and HDD storage bays, and yes, even the desktop-class Intel processor and Mini-ITX motherboard. Other neat touches include an integrated liquid cooling system in some packages, an optional top-mounted webcam and microphone combo, and a full VESA mount adapter on the Aura (though you might not want to mount this 50-pound behemoth on a load-bearing wall). Configurations from the various suppliers can go well above the $4000 mark, but frugal customers can save a bit of money with the $1800 CyberPower PC model and invest in upgraded Mini-ITX compatible parts later. Lenovo IdeaCentre Y910 Lenovo’s take on the gamer-focused all-in-one takes a slightly different approach than the boutique models above. The motherboard in the IdeaCentre Y910 is custom, meaning that the processor can’t be swapped out, but the RAM, storage, and full-sized graphics card can. The speakers are larger and front-facing, putting a focus on audio—a nice bonus for anyone who isn’t already using a good pair of headphones. The screen is a more conventional 27 inches, which is less impressive but perhaps more practical for a wider array of games. The Lenovo design has an extra trick up its sleeve, too: it works as a standalone monitor for other systems. Plug in an HDMI cable to the input and you can play just about anything via the screen and speakers. Other little design cues include an integrated headset storage arm, a DVD drive, a height-adjustable stand, and side-mounted ports for easier access. There’s only one model available at a reasonable $2,300 price tag, which includes a 6th-gen i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a GTX 1080 graphics card. Dell XPS 27 Dell’s XPS brand is making headlines thanks to some fantastic work in the laptop division, but it’s no slouch in other form factors. The XPS 27 uses a 4K screen with an optional touch upgrade and fold-down hinge for more direct tablet-style interaction. The design isn’t as sleek as other all-in-ones, but Dell says that the bulky speakers have three times as much power and 50% more clarity than the ones on the iMac. The XPS 27 is priced to move at just $1500 for the lowest tier, including a 4K non-touch screen. Upgrading to a touchscreen will cost you $400, and another $100 on top of that grants access to an AMD R9 M470X graphics card. Even the cheaper tiers can be upgraded after purchase thanks to a pair of user-accessible 2.5-inch hard drive bays, one M. PCIe X4 SSD slot, and four RAM DIMM slots supporting a maximum of 64GB. Lenovo Yoga Home 900 This all-in-one desktop is basically a gigantic Windows-powered tablet. Unlike the other touch-enabled machines in this list, the Yoga Home 900 can fold completely flat, its 27-inch screen and integrated battery inviting multiplayer games and shareable video. Though its older processor and relatively low-res 1080p screen aren’t necessarily built for gaming, a GeForce 940A graphics chip has more power than its pedestrian looks might suggest. The Yoga Home 900 includes a mouse and keyboard for full desktop-style operation, but extended use might benefit from a monitor riser, since the kickstand design keeps the screen quite low on a desk (which is not great for ergonomics). Its large size and weight and a limited three-hour battery life make it less suitable than a standard tablet for road use. Even so, with street prices dipping down towards the $1000 mark and an included suite of kid-friendly games and apps, it’s worth considering for anyone who wants a shared family computer. Acer Aspire C22 and C24 There’s not much to these minimalist Acer designs—they’re low-power all-in-ones, based on an Intel Celeron processor in the 22-inch model and a slightly speedier Core i3 in the 24-inch model. But they have two things going for them: one, they’re absolutely gorgeous, combining ultra-thin 1080p displays with silver or gold-colored accents. And two, they’re cheap, starting at just $450 for the smaller model. Even the larger version with a respectable 8GB RAM and terabyte hard drive upgrade is just $700 (and cheaper from some retailers), not much more than an equivalent desktop and monitor combo. HP Sprout Pro G2 Like the Surface Studio, HP’s Sprout Pro G2 wants users to get up close and personal with digital content. But instead of refining the all-in-one monitor design, HP has augmented it with a wild top-down projector that creates a virtual second screen where the keyboard lives on most desks. Combined with a multi-touch capacitive mat and an included digital pen, the Sprout Pro allows for a surprising amount of digital manipulation without any kind of external hardware. There’s another aspect to that unique projector mechanism: 3D scanning. Place any object on the touch mat area and the computer can make a full three dimensional model of it, which can then be imported into HP’s various tools for further projects. It’s a dream come true for 3D printing enthusiasts, but probably a bit of a gimmick for everyone else. Other downers include a relatively small 23-inch main display, and the fact that it’s still not ready for retail sales just yet, though the original model is now heavily discounted.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Third-party patch removes Windows Update restrictions for PCs with new chips, old OS 04/19/2017 at 1:57 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Last month Microsoft blocked Windows Update from working on computers with Intel Skylake or AMD Bristol Ridge or newer chips if those computers are also running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. In other words, if you have a new CPU, Microsoft wants you to run its newest operating system, Windows 10. And the company is willing to cut off support for older operating systems to get you to update. But GitHub user Zeffy is having none of that. He’s released a patch that lets you get security updates and other software updates through Windows Update even if you have a new CPU and an old OS. Zeffy It’s not like Microsoft didn’t warn us this was coming: as Bleeping Computer notes, Microsoft has been saying since early 2016 that it would only support Windows 10 on computers with the most recent Intel or AMD chips. But some folks probably didn’t see (or pay attention) to those messages, and some folks may have given Windows 10 a try and decided they preferred an older version of Windows. Zeffy’s script patches Windows DLL files to skip the CPU version check, allowing users to download updates that are intended for systems with different chips. Since the patch script is open source, anyone can inspect it before giving it a try. It’s worth noting that it’s possible that Microsoft could find a way to block the current script, but I suspect if that happens it would just be the next step in an arms race where hackers would try to figure out how to bypass Microsoft’s restriction and Microsoft tries to figure out how to stop them from doing so. A bigger issue is that there may come a time when a Windows update that’s not intended to run on Kaby Lake, Bristol Ridge, or Ryzen chips has some sort of compatibility issue that stops a computer from working properly when a user decided to try to install that update anyway.

(AFP PHOTO / KIMIHIRO HOSHINO) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Intel Corp. Medical diagnostics AI artificial intelligence Related Stories Sisters win video contest on how Israel inspires Ministers okay broadcaster delay to make last-minute changes to law Scientists leave labs, take to streets to defend research Archaeologists to probe ancient pyramid in Judean Hills In a push to save the lives of millions of women in third–world countries, technology giant Intel Corp. is calling on startups to come up with an algorithm that will detect and diagnose cervical cancer from smartphone images. The company has announced the Intel & MobileODT Cervical Cancer Screening contest, with applications accepted from startups by June 14. Intel and MobileODT are appealing to startups to come up with the algorithm that will help diagnose the cervical cancer by analyzing smartphone images. MobileODT, formerly called MobileOCT, is an Israeli startup that uses optical technology to transform a smartphone into a mobile, easy-to-use tool to help detect cancer by taking pictures for diagnostic and other analytical purposes. It has also developed apps to operate the devices and connect with software on the cloud to provide immediate and remote consultations for patients in areas of the world that lack immediate access to specialists. A correct diagnosis helps avoid the use of ineffective therapies and allows healthcare providers to refer patients for more advanced treatments, the companies said in a joint statement. Intel is offering $100,000 worth of prizes to the top three competition winners, of which $50,000 will go to the best solution. In addition, Intel will give a prize of $20,000 to the contender who makes the best use of the tools Intel makes available for the competition. All contest participants will be allowed access to Intel’s Deep Learning SDK, a free software product that allows big data experts to train neural networks — artificial networks that emulate the learning method of a human neural network and serve as a tool for machine learning. The product was developed by Intel Israel’s big data analytics unit. “We want to challenge developers, data scientists and students to develop artificial intelligence algorithms that would help solve tough real life problems in a range of fields, including medicine and healthcare,” said Doug Fisher, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s Software and Services Group. “These developments will help in taking real time decisions regarding therapy and provide first line response to women around the world who need early diagnosis of cervical cancer.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Intel Corp.,  Medical diagnostics,  AI artificial intelligence,  MobileODT More in Israel Inside 6 Israelis, including 2 soldiers, charged with attacking Arabs Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Intel holds competition to help spot cervical cancer By Shoshanna Solomon   Israeli startup says if the shoe fits, consumers will buy more By Shoshanna Solomon   No entry to viruses, thanks to Israeli-US team’s wastewater filter By Shoshanna Solomon   Facebook wants to read your mind By Glenn Chapman   MeMed gets $9.2 million contract from US DoD arm By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs April 22, 2017, 1:20 am Creativity In Action: How A Fortune-500 Company Improved The Quality Of Its Manufactured Products In A Creativity & Innovation Meeting Occasionally, a problem at work is so big and important, that it warrants a problem-solving Creativity &......

Intel will reportedly announce its next-gen CPUs and new X299 chipset during their conference at Computex 2017 in Taipei.     The latest news is coming from Bench.life, which is reporting that Intel's Senior VP Navin Shenoy will make the announcement during his keynote speech on May 30, while general availability of the new CPUs will start on June 26. Now, what new CPUs can we expect from Intel, especially now since AMD kicked them pretty hard in the pants with their new Ryzen CPUs.   Intel is reportedly preparing new 4, 6, 8, 10, and even new 12-core CPUs - so expect Hyper-Threading on most of them, making them 4C/8T, 6C/12T, 8C/16T, 10C/20T, and a monstrous 12C/24T. We should expect Basin Falls X-Series to include new Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors. Kaby Lake-X will be the family of quad-core processors, while Skylake-X will handle the higher-end SKUs.

Wants to Make Recycled iPhones Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Facing a Resurgent Samsung (SSNLF) View All Posts Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has slowed down the pace of its CPU releases over the past several years, and now that strategy appears to be paying off. For rival Advanced Micros Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) … AMD took advantage of the situation to make a big push with its new Ryzen processors, and Intel is now feeling the heat. Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr A report says the company has been forced to accelerate release of its new Basin Falls series CPUs by two months, with Coffee Lake chips being moved up even more. To achieve the rush move, INTC is reportedly spending big bucks to increase its manufacturing capacity. INTC Stock’s Slowing PC Processor Innovation With the global computer market declining for the fifth straight year, it’s not surprising that Intel took its foot off the gas in terms of new CPU development. Last year, the company ditched its “tick-tock” development model for one that stretched CPUs into three phases of development. Even earlier, it had begun to get complacent with releases. A prime example was the Broadwell CPUs. Scheduled for 2013, Intel didn’t get around to releasing them until September 2014 and even then, the line-up was staggered with nine months between the first mobile chips and availability of desktop CPUs. INTC was originally scheduled to release Cannon Lake, a new 10nm chip this year. But then it added Coffee Lake, based on the same 14nm process as three previous generations of chips. Coffee Lake will be the primary CPU aimed at mainstream PCs, and its release was pushed to 2018. Cannon Lake is still on track for 2017, but for low-power devices like ultrabooks. AMD Moves to Disrupt With Ryzen PC manufacturers don’t like being at the whims of Intel’s schedule. New models are sometimes delayed for months, waiting for new INTC chips. Consumers may be reluctant to buy a new PC that has a year-old CPU in it. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iMac hasn’t been updated since 2015 and the blame is often placed with Intel for delayed CPU releases. Intel’s rival in the computer CPU business has not been sitting still. AMD is taking full advantage of INTCs strategy. It has released new Ryzen CPUs that are based on all-new Zen architecture, with improvements that go far beyond the modest gains Intel’s bumps have been providing. AMD Ryzen CPUs also emphasize multicore support, making them ideal for advanced uses like VR and 4K gaming. AMD has been trampled by Intel in the past, to the point where nearly 90% of PCs sold have “Intel Inside” stickers. But the new AMD Ryzen CPUs — which have been well received — could change that.

Before the end of 2016, it was reported that the software giant successfully converted its current OS to run on a Snapdragon 820-based mobile device. After that, Microsoft announced that it will start working on porting the said operating system to the Snapdragon 835. Qualcomm seems to confirm that the upcoming ARM-based Windows 10 device will be coming just before the end of 2017. According to IDG Enterprise’s CIO, Microsoft and Qualcomm are collaborating on a design of a cellular PC that runs on an ARM chip instead of an Intel or AMD processor. Unfortunately, details of the device are still a bit murky. However, it is said that the device in question will have direct cellular connectivity. Also, 5th generation Bluetooth wireless technology will be a main feature of the device. Further, it seems that the build of the device will be a 2-in-1 form factor enabling it to function as a tablet or a laptop. With this news, many are now beginning to think that this is the new Surface Pro 5. Especially now that it is rumored that the Surface Book will eventually assume a clamshell design instead of the 2-in-1 form factor. Windows 10 UI (via microsoft.com) Unfortunately, Microsoft decline to comment on the report. However, as Qualcomm puts it, the said ARM-powered Windows 10 device will be available on the fourth quarter of 2017. At the moment, Microsoft is still perfecting the conversion of the Windows 10 operating system to ARM instruction set. It has been showcased late last year that the idea works in general. However, at the time of introduction, Microsoft is still sorting out major bugs in the system. It would seem that Microsoft is diversifying its portfolio starting with the ARM SoC. As more ARM-based products are being released year after year, it is only logical that Microsoft aims for the platform as well. This now leaves the question of Apple following suit with Microsoft. Unfortunately, the Cupertino company already clarified that it does not have any intentions of releasing a fully ARM-powered MacBook or MacBook Pro anytime soon.

Bajenting STOPPED BEFORE ‘RESCUE ATTEMPT’. A police team escorts Renierlo Dongon (center), a suspected bomb maker who got caught Sunday in a checkpoint in Clarin, Bohol. SUNSTAR FOTO / ALAN TANGCAWAN The local police in Clarin, Bohol took custody of a police official from the crime laboratory in Region 11 in Davao City and a suspected bomb maker after allegedly finding them on board a black Nissan Navarra pick-up while the second encounter between government troops and suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) ensued Saturday night. An intelligence source, who asked not to be named, said the official was with a driver whom he described as a Tausug. “They were driving fast, that’s why they were flagged down in a military roadblock near a resort in Barangay Bacani. Intel personnel saw her throw a cellphone on the ground,” he said. The cellphone was traced and the intelligence officer learned that the woman and her driver were allegedly contacting the remaining members of the Abu Sayyaf. “They were allegedly trying to rescue a 17-year-old alias Asis, who was royalty in Basilan,” another source said. Local police have not yet confirmed the information, but said that the police official and the bomb expert were in their office for tactical interrogation past 11 p.m. Saturday. The driver, according to an intelligence police who asked not to be named, is a bomb expert identified as Renierlo “Kudri” Dongon, brother-in-law of former Abu Sayyaf leader Abu Solaiman, alias Abdurajik Janjalani, and his brother Khadafi Janjalani. The two were brought to the Bohol Provincial Police Station (BPPO) at 5 p.m. with a convoy full of Special Weapons and Tactics (Swat) men. At 7 p.m., Chief Insp. Gaylord Tamayo, officer-in-charge of the Inabanga police conducted the search inside the vehicle. Police discovered flippers and snorkeling gear, a police-issued firearm, sets of clothes, first aid kits and food inside. “It’s up to the investigators now to determine the case to be filed against these persons,” Tamayo said. The confiscated items were believed to be supplies to help the remaining suspected Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) members in fleeing Bohol. The police official is under the custody of the local police while the bomb expert was already arrested by the virtue of a warrant of arrest for double murder and double murder with attempted murder. It was issued by Judge Vincent Rosales in Branch 23 of the Regional Trial Court in Cagayan De Oro. This was related to the bombing incident in Maxandrea Hotel in Cagayan de Oro last Oct. 11, 2012 in which he allegedly took part as one of the three bombers. The incident, which killed two persons and hurt two cops, was intended to bomb the vehicle of GMA network parked outside the hotel allegedly because of a TV coverage that aired what they claimed to be material offensive to their doctrine, a police report said. Dongon also revealed that his sister Saynab was the wife of Khadafi Janjalani, an ASG leader, who remarried after the death of Janjalani “Maroan” Ebrahim, a Malaysian national and an active member of the Al-Qaeda operating in the provinces of Cotabato and Lanao.

Eben Upton talks chips, children and the future of tech Monday 24 April 2017  | Comment Now Where do you go when you're already at the top? Raspberry Pi creator Eben Upton reveals all Walking into the Raspberry Pi Foundation's office, you wouldn't think it housed one of the most influential tech companies of the last decade. Situated on one floor of a small Cambridge building – which resembles a 1970s university library rather than a technological hub – flanked by impressive, modern buildings owned by Microsoft, Deloitte and KPMG, Raspberry Pi's quietly carries on changing the face of computing. Having started from humble origins, the company behind the £30 microcomputer has gone from strength to strength. It recently celebrated three milestones almost simultaneously: hitting its 5th birthday, its eighth product launch and the sale of its 12 millionth unit. One of the driving forces behind Raspberry Pi Foundation's success is Eben Upton, the founder and mastermind behind the Raspberry Pi. With stints at Broadcom, Intel and IBM - not to mention a three-year tenure as Cambridge University's director of studies for computer science - Upton has an impressive technical pedigree behind him. That knowledge quickly becomes evident upon talking to him and it's immediately clear that the Raspberry Pi is the definition of a passion project for Upton. His eyes light up when speaking about the engineering problems and you can feel his boundless enthusiasm for all things technical ooze out of every pore. Habitually dressed in jeans and rolled-up shirtsleeves, Upton's demeanour is a cross between a well-liked sixth form teacher and a starry-eyed Silicon valley programmer. I get the impression that this isn't a carefully-crafted look of artificial nonchalance commonly worn by tech CEOs, but a genuine result of Upton getting his hands dirty with the day-to-day grunt work of engineering alongside the rest of his staff. He dismissed the idea of working on shiny new technologies like AI, saying (with obvious relish) "the stuff we're good at tends to be grungy, low-level systems programming". It's this passion that's driven the Raspberry Pi Foundation since the beginning. Founded as a way to get more kids into computing at an earlier age, the Foundation has always been motivated by its values rather than its bottom line. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Raspberry Pi Zero – a fully functional computer priced at a mind-boggling $5. Roughly the size of a packet of chewing gum, the Zero is Upton's favourite product – a fact given away by the beaming grin that breaks out across his face when I first bring it up in conversation. "I made a million computers," Upton points out, "and I turned over five million dollars." For any other tech company, selling a product that cheaply would be lunacy. For Upton, though, the very concept of how howlingly insane a business move it was is part of the reason why he's so fond of the Zero. "I love that we were able to do it," he says; "I love that it worked." In many ways, the Raspberry Pi Zero is emblematic of the company as a whole. The first Pi models were a runaway hit but, rather than resting on their laurels, Upton and his team went and built the world's smallest commercial PC purely for fun. "It was just wonderful to be able to take a business that was going well and still be aggressive enough to say 'what happens if we just tear it up and do something else?'" With all this hardware innovation going on, it's easy to forget that devices like the Zero are effectively a side project for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. "You've got to remember that actually, in the end, we're a charity," Upton says. The foundation was set up with the aim of getting kids into computing, but its efforts don't stop at making cheaply available hardware for them to practise on. Outside of the hardware business, the Foundation puts most of its focus on grassroots education projects like Code Club. Following its acquisition in 2015, Raspberry Pi owns and operates Code Club as a subsidiary, setting up volunteer-staffed after-school clubs to teach kids about programming, computing and other digital skills. "Code Club is amazing. What never fails to astound me is the number of kids – there's over 5,000 Code Clubs, we've reached about 75,000 kids." Video of What Does a Code Club look like? "We've got to the point where more than half of the schools [in our age bracket] Code Clubs," Upton says. "It changes what the question is. The question isn't 'what's a Code Club?', the question for a parent is 'why doesn't my school have a Code Club? Because my friend's child's school has a Code Club?'" Not only has Code Club proved to be a huge success over here, it's also expanded internationally. There are hundreds of franchised Code Clubs in countries including Australia, South Korea and Brazil, all of which are working within their communities to get kids working with computers at an earlier age. Upton's goal with Code Club, he says, is "finishing off the UK". While he acknowledged the changing nature of tech means the job's never “done”, his aim is to reach the point where there's a Code Club in every school. This, along with the Foundation's other efforts, like its Picademy teacher training programme, is geared towards combatting the tech industry's burgeoning skills shortage. In particular, Upton is aiming to bring more girls into the tech workforce, which continues to struggle with a serious gender imbalance. "It's the single thing you can change," he says. "Participation rates among women are so low that if you got them up to the same level as they are already among men, then you'd effectively be doubling your workforce. If there's one bit of low-hanging fruit, that's the one." He's aiming to fix this problem through getting girls invested at an earlier age. It appears to be going well; roughly 40% of Code Club attendees are girls, a proportion that far outstrips most tech firms. "The reason it's nice that we're doing this intervention around Code Club at nine to 11 is that is a window where if you can get a girl to the end [of it] and she's still excited about [tech], there's every chance that she'll continue to be excited about it all the way through her career." The progress of the five-year-old foundation is impressive but, for Upton, the important thing is that it's built to last. The way the Foundation is governed has recently been revamped in order to make it self-sustaining. Under the new organisation, the foundation maintains a broad pool of expert members, who are elected by their fellow members to join the board of trustees. The first trustee to be elected under this new system is Dr. Tilly Blyth, head of collections and principal curator at the Science Museum in London. "That gives us some confidence that we're in this for the long run," he says. "We're trying to build an organisation that's going to outlive me; if this organisation dies before I do, I will be very unhappy. You don't want to be predeceased by your children and you don't want to be predeceased by your charitable foundations." So is all this effort paying off? Well, early signs would suggest that it is. The dip in university admissions for computing courses – the problem the foundation was originally created to solve – has reversed. In fact, since its creation in 2012, applications to Cambridge's computer science course have doubled. Upton's witnessed the impact of his efforts first-hand. "When I used to interview people, it used to take me an afternoon to interview my people for my college. I bumped into my successor in a bar after interviews last year, and it was the end of the week, and he was leaning on the bar; he'd had 42 applicants, I used to have six. He was leaning on the bar with a pint of beer, completely ashen-faced," he laughs, "so I've ruined his life!"   Eben Upton exudes passion. From corporate governance to product design to outreach initiatives, it's clear there isn't a single element of the Raspberry Pi Foundation's work which doesn't utterly captivate him. The company he created is thriving and he appears to be accomplishing that most elusive of Silicon Valley goals: making the world a better place. So what's next for the baker of the Raspberry Pi? Founding another startup? Political ambitions, perhaps? According to Upton, working at Raspberry Pi is just too much fun to pass up. "What's not to like: surround yourself with a staff of easy-going geniuses and build great toys all day long! So I'm still here, and while it's still fun, I'll be here."

Photograph: Boston Globe via Getty Images Guardian sustainable business Fourth industrial revolution Co-working spaces are the future of work but that could be a good thing They can be noisy but co-working spaces also offer an environment where professionals can wait out the volatility of the job market Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Tim Dunlop Sunday 23 April 2017 20.24 EDT Last modified on Sunday 23 April 2017 20.25 EDT The growing phenomenon of co-working spaces – places where individuals can rent a desk of their own while sharing a range of other facilities with their co-tenants – is as indicative of the changing nature of work as almost any metric you care to name. Although many see the casualisation of the workforce that this growth represents as an inherently bad thing – rightly focusing on the way in which technology is tending to convert full-time work into part-time “gigs” – there may well be a big upside. Co-working is a model that gives workers themselves, the digital nomads of gig economy, more control over their working lives. How big is the sector? Small Business Labs, an organisation that monitors it around the world, suggests that the number of people renting such spaces will grow globally from just under 1m in 2016 to nearly 4m in 2020. According to research by user experience researchers Melissa Gregg and Thomas Lodato, co-working can be a positive choice for many freelancers . They argue that, in part, such workers are seeking “relief from the emotional demands of the corporate office”. Seventeen jobs, five careers: learning in the age of automation Read more Co-working spaces, they write, “expanded significantly in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008/9”, adding this “style of work emerged in response to the slow plod of austerity, hollowed-out corporations, underemployment and career insecurity”. They argue that “co-working spaces met a growing demand for care and fulfilment as much as employment”. So is co-working a good thing in itself or simply a rational response to negative changes in traditional workplaces? Gregg, who is principal engineer in the Business Client Research and Strategy Client Computing Group at Intel Corporation, says with all the variations of experience there is no simple answer to that. Still, she says, “I regard co-working as the most optimistic example we have of conducting enterprise on our own terms. I like that it is often an experience of work that is determined by workers themselves.” Isolation is one of the key problems that arises for freelancers and providing this sort of human contact – a community of fellow nomads – has become the secret sauce of the co-working industry, a large part of what makes it attractive. Karen Corr, founder of the Make A Change organisation, says it would never have got off the ground without the existence of the Synergize Hub in Bendigo but that it was ultimately the community experience that kept her there, even as her organisation grew. Travel blogger Monika Pietrowski writes that after “a solid stint in the corporate world, I gave up the security, the scrutiny and the stress for a nomadic lifestyle”. She says that co-working communities have been central to this change and, although it can be hit or miss, the “biggest advantage for me is the people interaction and social setting”. Lipstick on the robot: why is everyone suddenly happy about tech unemployment? | Tim Dunlop Read more Gregg and Lodato write: “Co-working spaces provide an environment in which professionals can anticipate, withstand and perhaps even wait out the volatility of the competitive job market that surrounds them.” So do they expect the labour market to return to a more traditional form, with less of the sort “gig” work that suits co-working? “Not exactly,” Gregg says. “I think there is a pervasive sense of caution right now that co-working is a speculative economy in a classic sense – it is dependent on real estate and property value.” Indeed co-working spaces have become an attractive choice for landlords, real estate agents and other firms looking to fill floorspace as more traditional tenants, such as retailers, close down. US figures indicate co-working may account for as much as 2% of the office market by 2020. But for those who can “wait out” the job market changes, Gregg thinks they will have developed something “of long term, resilient value” with the co-working space as the centre of a useful network that would not otherwise have been available. In fact, the researchers believe co-working could be a glimpse into a more positive future. They write, “A more just future of work may have less to do with labour hours, the creation of welfare programs or the opening of resources and more to do with hospitality: with whom, through what means, and in which environments we associate and affiliate with fellow workers.” As attractive as this idea is, it could only work if it was underpinned with more formal means of security, something like a universal basic income. If co-working is to be anything more than a temporary response to precarity, don’t we need adequate state welfare measures in place? “Absolutely we do,” Gregg says. “But the state manifests differently in context and it is hard to imagine how this works in Trump’s America, for instance. “Still, I like to think of co-working in terms of what philosopher Peter Sloterdijk calls ‘co-immunity’ – creating shared bubbles of protection that allow people the space to conduct the practices that help them realise their potential.” Nonetheless, she notes, “I don’t pretend that co-working is suitable for all kinds of workers.” Some freelancers point out that the spaces can be noisy and hard to work in. Anis Qizilbash, who runs a sales training business, did several six-month stints but isn’t keen to continue. “I felt uncomfortable and it was hard to concentrate. Often there would be music playing and, being an introvert, I hated the open-plan workspace.” There is not escaping the fact that the nature of work is changing, however, so it’s worth embracing the positive aspects of that change. What constitutes a job is no longer neatly bound by notions of a career, the nine-to-five, of 40-hour weeks and four-weeks’ holiday leave, and nor should it be. Flexibility that empowers workers – as opposed to the sort of “flexibility” imposed from above by employers – should be welcomed and co-working spaces may enable that sort of change. It could be the testing ground for an entirely reimagined notion of employment. “Co-working,” Gregg says, may well be “the millennial’s MBA”.

Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) 22 April, 2017 04:25 - - - - print email Comments A Microsoft document detailing the minimum hardware specs for Microsoft Windows 10 Cloud-powered laptops seems to be the best evidence yet that Microsoft plans to launch a Chromebook competitor on May 2. Windows Central obtained a “recommended minimum spec” document, presumably handed out to Microsoft’s partners. The document outlines what Microsoft hopes to achieve with what the document calls an “Edu Cloud device” (and industry watchers have dubbed "Cloudbooks"): all-day battery life, a quick boot and resume cycle, and at least a quad-core Intel Celeron processor powering it all. It’s also titled “Windows 10 Cloud Performance Targets,” confirming the name of the new OS. A Microsoft representative declined to comment. Microsoft’s invitation to an education-focused launch event in New York on May 2 hinted strongly that a Chromebook competitor was in the cards. Though Windows PCs dominate the workplace, Google’s Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks have quickly insinuated themselves into American classrooms. Google and its partners have pitched Chromebooks as affordable, simple to use and manage, and rugged enough to survive student use. Windows 10 Cloud appears to be Microsoft's attempt to go back to school. The impact on you: One key advantage of a Chromebook, from Google’s perspective, is that it contributes to a virtuous cycle: Kids use the popular Android tablets and phones at home, then access something similar in the classroom. To help break that chain, Microsoft needs to get kids used to Windows. While this may have little impact on you personally, you might say that this is a fight for the hearts and minds of your children. What Cloudbooks will contain Windows 10 Cloud reportedly will restrict apps to the Windows Store, forbidding the use of non-Store apps like Google Chrome. Microsoft’s document also notes that its performance benchmarks assume the use of Intune device management policies specifically designed for the classroom. The spec document plainly states that Microsoft considers Chromebooks its chief competition. In a comparison of “performance benchmarks,” Microsoft’s target is 10-plus hours of “all day” battery life, with cold-boot times of 20 seconds and resume times of under 2 seconds. The document does not list suggested pricing. Likewise, Microsoft lays out what hardware the new devices should include: a quad-core chip, like a Celeron, or higher; 4GB of RAM, and at least 32GB of eMMC or SSD storage. Interestingly, pen and touchscreen capabilities are listed as “optional,” which would discard one of the chief advantages that a typical Windows PC has over a Chromebook. Who will make these devices remains a mystery at the moment. PC companies like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo have all already built Chromebooks, meaning they’ll have to choose between platforms, or support both. It’s telling, though, that Microsoft itself admits at least internally that it Windows 10 Cloud-based laptops won’t quite measure up to the competition. In its comparison of the two platforms, the document notes that Chromebooks are faster to cold-boot to a login screen (20 seconds to 15 seconds) as well as from the sign-in screen to the desktop (15 seconds versus 10 seconds). We’ll have to see how Microsoft spins this: Selling something that's almost-as-good as the competition doesn’t sound like much of a pitch.

Without Steve Jobs at the helm, it was lost and tried entering every product category you can think of. Most of them failed commercially, though some have a legacy worth remembering. Apple Newton Long before the iPhone, Apple made the Newton - a Personal Digital Assistant or PDA. These days you may hear digital assistant and think Siri, but PDAs were like smartphones, except without the phone part. In fact, the term PDA was coined by Apple CEO John Sculley. The Newton was advanced for its day (it was released in 1993), but its high price prevented mass adoption. Still, its advanced features were not easy to come by in those days. Larry Tesler, former Lisa team member, set out to find a fast but low-power processor for Apples PDA but there were no suitable existing options. Eventually, he turned to Acorn RISC Machines (a fabless chip designer) and their partner VLSI (a chip maker). Apple Newton (photo: Blake Patterson)  Note the ARM 610 chip (photo: Binarysequence) Never heard of Acorn? It designed the processor for the successful BBC Micro. But youve probably know it under the name ARM. Yes, the ARM that created the foundation of practically all mobile CPUs today. Apple, Acorn and VLSI designed a new ARM core - ARMv6 - to power the Newton. Various ARMv6-derived processors would go on to power early smartphones, including several Androids and the Palm Pixi. Things moved on to ARMv7 and now ARMv8 (the 64-bit chips), but theres little competition. Intel bailed out of mobile chipsets while MIPS never had much of a foothold in the Android era. And modern ARM cores are not the only legacy of the Apple Newton. Two devs that worked on it would later found Pixo, the company behind the OS for the early iPods (all non-iOS iPods ran Pixo OS). Apple Pippin In the mid-90s Apple started licensing its brand to other makers who made digital cameras, CD players and even a game console. That console was the Apple Pippin and was manufactured by Bandai (you may know them from Power Ranger toys). In fact, the Pippin was more than a console - it was based on the Macintosh platform and ran a modified Mac OS. But Apple forbade Bandai from calling it a computer to prevent confusion (Apple also did zero marketing for the product). The Pippin was a multimedia center - it played games, yes, and it could also play music and video and even browse the web. However, with a $600 launch price it proved expensive, making it a commercial failure. Still, you can see the similarities with Microsofts Xbox - it was meant to be the brain of a home entertainment setup and it ran a version of the companys flagship OS. However, by all accounts the Pippin was not a very impressive game console. One game stood out to us, though, a sci-fi first person shooter called Super Marathon made by a small game developer known as Bungie. Yes, that Bungie, which 3 years later would go on to make Halo, another sci-fi shooter. Halo broke all sorts of sales records and in the two months after its release, a Halo disc was sold alongside half of Xbox consoles. Many bought Microsofts console specifically for the game - just think what might have been if Bungies Pippin game sold so well. Apple eWorld In 1988 Apple and Quantum Computer Services launched AppleLink Personal Edition for the Apple II and the Macintosh. Later (in 1994) the two companies would partner again to create eWorld. Presented as a city with various buildings, eWorld offered e-mail (at the post office, of course), BBS (at the community center) and so on. Welcome to eWorld  installation diskettes Quantums co-founder and CEO Steve Case spend three months in California trying to convince Apple to let his company run the new service. Apple would get a 10% royalty of the $8.95 monthly subscription and $7.95 hourly charge (between 6am-6pm, outside that period it was $4.95 an hour). Perhaps youve never heard of Quantum, but thats only because in 1991 it rebranded to America Online or AOL. Sure, today AOL is mostly an empty husk, but in its heyday it was the dominant Internet provider in the US. Seriously, at the time 50% of CDs made in the whole world were AOL CDs. Plus, Apples later efforts to build an online community were no more successful than eWorld - you could argue that iTunes Ping was actually worse (it sure didnt last any longer).

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > Network Storage > Asustor AS3102T NAS Review Network StorageReviews Asustor AS3102T NAS Review James Seaton April 21, 2017April 21, 20170294 Today we are reviewing a feature rich NAS from Asustor. The AS3102T is a home user oriented model and features a HDMI output, making it a compelling option (or is it?) for a home theater system and networked home. The Asustor AS3102T is a 2-bay NAS designed to be a central device in a interconnected multi-device digital home. Even now NAS devices tend to be relegated to the domain of businesses and power users, but the need for interconnected storage is becoming well and truly mainstream. With the ever increasing power and numbers of mobile and networked devices, consumption and volume of digital media and the need for data portability and security, a NAS is becoming a very smart addition to a digital household. External storage has always been a hot seller with its plug and play ease of use, but a basic HDD doesn’t cover the bases of many home users anymore and so a NAS device like the Asustor AS3102T is a cost effective and powerful solution for the heart of a home media network, be it 4K media playback, media sharing, surveillance, backing up or cloud storage. The AS3102T uses Intel’s Celeron N3050 processor which features AES-NI hardware encryption. This is a key feature, allowing high speeds transfers of encrypted-files, Many older NAS lack the support for this level of encryption. The other major feature is the included HDMI 1.4b port. Digital media is everywhere so to have capable 4K (30fps) streaming capability is a big plus.   Specifications As we see below, the key feature at the heart of the AS3102T is the 6w Braswell N3050 CPU. This brings the aforementioned AES-NI encryption capability as well as hardware support for HEVC (but not 10 bit) We have 2Gb of DDR3L memory, a Gigabit Ethernet port,  a single HDMI 1.4b port and three USB 3.0 ports. A Closer Look The box is quite compact and easy to carry. Many of the key features are shown here and on the back including some smartphone setup instructions. The NAS and its accessories come securely packed inside foam shells so unless the courier is using it as a football, its hard to see how it could be damaged.     The accessories include a top quality Delta Electronics adapter, so there is definitely no corner cutting there. The unit is capable of providing up to 60w which is a lot more than this NAS and drives will use. Delta make some of the best power supplies on the market. We’ve also got  screws for attaching the hard drives, a Cat 5e Ethernet cable, software disc and installation guide. While using the provided disc is certainly an option, we’d always advise visiting the manufacturer website to obtain the latest software.     The front of the NAS is finished in a sort of diamond shaped covering which adds a little bit of style to what is typically a simple black box. There are a set of activity LEDs, a USB 3.0 port, but strangely, no power button, which is on the back of the unit. The rear contains the power button, a recessed reset button, the LAN port, two USB 3,0 ports, the HDMI 1.4b port and the DC input.     Opening up the unit is a matter of removing two screws and then sliding the two halves of the outer shell. Below the HDD cage we can see the motherboard, with the N3050 CPU beneath a rather large heatsink which keeps it perfectly cool given the low TDP of just 6w. The memory is soldered to the PCB and cannot be expanded. The motherboard has a single PCIe slot which holds the SATA expansion card. On the left is the main cooling fan which during operation, makes basically no noise, but it does get audible when selecting higher fan speed via the ADM interface.     System setup & Installation Installation is a simple process. You can follow the instructions and use the software provided on the CD, otherwise you can download the required software from the Asustor website, as we chose to do. The first step is to install the Asustor Control Center software. This app starts off by finding the NAS on your network. Then, select the initialize button, this will take you to a web based installation procedure to follow with easy steps.  Click next and wait while the ADM software is installed on the NAS. You can also map the drive from here, so it will show up as a storage device on your PC.   The NAS will ship with a version of the Asustor Data Master software (ADM) but we’d advise visiting the website and downloading the latest version. In this case, the latest version is 2.7.1. Next up is to select your RAID level (JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks), RAID 0 or or RAID 1) since this is only a 2 bay NAS, the higher RAID levels are of course blanked out.   That’s it! There’s an optional registration option to arrange an Asustor ID, which is used with the array of applications and services that can be used by the ADM software. ADM overview After the installation is finished, it’s time to visit the Asustor Data Master operating system. You’ll see a welcome message and be offered a tour of the web interface. If you are not familiar with the ADM software, this is recommended. The ADM can be accessed via a web browser or the HDMI port, as long as the NAS has a mouse connected or an app such as AiMaster which can be installed on mobile devices. The Asustor Data Master Operating System, (ADM) is a Linux-based operating system that Asustor uses across their range of NAS devices. it quite closely resembles Synology’s excellent DSM software. Though our experience with ADM is not as extensive as it is with QNAP and Synology’s OS’, the ADM does feel mature and bugfree with the functionality we tested. As this is a consumer oriented NAS device, we didn’t delve into the more advanced business and enterprise level features that are possible with ADM. Suffice to say, there are a ton of possible applications! Clicking on the admin tab at the top right of the interface brings a small settings menu where things like the passwords, volume usage and the background wallpaper can be changed. You can also shut down the NAS from here which may be especially handy given the difficult to reach location of the physical button on the back of the unit.   The major settings are located by selecting the cog icon on the desktop that you can see in the picture of the home screen above. There are an absolute mountain of settings and controls to be found here. The first tabs are the Network and VPN tabs. Key settings include manual controls over DNS, IP, Proxy settings and options for a WiFi Dongle should you be using one. VPNs are becoming more and more prevalent in the age of data mining and geo-blocking, so a VPN isn’t a bad thing at all to have. Next is the Regional Options tab which has things like time and date settings and the interface language. The Hardware tab is where you can control things like the disk hibernation or sleep settings, fan controls and a cool LED brightness adjustment. I personally use a Synology DS215J NAS and its LEDs are bright enough to light a room, so adjustment over the LED brightness on the Asustor is a small, but nice little option, particularly if you are planning to use it as a media playback device or with a HTPC in a darkened movie watching room. The Notification tab allows system log entries to be sent via email or SMS. For example, if a drive is failing or the fan freezes, the unit can be shut down remotely. The ADM Defender is a firewall application designed to protect the NAS from attacks. The Certificate Manager tab is probably not all that needed for our readers, but if the NAS is used in a business environment, this could be handy to control access. The ADM update tab is pretty self explanatory. Here the NAS will tell you which version you are running and if there are any updates, and notification methods if there are any available. The Network Recycle Bin tab is useful if you are worried about accidental data loss. This can be set to a per folder basis. The Energy Saver tab is where you can also control the drive sleep and hibernation settings, and wake on LAN. The EZ connect tab is a cloud ID for controlling remote access to your NAS. It’s an excellent feature. Let’s say you are overseas and want to upload a batch of pics to the NAS back home? no problem. The Manually Connect tab is where you’ll find DDNS settings or connecting a mobile device. The Factory Default tab is self explanatory. Apply this setting if you want to restore the NAS to its default state, but note you will lose all your data if you choose to do this. The final tab is the Registration tab where you can use your Asustor ID to utilize advanced features and cloud options.   Now that we’ve gone over some of the ADM settings and controls, lets have a look at some of the things AMD has at your fingertips, starting with the Storage Manager: Obviously  being a storage device fundamentally, you’ll want to be familiar with the Storage Manager tab. Here you can check the volume(s) and control iSCSI and LUN settings if you wish for a client device to see the NAS as a local disk(s). The File Explorer tab is where you’ll access the content of the NAS. Some of the useful features here include the ability to mount a ISO file and create a share link to someone who does not have access to the NAS. Kind of like your own Dropbox to share with people anywhere you like. Another feature is the ability to add an external optical drive. The App Central tab is where you can install apps to suit your usage requirements. There are a huge range of apps available, both from Asustor and third party developers. There’s apps for the cloud, security, web browsing, file sharing, itunes, productivity, Spotify, surveillance, coding tools, Kodi, Plex and about a million other apps. In addition to some of the built in content we’ve gone over, there are extensive two way backup and restore tools, system monitoring and information tools, and controls for external devices. we could write a book on the amount of functionality available. Did we mention the AS3102T can store files?? Asustor AS3102-T Multimedia Applications One of the key uses for a quality NAS is as a media server to stream to a wide variety of household devices. Plex Media Server is an ever popular tool for this very purpose. but we’re sad to say that we couldn’t get decent results. A 1080p h.264 stream over Wi-Fi resulted in choppy playback and 100% CPU load, with buffering pauses every few seconds making the stream unwatchable. Kodi, another popular media center app, fared better. Playback of a high quality 1080p x.264 stream with DTS audio played without issue over the HDMI port, with about 30% CPU usage on average. The problems started with the playback of a HEVC 10 bit stream which was choppy with 100% CPU use. This is a weakness of the built in Braswell CPU rather than anything specific to the software. Apollo lake CPU’s we’ve tested handle this kind of stream without issue, even at 4K. Playback to a mobile via Asustor’s own AiVideo app went well. The limitation of the HEVC stuttering playback remained, but we were easily able to stream 1080p x.264 content to a tablet with no stuttering or lagging issues over WiFi with low CPU usage. In summary, the Braswell N3050 dual core CPU is the Achilles heel of the AS3102T. Braswell lacks fixed function HEVC 10bit support and the two general purpose cores just aren’t powerful enough to compensate. In fact it can’t even handle 1080p HEVC 10bit properly. If you’ll be sticking to 1080p x.264, or using 8bit HEVC encoded content, then you’ll be fine. But 10bit and HDR is the way of the future. We recommend an alternative NAS solution such as Asustor’s own AS3202-T which has a more powerful quad core J3160CPU which should be able to handle 4K better.   Client applications A NAS, by definition, contains files that are shared with other devices on the network, so the way the network clients interact with the NAS is a key part of the user experience. Lets take a look at some of the client side applications. We’ve gone over a couple of the common apps, such as Plex and Kodi. Using an android phone, we were able to install and access data on the NAS quite easily. Now, if you go to the Google Play store and search for Asustor, you are greeted with an array of ‘Ai’ apps. Starting with the AiRemote. This is an app that lets you use your phone to control the NAS when it is connected to a display via HDMI. you can use the phone to move the cursor, control apps and type on a keyboard as well. It removes the need to have a keyboard and mouse. A perfect example would be to use Kodi with the NAS hooked up directly to a TV or HDMI receiver without the need for any PC in between. Nice! AiData is a tool for accessing the files on the NAS and connecting them with the cloud. Dropbox and google drive are two of the several options available for sharing. AiPhoto is the photo gallery app. With this you can manually or automatically send photos from your device straight to the NAS. It doesn’t appear to support geotagging though which would be a nice feature. AiSecure is a surveillance mobile app. This will be a vital app if you want to check in on your cameras while you’re out and about. AiMaster is the master control app for Asustor NAS’. You can do things like monitor status, backups and manage services and applications of the ADM OS. AiMusic is pretty self explanatory. This is the app that allows you to stream music from your NAS to your mobile device. AiVideo is the same thing, but for video. With this you can stream to a Chromecast dongle. AiDownload is the go to app if you wish to download without a PC. It supports HTTP, FTP and bittorrent. It can control various parameters such as up/down ratios, connection speeds and it supports RSS too. There’s one more not seen in the screenshot above. This is AiCast which is particularly useful for the HDMI equipped Asustor units. It is essentially a control app for Kodi. Though since Kodi has a dedicated android app, it’s up to you which one you prefer to use.   Test Setup & Results We equipped the AS3102T with a pair of Seagate ST2000VN000 NAS drives in a RAID 1 configuration. RAID0 wouldn’t make much sense given the speed would be bottlenecked by the Gigabit Ethernet connection. Remember that the choice of drive has a major impact on the performance of a NAS, so as always, your mileage may vary. In 2017, we also need to consider the limits of Gigabit networking as current hard drives are easily capable of transfers much faster than Gigabit. First up, we test a simple transfer to and from the NAS. We see this is hitting the limits of Gigabit networking once overheads are taken into account. Similar results to the real world test are seen in ATTO’s disk benchmark which shows the drives are fast enough to be bottlenecked even by smaller kb sized files. Next up is Anvil’s very good SSD test suite, which can also be used for regular hard drives of course.     Conclusion The Asustor AS3102T has a fantastic range of functionality and wide ranging selection of applications. Users unfamiliar with the virtues of Network Attached Storage will be blown away by some of the things a device like the AS3102T is capable of. It’s a low powered, cool running and quiet device and will serve an average users needs very well. Drive installation is a breeze, though they are not hot swappable for those who are concerned about this feature. We don’t think this is a massive issue here as most target users will be fussed with this once the device is powered up. Also we’d like to see the power button on the front of the unit. Having it on the rear is a bit of a head scratcher. For the most part performance is good as a home theater server, with one particular caveat: HEVC 10bit support. To be fair, this only comes with Kaby Lake generation CPU’s so this is hardly the only NAS that struggles with 10bit content. It will do 8 bit stuff well, and all kinds of x.264 content, provided the software you choose on the client side is properly set up to take advantage of it. Kodi in particular is a good choice, and we found Asustor’s own Ai apps worked well on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, which is not a cutting edge phone anymore. The Asustor’s ADM operating system is a terrific piece of software. It is intuitively laid out with most settings easy to find or easy to search for. Initialization and mapping the drive is very easy and we’re also impressed by the incredible variety of applications available . It’s like a separate networked PC really. The Asustor AS3102T is going for $369 SGD, making it a very good value proposition.   Pros: Good price Low power consumption AES hardware encryption support HDMI port 3x USB 3.0 3 Year warranty   Cons Braswell CPU is a step behind newer Apollo Lake solutions Strange power button placement No HEVC 10 bit hardware support Asustor 3202T is a better 4K choice James Seaton Post navigation Previous Article Tesla Sued Over “Dangerously Defective” Autopilot Software Next Article Fujifilm Launches INSTAX Square SQ10 Camera with Square Format Film Related Articles Graphics CardsReviews nVidia Forceware Driver Comparison TeamVR June 7, 2005 Network StorageNewsReviews Thecus N0503 ComboNAS TeamVR December 28, 2009 Graphics CardsNewsReviews Sapphire demos 6GB Radeon HD 7970 card at CeBIT, might be the next Toxic card TeamVR March 7, 2012 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Guest The reality of M&A for augmented and virtual reality Tim Merel@DigiCapitalist April 23, 2017 6:00 AM Above: Major corporations are coming together to fight the *power. (*The power in this case is market forces) Image Credit: Vrerse Despite Facebook’s blockbuster $3 billion Oculus acquisition in 2014, augmented and virtual reality has been too early stage for large scale mergers and acquisitions (M&A) so far. But that’s set to change in the next year to 18 months, so let’s look at what could drive M&A deals going forward. Where Digi-Capital’s Augmented/Virtual Reality Report Q1 2017 and deals database tracked $1.5 billion investments in the last 12 months to Q1 2017, there was only $600 million of M&As in the same period. That dynamic of investments outstripping M&As is typical of early stage tech markets, when deal-making is all about investment for growth rather than consolidation for dominance or cost. But as the VR/AR market continues to scale, M&A deal flow is on the rise. Major tech players are actively honing their strategies on where and who to buy. Startups are also considering larger corporate parents to provide safe harbor, until the market is big enough for their business models to sing. And as often happens, early stage companies which can’t raise the next round are looking for mergers with better funded startups to leverage their tech and talent. It’s good to be the king VR’s apex predators are Facebook’s Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive. But apex predators are giant, toothsome beasts that need to eat. A lot. High-end PC VR is compelling, and buying the headset, controllers, PC, graphics card, and premium software to make it fun put it beyond the reach of mass market consumers.  So while there are hundreds of thousands of Oculus and Vive users today, Digi-Capital’s forecasts see console/PC VR’s combined installed base only topping 20 million units by the end of the decade (Note: This is installed base, not annual unit sales, and it excludes higher volume mobile VR). And this is for companies used to operating in markets with users counted in the billions. Facebook’s enterprise value is close to $400 billion, it paid $3 billion for Oculus, and Mark Zuckerberg might invest $3 billion more on top of that. Facebook could fund Oculus’ PC division indefinitely, and HTC also has a large cash stockpile (although perhaps not quite such a big one) to fund the Vive division. With two T-rex’s and not enough food, something’s got to give at the high end. It’s not clear what deal (if any) might result, but watch this space. Picks and shovels While it’s not surprising to see corporates buying component makers and solution providers to accelerate internal development, for such an early stage market VR/AR’s roster of buyers has been impressive. Microsoft bought ODG’s patents for up to a reported $150 million. Apple bought Metaio. Google, Facebook, Intel and Snapchat each bought multiple component makers and solution providers. For core technology startups around mobile AR and AR smartglasses in particular, the high level of interest from corporate acquirers looks set to deliver more deals this year. Consolidation blues Some VR/AR sectors have become crowded already, with hundreds of startups chasing the same early stage consumers (and their wallets). The two sectors with lowest barriers to entry and the highest number of startups are VR video and VR games. While some of the best funded companies have the resources to see them through, others are already facing the financial realities of this stage of the market. Expect to see consolidation in these sectors in 2017, ahead ofwith a spurt of investment and growth coalescing around mobile AR next yearin the wake of Facebook’s AR Platform launch at F8. Through the looking glass Nobody has come close to an Oculus sized deal in AR, with the largest full-stack AR acquisition being Intel buying Recon for $175 million. AR smartglasses could take a few years to conquer AR’s five consumer challenges (hero device, all day battery life, cellular connectivity, app ecosystem, telco cross-subsidization)., with In the meanwhile, mobile AR becoming could become the dominant form of consumer AR through a combination of Facebook’s AR Platform and (if and when) Apple and Samsung enter the market. Given some folks’ wait-and-see approach to what the Facebook/Oculus deal means, AR’s consumer market might need to become clearer more established before corporates leap to the first billion dollar AR acquisition. Everything else VR/AR advertising, peripherals, distribution, social, enterprise and location-based VR have the benefit of not being overcrowded, but they also don’t have a catalyst to kick-off M&A in a major way yet. For large scale deal activity here, the total VR/AR installed base needs to scale to where corporates can’t stay on the sidelines any longer, and also need specific skills and tech they can’t develop inhouse. Where to from here? As VR/AR goes through a hinge year between 2016’s last year’s launch and 2018’s the coming inflection point around mobile AR, deal makers are being forced to consider where and when to move. Buy too early and risk being accused of irrational exuberance, buy too late and risk missing the boat. As always with VR/AR, it’s all a question of vision. All the investments and M&As in VR/AR for the last 5 years are tracked in detail in Digi-Capital’s Augmented/Virtual Reality Report Q1 2017 and bundled deals database.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Shuttle launches two Android/Rockchip Mini PCs for under $150 each 04/21/2017 at 2:00 PM by Brad Linder 8 Comments Shuttle has added two new tiny computers to its XPC nano line of products. The Shuttle XPC nano NS02A and NS02E both measure 5.6″ x 5.6″ x 1.1″ and feature fanless designs and power consumption of  just 5 watts. But while most Shuttle computers are designed for Intel processors, the new models are both powered by Rockchip RK3368 octa-core ARM Cortex-A53 processors and ship with Android 5.1 software. The good news is that they’re cheap: the NS02A sells for just $142, while the NS02E is available for $162. The main difference between the two models is that the NS02E supports Power-over-Ethernet, while the NS02A uses a separate power adapter. Both models feature 2GB of RAM, 16GB of eMMC storage, support for an optional 2.5 inch drive bay, Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, Miracast wireless display support, a 3.5mm audio jack, an HDMI port, three USB 2.0 ports and an SD card reader Shuttle says the systems are “particularly intended for digital signage and thin client applications,” but they’d also probably make decent media streamers or Android game systems. via MiniMachines   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 8 Comments on "Shuttle launches two Android/Rockchip Mini PCs for under $150 each" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member urgan Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Hell, 4.0 and 4.1-4.3 are only slated to lose support at the end of 2017. I have a tablet with 4.1.1 on it and I bought it four years ago. Whether this mini-signage box will actually take Google updates is another issue entirely but assuming it supports Google Play such things as anti-virus and entertainment apps such as YouTube and Netflix should be fine to run on this thing well into 2019.

I can’t even take Android seriously on tablets (use the phone btw), let alone on desktop. Chrome OS is somewhat more serviceable. $150 could probably be better spent on used or refurb white boxes that’ll run proper Linux distros no?

Android as desktop makes little sense in general so this can be used only for purpose-built applications, typically running only one application all the time. Also, this SOC + RAM is ridiculously underpowered for desktop workloads even among ARM solutions. Cortex-A72 should be the bare minimum nowadays for any kind of desktop/laptop attempt.

Call of Duty: World War 2 will be out on November 3, 2017. What’s more is that there will be a private beta for the game for those who pre-order. These were uncovered by Call of Duty fan site Charlie Intel. Furthermore, some details on what to expect in terms of single-player and multiplayer modes have also been made public. The game will feature events such as landing in Normandy on D-Day and will take place across Europe and there will be a co-operative mode that “unleashes a new and original story”. Photo Credit: Charlie Intel While the game should retail for $60 internationally, it would be safe to say that the standard edition of Call of Duty: World War 2 would cost Rs.4,499 on the PS4 and Xbox One in India with the PC version costing Rs. 3,499, much like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare did. Keep in mind that distributor Worldwide CD ROM is yet to confirm this. With Call of Duty: World War 2’s release date already made public, there’s still enough of a reason on to tune into the official reveal on April 26 at 10am PT (10:30pm IST). Hopefully Activision shows off what to expect in terms of gameplay and visuals, as well as highlighting Call of Duty: World War 2 special editions and other pre-order bonuses.   The use of a private beta to drive pre-orders is not too dissimilar to another Activision-published game due this year, Destiny 2. And much like Destiny, Call of Duty: World War 2 will have a marketing tie-up with the PS4. Box art for the game discovered on Amazon UK confirms that the PS4 will have timed exclusivity in terms of downloadable content, revealing “Play DLC Map Packs 30 Days Early” on PS4.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Microsoft enables 'Wake on Voice'… Microsoft enables 'Wake on Voice' feature on its Surface Studio all-in-one By Mark Coppock — April 20, 2017 1:33 PM Subscribe Share Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you're one of the lucky few to own a Microsoft Surface Studio, then you can now wake it up by yelling at it. Microsoft’s futuristic and ultra-expensive Surface Studio all-in-one (AIO) PC has been a smashing success, achieving more sales than the company expected and kicking off innovation in yet another PC market. The Surface Studio has become a little easier to purchase as well, with some configurations available for immediate shipping and some new markets opening up. Not one to rest on its laurels, Microsoft has released a new set of drivers for the Surface Studio that brings some welcome functionality. One of the features of Intel’s sixth-generation Skylake CPUs is what Microsoft calls “Wake on Voice from Modern Standby,” and that functionality is now available for the Surface Studio. As The Verge points out, the built-in ability to wake a machine using your voice has been around for a while on any machine with a Skylake processor. The feature is possible because such machines are capable of listening for voice commands even when in certain sleep states. However, it’s up to a given manufacturer to enable the feature. That’s exactly what Microsoft has done with the release of new Realtek audio drivers for the Surface Studio. Now, that system is capable of listening for the “Hey Cortana” command while it’s in “Modern Standby” mode, with is a specific sleep mode enabled in Skylake and later CPUs and also in Windows 10. It’s also the same functionality that’s available in the Xbox One running the latest Windows 10 build, certain Windows 10 Mobile devices, and the upcoming Cortana-powered Harmon Kardon speaker. One caveat is that a Surface Studio must already be updated to Windows 10 Creators Update to support the updated drivers and then enable the Wake on Voice from Modern Standby feature. If your Surface Studio has been updated to the latest major Windows 10 update, then you can go to the Surface Studio Drivers and Firmware page, click on the Download button, and then select the MSI installation file for the new driver. Mark Coppock\Digital Trends You’ll want to choose the driver that’s for the Windows 10 Creators Update build, which is 15063, then click the Next button. Once it’s downloaded, run it to install the appropriate Realtek audio drivers. Once that’s done, then you’ll be able to let your Surface Studio save some power by going to sleep but still expect it to respond immediately when you have a question for Cortana. It’s likely that this functionality will become even more important as Microsoft rolls out its anticipated home automation functionality.

If they ever get the bugs out, autonomous cars will put a lot of human drivers out of work. By Steven Greenhouse / The American Prospect April 23, 2017 Print Comments automobile congestion in the morning rush hour Photo Credit: chuyuss/Shutterstock Five to ten years from now, Uber hopes, the following will be an everyday occurrence: A driverless Uber car pulls up at Nick and Nicole Smith’s house at 7:30 in the morning. Their two kids, Julia, 16, and Joey, 14, hop into the car, and it then drops them off at school. The Uber car returns to the Smiths’ suburban home, picks up Nick and Nicole, and drops Nicole at the train station to catch the 7:55 into the city. The car then drives 40 minutes to drop off Nick at his company’s headquarters nestled in an office park. During the drive, Nick uses his laptop to answer emails and finish a PowerPoint. At 5:00 that afternoon, a driverless Uber car picks up Julia from field hockey practice and Joey from baseball practice and takes them home. Meanwhile, Uber has sent another car to pick up Dad at the office park at 5:30, and that car makes it to the train station in time to pick up Nicole, who’s due on the 6:15. The car then stops at a Chinese restaurant so the Smiths can pick up a takeout dinner. It waits while Nick runs in to get the food, and it then drops off the Smiths at home. Welcome to the brave new world of driverless cars and trucks. In this not-too-distant future, many Americans are likely to conclude that they no longer need—or want—to own a car. No more worrying about tune-ups or getting gas or shopping for auto insurance or renewing registrations. Uber’s controversial co-founder and CEO, Travis Kalanick, is very high on driverless technology, saying, “When there’s no other dude [i.e a driver] in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.” And Uber is far from the only player. Ford Motor and BMW say they’ll have driverless cars on the road within five years. General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft (obtaining a 10 percent stake) to help it develop driverless cars. Tesla, Volvo, Daimler, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Google, and Apple have also joined the race. And now mighty Intel, eager to get into a new, fast-growing sector, jumped into the fray in March by announcing a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye, an Israeli company that is a leader in making sensors and cameras for self-driving vehicles. Depending on how things shake out, Ford or Fiat Chrysler may own and manage self-driving fleets that compete head to head with Uber. The coming of driverless cars and trucks raises several big questions. How long will the transition to these vehicles take? What will be the benefits and the costs to society? Who will be the winners and who the losers (and it seems clear that many of the five million people who work as drivers will be losers)? And what role should the government play in managing and regulating the arrival of this new technology, or should all this be left to the free market to sort out? Also, what role should government take to help the millions of truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others who might lose their jobs, or should these displaced workers be left to fend for themselves? Should society require the winners from this new technology—most likely some giant corporations and the consuming public—to somehow share their gains with the losers, perhaps through some special levy on these new vehicles to finance programs to help the losers? The shift to driverless cars and trucks will be one of the most important new technologies since the horseless carriage replaced buggies. Yet the advent of self-driving vehicles will be different from the arrival of many previous technologies. Because we can see this technology coming years ahead of its arrival, we as a nation are in a position to take some smart policy steps to prepare and help the many people who will lose their jobs as a result of this new technology. But given America’s dismal history with easing economic transitions, such smart steps may not be taken, despite years of advance warning. Self-driving vehicles will threaten the jobs of as many as five million people—workers who make a living as taxi drivers, long-haul truckers, Uber and Lyft drivers, local delivery drivers, limo chauffeurs, and even many bus drivers. Beyond that, driverless cars could mean an end to many gas stations, auto repair shops, car washes, auto dealers, commercial parking lots, and car rental agencies, not to mention traditional auto insurance. Moreover, because this new technology will lead to a more efficient use of cars, the nation could well need fewer autos—and that could reduce overall car production. These cars will benefit the public in ways that many people don’t yet appreciate. “Most of us in the U.S. commute all alone in a single car—the average American driver spends 51 minutes to and from work every day,” says Raj Rajkumar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. “This is wasted time and wasted productivity. Driverless cars would be a big win for productivity. You can spend 45 minutes doing something productive, including taking a nap.” Rajkumar also sees a sharp drop in auto accidents. “About 1.3 million people die every year worldwide from auto accidents,” he says. “In the U.S., it’s about 38,000. Most of these accidents are caused by human error. Most of these lives would be saved with driverless technology.” Rajkumar adds that autonomous cars would be a godsend for blind, disabled, and elderly Americans who can’t drive. “These people would gain mobility,” he says. “It would greatly help the 1.5 million legally blind Americans and the more than five million disabled people who can’t drive.” Autonomous cars will make it far easier and, in theory, cheaper for many disabled people to get to work. And they will make it easier for many elderly and disabled people to go to movies or parks or shopping, and for the elderly to see their grandchildren and care for them after school. LAWRENCE KATZ, A LABOR ECONOMIST at Harvard, says there’s no denying that this radical new technology will imperil many jobs. The five million drivers who could lose their jobs, he says, represent almost 3 percent of the workforce and don’t, as a group, have bright prospects if they get laid off. “It’s disproportionately male, disproportionately non-college,” he says. Five million jobs, he explains, “is about the same size as the decline in manufacturing jobs since 2000. It’s a comparable potential shock.” The move to self-driving cars will of course produce some new jobs—in engineering, software, and marketing. But displaced former drivers generally won’t qualify for these white-collar jobs. Instead, they could find themselves with lower-paying jobs at Walmart or Target, or they could be trained for something better. According to Katz, there are two big reasons that the economic pain from losing five million driving jobs will be less than from losing five million factory jobs. First, drivers’ jobs are spread fairly evenly across the United States, while manufacturing jobs were concentrated in one devastated region, the Midwest. The more-even geographic distribution should make it easier for laid-off drivers to find jobs. Second, Katz noted, because factory workers average around $20 an hour, while drivers average $13, laid-off drivers would take less of a hit than factory workers if forced to take $10-an-hour jobs at Walmart. Still, Katz added, “This will be a shock to the labor market for non-college men. They’re already in tough shape.” Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which has 19,000 taxi, Uber, and Lyft drivers as members, shares these concerns. “Our people see this as a threat, and we know it’s closer than we realize,” she says. “These are workers on the margins, with language issues and low wages. Drivers are an older workforce. It’s people who are mainly in their forties and fifties and older. It’s going to be really hard to relocate these people within the economy.” “It’s going to be very disruptive,” says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy. “It’s going to happen faster than a lot of people realize.” How fast will it happen? Some companies, like Uber and Ford, see driverless cars becoming popular within five years, while some skeptical experts say it will take 20 or 30 years not just to develop a truly safe self-driving technology, but also to get needed government permissions, and to overcome public anxiety that could morph into public resistance. Moody’s Investors Service predicts that self-driving technology will not become a common option in conventional vehicles until 2030, and not become standard in all vehicles until 2035. Moody’s further predicts that not until 2045 will a majority of vehicles be driverless and that by 2055, they will become nearly universal. Uber and Google have prototypes on the road now. It’s one thing, though, to have a few dozen or hundred closely supervised experimental vehicles on the road, but a very different thing to have several million self-driving cars on streets and highways across America. Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book, an auto research firm, predicted that such cars would become mainstream across America in four to ten years. But Joan Claybrook, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says it could take 10, 20, even 30 years of tinkering with and improving self-driving technology until it is truly safer than human drivers. In terms of its impact on the job market, “a huge amount depends upon the rate of change,” says David Autor, an MIT economics professor. “If this is gradual, it’s not a big deal,” he adds, explaining that if this happens over 15 or 20 years, many drivers should have time to retrain and the economy should be able to absorb them without major problems. “But if this happens overnight, it’s a very big deal.” FOR THE MOMENT, THIS technology still faces sizable hurdles. It doesn’t work when snow covers lane markers, and there’s considerable worry about what happens if the internet system controlling these cars suddenly crashes. Government approvals could be delayed for years if there are more fatalities like that of the Tesla test driver who died in May 2016 when a truck cut in front of his self-driving vehicle. To help make sure that driverless vehicles are safe, huge infrastructure spending will be needed, such as installing road signs that communicate with these vehicles and upgrading GPS systems so they are accurate to within a few inches to help self-driving cars stay in their lanes. The huge outlays needed to finance these infrastructure improvements raise concerns about cost and about fairness. Supporters of driverless cars argue that such cars will help consumers—affluent and non-affluent—because they will in theory be cheaper than using today’s taxis. In some ways, however, the public investment needed to make a nationwide system of driverless cars possible will be a subsidy for affluent families like the Smiths who will be able to afford to use them far more than poorer families. The billions that government spends on infrastructure to make driverless vehicles safe and reliable could crowd out spending for mass transit, hurting less-affluent families who rely on subways, trains, and buses. Many technology experts say major infrastructure improvements will be needed to ensure that driverless cars are safe. The electronic equipment—sensors, cameras, radar, lasers—that keeps self-driving cars from hitting other cars relies on lane markings to operate, but when there is fog or when snow covers lanes or when there is blinding glare from the sun, those sensors often can’t function. To remedy this problem, there is a push to develop a far more accurate GPS system that can locate vehicles to within four inches—helping keep them in lanes. This upgraded GPS will likely need an expensive, elaborate, and frequently updated mapping of the terrain. As a further step to ensure safety and guide these cars, industry experts are calling for a new generation of road signs and traffic lights that contain elaborate electronics to communicate with driverless cars—perhaps telling them exactly where the next exit is or warning of construction ahead or an upcoming lane merger. These infrastructure improvements will be expensive, and one can be sure that the industries rushing to introduce driverless cars will want the government to pay. In the past, the government has paid for GPS satellites and highway signs. Another infrastructure requirement: The millions of autonomous cars that will eventually be on the road will need to communicate with the cloud, and that will mean significantly expanding the capacities of the cloud. This cost is likely to be borne by companies like Uber, Google, and Ford, and not by taxpayers. Brauer of Kelley Blue Book has other, nagging fears, among them that computer hackers might sabotage a car’s computer controls. For example, hackers might direct 20 driverless cars on a bridge to suddenly turn right, and they then disastrously plunge off the bridge. Or there might be an unexpected technical glitch that causes five cars to blow through an intersection and take out a group of pedestrians. Such a serious glitch or hacking incident could traumatize the public and cause regulators to delay for years giving needed government permissions. Brauer sees another obstacle to rolling out this new technology. “A lot of people won’t buy into it on a philosophy and on a trust level,” he says. That creates another challenge—many traditionalists may shun driverless cars and keep on driving their own cars. That could mean big problems meshing the supposedly safer driverless technology with cars driven by often-flawed human beings, some of whom will inevitably drive drunk or carelessly change lanes and crash into a self-driving car in their blind spot. There is also the big issue of how driverless cars should be regulated. Autonomous cars present an auto-safety issue far more momentous than the battles over airbags or cameras for when one drives in reverse. But in the face of industry eagerness and rapidly changing technology, the Obama administration punted. Without much public debate, the administration gave a fairly bright green light to driverless cars in September 2016, when the Department of Transportation issued guidelines permitting self-driving cars. These guidelines call for driverless cars to meet 15 safety standards and called for the 50 states to develop uniform regulations for these cars. There was no notice of rulemaking, and no formal set of rules. Under these guidelines, Uber, Google, Ford, and other companies could move ahead in introducing driverless cars onto the roads, without any further federal authorization needed—although the government emphasized that it would look over the companies’ shoulder and intervene if it saw safety problems with this radical new technology. In the event of safety problems arising, the government reserved the right to step in and set standards for some technologies, like electronic sensors, that autonomous cars rely on. Perhaps predictably, some auto industry executives protested that these guidelines were too strict because they raised the possibility that the government would delay or block some new self-driving technologies if it saw safety problems. Currently, the auto industry self-regulates in introducing new technologies, like automatic braking, under the belief that automakers—not wanting to hurt their image or sales—wouldn’t add a new technology unless they were convinced it was safe. But in light of the industry’s checkered history on safety, some skeptics are calling for greater regulation of self-driving vehicles. In Claybrook’s view, the Obama administration was far too hasty. “There will be some good actors and some bad actors,” she says. “The question is whether the public can rely on anything.” States have asserted some regulatory authority, but that is largely being preempted by Washington. The states will continue to be responsible for inspecting cars and licensing drivers and insurance. “The way it’s going to work,” Claybrook says, “if the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does nothing more, the industry can do whatever it wants on driverless cars. The federal government will have opted out.” And of course the Trump administration is even less likely to intervene. TRUCKING PRESENTS A paradoxical variation on the theme. Last summer, Michael Belzer, a professor at Wayne State University and one of the nation’s leading academic authorities on the trucking industry, was predicting that self-driving trucks wouldn’t arrive for 20 years. He said in an interview back then, “The technology is just not there.” But now Belzer says self-driving trucks might arrive in ten years, perhaps sooner. This past October, Uber’s Otto subsidiary caused Belzer to shorten his timeframe when an Otto self-driving truck equipped with $30,000 in software and hardware hauled 50,000 cans of Budweiser from Fort Collins to Colorado Springs. With a human driver sitting in the cab as a backup, the truck drove 120 miles on I-25, although the human did get the truck onto the interstate and took over again before the truck exited back onto city streets. Some experts predict that self-driving trucks will become widespread before self-driving cars do, because trucking companies are so eager to cut costs and have these expensive vehicles run nearly around the clock. “The trucking industry has a huge interest in not having to pay for drivers,” Claybrook tells me. For some long-distance trucking trips, companies may cut back from two drivers in the cab to one, and there’s talk of having convoys with two or three trucks, with a driver in the front truck, and one or two autonomous trucks following right behind. “One of the big questions should be what’s going to happen to this workforce,” Belzer adds. “A lot of these drivers voted for Trump. What’s going to happen to them? Our tradition in the United States is to hell with these workers and dump them. We get rid of that work, get rid of those jobs, and you, the worker, figure out what to do.” For now at least, officials with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters aren’t voicing much alarm about the possibility of truck drivers losing jobs. The reason: Teamster officials assert that self-driving trucks will continue to need a driver to help out in case of emergencies, to handle paperwork, to assure the safety of the cargo, to pull a truck into a warehouse. An analogy is aircraft. Planes have had autopilots for generations. Today, aircraft can virtually fly themselves—and do so in bad weather. But despite futuristic projections of pilotless planes, no serious person is pushing to have commercial jetliners without human crews capable of taking the controls. Kara Deniz, a Teamsters spokesperson, says, “We don’t see anything indicating that these vehicles will be able to function in real-life conditions, go long distances, especially through a city environment, without a human being. You hear these doomsday scenarios about jobs, but there are so many questions that still need to be addressed, like not knowing the reliability and safety, and then there are hacking issues.” Sam Loesche, a Teamsters lobbyist, adds, “We have not seen a situation where any responsible operator would agree that there’s a role for this technology without an operator in the cab. Our view is [that] the best piece of safety technology is the driver.” While insisting that drivers will continue to be needed, Loesche switches gears and says that in any conversation about self-driving vehicles, “workers’ jobs need to be a top issue.” He adds, “You can’t have the number of job losses you did in other industries and not see a role for policymakers and the government.” The main industry group, the American Trucking Associations, shares some of the Teamsters’ views. Pointing to issues like hazardous cargo, driving in cities, and interacting with warehouses and stores receiving merchandise, Chris Spear, the association’s president, told a federal transportation panel in January that ATA believes drivers “will retain an important role in trucking for the foreseeable future, even with automated trucks, just as pilots are still present in airline cockpits.” Kalanick, Uber’s CEO, has a surprisingly optimistic—though somewhat self-contradicting—take on what driverless technology will mean for jobs. He says that in years to come, Uber will offer a mix of rides, some provided by drivers, some by self-driving cars. Kalanick foresees skyrocketing demand for improved transportation and says this would mean a continued need for drivers—for instance, to help many disabled or elderly passengers in and out of vehicles. “Many people predicted that the ATM would spell doom for bank tellers,” Kalanick says. “In fact, ATMs cut the cost of running a local bank so more branches opened, employing more people.” Kalanick adds, “Self-driving Ubers, for example, will be on the road 24 hours a day, which means they’ll need a lot more human maintenance than cars today.” NUMEROUS CORPORATIONS stand to make a fortune from this new technology, and many consumers will benefit, too. “Well-funded companies see a lot of potential revenues at the end of this rainbow, and they all want to get there first,” says Brauer of Kelley Blue Book. “There’s lots of money to be made producing the cars, controlling them, managing their data systems, and collecting information about passengers. Companies will know when he’s going, where he’s going, what he’s doing. Talk about opportunities for targeted advertising.” Once autonomous cars become popular, Brauer adds, “there will be an explosion of new business models with billions of dollars up for grabs.” With driverless cars, Uber and Lyft won’t have hard-working drivers keeping 60 percent to 80 percent of the fares. Instead, Uber and Lyft will keep the lion’s share of fares, although some might go to taxes and fees and some might go to Google or whichever company runs the driverless cars’ data systems. “Their business model would go from having huge profit potential to having massive profit potential,” Brauer says. “The fight over whether the drivers are independent contractors or employees and the related litigation, all that goes away. It becomes an extremely desirable business model.” In their book, Driverless: Intelligent Cars and the Road Ahead, Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman point to another problematic effect of driverless cars—companies and their shareholders will grow richer as drivers grow poorer. “As machines take away human jobs,” they write, “one potentially devastating effect will be to further exacerbate the trend toward inequality, a growing global problem.” MIT’s Brynjolfsson argues that we as a nation should make sure we find a way to share this prosperity and progress with the displaced drivers. The most important step, he said, will be to provide first-class retraining for them. Many economists say bigger and better retraining programs will be the key, even though the nation’s retraining programs have a less-than-stellar history because they often train unemployed workers for fields where there aren’t enough job openings. Help for laid-off drivers can take many other forms, perhaps including something akin to the trade adjustment assistance received by factory workers who lose their jobs to imports. A beefed-up version would be desirable, because trade adjustment assistance has often been underfunded and has not done enough to support and retrain laid-off workers. Harvard’s Lawrence Katz offers several other suggestions: wage subsidies, an increased earned income tax credit, and, if need be, a government-backed public jobs program. (That last idea is anathema to conservatives.) A big question is where we, in tax-averse America, would find the money to finance programs to assist displaced drivers. One option would be to impose a tax on self-driving vehicles—perhaps a tax on every mile traveled. At some point, Congress could step in and tell the many corporations eager to introduce—and cash in on—this technology that it will agree to a nationwide green light for all 50 states on one condition: that it enacts a law creating a special per-mile tax to finance programs that aid and retrain displaced drivers. “Even though this may not lead to mass dislocation,” Autor says, “it may further constrict the set of opportunities for people who don’t have specialized skills. Not to say that driving doesn’t require specialized skills, but it’s not up there with engineers or computer programmers.” Autor sees demand for skilled construction workers, skilled medical technicians, and skilled repairmen as opportunities for displaced drivers. As for those who do not retrain and develop special skills, Autor says, they might have to turn to lower-paying jobs as home health aides, security guards, or food service or cleaning workers. Brynjolfsson believes laid-off drivers should be retrained for many “different kinds of jobs and industries.” Many could be trained for sales or marketing jobs, he says, adding that there are huge unmet needs, in particular, in health care and other nurturing and caring jobs. But, he acknowledges, “a lot of truck drivers aren’t going to find much of this appealing. It will be a rough transition.” America’s retraining programs have often fallen short because they failed to place workers in jobs after months or years of retraining—often because the programs ignored whether there were opportunities in the fields for which laid-off workers were being trained. While education—whether obtaining vocational training or associate’s or bachelor’s degrees—would of course help laid-off drivers, it could prove frustrating if there aren’t enough jobs out there. An ambitious program to address the nation’s urgent infrastructure problems is badly needed, and that could create a million or more construction jobs, as well as long-term jobs maintaining and operating all manner of “smart” infrastructure systems, not to mention the newfangled auto repair stations and parking lots that will be needed for company-owned fleets of driverless cars. The nation’s renewed focus on preserving and creating factory jobs could also provide valuable opportunities for laid-off drivers. And it is of course important to strive for a full-employment, higher-wage economy that offers job opportunities not just for laid-off drivers, but for everyone. This is a long-term planning challenge that goes well beyond the question of how to re-employ the upcoming wave of displaced drivers. No one should expect a seamless transition for the many drivers whose jobs get run over by driverless technology. That’s where wage subsidies, earned income tax credits, extended unemployment insurance, and some form of adjustment assistance might come into play. Some advocates argue that universal basic income would be an ideal program for drivers thrown out of work and having a hellish time finding another job. But most drivers are eager to work and probably won’t want to just get by on a modest UBI. The development of driverless cars is a perfect opportunity for some smart public policy. We as a nation have years to plan, and there will be a rich revenue stream to draw from. Let’s hope that we, the world’s richest nation, adopt some smart, foresighted policies so that millions of drivers don’t get banged up in a head-on collision when this radical new technology takes the road.         Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Sign Up!

Not anymore. Last year, the company’s co-founders Dan and Johnna Charbonneau hired Galvin, who had worked as a fundraiser and a consultant to global nonprofit groups and social entrepreneurs. Now CBT Nuggets’ charitable giving arm, Nugget­Love, doesn’t just give money. It gives Galvin’s time and expertise — and sometimes the talents of other employees — to help a targeted group of nonprofit organizations raise money and spread their message. The Charbonneaus’ eyes opened to this new way of corporate giving a few years ago after CBT Nuggets donated to the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Drop in the Bucket. Drop in the Bucket builds wells and sanitation systems in Uganda, enabling girls to go to school and women to be part of the local economy, instead of spending much of their time fetching water. The nonprofit also starts village savings and loan programs, offering microloans to entrepreneurs. Interest from the loans pays to maintain the wells, and the loans help spur a market economy, Galvin said. After working with Drop in the Bucket, “we realized we could do more to help in the world,” Johnna Charbonneau said. “We decided we wanted to work with charities who help their beneficiaries not only fulfill basic needs — like clean water and sanitation — but who also elevate their beneficiaries to become self-reliant,” she said. “We felt we could do this by working with a small number of charities assisting them in their development efforts, helping them become stronger and more sustainable, and thus making a bigger impact on difficult social, economic, and environmental problems.” Sharing the NuggetLove CBT Nuggets, which was founded in 1999, produces and sells online training for information technology professionals worldwide. It has 127 employees — 95 of them are based in Eugene. The private company doesn’t reveal its annual revenues, but it said each year it channels to NuggetLove about 1 percent of total revenues. Nonprofit groups apply to be part of the NuggetLove program. CBT Nuggets is currently helping the 15th Night Movement, a partnership of over 20 local organizations, working to prevent homelessness among area youth. The project’s name comes from social services agencies’ observation that if young people don’t have a place to call home by the 15th night, they run a greater risk of chronic homelessness. For the past month, Galvin has been leading weekly meetings of a seven-person committee to help the 15th Night project with marketing and communications. Organizations that are striving for social change, to improve lives or advance their mission, are looking to business for support in terms of time, money and/or talent, said Megan Schultz, a Eugene consultant who has been contracted to help launch the 15th Night. “In CBT Nuggets’ case, they have all three,” she said. “They’re really trying to meet organizations where they‘re at. What is it that would be most helpful to you?” NuggetLove also works with the Kenyan nonprofit, I See Maasai Development Initiative, which works to improve Maasai communities by providing access to school supplies and scholarships, water projects, such as wells, healthcare facilities, public health education, and social entrepreneurship opportunities in the tourism industry. Galvin said she isn’t aware of any other companies CBT Nuggets’ size that structure their corporate giving in this way. “Even though this is a small company, they are on the leading edge of what’s being done in corporate citizenship,” said Maryann Fiala, spokeswoman for the Association of Corporate Contributions Professionals. Members of the South Carolina-based nonprofit group lead corporate responsibility programs at for-profit companies and corporate funded foundations. “More and more companies, regardless of their size, are recognizing the value of good corporate citizenship and are choosing to do it strategically rather than hit or miss,” Fiala said. It’s very common for companies to offer resources, not just money, to help nonprofit groups build their capacity, she said. “You can give them X number of dollars that can go so far. But if you can give them skills that can multiply the dollars they’re raising and multiply the impact on ... whatever social ill they’re trying to solve, then you’ve given so much more than money.” Increasingly companies, even small ones, want their giving to have global impact, especially if their marketplace is global, Fiala said. A strong corporate giving program also can help businesses recruit and retain workers, she said. “The generation of workers coming into the workforce now are telling us very vocally they want to work for companies that want to do good in the world,” Fiala said. “They want to work for a company that does more in the world than just provide a product or service.” Other ways of giving Besides its targeted work with several nonprofit groups, CBT Nuggets also gives to the community in other ways. The company has to constantly upgrade its own computers, so it routinely donates its old ones to local nonprofit groups, Galvin said. It also looks for groups of people who could benefit from free CBT Nuggets training. After Intel Corp. announced last year that it was laying off 12,000 workers, including employees in Oregon, CBT Nuggets offered affected employees six months of free CBT Nuggets’ online training to help them brush up their skills or gain new ones, with the goal of keeping them employed in Oregon’s tech industry. Several hundred laid-off Intel workers accepted the offer, Galvin said. That effort led CBT Nuggets to brainstorm how it could help sustain and grow Lane County’s tech force, she said. Galvin contacted the Lane Workforce Partnership, a local workforce agency. Earlier this month, NuggetLove announced it is offering six months of free online training to Lane County job seekers working with Worksource Oregon, a partnership of various public and private agencies, including the Lane Workforce Partnership and the state employment department. “We serve all job seekers,” said Jessica McCormick, the partnership’s workforce project manager. “It could be someone looking to advance their career, or someone laid off, or currently looking for work.” The six months of training, worth an estimated value of $500, “is a really good opportunity for anyone interested in getting into the tech field,” McCormick said. The partnership is excited to offer this opportunity to clients, she said. “One of the goals of Lane Workforce Partnership is to expand the use of services to underrepresented populations,” McCormick said. “That includes rural Lane County. This is a unique opportunity for people with barriers to transportation to get some very sophisticated training.” For years, through its Outside the Wire program, CBT Nuggets has offered six months of free training to service men and women transitioning out of the U.S. military. About 70 veterans have used or are using the free training, Galvin said. Esteban Hermosillo, 24, is among them. Hermosillo lives at Camp Pendleton near Oceanside, Calif. He has served in the U.S. Navy in information technology, as a network administrator and system administrator, since July 2013, and is planning to transfer out of the Navy this summer. Hermosillo is enrolled in Microsoft Software & Systems Academy, a program for service men and women leaving active duty to train as cloud developers and administrators and database administrators. He said he stumbled upon CBT Nuggets’ website, and learned about the six-months-free-­training offer, so he applied. “It’s been an awesome tool,” Hermosillo said, adding that he is using the training to learn about servers and to achieve Cisco certification as a network administrator. “I watch all the videos,” he said. “They have a bunch of quizzes and tests.” Hermosillo said without the program, the CBT Nuggets training would have cost $600. “That was money I did not have,” he said, “and I was hoping to get some support. It’s been invaluable to me.” Follow Sherri on Twitter @sburimcdonald . Email sherri@registerguard.com .

Trump visited the headquarters of tool manufacturer Snap-on Inc., and will later sign a an executive order that seeks to make changes to a visa program that brings in high-skilled workers. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) With the technology industry constantly complaining about a talent shortage, making it harder to hire foreign workers doesn’t seem like an obvious solution. Oddly enough, though, President Donald Trump’s proposed changes to the H-1B visa program could help companies such as Microsoft and Google bring in the foreign talent they need. In his “Buy American, Hire American” executive order, Trump told four Cabinet agencies to propose new procedures for granting H-1B visas, including a possible replacement for the current lottery system. Related Trump orders review of visa program to encourage hiring Americans 'We're going to defend our workers, protect our jobs and finally put America first/' In this year’s lottery, the government got 199,000 applications in less than a week for 85,000 available visas. The applications were down a bit from last year, which can be read as a sign that outsourcing firms — the biggest users of the H-1B program — are worried about a Trump crackdown. And that’s a good thing. The outsourcing firms, mostly Indian companies such as Wipro and Infosys, often pay their foreign workers less than typical technology-industry wages to maintain websites and perform other routine back-office tasks. Critics say their business model harms American workers. Industry observers also believe the outsourcers flood the government with H-1B applications to improve their odds. If they stop playing that game because of Trump’s vow to police abuses, the odds should tilt in favor of companies such as Amazon and Intel. Administration officials suggest that Trump wants to move away from the lottery and toward a system that would reward higher-paying employers. They also suggest that he may raise the application fee and set a higher minimum salary for H-1B workers. All of those moves would make the program less hospitable to outsourcers and more useful for Silicon Valley firms looking for truly high-end skills. “You solve a supply-demand problem by either increasing supply or raising the price,” says Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation. “President Trump essentially is raising the price.” The outsourcing firms, of course, will adapt to the changes. “One effect is they will just do more work in India,” Atkinson says. “The other possibility is that it becomes harder for these companies to make their model work.” What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, thinks the Indian firms will have to pay more — and hire more U.S. citizens — if they want to keep their American clients. “These firms are under serious margin pressure anyway,” Kirkegaard says. “They need to move up the food chain, do more than basic bug-finding and back-office optimization. … To do that, to become more of a high-value-added provider, they’re going to have to hire more American workers.” Trump’s executive order eventually may transform H-1B from a lottery into something like an auction, where the visas go to the firms willing to pay the most. Firms such as Google — or in other industries, Monsanto or Goldman Sachs — would be able to hire the world’s best talent and find specialized skills that are in short supply. That, after all, is what the H-1B program was designed for. And, those U.S. companies tend to try to keep the workers they bring in. “They pay workers well, and they sponsor them for green cards,” Kirkegaard points out. “It’s a different use of the program than the outsourcing firms do.” Ideally, the U.S. should combine an auction process with a way to issue more visas when companies need more workers. Trump, having run on an anti-immigration platform, isn’t likely to go that far, so employers will have to settle for a more efficient allocation of the current quota.

Those lucky — and wealthy — enough could do so in an outfit from H&M’s Coachella collection and end their night in an air-conditioned safari tent designed by Marriott.

(Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand Coachella, once an indie darling, used to bury sponsors on its website, but this year, the festival’s corporate partners all have an experience to sell and a logo to slap on it. Some offered ways to interact with their brands without an obvious sales pitch, while others used the three-day festival to promote new products and special offers. The experiences offered in 2017 included drone shows, a psychedelic journey through space, a makeup counter and an opportunity to get a selfie in fake snow. Studies have found millennials — the demographic buying up tickets to the sold-out festival — are more prone to FOMO, or the “fear of missing out,” making them more likely to form connections to brands that allow them to share unique interactions with their envious friends at home. Ticket seller Eventbrite found that more than 78 percent of millennials would rather spend their money on events than on products and more than 77 percent tied their “best memories” to a live experience in a 2014 nationwide survey of more than 2,000 adults. “We’re living in an era where a lot of people are paying for an experience,” said Jeff Fromm, a partner at the Kansas City, Missouri-based ad agency Barkley and author of “Marketing to Millennials.” “And brands are looking to integrate with those people who have discretionary money.” It’s not necessarily a bad thing either, Fromm said, as long as the sponsorship doesn’t take away from Coachella’s charm. Guests at Coachella seemed to agree, with some of the sponsored “experiences” this year getting praise from the people who paid at least $399 per ticket. Coachella is a “bucket list experience” and consumers looking to check it off the list aren’t likely to be deterred by sponsorships, overt or otherwise, Fromm said. Netflix, Heineken and H&M all showed up at Coachella. Netflix offered free WiFi to promote its new series “Girlboss;” Heineken, a longtime sponsor, brought in surprise guests; and H&M as it has in recent years sponsored a fashion line in the spirit of the music festival. Computer company HP Inc. had one of the largest presences at Coachella this year, but fans seemed to view most of their offerings favorably. HP hosted a lounge with virtual reality, a light show controlled by fans using the latest HP computers, and a machine to create custom bandannas. Along with Intel, the tech company also backed a synchronized drone performance with hundreds of the aerial robots that circulated on social media as one of the better moments of Coachella’s first weekend. The Antarctic, a massive dome sponsored by Intel and HP near Coachella’s main entrances, similarly drew praise. The 15-minute show gave fans a chance to relax in beanbag chairs in the air-conditioned dome while watching a trippy 360-degree video that first starts in the desert and then flies through space, time and the human brain. HP partnered with visual artists Android Jones and Eric Pare to create the immersive installation, according to the company. “They’re not really in your face trying to sell you stuff,”  said Amy Kirkpatrick, of Irvine, as she exited the dome with Mitch Franco, of Santa Ana. “We’re not running out to buy HP printers or computers or anything.” Kirkpatrick said they had not noticed the HP logo until the very end and weren’t aware of the other companies’ booths throughout the polo field, many of which were tucked away from the main stages. Marriott and American Express were among those offering special tents for members of their rewards’ programs and the general public. American Express created a lounge for fans to create mini-music videos at Coachella, and outside the venue they offered an exclusive party for Platinum cardholders in Palm Springs. At Marriott, guests could pose for pictures on four stages set up to look like locales around the world, from the beach to an arctic tundra complete with fake snow for snow angels. Rewards members got access to a VIP area with unique food and drink vendors and a chance to bid on eight safari tents themed after Marriott’s various hotel chains. Actress Vanessa Hudgens tweeted out a picture in front of one of the tents during the first weekend as part of a brand partnership with Le Meridien Hotels, one of Marriott’s chains. Fromm said arrangements like the one with Hudgens are helping to reach younger generations. “Millennials are less likely to accept company points of view than prior generations and more likely to accept non-traditional forms of communications,” he said. Some of the experiences were only for the festival’s most wealthy clientele. VIPs could get rides to the event in a Coachella-themed BMWi, worth $142,000, and the company set up displays within the VIP areas as part of its #roadtocoachella campaign. The walls of the tent were papered in photos of BMWs near the wind farms that are the gateway to the Coachella Valley. The special tent had couches for lounging, phone-charging lockers and a display that showed promotional videos created for Coachella, including one with Sunday night performer and film composer Hans Zimmer. However, you couldn’t test drive a car on-site, unlike the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, which allows people to test out Toyota trucks on an off-road course. Eight-year Coachella veteran Andy Zepeda said he’s noticed the amount of corporations visible at Coachella increase every year, but it hasn’t reached a level where it bothers him, yet. “As long as it is giving me something new to experience, I don’t really mind it as long as it not getting in my way,” he said. The sponsors this year offered either experiences that gave him more to do, or they offered free merchandise, like bandannas, he noted. Fromm, the marketing expert, said Coachella fans should get used to the sponsorships, which help Goldenvoice, the promoter, expand the festival without increasing ticket prices or cutting into their revenues. In exchange for their support, the brands get a captive audience, he added. “I’m not surprised to see more of these events, and brands are looking for the opportunity to engage with consumers,” Fromm said. “It’s not going to get smaller; it’s going to get bigger.” More stories, photos from Coachella 2017: Photos: See all of the Coachella vibes from Weekend 2 What happened on Friday, Weekend 2 Coachella 2017: This is the cool, weird stuff you can buy in the festival’s Vintage Market See a couple’s Coachella proposal Radiohead conquers Coachella’s second weekend Photos of Radiohead from Weekend 2 Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 2 Meet the young kids rocking out at the festival How ‘Amnesty Boxes’ keep drugs out and festivalgoers safe Live updates from Weekend 2 17 things to know about opening weekend Photos: What it actually looks like to be at Coachella’s opening weekend Here’s how the first Friday at Coachella went down Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 1 Who wore it best (or worst)?

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. A new low-cost Surface device and Windows 10 Cloud OS combo could do some serious damage to Google's Chromebook ambitions in U.S. schools. On May 2, all eyes will be on Microsoft at its New York City event. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is expected to take the stage and unveil a new push into the education market, likely focused on the U.S. initially. Google has been making big inroads into the K-12 education sector with its low-cost and easy-to-manage Chromebooks. According to IDC's latest numbers,, Chromebooks represented 49 percent of that market last year, up from 40 percent in 2015 and just 9 percent in 2013. Another research firm, Futuresource, puts the number even higher at 58 percent, up from 50 percent in 2015. Apple, which has taken the brunt of the damage from the Chromebook wave in education in the U.S, meanwhile lost significant momentum in recent years. Apple's iOS, featured on the waning iPad series, went from a peak of 26 percent of the market in 2014 to just 14 percent last year, according to Futuresource. Microsoft's Windows, by comparison, did better, dropping from 25 percent to 22 percent in that same time period. For non-U.S. markets, the tale is very different. There, 65 percent of the education market is Windows, with Chrome OS at just six percent and Android at 17 percent. Apple held steady at just nine percent of the global education K-12 markets. The timing is right for Windows 10 Cloud Google is on to something with its Chromebook line, at least in the U.S. Combined with hardware support from major manufacturers, a mature app ecosystem, and ease of IT management, Chromebooks are the preferred choice for school IT departments. In speaking with some local school IT administrators – both public and private – here in Marlborough, Mass., it is the ability to lock down and secure Chromebooks, followed by cost, that is driving Chromebook adoption. 7 things you need to know about Windows 10 Cloud Microsoft is poised, however, to get back into education. Windows RT was a disaster for the company on many levels, including its confusing name, poor marketing, software limitations, and pricing. The Windows 10 Cloud OS, which may go by the name "Windows 10 S" when unveiled on May 2, is a different scenario. This time, Microsoft has a story to tell and a strategy to market this version of Windows to the right audience. Key differences between Windows RT and Windows 10 Cloud OSes include: A more mature Store for Windows Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The ability for the OS to be upgraded to a Home or Pro license. Capacity to run Win32 apps via "Project Centennial" bridge apps via the Store. A hardware team that's more in tune with commercial and consumer needs and desires. Combined with advancements in hardware and improvements to the OS, Microsoft has clear goals it wants to achieve with Windows 10 Cloud. In an internal document obtained by Windows Central (above), we can see exactly how Microsoft views Windows 10 Cloud as competing against Chromebooks in performance benchmarks. Additionally, recommended minimum specifications for a Windows 10 "CloudBook" are listed for hardware manufacturers: Quad-core (Celeron or better) processor. 4GB of RAM. 32GB of storage (64GB for 64-bit). A battery larger than 40 WHr. Fast eMMC or solid state drive (SSD) for storage technology. Pen and touch (optional). Microsoft is focusing heavily on all-day battery life, as evidenced by its new "Power Throttling" initiative that's being tested in recent Windows Insider Program previews for the "Redstone 3" release expected this fall. Windows 10 on ARM will go further Windows 10 on ARM is another big step for Microsoft that is expected to come to fruition this fall, as well. With the ability to run what was an x86/64 OS on mobile ARM processors, the company can further drive down hardware costs, improve battery efficiency, and make thinner and lighter devices. Intel is making significant strides in reducing battery consumption, and Microsoft's Power Throttling goes further. According to the company, its Power Throttling support will be extended to other processor types (currently it is limited to 6th and 7th Generation Intel processors), which likely includes ARM. The Achilles heel of Windows laptops has always been two-fold: poor battery life, and risk management due to viruses and installing .exe software. Both of those problems are now being ameliorated through Windows 10 Cloud. Windows 10 on ARM devices are expected at the end of 2017 in the fourth quarter. Today's Surface Book is too expensive The current problem for Microsoft and its Surface line is the price. At Microsoft's Surface Studio event in October 2016, Microsoft's Corporate Vice President of Devices Panos Panay used a photo of his son to demonstrate how children naturally adopt digital inking on a PC. In the picture, presented as a backdrop, the child is using a Surface Book. That device starts at $1,600 and increases to more than $3,000 for the high-end version. Kids love inking and the Surface Book, but how do you get it into schools? While in a perfect world all kids would be able to afford a Microsoft Surface Book, the chances of that happening are minuscule. Clearly, Microsoft needs a lower-cost, entry-level device that provides a similar experience with an emphasis on a touchscreen and digital pen. A new "Surface Laptop" running Windows 10 Cloud is the ideal solution, if it meets the minimum hardware specifications mentioned earlier. It also could also replace the now deprecated non-pro Surface 3. Microsoft is expected to announce such a device on May 2, though some of our sources say the new hardware may not come until Microsoft's Build conference the following week. A traditional laptop without a detachable keyboard would keep production costs down (fewer product SKUs), and it would work for schools, where losing a keyboard (or breaking it) could cause headaches for IT staff. As a solution to making the laptop more Surface-like, the keyboard could rotate around like Lenovo's Yoga series or HP's x360 line. I also suspect a Surface Pen will be a part of any Surface Laptop, because the recent Creators Update focuses on inking. The new EPUB support in Windows 10 makes sense when you think of a push into education for Microsoft. Likewise, the seemingly odd addition of EPUB support for the Edge web browser and corresponding digital book section in the Windows Store makes more sense once you bring education into the equation. However, one issue Microsoft could face in schools is app selection. While UWP is evolving and improving the selection of quality apps specifically related to education, it cannot possibly match the Google Play Store. That could change over time, and perhaps Microsoft has some strategies in place to help lure companies to create apps specifically for this genre. Windows 10 Cloud and Surface for schools makes sense Recently, a nephew of mine who is nine years old saw my Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. He said, "That looks like my Chromebook." I jokingly corrected him by stating "No, your Chromebook looks like my PC laptop." The point should be obvious: The education market is critical to Microsoft's future based purely on familiarity. The debate between macOS and Windows preference, for instance, almost always comes down to what you were exposed to first. Rarely in today's world do adults try both OSes, evaluate them equally and come to rational decisions. Chromebook or PC? The answer may be age dependent. If Google is already at 50 percent adoption in the U.S. education market, that is a generation that's now in the Google and Android ecosystem. Microsoft needs a plan to take that on and, for once, I feel like it may have some significant advantages with Windows 10 Cloud and a new Surface. The recent announcement that it will align the servicing models for Windows 10, Office 365 ProPlus, and System Center Configuration Manager also likely plays a part in this plan. Windows 10 Redstone 3: Everything we know so far Microsoft's hardware partners are likely to pick up the slack and deliver even lower cost hardware to run Windows 10 Cloud in the coming months in preparation for fall 2017. All of that combined with Apple's declining popularity in schools is a perfect opportunity for Redmond. As such, Microsoft's May 2 event could be the start of a significant push for the company — one that will have a lasting effect on a new generation.

But do I believe it?</p> <p>* To succeed, I assume MS also aims at non-English speaking countries.<br /> * Does MS aim at primarl school only, or also at colleges/universities?</p> <p>MS faces some challenges..</p> <p>1. Living in Europe with a non-English mother language/keyboard, I still have chosen English as UI language in Windows 10. Why?<br /> * Why even ask? It is my own choice! Nevertheless...<br /> * Easier to google/bing for help to solve problems, and I recognize the names of settings, etc. in English<br /> * I use programs/applications with English-only UI, and it is easier when there is consistency across applications and Windows<br /> * I teach for international students (EU exchange students, students from Africa, Asia, Latin America, etc.) both at home and abroad. I need these students to understand settings in Excel, etc.</p> <p>2. Windows Cloud, based on UWP apps in my teaching? Not possible for now!<br /> * Windows 10 currently installs UWP apps on my computer where the UI language is either based on the region, my physical internet address, or the keyboard. In other words: using my national language.<br /> * This means that the installed apps use a different UI language than Windows. My students don&#39;t understand the UI language of my apps (e.g., OneNote)!<br /> * Most likely, the international students will face the same problem as I do -- at least if their computer is bought locally (with our national keyboard). This doesn&#39;t cut it.</p> <p>3. Other language &quot;challenges&quot;...<br /> * Several UWP apps choose spelling checker based on keyboard.&nbsp;<br /> * This is ok. in tablet mode, where I can use virtual keyboards on screen, and can easily switch keyboard by the flick of my finger.<br /> * This idea is absolutely horrendous when working with a physical keyboard!<br /> * And -- NO! The language auto detection doesn&#39;t work well. And I&#39;m tired to manually having to go through menus to change spelling checker language...<br /> * Yes, I can handle more than one language. I do write in my mother tongue. I do write in English. I sometimes write in German. I sometimes write in Spanish. And I do not change physical keyboard -- it is not possible (except for, e.g., Surface Pro, but I don&#39;t want to lug around a stack of TypeCovers...)</p> <p>4. And then there is Excel...<br /> * Yes, the situation *is* improving. A few years ago, Windows installed MS Office in my national language irrespective of the Windows UI language.&nbsp;<br /> * When the language problem with Office was fixed so that I got English UI language in Office, Excel *still* insisted on installing plug-ins (e.g., Solver) with my national language as UI... OK, that has been fixed (I hope...).<br /> * Current problem: tomorrow, I will give a class in Spain using Excel. I *hope* I can use my own laptop with English as UI language (I&#39;m not that fluent in Spanish). And I&#39;ll demonstrate some calculations using Excel.<br /> * Big problem: the function for random number generation (rand) has a different name in Spanish (aleatorio, or something). Programming constructs have different names, e.g., &quot;if&quot; is not denoted &quot;if&quot; in the Spanish version of Excel.<br /> * OK -- I can live with this, as long as I don&#39;t have to use a local computer -- and as long as the students can figure out what these constructs are called, but this is really, really bad when teaching.<br /> * OK -- can I make my Excel programs/sheets available to the students? In other words, do my sheets written for the English UI version of Excel work when opened in a Spanish language version? Are commands such as &quot;aleatorio&quot; automatically translated to &quot;rand&quot;? Maybe, but I do not feel confident...</p> 0 22 hours ago Reply Sin Ogaris I wouldn't exactly say this is the right time, pc's and tablets are already well and truly engraved in the education sector. 0 1 day ago Reply Michael Alan Goff So, serious question, has Microsoft cleared the gap in maintenance/management between Windows and Chrome OS? 0 1 day ago Reply Nect removed 0 1 day ago Reply bleached This article doesn't mention exactly where schools are saving money with Chromebooks. I don't think it is cost of the hardware. It is likely cost of supporting and managing Windows machines. There are plenty of low cost Windows machine as available today, but they are not easy for a school with limited resources to deploy. Microsoft needs to further simplify Windows and match the services available on Chromebooks. We will hear how Microsoft will handle this, but it seems they are being short sighted. 1 1 day ago Reply r4incs So MS is playing catch-up once again? It turned out really well last time (looks at Windows Phone/Mobile). 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 As importantly, the tablet market where windows on arm is targeted, is a sector where only windows and budget are growing amonst consumers. By making a budget hybrid, perhaps something like the transformer book, windows can be positioned in BOTH of the growth sectors of tablets, when both samsung and apple have been slipping for four years. a serious foothold in tablets will drive UWP development, as will any substantial sales of a cloudbook. Re-positioning Windows to re-enter the fray for pocket cellular devices.  So this year, I expect not simple a surface pro, but a budget model. I'm hoping with a transformer book design, so it can be also more laptop like. And without the ridiculous screen sizes - perhaps a happy 10.1 inches, or even apple like 9.7. I expect this is why the rumours on surface suggest both arm, and intel - it'll be both.  Basically its the whole budget thing that is MS's entire pathway back to market dominance, in particular larger touchscreen devices. And that's also the point of difference for a cloud book - its touch enabled, its stylus enabled (as you say, a rotatable design would suit education best). If windows can make gains on bigger screen touch devices, that breathes life into UWP. And you can see the push for UWP in all of MS's recent moves - the option to lock windows down to store only, the cloud device, and the cheaper arm devices. THIS is how they are tackling the app gap - by fighting in an area where they have strenth - bigger screens.   0 1 day ago Reply Aden Rossinni I've heard of many schools here in Australia wanting to drop the Chromebooks because they either didn't realise that they couldn't do **** or realised later in using them. They are just gimmicks, and have already been swapped for Surface Pros in some places, so what MS is doing is perfect in this situation. 3 2 days ago Reply yac man please quote your sources ( otherwise untrue / did not happen / fake news ).   0 2 days ago Reply Drael646464 sd 0 1 day ago Reply vEEP pEEP Get'em while they are young...

Who knows how close MS is to achieving those targets? Incidentally, my 2-years-old Chromebook Flip cold boots in 7 seconds. So Chromebook numbers are a little skewed to lower the bar for MS. It's interesting though that MS is trying to re-invent the Chromebook, only it will cost more, be less secure, and be restricted to a much smaller and lower quality application pool. 1 2 days ago Reply Drael646464 Cost more? Why would it cost more? It's using the same chipsets, the same type of hardware, and likely a free license.  Personally I wouldn't say that's better app quality, when the app pool (android apps) isn't even designed for the FF, and they are more geared to social networking and bus stop games than education. Chrome apps themselves number a paltry 10,000. Admitedly for the education sector, windows might have a small catch up, but its not exactly huge, nor are education apps demanding functionality. For the most part people use web browsers, and word processors.  The whole point of difference for Windows could is - its touch enabled, its ink and stylus enabled and its fully upgradable to full windows. Which makes chromebook seem kind of sad by comparison IMO, as an educational tool.  0 1 day ago Reply Aden Rossinni Yes, but they don't do much so ... 0 2 days ago Reply ProfessorMudguts You'd think for $3000, the Surface Book would teach Panos' son how to hold a pen correctly :-D 0 2 days ago Reply El Mac Funny.

Ah, ok 👌, I see how that makes sense. 0 2 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer There's 1 MAJOR advantage Chromebooks have in the Educational market that Windows 10 currently has nothing to match; NEVER need to reboot to update the OS. Chromebooks merely being the Chrome web browser on Windows means that to install security patches/updates, all that has to happen is the user closes the browser and the security updates are installed automatically without requiring ANY reboot. That is automatically and seamlessly done whenever a user logs out the system, and if a security patch didn't get the time to install prior to the chromebook going to sleep, that's easily and quickly done on next resume from sleep. So, literally 0 need for reboot to stay secure, literally 0 need for IT department keeping tabs on them for security reasons. Compare that to Windows 10 where when you wake it up from sleep, you'll be getting that stupid "Updating Windows, don't turn off your computer" message for several minutes, especailly when they've not been updated in a while due to them not being used in a classroom. Imagine getting that when you're about to write an online Exam (which is the only place where Chromebooks were used on my Campus, everything else is Windows). Unless an IT department is being paid to keep those Windows 10 Cloud Laptops up to date, or those Laptops never turn off (in which case they can do the restart when the user logs off and thinks they've put the Laptop to sleep), Windows 10 Cloud won't be able to remain secure, making them a security threat to the Campus. 0 2 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino Microsoft's policy is to not require a reboot for an update more than once every 4 weeks. I really don't see that as a big deal these days. Additionally, the Unified Update Platform (UUP) goes a long way to helping with this as well. 1 2 days ago Reply MrElectrifyer It's not much of a concern as a consumer, 'cause I'm only dealing with 1 PC (a Surface Pro 2 in my case), and I can easily take a moment to configure Windows Updates to match my workflow for the rest of my use of the Windows PC. No problem with that. In the case of a school campus, where there's 1000s of them - all of which don't get used for months until an Exam is coming up - it becomes a big concern in terms of both time and security. You'll need to pay an IT department to mange each and every one of those Windows Laptops/Convertibles, 'cause unlike Windows Desktops, they're not connected to a LAN 24/7, and thus can't be updated remotely. If you don't pay an IT department to do that, you risk having significant delays or interuptions when the Laptops are needed; during an online Exam. That's the major advantage Chromebooks have; savings in both IT department costs and time. With Chromebooks, any Teacher (regadless of background) could just grab a Laptop cart (contains about 50 Chomebooks I think) from some IT room (where the cart was plugged in charging the Laptops) at anytime of the year, bring it to the classroom, students simply unplug 1 of them and take to their desk, log-in, and can begin the exam (no waiting for any updates). Once they're done, they sign out, take the Laptop back to the cart and just plug in its power cable. To get the same with most of todays Windows Laptops, you'll need to be fussing with both power and ethernet cables for each and every one of those Laptops in some specialized cart, so that when in the IT room, they can be connected to the LAN and kept up to date remotely when not in use for months. That adds more room for human error, unless the campus pays some premium to get a custom Windows Laptop and Laptop cart that can get both power and ethernet over 1 connection. On top of that, would still need to pay an IT department to be keeping tabs on them remotely. None of which is a concern with Chromebooks.

Let me give you an example, you think this Cloud OS is a good idea, but basically its RT2.0.... fair enough, that is what you think.   But in the real world, in my experience at the enterprise level.... businesses have or want to strip not the Win32 stuff out but the UWP/Store from Windows 10.   So, I work with a medium size company that wants to deploy Win10 from Win7 which is virtualized and users use citrix.   Now do you want to know what those builds look like now in testing.... everything you write about in these articles are being stripped out... whether its the Store app, OneDrive, UWP, tablet mode, etc.   Windows without Win32 and open is kind of like Kate Upton without the rack, what's the point?   Windows with UWP might as well be a Chromebook, either way I doubt the consumer is going to come back in mass. What MS is doing is throwing a bunch a mud at the wall hoping the consumer is coming back, the problem is.... reality is much different.    0 2 days ago Reply CMDR_Shepard I work for a company that is considered medium (almost 500+ people) and we are moving to Windows 10 Enterprise at a fast pace.

So let's establish something, schools are enterprise.  You try managing thousands of these devices in the hands of children, it is a nightmare.  Apple's management utilities left a lot to be desired whereas Google knocked it out of the park with Chromebooks.  Chromebooks have significant advantages over Windows, OS X and iOS in the eyes of school IT decision makers: They are ridiculously inexpensive per unit.  You can buy 2 chromebooks for the cost of 1 iPad or PC. Hardware support warranties are inexpensive per unit. Management is all in Google's cloud and it is incredibly easy to maintain, control, distribute apps, secure and lock down these machines.  It is also low to almost no cost for the Chromebook management tools.  Most schools decided to focus their engineering time on faculty/staff machines that require more advanced workflows. Chromebooks are 100% integrated with Google Apps.  Google Apps is/was far more aligned with consumer needs and experiences than Office 365, so lots of people gravitate towards it because it feels less intimidating to them.   Lightweight, great battery life and are very reliable for teachers that have crafted their lesson plans around this piece of technology.  Consumers today expect more intuitive software and design that to them feels more natural.  What they get at work or school is just frustration, because they cannot reconcile the duality that this iPad at home works great, why can't my IT staff make it work this great here.  Chromebooks never had that problem, they are the same natural, simple experience both at home and at work or school. The consumerisation of IT is real, expectations have changed dramatically and has made the job of IT administrators harder everywhere. I see this new Microsoft device as the start of the great iPad and Chromebook purge, IF they can get the management right and work on their consumer experiences. Intune, Azure AD, Windows 10 and Office 365 together looks to be a winning combination for IT decision makers that is evolving every day.  I have already began moving in that direction at my school, it remains to be seen if other school IT decision makers will follow suit. 5 2 days ago Reply Tunde Fajimi Great insights jblank46!

But the numbers, to me, show that Microsoft's strategy of "US only" or "US first" is as wrong as it gets. Yes, the growth of ChromeOS in the USA may be worrisome to Redmond BUT the USA is just ONE country in 196. In 195 countries, Chromebooks are absolutely irrelevant. Now you may say "well, that's why they should focus on the US". But that's, to me, the wrong strategy. They hold a large margin worldwide but if they continue to treat the US as special and focusing all their offerings and services only on the US, all that Google or any other competitor needs to do is to open those same types of services to people in the other 195 countries. We can take a couple of examples from history: - Microsoft has always treated Europe as a second-rate (or third, or fourth) market for the Xbox (and most other things, really). As a result, Sony's PlayStation rules in Europe with over 70% marketshare (in some countries over 90%). They've sold over 22 million consoles in Europe. Xbox? Less than 8 million. - Nokia's Eflop years saw the company leave their European/Asian focus and move it to the US. Because "Europe was guaranteed". As a result, sales in Europe continuously declined without the US market growth making up for it. - Sony's Xperia phones, at the same time, saw great growth in the European market because Sony made an effort instead of bothering with focusing in just one country (the US). When Sony decided to change that - around the time of the Xperia Z4 - and start trying to focus in the US market alone, sales of Xperia devices started to come down.   So whilst it's important that Microsoft shows aggressiveness in the US market to combat the Chromebook infestation that has installed itself on Uncle Sam's lands, it will be a major flaw if they limit the efforts to the USA. In Europe and other Western or Westernised markets, if Microsoft doesn't make an effort to show some parity of treatment with the US, they risk Google or someone else to come along and show that parity. And then they'll not only risk not gaining back anything in the US, they'll be losing market in those other countries. It's also worth noting that the educational system in Europe and Western markets is far better than the American and more likely to adopt new technologies to tackle on new educational challenges. Microsoft simply can't let that pass and not take the chance. 13 2 days ago Reply Azizelh Simple... The focus on the US is not because of the US. It's because schools here offer items to their students and are ready to pay some money for that. None of the schools I personally know in France for example offer them to students. They have some in dedicated rooms and the libraries, but none in class. Pretty sure it's the same or close in other countries. Reason is schools and tuitions are too cheap in most European countries to allow for these expenses. Most of the time of course. Im sure some school can offer them, just MUCH less than US. 3 2 days ago Reply Hoekie Over here we do. So that can't be the reason. Also deals for pure personal use. It's the US being cheap. We, rich Europe, can have proper laptops/2in1 devices. Chromebooks are for poor students/schools really. 0 2 days ago Reply GraniteStateColin It would be interesting to see the whole world including US. From the graphs above, there's not enough information to know. If what you said is right, @Azizelh, then you would expect global figures to track much more based on the US figures, simply because the US budget would dominate. On the other hand, if the total global numbers appeared similar to the "rest of the world" half of the graph, then @DJCBS would be right. 0 2 days ago Reply toph36 "Windows 10 S"?  That would be just as confusing as Windows RT.  I hope they keep Cloud in the name, even though that is not exactly what this is.  Although "Cloud" is more of a concept, so it does make sense to use here. 2 2 days ago Reply Azizelh To be honest, we thought Edge was a bad name for the browser, specially compared to Spartan.

I think this is the intent of being locked to teh store. As I recall enterprises, or schools, are allowed to curate their own store apps. 0 2 days ago Reply SuperMarioPlayer The problem with the proposed name "Windows 10 Secure" is that Microsoft already claims that Windows 10 is the most secure version of Windows to date (which it probably is.)

Chromebooks require almost no support. They basically just need WiFi and an account created for each student. Windows historically isn't anywhere near as easy to manage and requires dedicated IT support. When students log into a Chromebook it automatically has all their settings and files available, no matter what machine they are on. It is really simple and each user has their own separate experience. Windows is getting better here, but it still takes some time when you first log in and Microsoft's services (especially Edge) just aren't really designed for this style of cloud computing. I think this is where Microsoft really needs to improve. Logging in with your Microsoft ID should quickly give you the same experience on any device without having any setup required to use their services. Chromebooks accel here. There are certainly tasks that are tougher to complete on a Chromebook. Computer programming, video editing, CAD, etc. just aren't great experiences. These types of niche classes require niche hardware and services. For the vast majority of tasks required of students, mainly document creation and research, Chromebooks are more than enough. 3 2 days ago Reply HackAtak WOW, "They basically just need WiFi and an account created for each student. Windows historically isn't anywhere near as easy to manage and requires dedicated IT support."   What you meant to say is to fully utilize a Chromebook, Wi-Fi/Internet is REQUIRED otherwise its a paperweight!   All too many on here tout the chromebook as good for the student which is CRAP, its cheap and easy for the school to cut corners and further indoctrinate the youth toward a product that has absolutly NO PLACE in the business world or upper education for that matter.  I for one hope MS knocks their introduction out of the park and boot these CRAPbooks to the curb!  I do business with many schools and they all agree, they went with the chromebooks because they were cheap and about the only alternative to textbooks, but they now see the issues with FREE and Google and how they control, track and monitor activities of chromebook users and collect that data so they can use it to sell to companies for marketing purposes.  Google Drive and Gmail, there aren't any bigger security issues in the world than thats two repositories for the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.  To better prepare students for the work place, using a chromebook and google docs is doing them a disservice...PERIOD!   0 1 day ago Reply bleached Schools have so much to hide from the CIA, FBI, etc. Do you hear what you are saying!

At least until there is evidence of benefit. 0 1 day ago Reply Curtis Quick You're kidding right? I guess you never thought that a student could take notes with a pen. It is so much easier to handwrite notes and the ability to add diagrams and drawings is phenominal! A Windows 2-1 device and OneNote will draw circles around a Chromebook any day. Chromebook is last century in comparison. Teachers can share their lecture notes with students. Students can share notes with oneanother - all without ever needing to use a keyboard! Every subject benefits from easy pen input. Science, Math, History, Art. Everywhere you have more than just words a pen is a great idea. Try drawing a diagram for physics with a keyboard. Or doing math problems. Or Art. You will quickly understand what I mean. Modern versions of Windows on 2-in-1 devices are exactly what students need in the classroom. They provide almost every conceivable manner of input that a student might need and they do it well. The only thing Chromebooks had going for it was cost, setup and a strong ABM (anything but Microsoft) attitude. Modern Windows 2-in-1 devices can do both and so much more. Schools were burned by iPads, and when they see how much more they can do with Windows 2-in-1 devices than Chromebooks it will be like the iPad all over again. 3 1 day ago Reply ozaz I didn't ask what the idea behind it is. I asked if there is any evidence that it actually benefits learning. The idea is obvious but just because something sounds appealing in theory does not mean it is actually beneficial in practice. If there have been any convincing studies that show learning is enhanced by student use of a stylus equipped computing device (compared to just traditional pen and notebook for notetaking) please link me to them.  If they don't yet exist, I would question the wisdom of schools investmenting in stylus-equipped devices for students just because they sound good in theory. Stylus-equipped devices for teachers is a different issue, and would presumably make much less of a contribution to overall expenditure anyway. 1 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 It allows you to take your own notes, adding notes to web pages, documents, etc. If notation and note taking is considered useful, which of course it is, then ink is useful.

We are talking sort of 20 bucks here.  2 1 day ago Reply ozaz $20 to the manufacturer, but what about the added cost to the schools, factoring in inevitable regular loss and damage to styluses? Surely more than the cost of pen and paper. Hence my question above as to whether there is evidence it provides added learning benefit over notetaking via pen and paper. 0 1 day ago Reply Drael646464 Schools spend quite a bit of money on printing, so I think that pretty much neutralises out. It's basically its people making notes on digital stuff, rather than paper. So on the website, or document, or map, rather than printing it out and doing the same. So its basically more accessible digitally. You get some great digital art programs on windows too, which offers a new subject currently not given much focus, but of high commercial importance - digital media.  I doubt anyones done any studies on this though.    0 3 hours ago Reply Drael646464 Well, windows cloud, I imagine a free license product running on the cheaper ARM chipsets, will be basically the same cost as a chromebook.

The device was developed with input from the community, and funded through an Indiegogo campaign in November, which reached its target in just one hour. Originally aiming for $75,000, the company has since raised over $1.4 million. Previously referred to by its development codename 'Pyramid Flipper', the device will launch as the Eve V, featuring a range of desirable specs and features. The Indiegogo campaign originally estimated that shipments would begin in February, but that schedule has clearly slipped. However, the company said that it will begin its "first pilot production run at the actual factory floor on 25th of April" to ensure that its production process runs smoothly, before ramping up for larger-scale assembly. Eve explained that "this stage will take us around 10 days and then assembly of the remaining units will take 2-3 days more after which they will be immediately shipped", adding: We will start production of second batch of units immediately after first batch is produced. Second batch production is as before planned to be done in 30 days. We are considering splitting up production runs for the 2nd batch so like producing 500 devices first and shipping them 2 weeks after the first batch, making 500 more and shipping them few days later and so on before all 2000 devices are produced. This would help us to ship part of the limited birds faster than in 30 days! The exact timeline of the second batch will become clear after the first batch is produced. Eve also said that "each screen will be calibrated individually" in partnership with US firm Portrait Displays, "to make sure each and every V leaving [the] factory floor will follow our color calibration requirements." The Eve V is similar in concept to Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, with a tablet form factor and retractable kickstand, along with a detachable keyboard. But the Eve device offers some even more attractive features than the Surface, including a wireless mode for the keyboard, so that it can be used without being directly connected to the tablet; USB 3.1 Type-C ports; and Intel's latest 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) processors. Here's an overview of the Eve V's key specs: 12.3-inch IGZO LCD with 2736x1824px resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 7th-generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core m3, i5 or i7 processor 8GB or 16GB LPDDR3 RAM 128GB, 256GB or 512GB SSD storage 2MP front-facing camera 5MP rear camera 802.11ac Wi-Fi with 2x2 MU-MIMO Bluetooth 4.2 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3 support 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C port (Gen1) 2 x USB 3.1 Type-A port 3.5mm audio port microSDXC card reader 2 x noise-cancelling microphones 4 x 1W speakers Fingerprint sensor, hall sensor, gravity sensor, light sensor, gyroscope GPS N-trig stylus (Surface-compatible) with two buttons, and 1024 pressure levels Keyboard with Pogo-pin connectors and wireless connectivity; backlight; glass Clickpad by Synaptics Up to 15 hours of battery life 'Early bird' pricing for the Eve V has now ended, so full pricing will apply for future sales. You can find details of the cost and configurations for each model here. The company's CEO, Konstantinos Karatsevidis, referred to the Eve V, with tongue-in-cheek, as a 'Surface-killer' in an interview with Neowin last year. Microsoft is likely to launch its new Surface Pro 5 in the next few weeks, but the device is not expected to differ significantly from its predecessor, featuring a similar design to the Pro 4, along with new Kaby Lake processors.

(Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG) By Jason Henry | Press-Enterprise PUBLISHED: April 22, 2017 at 8:21 pm | UPDATED: April 22, 2017 at 10:09 pm Fans at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival this weekend were able to arrive in style in the newest electric BMW, grab a Heineken, and then party at special venues set up by American Express and HP. Those lucky — and wealthy — enough could do so in an outfit from H&M’s Coachella collection and end their night in an air-conditioned safari tent designed by Marriott.

(Photo by Kevin Sullivan, Orange County Register/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand Coachella, once an indie darling, used to bury sponsors on its website, but this year, the festival’s corporate partners all have an experience to sell and a logo to slap on it. Some offered ways to interact with their brands without an obvious sales pitch, while others used the three-day festival to promote new products and special offers. The experiences offered in 2017 included drone shows, a psychedelic journey through space, a makeup counter and an opportunity to get a selfie in fake snow. Studies have found millennials — the demographic buying up tickets to the sold-out festival — are more prone to FOMO, or the “fear of missing out,” making them more likely to form connections to brands that allow them to share unique interactions with their envious friends at home. Ticket seller Eventbrite found that more than 78 percent of millennials would rather spend their money on events than on products and more than 77 percent tied their “best memories” to a live experience in a 2014 nationwide survey of more than 2,000 adults. “We’re living in an era where a lot of people are paying for an experience,” said Jeff Fromm, a partner at the Kansas City, Missouri-based ad agency Barkley and author of “Marketing to Millennials.” “And brands are looking to integrate with those people who have discretionary money.” It’s not necessarily a bad thing either, Fromm said, as long as the sponsorship doesn’t take away from Coachella’s charm. Guests at Coachella seemed to agree, with some of the sponsored “experiences” this year getting praise from the people who paid at least $399 per ticket. Coachella is a “bucket list experience” and consumers looking to check it off the list aren’t likely to be deterred by sponsorships, overt or otherwise, Fromm said. Netflix, Heineken and H&M all showed up at Coachella. Netflix offered free WiFi to promote its new series “Girlboss;” Heineken, a longtime sponsor, brought in surprise guests; and H&M as it has in recent years sponsored a fashion line in the spirit of the music festival. Computer company HP Inc. had one of the largest presences at Coachella this year, but fans seemed to view most of their offerings favorably. HP hosted a lounge with virtual reality, a light show controlled by fans using the latest HP computers, and a machine to create custom bandannas. Along with Intel, the tech company also backed a synchronized drone performance with hundreds of the aerial robots that circulated on social media as one of the better moments of Coachella’s first weekend. The Antarctic, a massive dome sponsored by Intel and HP near Coachella’s main entrances, similarly drew praise. The 15-minute show gave fans a chance to relax in beanbag chairs in the air-conditioned dome while watching a trippy 360-degree video that first starts in the desert and then flies through space, time and the human brain. HP partnered with visual artists Android Jones and Eric Pare to create the immersive installation, according to the company. “They’re not really in your face trying to sell you stuff,”  said Amy Kirkpatrick, of Irvine, as she exited the dome with Mitch Franco, of Santa Ana. “We’re not running out to buy HP printers or computers or anything.” Kirkpatrick said they had not noticed the HP logo until the very end and weren’t aware of the other companies’ booths throughout the polo field, many of which were tucked away from the main stages. Marriott and American Express were among those offering special tents for members of their rewards’ programs and the general public. American Express created a lounge for fans to create mini-music videos at Coachella, and outside the venue they offered an exclusive party for Platinum cardholders in Palm Springs. At Marriott, guests could pose for pictures on four stages set up to look like locales around the world, from the beach to an arctic tundra complete with fake snow for snow angels. Rewards members got access to a VIP area with unique food and drink vendors and a chance to bid on eight safari tents themed after Marriott’s various hotel chains. Actress Vanessa Hudgens tweeted out a picture in front of one of the tents during the first weekend as part of a brand partnership with Le Meridien Hotels, one of Marriott’s chains. Fromm said arrangements like the one with Hudgens are helping to reach younger generations. “Millennials are less likely to accept company points of view than prior generations and more likely to accept non-traditional forms of communications,” he said. Some of the experiences were only for the festival’s most wealthy clientele. VIPs could get rides to the event in a Coachella-themed BMWi, worth $142,000, and the company set up displays within the VIP areas as part of its #roadtocoachella campaign. The walls of the tent were papered in photos of BMWs near the wind farms that are the gateway to the Coachella Valley. The special tent had couches for lounging, phone-charging lockers and a display that showed promotional videos created for Coachella, including one with Sunday night performer and film composer Hans Zimmer. However, you couldn’t test drive a car on-site, unlike the Stagecoach Country Music Festival, which allows people to test out Toyota trucks on an off-road course. Eight-year Coachella veteran Andy Zepeda said he’s noticed the amount of corporations visible at Coachella increase every year, but it hasn’t reached a level where it bothers him, yet. “As long as it is giving me something new to experience, I don’t really mind it as long as it not getting in my way,” he said. The sponsors this year offered either experiences that gave him more to do, or they offered free merchandise, like bandannas, he noted. Fromm, the marketing expert, said Coachella fans should get used to the sponsorships, which help Goldenvoice, the promoter, expand the festival without increasing ticket prices or cutting into their revenues. In exchange for their support, the brands get a captive audience, he added. “I’m not surprised to see more of these events, and brands are looking for the opportunity to engage with consumers,” Fromm said. “It’s not going to get smaller; it’s going to get bigger.” More stories, photos from Coachella 2017: Photos: See all of the Coachella vibes from Weekend 2 What happened on Friday, Weekend 2 Coachella 2017: This is the cool, weird stuff you can buy in the festival’s Vintage Market See a couple’s Coachella proposal Radiohead conquers Coachella’s second weekend Photos of Radiohead from Weekend 2 Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 2 Meet the young kids rocking out at the festival How ‘Amnesty Boxes’ keep drugs out and festivalgoers safe Live updates from Weekend 2 17 things to know about opening weekend Photos: What it actually looks like to be at Coachella’s opening weekend Here’s how the first Friday at Coachella went down Photos of the bands and their fans on Friday, Weekend 1 Who wore it best (or worst)?

Robots – What’s inside is valuable and important Posted on April 24, 2017April 21, 2017 by GS Early Views: 1 0 Shares There’s a lot of talk about the coming disruption of the Robot Age. But the thing is, robots are here. They’ve been here for a while now, even though most of us don’t see them on a day to day basis. Finding them may be easier than just looking at an auto production line, which is the standard media example of robotics in action. However, that’s the standard because automation is at the heart of robotics, so a “robot” might not be a machine that looks somewhat human. It may be a complicated machine that can replace what humans have been doing. For example, I recently wrote a couple articles on the transition of dangerous manual labor in the oil and coal industries. Basically, automation is taking over the jobs that used to be the domain of brave workers risking life and limb in a mine or on a rig. For the companies, they now have invested in technologies rather than personnel and those technologies operate rain or shine, with no attitudes and no sick days. These new technologies are essentially robots. Amazon.com’s warehouses are also full of robots doing a complex dance among all the products filling orders and getting them to our door within a day or two after placing the order. The military has been using umanned vehicles in the air, land and sea for more than a decade now. And these machines are getting to the point where they are becoming fully autonomous, able to change course or altitude depending upon the conditions they encounter. So, yes it’s the Robot Age. But underneath the robotics is what’s most important — the brain. How these robots carry out their duties is far more important than what they do, in the end. The brains of these machines are what make them valuable and important. Many years ago, I was talking to a friend about the growing demand in the U.S. military for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). I was looking at iRobot, a company that is better known for its household robotic vacuums, pool cleaners and gutter cleaners. It had begun building UGVs and I thought this would be an interesting play on the sector since it a focused player. A colleague of mine then told me his father, a physics professor at a major university, knew one of the founders. And then he said, “The thing that really makes these unique isn’t their build but their programming.” That was my “Aha!” moment. How to program these robots to figure things out on the fly was what set them apart. And that hasn’t changed. What has changed however, is that processing power has increased significantly so these machines can now process much more information, much more quickly. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. Building a self-aware machine has long been a theme of science fiction. But now it’s much closer to science fact. Computers can now read, talk, play games, give directions (and adapt those directions if you miss your turn) and recognize people by their voices. I got a Google Assistant for Christmas. I usually use it as a timer, or to check the weather or settle some disputed trivia among family members. But it has other more complex tools as well. I can ask it what my day looks like and it will assimilate information from a number of different places to tell me about the weather, my schedule, traffic, curated news, etc. And now, Google has just upgraded the Assistant’s brain to recognize different voices and match them to separate accounts. Nowadays that doesn’t sound too earth shattering… but given this is a $100 device, that kind of technology is pretty stunning. AI is what is powering the Robot Age. It behind driverless cars and the Internet of Things (IoT). IBM is using its AI, Watson to do taxes for H&R Block customers. It’s not coming, it’s here. How to play AI Your best choices for getting a toe — or foot — into this water is to stick with the big players that are making it happen at the fundamental levels. For example, Intel missed the big move to mobile, but it’s redoubled its efforts in AI and the Internet of Things. It has the advantage of being able to deploy huge amounts of chips that are reliable and state of the art. Smaller players may have more interesting designs or abilities but they can’t scale up as reliably, so they will have trouble finding enough customers to grow. No doubt some will succeed, but Intel won’t be left begging. And it’s already making a very successful transition out of the desktop and traditional server markets and into the new sectors. On the implementation side, look to Amazon. It has its hands in just about everything at this point, but automation is at the foundation of its business. AI is going to be a key factor in taking this efficiency to the next level. And if you’re still looking for a smaller company that may have some leverage growth, look at iRobot or AeroVironment. Both have been pioneers of the Robot Age and have deep and loyal roots on the military and homeland security side of things. As border security becomes a bigger issue these firms will be winners.

Corporate America is set to unleash its biggest profit-reporting feast in at least a decade next week, with more than 190 members of the S&P 500 index  delivering quarterly scorecards, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data. The lineup accounts for around 40 per cent of the benchmark index’s value, or more than $7.7 trillion, and includes big names like Google’s parent Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp. The onslaught could keep US stock investors’ focus largely on earnings next week even as the world’s attention is likely to be drawn elsewhere. “That would be our hope,” said Joe Zidle, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors in New York. “A lot of people looked at this market and said it was the result of the Trump bump or the Hillary relief rally,” while earnings have been rebounding, he said. “The faster earnings growth is under-appreciated by investors.” Many strategists have attributed the 10 per cent rally in the S&P 500 since Donald Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in the November 8 US presidential election to optimism Trump would boost the domestic economy through tax cuts and an infrastructure spending binge. The gains drove market valuations recently to their highest since 2004, even with little progress in Washington on the fiscal policy front. Meanwhile, other anxiety-provoking events have grabbed headlines, including unsettling relations with North Korea and this weekend’s election in France, which has a bearing on the country’s membership in the European Union and its currency, the euro. Upbeat earnings from Morgan Stanley and other banks so far this reporting period cushioned those geopolitical worries, helping push the S&P 500 up 0.9 per cent this week, its best such performance in two months. Shares of smaller companies did even better, with S&P’s benchmark indexes for small  and mid-cap stocks notching their best weeks of 2017, with gains of between 2 per cent and 3 per cent. Expectations for the quarter’s profit growth have risen as well, and the first three months of the year now appear set to mark the strongest quarterly earnings growth in more than five years. In the last week alone, expected S&P 500 first-quarter earnings per share growth rose to 11.2 per cent from 10.4 per cent, a more than 7 per cent jump, according to Thomson Reuters data. “This week definitely has proven that the Street likes earnings — it’s controllable, it’s US,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. The reason for the slew of reports next week is anyone’s guess, Silverblatt said, although recent holidays possibly played a role. Passover, Good Friday and Easter all fell in the previous weeks, which may have prompted some companies that typically report earlier to delay a week. Just 76 companies reported this week compared with 134 in the comparable week a year ago, Silverblatt said. Next week’s rush will represent a 15 per cent increase from the 166 S&P constituents that reported in the comparable week last year. Thursday will be the busiest day with nearly 70 reports due, including updates after the closing bell from Alphabet, Amazon, Intel Corp, Microsoft and Starbucks Corp. That could make for a bang in the market on Friday, Silverblatt said, which is also the final trading day of April. US STOCKS: US stocks dipped on Friday as investors were cautious ahead of the first round of the closely contested French presidential election, but the S&P 500 managed to notch its first weekly gain in three. The first round of France’s presidential election may be too close to call when polls close on Sunday because initial projections will not be available as early as in the past, pollsters and their watchdog said. Most polls see centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen qualifying on Sunday for a May 7 runoff, but conservative Francois Fillon and leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon are not far behind and within the margin of error. “Nobody is taking anything for granted after the big swing and miss in Britain and the big swing and a miss here,” said Jack Ablin, Chief Investment Officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “I don’t think anyone wants to stick their neck out for this one.” US President Donald Trump said he would have a major tax reform announcement on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.95 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 20,547.76, the S&P 500 lost 7.15 points, or 0.30 per cent, to 2,348.69 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.26 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 5,910.52. The Dow rose 0.5 per cent, the S&P gained 0.8 per cent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.8 per cent in what was the first weekly gain for the top indexes over the last three weeks. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Trump’s ‘big announcement’ on tax to be broad principles China’s quota threat charges up electric car market → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Tough new penalties come into force from tomorrow Agreement for RO 265m Nakheel ITC project to be signed today Call for benefiting from tourism sector Bid to attract Russian tourists to Sultanate Read More ...

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | April 24, 2017 -- 03:08 GMT (20:08 PDT) | Topic: Mobility Lenovo Flex 11 Chromebook Lenovo has expanded its lineup of Chromebooks with the introduction of the Flex 11, a 2-in-1 laptop that may have a slightly higher price tag than competing models, but brings plenty of extras to justify the added cost. CNET Chromebooks compared: New and upcoming Chrome OS laptops Read More As with other Flex convertibles, this Chromebook version features a 360-degree hinged design that allows the 11.6-inch touchscreen display to switch easily from laptop mode to tent mode, watch mode, and tablet mode. The last mode makes the Flex 11 a natural to be the latest Chromebook to support the Google Play Store for Android apps. Like a growing number of Chromebooks, which often wind up in the hands of schoolchildren, the Flex 11 has been given some rugged features to deal with the potential abuse from youthful users. Lenovo says it can handle drops of up to 2.4 feet and roughly a cup of water can be spilled on it without damaging the keyboard. The keypad is sealed as an additional precaution to potential spills. The extras run out when it comes to other components, however. The Flex 11 runs on a 2.1GHz quad-core ARM processor rather than an Intel CPU and includes 4GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in storage. It does include a USB Type-C port and built-in 802.11 a/g/n/ac Wi-Fi among its connectivity options. With its hybrid design and extra durability, the Flex 11 can't join the sub-$200 Chromebooks at the bottom end of the market. However, its $279 price tag is still lower than most budget Windows laptops cost, especially convertibles. Lenovo says the Flex 11 Chromebook will be available this month, but it still shows as "coming soon" on the company's website.

Dreams of a password-less future are inching closer with Microsoft’s release of an app that facilitates sign-in to applications using the fingerprint scanner on your phone. It’s part of a growing reliance on biometrics and intelligent imaging that is also seeing growing use of selfies instead of passwords. Flashlight apps have long been popular conduits for malware, and Google pulled two apps that were substituting fake sign-in pages for Australian banks – including the CBA, NAB, and Westpac – when users attempted to launch the real thing. This is the sort of thing that’s hard to beat with user education, no matter how good the user-education tools you choose. The problem is particularly compounded with surveys suggesting that the majority of users are willing to share sensitive information. With ransomware now available on the black market for $US175 ($A132), it’s a piddling effort for cybercriminals to start their own ransomware franchise. Also popular among cybercriminals are Skype, Jabber, and ICQ – as well as an old Stuxnet-related bug that has proven successful in hitting unpatched computers. As if the Internet of Things (IoT) security climate wasn’t already problematic enough, a new competitor to Mirai was proving even more adept at compromising home devices that continue to suffer security vulnerabilities like the flaws that allow Linksys routers to be compromised. A vigilante hacker is said to have built a worm to protect the IoT – but there’s little wonder that security is a big factor in Intel’s $US15b ($A20b) investment in the collision-avoidance space. Indeed, cybersecurity breaches are nearly ubiquitous these days as figures suggest 9 out of 10 Australian organisations suffered a breach or attempted breach last year. Australian startup Wangle believes this security climate has created ripe opportunities for a mobile-optimisation stack that has been bundled into a commercial VPN product that is the first of many expected tools from the company. Speaking of tools, a security researcher launched a utility that tests whether your computer has been infected with NSA spyware – even as Oracle released 299 security fixes in its latest update as it caught up with the leak of NSA hacks that included a Solaris exploit. Drupal fixed a critical access bypass vulnerability, while Google patched Chrome to address a phishing attack that transparently spoofed Apple.com by using internationalised domain names represented with non-Latin characters.

Investors will also parse the results of Sunday’s first round of voting in France's presidential election to gauge the stability of the European Union. "The election of either [far-right candidate Marine] Le Pen or [far-left candidate Jean-Luc] Melenchon would put Paris on a fast-track collision course with [EU officials in] Brussels," James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University in Britain, told Reuters. "The election of Marine Le Pen would make Brexit look trivial by comparison,” Shields noted. Le Pen wants France to drop the euro and return to the franc. The second round of voting in France between the two candidates who take the most votes this weekend is set for May 7. Most polls will close at 8pm local time on Sunday in France. Trump last Friday unexpectedly promised that a “big tax reform and tax reduction will be announced next Wednesday.” US Treasuries pared earlier gains on Friday, as a result. "The Treasury market is apparently far less convinced of the veracity of the political pledges this round," BMO strategists Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli wrote in research note, Bloomberg reported. The announcement will consist of "broad principles and priorities," an administration official, who asked not to be identified, said on Saturday, Reuters reported. Trump’s ability to conclude a tax deal has been hurt by the failed effort to agree with Congressional Republicans on revamping Obamacare. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 percent, while the the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 1.8 percent, bolstered by better-than-expected corporate earnings. Other US companies reporting their latest quarterly results in the coming days include Microsoft, Intel and Exxon Mobil. The latest economic data will arrive in the form of reports on the Chicago Fed national activity index and the Dallas Fed manufacturing survey, due today; the FHFA and S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller house price indices, new home sales, consumer confidence, and the Richmond manufacturing index, due Tuesday; durable goods orders, international trade in goods, weekly jobless claims, pending home sales index, and the Kansas City Fed manufacturing index, due Thursday; and GDP, employment cost index, Chicago PMI, as well as consumer sentiment, due Friday. US Federal Reserve officials scheduled to speak this week include Neel Kashkari today as well as Lael Brainard and Patrick Harker on Friday. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index retreated 0.6 percent last week. Charles Gave, founder of Hong-Kong based asset-allocation consultancy GaveKal Research, who predicted the win of Trump, now predicts a victory for Le Pen in the French presidential elections, Bloomberg reported. “Le Pen’s momentum is a slow-moving reaction against the men of Davos — as we have seen with Brexit and Trump — but markets don’t want to believe it,” Gave told Bloomberg ahead of the first round of voting. The latest eurozone data slated for release this week include reports on Germany's IFO business climate, due today; Germany's GfK consumer confidence and consumer price index, and euro-zone economic confidence, due Thursday; and German retail sales and import price index, as well as the euro-zone CPI, due Friday.

The EU agriculture commissioner said he expects Taoiseach Enda Kenny to step down very soon despite criticising his opponents for failing to recognise his “statesman” status.  Speaking on RTÉ Radio’s This Week programme weeks after the Dáil deal on Irish Water Mr Hogan defended the record of the utility which was set up while he was environment minister. When the company’s role in addressing poor water conditions in Co Roscommon, concerns that visitors to the web summit would be unable to take a shower, and claims that Intel would not expand its base here due to water quality were taken into account, he said he was “very proud of what Irish Water has achieved”. The interview came days after Mr Kenny told reporters in the Hague in the Netherlands he will make his departure intentions very clear once he is happy with the Brexit negotiations parameters.  Mr Hogan also said he expects the Taoiseach to leave very soon. He declined to confirm who he wants to replace Mr Kenny as “I didn’t see all the runners yet”, but said the Taoiseach will be remembered as someone who was a strong statesman for Ireland.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 24 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life.

Investors will also parse the results of Sunday’s first round of voting in France’s presidential election to gauge the stability of the European Union. “The election of either [far-right candidate Marine] Le Pen or [far-left candidate Jean-Luc] Melenchon would put Paris on a fast-track collision course with [EU officials in] Brussels,” James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University in Britain, told Reuters. “The election of Marine Le Pen would make Brexit look trivial by comparison,” Shields noted. Le Pen wants France to drop the euro and return to the franc. The second round of voting in France between the two candidates who take the most votes this weekend is set for May 7. Most polls will close at 8pm local time on Sunday in France. Trump last Friday unexpectedly promised that a “big tax reform and tax reduction will be announced next Wednesday.” US Treasuries pared earlier gains on Friday, as a result. “The Treasury market is apparently far less convinced of the veracity of the political pledges this round,” BMO strategists Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli wrote in research note, Bloomberg reported. The announcement will consist of “broad principles and priorities,” an administration official, who asked not to be identified, said on Saturday, Reuters reported. Trump’s ability to conclude a tax deal has been hurt by the failed effort to agree with Congressional Republicans on revamping Obamacare. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 percent, while the the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 1.8 percent, bolstered by better-than-expected corporate earnings. Other US companies reporting their latest quarterly results in the coming days include Microsoft, Intel and Exxon Mobil. The latest economic data will arrive in the form of reports on the Chicago Fed national activity index and the Dallas Fed manufacturing survey, due today; the FHFA and S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller house price indices, new home sales, consumer confidence, and the Richmond manufacturing index, due Tuesday; durable goods orders, international trade in goods, weekly jobless claims, pending home sales index, and the Kansas City Fed manufacturing index, due Thursday; and GDP, employment cost index, Chicago PMI, as well as consumer sentiment, due Friday. US Federal Reserve officials scheduled to speak this week include Neel Kashkari today as well as Lael Brainard and Patrick Harker on Friday. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index retreated 0.6 percent last week. Charles Gave, founder of Hong-Kong based asset-allocation consultancy GaveKal Research, who predicted the win of Trump, now predicts a victory for Le Pen in the French presidential elections, Bloomberg reported. “Le Pen’s momentum is a slow-moving reaction against the men of Davos — as we have seen with Brexit and Trump — but markets don’t want to believe it,” Gave told Bloomberg ahead of the first round of voting. The latest eurozone data slated for release this week include reports on Germany’s IFO business climate, due today; Germany’s GfK consumer confidence and consumer price index, and euro-zone economic confidence, due Thursday; and German retail sales and import price index, as well as the euro-zone CPI, due Friday.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Jobs MSME careers: How to unshackle small enterprise growth in India MSME careers: How to unshackle small enterprise growth in India The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) employ more than 80 million people in India and contribute to around 40% of total exports and 37% of total GDP. Updated: April 24, 2017 4:07 AM Small enterprises in China, which due to their low product prices have worried Indian MSMEs, file 80% of intellectual property applications in China, as compared to a mere 15% by Indian small enterprises in India. (PTI) The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) employ more than 80 million people in India and contribute to around 40% of total exports and 37% of total GDP. Yet it is not easy for most of them to thrive owing to lack of funds, obsolete technology and poor production capacity. It is, therefore, not surprising that Indian small enterprises are unable to withstand global competition. Small enterprises are known to support the vitality of markets by complementing large-scale industries, provide a large number of low-cost jobs (especially for low- or medium-skilled workers), create wealth by contributing appropriately to the GDP, and go on to become large enterprises in the future. With India needing to do significantly better in all these areas, it is imperative to build competitiveness in this sector. Countries that have competitive small industries witness a high degree of innovation. For example, the US has had 50% of all innovations and 94% of all radical innovations—since the Second World War—coming from new and small firms. The number of patent applications, another indicator for innovation, validates this theory further. Small enterprises in China, which due to their low product prices have worried Indian MSMEs, file 80% of intellectual property applications in China, as compared to a mere 15% by Indian small enterprises in India. You May Also Want To Watch: Studies reveal that small enterprises which achieve better innovation performance also achieve better economic performance in the form of higher growth in sales turnover. The Global Innovation Index (GII) placed India at the 66th spot globally in 2016, and it can be safely assumed that building innovative capacities of small enterprises will go a long way in enabling India to leverage the full potential of its industries. Conducive policies play a significant role in improving innovation and hence competitiveness of small enterprises. The government’s Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) plans to set up 800 clusters of traditional industries with an outlay of Rs 850 crore while laying provisions for soft interventions like building capacity for innovation. A Scheme for Promotion of Innovation, Rural Industry & Entrepreneurship (ASPIRE) initiated in March 2015 plans to set up a network of technology and incubation centres in order to promote innovation and entrepreneurship with a fund of Rs 200 crore. The Prime Minister’s Bank Loan Scheme under the Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency (MUDRA) is providing much-needed capital to small enterprises to innovate and expand. However, despite all these efforts, India’s spending on R&D continues to remain below 1% of its GDP. This is meagre compared to R&D expenditure of 2-3% by countries such as the US and China. The fallout of this low spending eventually trickles down to lack of innovation and competitiveness in Indian small enterprises. An effective way to induce innovation among Indian small businesses is to adopt a programme like the Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR), popular in the US and a few other countries. Under SBIR, governments disburse funds on a competitive basis to small enterprises and help them build their R&D capabilities. Improving R&D will boost innovation and make enterprises more competitive. As a result, they will generate higher employment and will be more productive with improved products and services. In fact, SBIR in the US has helped small businesses secure over 67,000 patents since its inception. Apple, Chiron, Compaq and Intel have been the early beneficiaries of SBIR. The programme is known to have similar effects in other countries. In the Netherlands, the success of a similar programme spurred a seven-fold growth of the programme in a four-year period. In Korea, it has led to an increase in the proportion of SMEs investing in R&D from 12% to 31% in 12 years. In the UK, the programme witnessed 30% average annual sales growth, resulting in 10% higher job creation and leading to a five-fold expansion of the programme in 2013. In India, where the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has pioneered its adoption, about 70% participants of DBT’s SBIRI (Small Business Innovation Research Initiative) ascribe completion of their projects to this programme. In its 2015 report, the NITI Aayog Expert Committee highlighted SBIRI as a strategy to promote innovation. A programme like SBIR has the potential to change the landscape of small enterprises in India. If it is adopted and implemented properly, India will not only make its MSME framework robust, but will also manage to reap significant benefits of the demographic dividend at its disposal.

At a time when 4G networks are on an expansion mode, telecom operators globally are preparing the road to 5G — the next generation mobile technology that promises blistering download speeds on smartphones. Having lagged on both 3G and 4G fronts, the Indian government wants to draw level with the rest of the world on 5G, and has set in motion plans to auction 5G spectrum by asking the telecom regulator to suggest a starting price for such airwaves in the 3400 MHz to 3600 MHz bands. ET In the Classroom plumbs the depths of the 5G realm and tries to demystify its nuts and bolts. WHAT IS 5G? 5G, or 'fifth generation', is a technology that will run the next wave of fast mobile broadband networks in possibly two years from now. A 5G network will offer incredible download speeds of 20 GBs/second against 1 GB/second on a 4G network on your smartphone. It's like having a fibre optic connection in your pocket anywhere you go. WHAT WOULD A TYPICAL 5G EXPERIENCE BE LIKE? A 5G user will be able to download a 3-hour HD movie in under a second on his smartphone compared to at least 10 minutes for a 4G user. Video buffering during a streaming session should virtually disappear as data transmission would happen at lightning speeds on a 5G network. This is since a 5G network will deliver data with less than a millisecond (ms) of delay compared to about 70 ms on a 4G network. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE EMERGING SERVICES THAT WILL RIDE ON 5G TECHNOLOGY? Experts believe 5G technology will be a gateway of sorts for a truly connected society. It is slated to power a host of new-age services such as machine-tomachine (M2M) communications, Internet of Things (IoT), connected smart cities, self-driving cars, remote control surgery to virtual reality. For instance, M2M technologies would allow wired and wireless devices to talk to one another using sensors, and such applications can be deployed in next-gen infrastructure projects such as smart cities, smart grids, smart health and smart transportation. Likewise, a 5G-powered IoT environment could enable someone to connect his home to a wireless network by embedding them with electronics, software or sensor technology. A typical example could be a remote operation of a house's security system. 5G NETWORKS WILL RUN ON WHICH SPECTRUM BANDS? 5G networks could run on the 3400 MHz, 3500 MHz and 3600 MHz spectrum bands. Airwaves in the 3500 MHz band are considered ideal for the first wave of 5G. Going forward, millimetre wave spectrum may play a significant role in 5G networks. They are called millimetre waves as they vary in length from 1 to 10 mm unlike radio waves (measuring tens of centimetres in length) that serve present smartphones. Millimetre waves are broadcast on frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz. Till date, they have been largely used by those running satellite networks and radar systems. WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS OF 5G DEPLOYMENTS WORLDWIDE? The global telecom industry expects large scale 5G trials and deployments to start by 2019, a year earlier than the previous target. But South Korean carrier KT Corp could reportedly launch 5G services as early as the upcoming Winter Olympics in 2018. In the US, AT&T and Verizon have been conducting 5G trials. Verizon is reportedly testing a 5G fixed wireless service with Sweden's Ericsson in 11 US markets and weighing a commercial launch next year. US telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has laid the groundwork for launching 5G in the US by 2020. In Japan, Ericsson has reportedly teamed up with NTT DoCoMo and Intel to build a 5G trial environment in central Tokyo, starting next year. ARE THERE ANY INHERENT WEAKNESSES IN 5G? Researchers say a key challenge is the possibility of 5G frequencies being blocked by buildings and losing their intensity over longer distances, which could undermine wider coverage. For instance, if millimetre waves are used for 5G in future, there could be possible coverage issues since such waves cannot easily travel through buildings and can also be absorbed by foliage and rain. WHAT'S THE 5G PICTURE IN INDIA? The government has set in motion plans to auction 5G spectrum. It has asked the telecom regulator to suggest a starting price for 5G airwaves in the 3400 MHz to 3600 MHz bands that may debut in the next auction. The Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) is slated to start consultations soon towards determining the base price of 5G airwaves proposed to be auctioned. The DoT (Department of Telecom) is also expected to soon unveil a policy on use of higher band spectrum, including 5G airwaves.

World Week Ahead: US tax reform, corporate earnings, French election Margreet Dietz Monday April 24, 2017 Share National Front party leader Marine Le Pen Play NBR radio on A slew of US corporate earnings including those of Alphabet and Amazon, US President Donald Trump's "big announcement" on tax reform, as well as central bank meetings in the eurozone and Japan will form a key focus this week. Investors will also parse the results of Sunday's first round of voting in France's presidential election to gauge the stability of the European Union. "The election of either [far-right candidate Marine] Le Pen or [far-left candidate Jean-Luc] Melenchon would put Paris on a fast-track collision course with [EU officials in] Brussels," James Shields, professor of French politics at Aston University in Britain, told Reuters. "The election of Marine Le Pen would make Brexit look trivial by comparison," Shields noted. Le Pen wants France to drop the euro and return to the franc. The second round of voting in France between the two candidates who take the most votes this weekend is set for May 7. Most polls will close at 8pm local time on Sunday in France. Trump last Friday unexpectedly promised that a "big tax reform and tax reduction will be announced next Wednesday." US Treasuries pared earlier gains on Friday, as a result. "The Treasury market is apparently far less convinced of the veracity of the political pledges this round," BMO strategists Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli wrote in research note, Bloomberg reported. The announcement will consist of "broad principles and priorities," an administration official, who asked not to be identified, said on Saturday, Reuters reported. Trump's ability to conclude a tax deal has been hurt by the failed effort to agree with Congressional Republicans on revamping Obamacare. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 percent, while the the Standard & Poor's 500 Index gained 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rallied 1.8 percent, bolstered by better-than-expected corporate earnings. Other US companies reporting their latest quarterly results in the coming days include Microsoft, Intel and Exxon Mobil. The latest economic data will arrive in the form of reports on the Chicago Fed national activity index and the Dallas Fed manufacturing survey, due today; the FHFA and S&P Corelogic Case-Shiller house price indices, new home sales, consumer confidence, and the Richmond manufacturing index, due Tuesday; durable goods orders, international trade in goods, weekly jobless claims, pending home sales index, and the Kansas City Fed manufacturing index, due Thursday; and GDP, employment cost index, Chicago PMI, as well as consumer sentiment, due Friday. US Federal Reserve officials scheduled to speak this week include Neel Kashkari today as well as Lael Brainard and Patrick Harker on Friday. In Europe the Stoxx 600 Index retreated 0.6 percent last week. Charles Gave, founder of Hong-Kong based asset-allocation consultancy GaveKal Research, who predicted the win of Trump, now predicts a victory for Le Pen in the French presidential elections, Bloomberg reported. "Le Pen's momentum is a slow-moving reaction against the men of Davos - as we have seen with Brexit and Trump - but markets don't want to believe it," Gave told Bloomberg ahead of the first round of voting. The latest eurozone data slated for release this week include reports on Germany's IFO business climate, due today; Germany's GfK consumer confidence and consumer price index, and euro-zone economic confidence, due Thursday; and German retail sales and import price index, as well as the euro-zone CPI, due Friday.

There was even a report from Bloomberg saying that the Cupertino company is busy testing out a number of prototypes for the tenth anniversary iPhone. Now, a new leak seems to give a better idea of what the iPhone 8 would look like when it releases later this year. The latest images actually came from the same guy who made a name in leaking various upcoming mobile devices including the Samsung Galaxy S8. However, this time arounds, known leaker Benjamin Geskin was kind enough to share a dummy model of the iPhone 8. Now, one might think that this is possibly what the iPhone 8 would look like. However, keep in mind that the previous Bloomberg report says that Apple is testing out more than one prototype. This means that the new leaked images could be one of the many.   In the said leaked images, one can see clearly the absence of the TouchID sensor from the back of the device. Earlier last week, it was rumored that Apple might veer away from the display-embedded fingerprint scanner in favor of the rear mounted one. This is mainly because the company’ main supplier is still having issues merging the display and the sensor together. Another stark feature of the dummy model is the vertical duo camera. It has been reported many times that Apple is considering this camera configuration as it deems it will give better imaging quality. The one thing to note, however, is the fact that this could be an elaborate hoax. Readers are still urged to take this bit of news with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, everyone can agree that  if this happens to be what the iPhone 8 would look like, users are in for a thicker phone. Furthermore, there seems to be more surface area on the display in comparison to the Samsung Galaxy S8. Unfortunately, this purported design could still change as the days go by. Evidently, the display-embedded TouchID will still depend greatly on the manufacturer’s ability to generate enough units to comply with the demands.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Firefox 53 brings new graphics engine, new themes, new site permission UI 04/19/2017 at 3:00 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Mozilla has released Firefox 53 for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. The desktop browser comes with two new themes designed to give more screen real estate to web pages: Compact Light and Compact Dark. The Android version of Firefox has a new Compact Tabs option that lets you see more browser tabs at once by putting them in two rows instead of one. But the biggest change may be the inclusion of the new Quantum Compositor, which should lead to improved graphics rendering and fewer browser crashes. The Quantum Compositor is the first major part of Mozilla’s Project Quantum effort to update the core technologies to take advantage of modern computer hardware. The new graphics compositor leverages your computer’s GPU to run quickly without using up CPU resources. And since it’s running in a separate process from the rest of the browser, a graphics compositor crash will no longer cause the whole browser to crash. In fact, it won’t even crash a single browser tab. Mozilla says the Quantum Compositor works on computers with Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA graphics that are running Windows 7 or later. It’s not used on MacOS, which Mozilla says already has offers stable graphics compositing. While Mozilla is embracing modern hardware, the company is dropping support for older software: Firefox 53 is the first version of the web browser that won’t support Windows XP, Windows Vista, or 32-bit Mac OS X. Firefox 53 also no longer supports Linux computers with Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Opteron or older chips. Another new feature in Firefox 53 is a redesigned user interface for granting permissions to a website when it asks to access your camera or other hardware. A message will pop up and let you know what hardware a site wants to access and give you the option of remembering your choice or granting it just once. You can always change your settings later by clicking the “i” icon in the location bar.

Jumia Travel , the leading online travel agency, shares 6 of these broad guidelines to help you out. The Screen When buying a laptop, be sure to go for the laptop that gives you the best screen within your price range. A good screen typically considers three things: resolution, viewing angles and size. Laptops with higher resolution screens are generally the best ones to choose. For portability, smaller screens are better, but if you intend to use the laptop for entertainment and architectural or artistic functions, then a bigger screen is best. Lastly, in terms of viewing angles, a laptop screen that touts IPS (in-plane switching) technology offers the widest viewing angles for the best user comfort. Screen Quality You should consider laptops that are comfortable to look at because you are likely to be looking at it for quite some time during the day. Many laptops these days have touchscreens, but these touch screens tend to be glossy and glossy screens leads to reflections that negatively affect your eyes. You should therefore try to avoid these glossy screens and maybe opt for laptops that aren’t touchscreen, but if you must buy one go for the ones that don’t have glossy screens. RAM Typically, more RAM is better. For a decent laptop experience, 4GB RAM can be considered, but 8GB RAM is recommended. If you intend to do a lot of video and photo editing, you can consider buying one with 16GB RAM. More RAM allows for more applications to run at the same time, and for more data to be quickly accessible to the system at any one time. When buying a laptop, it’s always best to consider the ones with more RAM compared to others, within your favored price range. Keyboard Quality It’s advisable to choose a laptop with a keyboard that’s comfortable for you, rather than one that packs in every key and forces you to start hunting for keys. You should go for a keyboard with a comfortable layout with full sized keys and some space around the arrow keys. The keys should have a sort of ‘snappy responsiveness’ and should be easy on your fingers. When buying a laptop, it’s best to get a feel of the keyboard rather than ‘buying blind’ (asking someone to buy it for you or ordering online). CPU Intel’s Core-Based CPUs are one of the best to consider when buying a laptop. Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 offer some of the best performance when it comes to multitasking and multimedia tasks. However, for Core i7-based systems, though they offer the best performance for your laptop, the heat emitted from the base of the laptop tends to be a cause for concern if you plan to use the laptop for a long time.

Microsoft has made history with its Surface Pro 4 last year because this is the device which helped Microsoft generate over one billion dollars in profits. With that being said, Microsoft is undoubtedly going to unveil another Surface Pro itineration during 2017. Additionally, tech fans have urging Microsoft to unveil additional details about the upcoming Surface Pro 5 and see this enthusiasm is definitely giving Microsoft confidence. Sadly, Microsoft has been doing a good job of keeping its mouth shut about upcoming devices and we don’t have any official information about Surface Pro 5. However, this hasn’t stopped anyone from speculating or sparking up rumors about the hybrid tablet’s release date. We have rounded up the most liable rumors about Surface Pro 5 and we’re going to present them right now. Release Date The most important information that we could know about Surface Pro 5 is its release date. The device was initially expected to be unveiled alongside Microsoft’s Windows 10 Creators Update. As everyone already knows, this didn’t happen. We don’t know for sure why Microsoft has decided to delay the device’s launch date, but it might have something to do with the fact that the expectations bar is set pretty high. Microsoft might have decided to keep Surface Pro 5 under wraps for a short period of time in order to install some additional features. What’s interesting is that rumors and speculations are pointing towards a May 2nd release. The reason why everyone believes Surface Pro 5 is set to come out on May 2nd is because that’s when Microsoft will hold its Windows 10 Cloud press event. Expected Specs Just like with Surface Pro 5’s release date, Microsoft doesn’t want to disclose any vital information about the device’s hardware specs. However, Surface Pro 5 is expected to be powered by Intel’s latest Kaby Lake architecture chipset and around 16GB of RAM on the premium model. We should mention that Intel’s latest CPU will significantly increase Surface Pro 5 battery life expectancy. Last but not least, Microsoft will surely equip Surface Pro 5 with the latest USB Type-C ports which will ensure faster transfer times.

By Paul Acevedo Saturday, Apr 22, 2017 at 3:00 pm EDT 18 Comments Welcome to another installment of Steam Spotlight, our weekly look at interesting Steam games for your Windows PC. Free to play games come in all shapes and sizes, but Heavy Metal Machines stands out as a top-down car combat game. Players select from gnarly road machines and then enter an arena for a team-based carpocalypse. Heavy Metal Machines is free to play and currently in Early Access. Read on for detailed impressions and your chance to win a valuable booster pack! See on Steam Car combat made simple Heavy Metal Machines begins with a quick tutorial that teaches the rules of the road. No need to worry about acceleration and breaking here. You just jam the analog stick of an Xbox controller or point the mouse in the direction you want to drive, and you're off. Holding a button puts your ride in reverse, though I find it largely unnecessary during the heat of battle. Each of Heavy Metal Machine's vehicles (13 available now, with more on the way) has two regular weapons and one special weapon. You can use regular weapons as much as you want, but they have a cooldown timer (indicated in the lower-left corner of the screen). My vehicle of choice, Wildfire, comes with a rapid-fire ring of fire that damages anyone unlucky enough to be close to it; and a long-range reflective shot. The long-range shot's cooldown is lengthy, but the ring of fire makes up for it. Special attacks take time to charge up – almost the entire length of the round. Once the meter fills, you can unleash it and bring serious pain to your foes. Wildfire's special fires a nuclear blast in a wide radius around her. Anyone who gets killed during battle will respawn at their base a short time later. The money earned from kills can be spent on upgrades at any time. Each weapon has four upgrades to choose from, although you can only buy two in order to keep their power in check. General upgrades and special weapon upgrades are available as well. These upgrades last for the duration of the match, much like the upgrades in a MOBA. Game types Heavy Metal Machines is exclusively a free online multiplayer game, so no driving solo here. It currently offers two modes of play, with Ranked, Custom Lobbies, and Spectator modes planned for the future. Practice is the primary game mode, with super short wait times (less than half a minute in my experience). The other mode has crazy wait times of fifteen+ minutes. Developer Hoplon really needs to provide some incentive to choose Play over Practice, as there isn't any right now. Practice is a four-versus-four game in which each team tries to capture a single bomb and deliver it to the other team's base. Getting it there won't be easy, as the arena has yellow walls that everyone else but the bomb carrier can pass through, as well as red zones that make you drop the bomb if touched. The enemy team will naturally gang up on the bomb carrier, so everyone else has to surround and protect him or her. It's a fun dynamic, and I enjoy going for kills even when I don't have the bomb. Deliver that bomb, and your team will score a point, ending the round. The match lasts until one team has three points. This can take as few as 10 minutes or as many as 30, depending on whether the other side wins some rounds or not. Completing games get you experience for not only your overall profile, but also the vehicle used. Leveling up vehicles unlocks new skins for them, whereas the overall level doesn't seem to have a benefit right now other than assisting with matchmaking. System requirements and controls One big feather in Heavy Metal Machines' cap is its low system requirements. Thanks to the top-down view (rather than a traditional 3D view), the game doesn't need beefy hardware to run. In fact, it runs on machines with Intel Integrated Graphics (HD 4000) and 4GB of RAM – good news for Ultrabook owners. Heavy Metal Machines can be played with either mouse and keyboard or Xbox controller. If playing with mouse and keyboard, the mouse steers the vehicle, which might be off-putting for people used to more direct control in racing games. Hence a controller is really the way to go. The only thing is, the menus don't support controllers at all. You can use one during matches, as long as you've gone into the options menu and selected controller (it won't just detect and let you use it). But we should really be able to play entirely with a controller rather than switching to the mouse for menus. Controller support for menus can't be too much work for the developers, so they should prioritize adding it. In-app purchases Since Heavy Metal Machines is a free to play game, it relies on in-app purchases for sustainability. These consist of premium currency (called cash here), booster packs (which bundle temporary boosters you can also buy with cash), and character packs. To unlock new characters/vehicles, you generally need to spend soft currency (gold) earned from matches or buy them faster with cash. One character only costs two or three bucks worth of currency, but most will require a $12.99 purchase (which also leaves you with some cash left over). Buying a character is a great way to support the developer, although it's hard to know whether you'll like one before buying. Hoplon probably needs to add a few more ways to spend money if they want to keep established players making purchases over time. Current impression Heavy Metal Machines is currently in Early Access, so we can't give it a final impression or full review. The game has a long way to go, as it only offers one mode and one map/track to play at the moment, and controller support for menus needs to happen. But the core gameplay is genuinely fun – way more so than I expected it to be. If you enjoy car combat games, this one's definitely worth a try. The current scarcity of content might not keep players around too long, but it's still good for a few hours of battles. Hopefully, Hoplon will keep the updates coming frequently because Heavy Metal Machines just needs to grow a bit before it can truly rock. Dare we hope for an Xbox version someday as well? Yes, we do.

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. Both USB-C ports will charge the computer. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Specs Hexa-core Dual Arm Cortex A72 2GHz Processor 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB eMMC storage Model Number – XE513C24-K01US 12.3-inch LCD Touchscreen Display with 2400 x 1600 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio and 400 nit brightness 2-in-1 rotating display Shared integrated graphics 2 1.5watt stereo speakers facing down 720p webcam 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with Marvell 88W997 wireless card Bluetooth 4.0 Headphone mic combo audio port 2 USB-C 3.1 ports (up to 5Gbps and 4K display output with optional adapter) 1 micro-SD card slot Spill resistant 74-key keyboard S Pen 2-cell Li-ion 5140mAh batter with 39 watt hours Dimensions – 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ Weight – 2.38lbs The Bottom Line Samsung makes the best Chromebook money can buy. It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   4 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. 04/18/2017 PC Reply Question, how is the S PEN lag? Earlier reviewers were sent a Chromebook Pro from Samsung and many commented that there was a noticeable lag between the ink appearing and your writing. Also how low can you turn down the brightness as I like to do writing at night in a low light. I was considering the Lenovo Yoga Book, because of the feature of using real ink and paper on top of the HALO surface area. 04/22/2017 Gary Reply Don’t expect Apple Pencil level latency performance. There is noticeable lag, so you will have to compensate and write slower/carefully for your writings to appear as they would on actual paper. It also depends on the software of course, but I would say the level of lag is about same as Surface Pens. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Key researchers are using GTA V-derived code to power simulations and test scenarios to test the software that runs autonomous vehicles--in a sense the vehicles are "playing" the games, learning from interactions within the world itself, and more importantly the mistakes they make. This generates tons of data for the vehicle's "brains" to learn from, and gives engineers valuable information in the process.   The vehicle's machine-learning algorithms are put through their paces via simulations, which act as the other half of testing outside of the cars testing their skills on actual roads. With its myriad of cars, people, and dynamic physics-filled sandbox GTA V is the perfect virtual testing ground for driverless cars to learn from. Researchers at Intel Labs and Darmstadt started using GTA V for autonomous vehicle testing last year, and now other teams have picked up on it.   Using GTA V for their tests, Google's self-driving car project Waymo is able to run simulations where cars drive 3 million miles per day.   "Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance," Bloomberg reports. "What's learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation."   Los Santos' roads may not be safe from crazy players, but its fictional world is being used to make our real roads even safer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 23 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Embraer Receives Customers to Celebrate 20 Years of the ERJ 145 Jet Operations Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – April 11, 2017 – As part of the celebrations for the 20 years of commercial operation of the 50-seat ERJ 145 jet, Embraer receives, as of today, almost 30 operators of the jet family for the two-day Embraer Operators Conference (EOC), in Rio de Janeiro. The first commercial flight of the ERJ 145 occurred on April 6, 1997, with U.S. airline Continental Express. “The ERJ 145 marked Embraer’s commercial renaissance, paving the way for the development of new programs, such as the E-Jets, which moved the Company into the lead of the commercial jet market for up to 130-seat aircraft,” said Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, Embraer President & CEO. “Personally, I have a great affection for the program, which brought me to Embraer. I participated in practically all the jet’s sales campaigns as Vice President of Customer Financing.” The ERJ 145 family of jets consists of the ERJ 145 (50 seats), the ERJ 135 (37 seats), the ERJ 140 (44 seats) and the ERJ 145 XR (long-range 145 version). Since its entry into operation, the ERJ 145 family has accumulated more than 27 million flight hours and almost 730 million passengers transported, being used by more than 120 operators. Over the last seven years, the ERJ’s global customer base has almost doubled, from 39 operators, in 2010, to 70, today. During the same period, the application and use of ERJ models has been growing in emerging markets, such as Africa, where the ERJ fleet has increased from 16 units in 2010 to almost 60 jets in 2017. Robust and with excellent operating history, the ERJ platform is a success in commercial aviation, with almost 900 units delivered, having applications in the business aviation market, with the Legacy 600 and Legacy 650 jets, as well as in defense, such as the AEW&C, Multi-Intel and maritime patrol for the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) segment. In total, more than 1,200 aircraft based on the ERJ 145 platform have already been delivered worldwide, making the ERJ program one of the most successful in the aircraft industry.
