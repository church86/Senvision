In fact, just last week it was brought to light that half a billion Yahoo users suffered from a cyber attack that happened two years ago. Cloudera and Intel believe they can solve the ongoing cybersecurity crisis with a new open-source project: Apache Spot. “As an open-source community, we have both an opportunity and an obligation to deal with this problem,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer of Cloudera, at Strata + Hadoop world in New York today. Apache Spot, formerly known as Open Network Insight, is designed to be an open common data model that provides visibility into cybersecurity threats, and to provide advanced threat detection with Big Data analytics and machine learning. (Related: Microsoft announces new security capabilities) The Open Network Insight project started at Intel, and was launched as Spot earlier this year. Cloudera and Intel, along with Anomali, Centrify, Cloudwick, Cybraics, eBay, Endgame, Jask, StreamSets and Webroot, have been collaborating on Apache Spot to bring developers the cybersecurity capabilities they need in their application. “Let’s give one common data model that any application developer can take advantage of to bring new analytic capabilities to bear on cybersecurity,” Olson said. Cloudera and Intel recently announced a proposal to donate the project to the Apache Software Foundation. The foundation accepted the project into the ASF incubator last week. “The open-source community is the perfect environment for Apache Spot to take a collective, peer-driven approach to fighting cybercrime,” said Ron Kasabian, vice president and general manager of the analytics and artificial intelligence solutions group at Intel, in a statement. “The combined expertise of contributors will help further Apache Spot’s open data model vision and provide the grounds for collaboration on the world’s toughest and constantly evolving challenges in cybersecurity analytics.” Spot features a comprehensive cybersecurity hub, open data models, analytics collaboration, and a rich application ecosystem.

Jason Merritt, Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email LOS ANGELES Actress and comedian Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity on the internet – and not just because of her no-holds-barred personality. Intel Security announced Wednesday that Schumer topped its 10th annual list of the most dangerous celebrities online. A search for the “Trainwreck” and “Inside Amy Schumer” star carries over a 16 percent chance of connecting with a site that carries viruses or malware. Following close behind, Justin Bieber was number two on the list, with a 15 percent chance of linking to malware.  “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security, said in a statement on the company’s website. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware.” Here’s Intel’s list of the top ten most dangerous celebs to search for online, based on its own security data: Amy Schumer​ - 16.11% risk Justin Bieber - 15%  Carson Daly - 13.44%  (tie) Will Smith - 13.44%  Rihanna​ - 13.33% Miley Cyrus​ - 12.67% Chris Hardwick - 12.56% Daniel Tosh - 11.56% Selena Gomez​​ - 11.11% (tie) Kesha​ - 11.11% Intel, whose products include McAfee security software, urged consumers to take precautions when they surf the web. In addition to recommending antivirus software, the company’s safety tips include: Think before you click! Beware of third-party links that may not be what they seem. If you’re searching for the latest episode of “Inside Amy Schumer,” go directly to the original source at comedycentral.com, not some video clip uploaded by a random user who may have ill intent. “Torrent” searches are especially risky. These file-sharing tools are often used by cybercriminals who embed malware. It’s safer to limit your video viewing to legitimate streaming options​. Protect your personal info. Think twice before you enter personal information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login. Online phishing scams​ can lead to identity theft. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

This Fool doesn't think so. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 28, 2016 at 11:21AM Image source: Apple.   Over the past several years, speculation has run rampant that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends to eventually replace chips from microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) inside its Mac products with homegrown ARM Holdings-compatible microprocessors. For a while, it seemed there was no immediate threat to Intel's Mac business, given the relatively large performance deltas between Intel's notebook processors and Apple's own A-series processors used in both the iPhone and the iPad. However, beginning with the A9 and A9X chips launched about a year ago and continuing on with the recently released A10 and the soon-to-be-launched A10X, it's clear that Apple's engineering teams are now able to deliver offerings that are truly competitive with Intel's low-power notebook processors. In other words, the argument that Apple's chips aren't powerful enough no longer appears to hold water. In that context, it's worth reconsidering whether Apple will ultimately boot Intel from the Mac line of products My bet is still: not anytime soon. Here's why. Apple can't easily or cheaply replicate Intel's product breadth Apple releases two high-performance processors each year or so -- one for the iPhone and a beefed-up version of that offering intended for the iPad. Last year, we got the A9 and A9X, and I expect that the A10X will follow the A10 that launched in September by approximately six months. If Apple were to replace Intel inside the Mac, it would need to build many more chips for each of its Mac products. Indeed, it would need to build chips for the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air, the plain MacBook, and the iMac lines. Intel currently services the plain MacBook with its Y-series processors, the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro with its U-series processors, the 15-inch MacBook Pro and 21.5-inc iMac with its H-series processors, and the 27-inch iMac with its S-series processors. To be clear, all of the Intel processors that go into the Macs are based on the same fundamental building blocks -- CPU cores, graphics technologies, and the like -- but they are integrated in different quantities and proportions, such as CPU core count, graphics core count, and so on. Apple could certainly invest in building additional configurations/variants for a suite of Mac chips, but given that the company ships roughly 20 million Macs a year, which is just a fraction of the number of iPhones and iPads that it ships, the potential return on that investment might not be good enough. Focus, focus, focus! One of the reasons Apple's chip teams are able to execute so beautifully is that the company has a lot of the world's best chip engineers all working on a very targeted set of products. They don't have their hands full trying to build different chip configurations or weighing painful trade-offs to make its core technologies scale across too wide of a range. Each year, the company puts out arguably the world's best smartphone and tablet processors. Although Apple would still probably put out excellent chips for these segments with a broader focus, possible even including leadership products, somehow I think they would ultimately be less impressive. Intel already invests billions to try to build a wide range of personal-computer processors, and these chips have successfully powered all of Apple's Macs for years. Unless Apple thinks Intel won't be able to build chips that enable it to offer the Mac experiences it aims to deliver to consumers -- and that's unlikely -- then it simply doesn't make sense for Apple to switch to an in-house solution anytime soon.

Photo Credit: AP / John Salangsang advertisement | advertise on newsday HIGHLIGHTS She’s the first female comedian to top Intel Security’s list Justin Bieber came in at No. 2 Comedian Amy Schumer is the “most dangerous celebrity” in terms of search-engine results that may result in computer malware, according to Intel Security’s 10th Annual Most Dangerous Celebrities List. “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” Gary Davis, an executive with the cybersecurity division of the technology company Intel, said in a statement Wednesday. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware.” advertisement | advertise on newsday The Rockville Centre-raised Schumer, 35, is the first female comedian to take the No.1 spot on the list. A search for “Amy Schumer” has a 16.11 percent chance of connecting to a malicious website, the company said. Adding “torrent” to the search, referring to “torrent” computer files that contain data about downloadable files and folders, increases this to 33 percent. Justin Bieber came in at No. 2, followed by “Today” and “The Voice” host Carson Daly (No. 3). Electronic dance music DJ Armin van Buuren was in first place last year. The company, maker of McAfee anti-virus software, conducted the study using McAfee WebAdvisor site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by Google, Bing and Yahoo! searches of a celebrity name and commonly searched terms. From that, an overall risk percentage was calculated for each celebrity. “Most dangerous means that these celebrities are likely popular search subjects,” the company explained.

Ubuntu 16.10 Isn't Shipping Vulkan Support By Default Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 28 September 2016 at 03:28 PM EDT. 10 Comments With Ubuntu 16.10 being right around the corner you may be wondering about its support for Vulkan. Here's my experience when trying out today's Ubuntu 16.10 "beta 2" release and looking for Vulkan support. Ubuntu 16.10 isn't shipping with Vulkan support installed by default. This is while Ubuntu 16.10 is making use of Mesa 12.0 and with that release was the Intel "ANV" Vulkan Linux driver as part of Mesa. However, there is the Intel Mesa Vulkan driver support available via the Universe repository. If you simply install the mesa-vulkan-drivers package on Ubuntu, you will have access to the Intel Mesa Vulkan driver (currently v12.0.3). Also on Ubuntu 16.10 within the universe repository is libvulkan-dev to provide the Vulkan headers (currently based on Vulkan 1.0.21) and libvulkan1 for the common loader library and then vulkan-utils provides the vulkaninfo command. So there's no support out-of-the-box for Vulkan on Ubuntu 16.10, but at least it's within easy reach now for the Yakkety Yak. Hopefully by the time more Linux games are shipping with Vulkan support, we'll see it shipping by default on future Ubuntu releases. There is also the matter in Ubuntu-land of still waiting on Vulkan Mir support, something originally talked about for Ubuntu 16.04 and two years after Canonical joined The Khronos Group. If you are a Linux gamer or enthusiast, the mesa-vulkan-drivers package probably won't be too exciting though since it's based on the four-month-old Mesa 12.0 and Ubuntu 16.10 won't get the next Mesa release. Thus with third-party PPAs like Padoka, you can still get the Intel Vulkan driver (including on Ubuntu 16.04) while enjoying Mesa Git for the very latest Vulkan support. Hopefully we'll see the RADV Radeon Vulkan driver merged into mainline Mesa too, thereby providing greater purpose for the graphics PPAs over this default package. For binary driver users, the nvidia-367 package on Ubuntu 16.10 has the NVIDIA 367.44 driver with Vulkan support. For AMDGPU-PRO, it's currently not packaged in the Yakkety archive. 10 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Strength in PCs leads Intel to raise Q3 revenue guidance Intel says PC makers are renewing inventory, which is helping boost chip shipments Agam Shah (IDG News Service) on 17 September, 2016 00:33 0 - - - - print email The PC market is showing signs of recovery, with Intel increasing its revenue guidance based on improved chip shipments. The chip maker has raised its revenue guidance for the third quarter to $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an improvement from $14.9 million, plus or minus $500 million. That's due to PC makers replenishing laptop and desktop inventory, which means Intel is shipping out more chips. It's likely in anticipation of the holiday season, when PC shipments rocket. "The company is also seeing some signs of improving PC demand," Intel said in a statement. In the second quarter of the year, PC makers slowed down chip orders and were clearing out existing stock of laptops and desktops. PC shipments declined by 4.5 percent during that period, according to IDC. Shipments of gaming PCs, 2-in-1s and Chromebooks are driving PC shipments. Microsoft's free upgrade offer to Windows 10 has also ended, which means users are more likely to buy new PCs to get Windows 10. Meanwhile, new laptops with Intel's Kaby Lake chips are now available. All the top PC makers have announced new 2-in-1s and laptops with Intel's new chips. New Kaby Lake chips for gaming PCs will be announced in January. Intel also has started shipping Pentium and Celeron chips, both aimed at low-cost laptops, based on the same architecture and code-named Apollo Lake. Many Chromebooks are based on Apollo Lake chips. Intel will announce third-quarter earnings on October 18. Brand Post ESET Smart Security 8 More from Eset Join the PC World newsletter! Join Error: Please check your email address.

Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware.” Schumer, 35, is the first female comedian to take the No.1 spot on the list. A search for “Amy Schumer” has a 16.11 percent chance of connecting to a malicious website, the company said. Adding “torrent” to the search, referring to “torrent” computer files that contain data about downloadable files and folders, increases this to 33 percent. Justin Bieber came in at No. 2, followed by “Today” and “The Voice” host Carson Daly (No. 3). Electronic dance music DJ Armin van Buuren was in first place last year. The company, maker of McAfee anti-virus software, conducted the study using McAfee WebAdvisor site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by Google, Bing and Yahoo! searches of a celebrity name and commonly searched terms. From that, an overall risk percentage was calculated for each celebrity. “Most dangerous means that these celebrities are likely popular search subjects,” the company explained. NYC, in your inbox.

This Fool doesn't think so. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 28, 2016 at 11:21AM Image source: Apple.   Over the past several years, speculation has run rampant that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) intends to eventually replace chips from microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) inside its Mac products with homegrown ARM Holdings-compatible microprocessors. For a while, it seemed there was no immediate threat to Intel's Mac business, given the relatively large performance deltas between Intel's notebook processors and Apple's own A-series processors used in both the iPhone and the iPad. However, beginning with the A9 and A9X chips launched about a year ago and continuing on with the recently released A10 and the soon-to-be-launched A10X, it's clear that Apple's engineering teams are now able to deliver offerings that are truly competitive with Intel's low-power notebook processors. In other words, the argument that Apple's chips aren't powerful enough no longer appears to hold water. In that context, it's worth reconsidering whether Apple will ultimately boot Intel from the Mac line of products My bet is still: not anytime soon. Here's why. Apple can't easily or cheaply replicate Intel's product breadth Apple releases two high-performance processors each year or so -- one for the iPhone and a beefed-up version of that offering intended for the iPad. Last year, we got the A9 and A9X, and I expect that the A10X will follow the A10 that launched in September by approximately six months. If Apple were to replace Intel inside the Mac, it would need to build many more chips for each of its Mac products. Indeed, it would need to build chips for the MacBook Pro, the MacBook Air, the plain MacBook, and the iMac lines. Intel currently services the plain MacBook with its Y-series processors, the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro with its U-series processors, the 15-inch MacBook Pro and 21.5-inc iMac with its H-series processors, and the 27-inch iMac with its S-series processors. To be clear, all of the Intel processors that go into the Macs are based on the same fundamental building blocks -- CPU cores, graphics technologies, and the like -- but they are integrated in different quantities and proportions, such as CPU core count, graphics core count, and so on. Apple could certainly invest in building additional configurations/variants for a suite of Mac chips, but given that the company ships roughly 20 million Macs a year, which is just a fraction of the number of iPhones and iPads that it ships, the potential return on that investment might not be good enough. Focus, focus, focus! One of the reasons Apple's chip teams are able to execute so beautifully is that the company has a lot of the world's best chip engineers all working on a very targeted set of products. They don't have their hands full trying to build different chip configurations or weighing painful trade-offs to make its core technologies scale across too wide of a range. Each year, the company puts out arguably the world's best smartphone and tablet processors. Although Apple would still probably put out excellent chips for these segments with a broader focus, possible even including leadership products, somehow I think they would ultimately be less impressive. Intel already invests billions to try to build a wide range of personal-computer processors, and these chips have successfully powered all of Apple's Macs for years. Unless Apple thinks Intel won't be able to build chips that enable it to offer the Mac experiences it aims to deliver to consumers -- and that's unlikely -- then it simply doesn't make sense for Apple to switch to an in-house solution anytime soon.

Training Certification Events Webinars Community Participate Q&A Forums Blogs Resources Newsletter Distributions Publications Infographics Photos Videos Jobs Eric Brown September 27, 2016 Linux and Open Source Hardware for IoT iot-boards.png Intel's IoT-oriented Intel Joule module runs on the latest, 14nm “Broxton-M” Atom SoCs and is supported by the Yocto Project-based Ostro Linux. Used with permission Most of the 21 open source software projects for IoT that we examined last week listed Linux hacker boards as their prime development platforms. This week, we’ll look at open source and developer-friendly Linux hardware for building Internet of Things devices, from simple microcontroller-based technology to Linux-based boards. In recent years, it’s become hard to find an embedded board that isn’t marketing with the IoT label. Yet, the overused term is best suited for boards with low prices, small footprints, low power consumption, and support for wireless communications and industrial interfaces. Camera support is useful for some IoT applications, but high-end multimedia is usually counterproductive to attributes like low cost and power consumption. IoT characteristics tend to apply more to endpoints – node devices that collect sensor inputs -- rather than gateways. Yet most gateways connect directly to endpoints rather than aggregating inputs from other gateways, and tend to be deployed in large numbers, often in remote areas. Therefore, they must also be affordable, efficient, lightweight devices. IoT modules and SBCs can often be used interchangeably in home and industrial settings.  Yet, boards for smart home hubs tend to be focused more on wireless support while industrial gateways are also frequently connected to serial, CAN, and other interfaces, or industrial Ethernet technologies like EtherCAT. MCU IoT IoT attributes are driven largely by the processor, and for endpoints, this often means microprocessor units. MCUs tend to run a lightweight real-time operating system, like the open source FreeRTOS, or are programmed with the Arduino IDE. Until recently, the poor wireless support on MCUs limited their appeal for IoT compared to applications processors running Linux or Windows Embedded. The only Linux that runs on MCUs is the aging and somewhat limited uClinux, and it only runs on higher-end MCUs. For several years, the trend has been to combine MCU-driven Arduino boards with MIPS-based wireless chipsets like the Qualcomm Atheros AR9331, running the more robust OpenWrt or Linino Linux distributions. There are still plenty of hybrid Linux/Arduino SBCs, including the Arduino Yún Mini and Atheros AR9432 based Arduino Tian. Others, such as MediaTek’s Arduino-compatible LinkIt Smart 7688, run OpenWrt on the MIPS-based Mediatek MT7688AN. Over the past year, low-cost WiFi SoCs, especially the Espressif ESP8266, have made it easier to build wireless-enabled MCU devices without requiring the overhead of application processors running Linux. The open source ESP8266, which is based on a Tensilica RISC core, can be modified to run Arduino sketches directly, if you flash it with an alternative, open-source firmware, as described on GitHub. The ESP8266 can also be reprogrammed to run FreeRTOS or the MCU-oriented, wireless-savvy ARM Mbed. The ESP8266 has shown up on Arduino boards like Arduino Srl’s Arduino STAR Otto and Arduino Uno WiFi and is frequently hacked into Arduino-based IoT DIY projects. Recently, Espressif shipped the ESP8285 -- essentially an ESP8266 with 1MB of flash -- and introduced a faster, Bluetooth enabled ESP32 SoC. ESP SoCs are not the only game in town. Arduino LLC’s MKR1000 board uses an Atmel ATSAMW25H18 for WiFi. Pine64, known for its Pine-A64 Linux hacker board, recently jumped in with PADI IoT Stamp COM based on Realtek’s RTL8710AF, a WiFi-enabled ESP8266 competitor that runs FreeRTOS on a Cortex-M3. Like ESP-based modules, the PADI IoT Stamp is tiny (24x16mm), power efficient, and dirt cheap, selling for only $2 at volume. Intel’s second generation, MCU-like Quark D2000 and Quark SE processors are also aimed at IoT nodes, in this case running lightweight RTOSes such as Zephyr. The Quark SE drives Intel’s BLE-enabled Curie modules for wearables, as well as Intel’s Arduino 101 board. Linux IoT Higher end IoT nodes require application processors running Linux, Windows Embedded, and now Windows 10. Home automation was the leading application in a recent HackerBoards survey of users of community-backed Linux SBCs. Other major categories included industrial applications such as data acquisition and HMI. Linux-based endpoints are typically used when you require more local processing and must run a web session or HMI screen. They often need to support a wider array of wireless radios or integrate cameras and audio. Linux is more often found on gateways, which aggregate data from IoT nodes. In many cases, however, the same embedded board can drive a low-end gateway or a high-end endpoint. That is often the case for the Raspberry Pi, one of the most commonly used development boards for IoT. It’s not that the Pi is particularly well-suited for the task, although the WiFi and Bluetooth on the Pi 3 helps. Yet, the Pi and its clones are small and affordable, and there are numerous IoT-oriented add-ons. IBM, Element14, and EnOcean collaborated on one such add-on. The kit combines a Raspberry Pi with EnOcean’s self-powered, energy harvesting wireless sensors, which gain energy from the motion, light, and temperature of the surrounding environment. IBM has supplied its IBM Watson IoT Platform for cloud-based IoT analytics. Many IoT platforms support the BeagleBone, which is better suited for industrial IoT and has numerous IoT add-ons. The Cortex-A8 and -A9 based Texas Instruments Sitara SoCs found on the BeagleBone and variants like SeeedStudio’s BeagleBone Green Wireless are widely used in IoT. For more processing power, NXP’s Cortex-A9 based i.MX6 is a popular choice. Like the Sitara, is supplies numerous industrial interfaces. i.MX6-based hacker boards include HummingBoard and Udoo models, as well as the Wandboard. Both the Sitara and i.MX6 are frequently used in commercial IoT boards, as well. Atmel’s Cortex-A5-based SAMA-branded SoCs are another IoT mainstay, found on devices such as as Artila’s Matrix remote monitoring computers. Even the aging ARM9 core continues to find a role in IoT due to its small size, low price, and low power consumption. LittleBits’ tiny, ARM9-based, CloudBit SBC connects to scores of LittleBits actuators, sensors, buzzers, dimmers, LEDs, and DC motors. Other hacker SBCs offer similar IoT add-ons. SeeedStudio’s Grove is one of the most popular family of sensor devices and is tapped by boards including the Intel Edison Kit for Arduino. The Creator Ci40, HobbitBoard, and HummingBoard-Gate, and other SBCs support MikroElektronika’s Click modules. Higher-end data acquisition devices are often built around Xilinx’s ARM/FPGA hybrid Zynq SoCs. Linux hacker boards based on the Zynq include the Parallella, Z-Turn, and Snickerdoodle. ARM’s power-sipping Cortex-A7 is increasingly replacing Cortex-A5, -A8, and -A9 SoCs in IoT nodes and low-end gateways. Popular -A7-based SoCs for IoT include NXP’s i.MX6 UltraLite (UL) and Samsung’s dual-core Artik 5 SoC/module combo. Allwinner SoCs are used on a number of Pi clones and other SBCs that end up in IoT projects, but as with Rockchip, Samsung, and Qualcomm SoCs, the higher end models are more typically used in higher-end, multimedia driven devices. Soon we will see IoT SoCs based on the Cortex-A32, the smallest, and most power efficient ARMv8 core to date. Cortex-A32 is much faster than the -A7 while offering 25 percent higher efficiency. (The S2 SoC in the Apple Watch 2 is rumored to be Cortex-A32.) On the x86 side, Intel may have given up on pushing its increasingly power-efficient Atom SoCs at smartphones, but it continues to aim Atoms at the embedded market. Its IoT-oriented Intel Joule module runs on the latest, 14nm “Broxton-M” Atom SoCs -- the quad-core Atom T5700 and T5500 – and is supported by the Yocto Project-based Ostro Linux. While Intel’s latest Quark processors are aimed at RTOSes, its original line of Linux-driven Quarks continue to target both IoT endpoints and low-end gateways. The Quark X1000 runs Linux, and has appeared on low-end IoT gateways such as the Advantech UNO-1252G. Higher-end gateways like Axiomtek’s ICO300-MI are more likely to use Atoms. AMD, meanwhile, has seen its x86-based G-Series SoCs rolled into various IoT boards and devices. The top-level gateways that aggregate and process data from other gateways tend the use more powerful x86 and ARM platforms. These systems feed data to IoT cloud servers where software, rather than hardware, is the IoT differentiator. Although industrial, rather than consumer IoT, will likely be the main driver of the industry over the next few years, it will largely remain invisible beyond the developer world. For most people, IoT is a Linux-driven smart home hub, and Android or iOS smartphone app, plus a kit full of “smart devices.” Next week, we’ll look at consumer-facing, Linux-driven home automation platforms, examining both open source and commercial options.

On the EVGA Z170 Classified K, EVGA expanded the  USB offerings to include dual USB 3.1 ports in the Back I/O cluster but also reduced the SuperSpeed USB 3.0 ports from 8 to 6.  Technically you still have 8 USB 3.0 ports, just two of them are now compatible with 3.1.  Ethernet options were expanded as well, to include dual Gigabit NIC’s, one from Intel and one from Killer. The various storage options has been increased, SATA ports include an additional 4 SATA 6G ports, or two SATA-Express, while the M.2 ports were increased from a single PCIe Key-M slot to dual Key-M and a single Key-E.  Memory support has also been updated to include 4x DDR4 up to 3600MHz+. EVGA Z170 Classified K Motherboard EVGA does a good job at keeping your motherboard selection easy, by providing three Z170 ATX motherboards with the same core features but slightly different advanced features.  This is a big change from many motherboard manufacturers that offer dozen options which can confuse potential users.  All of their Z170 ATX motherboards can be purchased at many online locations, and the Z170 Classified K can be found for $229.99 with free shipping while the Z170 FTW is available for a little less at $174.95. EVGA Z180 Classified K Features and Specifications 6 Layer PCB 2-Way SLI + PhysX M.2 Support High Gold Content for CPU Socket Killer E2400 NIC 8 Phase PWM Dual BIOS Support Onboard Power, Reset, and CMOS Restet Buttons Top Notch Integrated Peripherals Specifications Chipset Intel Z170 Socket 1151 Processors Supports i3, i5, and i7 SLI 2-Way + PhysX SATA 10 SATA 6G RAID 0, 1, 5, 10, JBOD USB 2x USB 3.1 / 6x USB 3.0 / 2x USB 2.0 Memory Support 4 DIMM Dual Channel DDR4 3600MHz+ (up to 64GB) Capacitors POSCAP/Solid State Ethernet 1x Killer E2400 1x Intel Gigabit NIC Audio 8 Channel High Definition + Optical Video 1x DP 1.2, 1x HDMI 1.4 Fan Headers 7 (2PWM, 5DC/PWM) PCB 6 Layers PCI-E Slot Arrangement 3.0 Support 1 x16, 2 x8 + 1 x4 + 2 x1 NVMe Support Yes Warranty 3 Years EVGA Z170 Classified K Front of Box EVGA Z170 Classified K Back of Box EVGA Z170 Classified K Accessories Packaging EVGA Z170 Classified K Motherboard Packaging EVGA does a good job at packaging their motherboards.  The retail packaging provides a good overview of the motherboard, and lets you know the key features and specifications, along with presenting an overview of the motherboard.  EVGA packages the included accessories individually, and separates the motherboard from the various accessories with a layer of cardboard.  On the bottom of the box the motherboard is in an anti-static bag, and a foam sheet to protect the bottom and the sides.  This is pretty standard packaging for motherboards, and has been shown to be highly effective. EVGA Z170 Classified K Accessories Since this is a motherboard, not many accessories are needed to get it up and running.  A detailed user manual, and a driver/software disk is included to help get you up; it is highly recommended to get the latest drivers from EVGA’s website.  In addition, there is a rear I/O shield, two SATA cables, a flexible SLI bridge and the rear I/O key.  For a motherboard that supports up to 10 SATA drives, two SATA cables seem to be a little light, most of us that build computers probably have a pile of them though. One word of warning about the rear I/O shield, if you place a GPU in the first PCIE slot, it will rub against the I/O shield, however EVGA has placed a piece of plastic on that edge to avoid any shorts.  If you use a backplate on the graphics card, you will most likely have issues.  When testing the EVGA Z170 FTW, we found that even though our test graphics card has a backplate, the EVGA GTX 970 would fit if the retaining screw was loosened a little. Let’s take a quick look at the Z170 Classified K and the test system before starting it up. Questions or Comments? View this thread in our forums!

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Amy Schumer Is Dangerous To Google Posted: Sep 28 2016, 10:10am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, Updated: Sep 28 2016, 10:34am CDT, in News | Latest Celebrity News   Photo Credit: Getty Images Gallery 11 images   Comedian Amy Schumer is more "badass" than Justin Bieber. Do you have ot what it takes to google Amy Schumer? As a celebrity you know you have made it, when McAffee is putting your name on top of the most dangerous celebrities to search on the Internet. Don't Miss: The Black Friday Deals to Buy now on Amazon Amy Schumer knocked electronic dance music (EDM) DJ Armin van Buuren off of the list to become the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according to Intel Security. Now in its 10th year, the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study, published by Intel Security, researched a broad list of well-known figures including actors, comedians, musicians, TV hosts, athletes and more. This research uncovers which celebrities generate the most dangerous search results that could expose fans to viruses and malware while searching for the latest information on today’s pop culture icons. Amy Schumer is considered to be one of the most popular female comedians who is also known for her work as a writer, actress and producer. Now Schumer can add “first female comedian to take the No.1 spot on the McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities study” to her list of achievements. Justin Bieber came in hot on her heels at No. 2, followed by “Today” and “The Voice” host Carson Daly (No. 3). Schumer is also accompanied by comedian peers in the top 10 with Chris Hardwick (No. 7) and Daniel Tosh (No. 8). Former rapper turned Hollywood A-lister Will Smith is joined by chart-topping musicians such as Rihanna (No. 5), Miley Cyrus (No. 6), Selena Gomez (No. 9) and Kesha (No. 10), rounding out the top 10 list. Amy Schumer appeared this week on Netflix's Chelsea. Amy Schumer and Chelsea Handler talked about the problems of becoming famous. Malware is now another problem for Schumer. A search for ‘Amy Schumer Torrent’ results in a 33% chance of connecting to a malicious website. If you have 'torrent' in your query, you have it coming though. Savvy cybercriminals continue to leverage consumers’ ongoing fascination with celebrity news – such as award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more – to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information. The study conducted by Intel Security highlights the various ways hackers can take advantage of consumers’ interest around pop culture news, the risks of their online behavior and how to best protect themselves from potential threats. “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware. As a result, consumers need to understand what precautions to take to enable safe online experiences.” Intel has a couple of tips on how to stay safe when searching for Amy Schumer. How to Search Safely Think before you click! Are you looking for the latest episode of Amy Schumer’s TV show, “Inside Amy Schumer”? Don’t click on that third-party link. Instead, get your content directly from the original source at comedycentral.com to ensure you aren’t clicking on anything that could be malicious. Use caution when searching for “torrent.” This term is by far the riskiest search term. Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. It’s best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available. Keep your personal information personal. Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to steal your personal information. If you receive a request to enter information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login don’t give it out thoughtlessly. Do your research and ensure it’s not a phishing or scam attempt that could lead to identity theft Browse safely using protection like McAfee WebAdvisor software. WebAdvisor will help keep you safe from malicious websites by helping to identify potentially risky sites. A complimentary version of the software can be downloaded at mcafee.com/mcafeewebadvisor Use cross device protection. Consumers need to protect all facets of their digital lives regardless of where they are, what device they use or where they store their personal data. Use solutions that work across all your devices to deliver protection against threats, such as malware, hacking and phishing attacks.

Image: Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock A list of celebrity names used most often to spread malware has been released, with Amy Schumer, Justin Bieber, Carson Daly, Will Smith and Rihanna as the top five. Intel has named Amy Schumer as the most dangerous celebrity to search online, with the company’s McAfee ranking finding the comedian’s name linked to a growing number of malware-hosting websites. The table lists which celebrities generate the most dangerous search results, exposing users to viruses and malware through casual browsing, by landing on dodgy, third-party web pages. “Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news,” said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. “With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks.” Cybercriminals, said Davis, know our browsing habits all too well, attempting to lead us to “unsafe sites loaded with malware”. What is perhaps most interesting is how torrents are being targeted, with a simple search for ‘Amy Schumer Torrent’ resulting in a one-in-three chance of landing on a malicious website. Intel’s advice is to keep it all legit, by using original sources rather than third-party content. With Amy Schumer, for example, watching her show on Comedycentral.com is far more advisable than some other streaming website. Of course, given the internationally bordered access to content on legitimate websites, this is not always the easiest thing to do. Avoiding torrents is another nugget of Intel’s advice, noting the difficulty in determining just how safe a downloaded file is. “It’s best to avoid using torrents, especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available,” said the company. The top 10 celebrities from this year’s study with the highest risk percentages include: Amy Schumer Justin Bieber Carson Daly Will Smith Rihanna Miley Cyrus Chris Hardwick Daniel Tosh Selena Gomez Kesha Amy Schumer.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 27, 2016 at 8:41PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has long been known for its chip-manufacturing prowess relative to competitors. Its manufacturing technologies have often offered better performance than the competition, and it has usually been able to bring denser technologies -- that is, technologies that allow chip designers to pack more functionality into a given area -- to the market sooner than its competitors. However, in recent years, Intel's chip manufacturing peers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) have been working to try to narrow the gap. During the next couple of years, Intel is certainly going to face something of a public relations/perception nightmare as its chip-manufacturing peers transition to technologies that they refer to as "7-nanometer" -- usually smaller is better -- around the time when Intel will be in production on a technology that it calls "10-nanometer." Although there's more to a chip-manufacturing technology than density, it's a relevant metric that has a direct impact on the capabilities that these companies can, cost-effectively, put into their chip designs. A question that's worth pondering, then, is the following: Will Intel be able to maintain chip-area leadership with its 10-nanometer technology even as competitors transition to their "7-nanometer" technologies? I think the answer to that is "yes." Here's why. Comparing TSMC's public statements with Intel's I consider TSMC to be Intel's fiercest and most capable competitor. It's the world's most successful contract chip manufacturer, and over the last several generations, it has executed brilliantly in ramping new manufacturing technologies into production in support of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A-series processors. In contrast, Samsung has lost Apple's business, and is even reportedly actively shifting focus away from contract chip manufacturing in favor of display manufacturing. In light of this, I think the most interesting discussion is one in which we look at Intel's and TSMC's public statements head-to-head. A metric that Intel uses (publicly) to compare the relative densities of two manufacturing technologies is gate pitch multiplied by cell height. (A visual representation can be found below.) Image source: Intel. Intel says that, using this metric, its 10-nanometer technology offers "close to a full generation lead in logic density," as illustrated in the slide below: Image source: Intel. Intel also claims that its 10-nanometer technology provides better than its historic 0.46 times scaling factor relative to its 14-nanometer technology, though the chipmaker doesn't specify by how much. In the table below, I show the gate pitch multiplied by minimum metal pitch -- a similar metric that Intel and others have used in the past in place of gate pitch multiplied by cell height -- for several Intel and TSMC technologies, as well as my projections. This is based on Intel's and TSMC's public statements for what future technologies will bring:   Intel TSMC 14nm/16nm 3640 5760 10nm <1674 ~2880 7nm N/A ~1766 Data sources: Intel and TSMC. At the 14/16-nanometer generation, Intel had a clear lead over TSMC in terms of density. TSMC says (via EETimes) that it will go into mass production on its 10-nanometer technology by the end of the year, and that it will provide a 50% area reduction compared to its 16-nanometer technology. TSMC's 10-nanometer technology should be superior to Intel's 14-nanometer technology in terms of chip area, and it should be in mass production before Intel's 10-nanometer technology. At 10 nanometers, Intel should see a scaling factor of something smaller than 0.46 times, per its own statements, resulting in the <1674 figure given in the table above. According to EETimes, TSMC claims that its 7-nanometer technology will offer a 1.63 times the density of its 10-nanometer technology -- an implied scaling factor of ~0.613 times. Intel should have a slight area lead Based on the analysis above, Intel's 10-nanometer technology should have a slight area lead over TSMC's 7-nanometer technology. What this means is that Intel's marketing claims that it's almost a generation ahead of TSMC are virtually worthless because TSMC's 10-nanometer technology should be in mass production before Intel's. In fact, in terms of timeline, TSMC's 7-nanometer technology is expected to go into mass production in the first quarter of 2018 -- approximately two quarters after Intel begins mass production of its 10-nanometer technology. (Intel's first 10-nanometer chips should go on sale in the fourth quarter of 2017 according to leaks, implying mass production starting in the third quarter of 2017). The reality is that, in terms of chip area scaling, Intel is likely to have a roughly six-month lead over TSMC. This, in the scheme of how long these technologies are expected to remain leading edge, is just not all that long. The good news for Intel is that, contrary to the marketing labels that TSMC (and other contract chip manufacturers) assign to their technologies, it won't actually fall behind its competition in terms of chip area scaling. The days of Intel having a substantial leadership position in this metric, though, are likely long gone.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

European automakers today joined forces with Qualcomm, Intel, and several mobile phone manufacturers in a bid to define how 5G cellular networks will talk to cars. The companies created the 5G Automotive Association, whose members include Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, Huawei, Intel, Nokia, and Qualcomm. Noticeably absent are Apple and Google, which have been working on their own versions of autonomous vehicles and in-car communications, like Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. The 5G association will look primarily outside the vehicle, to "address society's connected mobility and road safety needs with applications such as connected automated driving, ubiquitous access to services and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation" as Intel put it in a press release. Faster and more robust networks are the foundation of all those efforts, and the association's members have already been clamoring to define standards for 5G networks, on their own and via other partnerships. But today's announcement appears to offer a roadmap for technological details. //Related Articles What Is 5G? The association will work on defining standards for what's referred to in the connected auto industry as "vehicle-to-everything" communication. It will also address how cars and phones will work together. "The creation of this association demonstrates the clear need for a cross-sector-collaboration between mobile industry and car industry for joint innovation, and to establish a platform to align on timeline and priorities and solution road maps," Huawei research director Li Yingtao said in a statement. The association is also unique because it includes Intel and Qualcomm, which until now have mostly been arch rivals in the race to develop 5G standards. Qualcomm, whose modems and other components are already in a vast number of connected devices, is working with manufacturers and telecom operators on testing 5G. At its developers conference in August, Intel said it would begin the bulk of its 5G trials in 2018.

Nasdaq recently released the latest short interest data for the August 15 settlement date, and several prominent semiconductor stocks saw significant gains in bearish bets. The largest semiconductor company in the world, Intel Corp. (INTC), saw its short interest rise increase to 75.47 million shares, up from a prior level of 66.39 million. That 13.67% rise in short interest was the highest gain among all semiconductor names in the latest period. Intel represents nearly 16% of the total holdings within SMH, so an INTC pullback would have a large effect on the ETF. SMH – Top Holdings Symbol Company % of Total INTC Intel Corp 15.79% TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 15.04% QCOM QUALCOMM Inc 8.7% AVGO Avago Technologies Ltd 5.55% TXN Texas Instruments Inc 4.93% NVDA NVIDIA Corp 4.66% ASML ASML Holding NV 4.56% AMAT Applied Materials Inc 4.43% NXPI NXP Semiconductors NV 4.33% MU Micron Technology Inc 4.02% QUALCOMM, Inc. (QCOM), which is SMH’s third largest holding at 8.7%, also saw its short interest grow to 21.43 million shares in the latest period, up from 20.92 million. Other semiconductor names to see short interest grow recently were Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) (14.62 million shares vs. 12.86 million) and Micron Technology (MU) (77.14 million shares vs. 74.12 million). It remains to be seen if the elevated short interest in these names will put downside pressure on their share prices, but investors in these individual stocks — as well as ETFs that have large exposure to them — might find it useful to monitor the situation. So far today, the higher short interest in semi stocks isn’t affecting SMH. Those shares rose $0.63 (+0.95%) to $67.00 in Tuesday morning trading. The largest semiconductor-focused ETF currently has about $567 million in assets under management, and is the fourth best performing fund in the Technology Equities category this year.

Intel Core i5 vs. Core i7: Which processor should you buy? By Joel Hruska on September 27, 2016 at 11:26 am Comment Whether you’re building your next PC or shopping for a new computer online, one of the questions that comes up from time to time is whether the Intel Core i5 or Core i7 is a better bargain. The short answer, “It depends,” isn’t all that helpful, so we’ve broken the data out in more detail and for both mobile and desktop processors. Here’s what you need to know. Desktop Core i5 vs. Desktop Core i7 Intel’s Skylake (6th generation) differentiation and feature sets haven’t really changed much since Haswell (4th generation). The Core i7 features quad-cores with Hyper-Threading enabled and Intel’s HD Graphics 530 solution. The Core i5 family offers quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, and either HD Graphics 530 or 510 GPUs. Most people, including gamers, should be fine with a Core i5 desktop CPU. Core i7 chips tend to help more with engineering, video editing, audio post-production, and other tasks that require as many processor threads as possible. For graphics, the HD Graphics 510 has 12 execution units (EUs), while the 530 has 24. Avoid the 510 in any case where you intend to do anything substantial with the GPU. But the long-standing rule of thumb remains true: No Intel chip is particularly strong in the graphics department, apart from the EDRAM-equipped Iris Pro variants (none of which exist in socketed consumer hardware). Enthusiast gamers should always opt for a discrete GPU. One significant difference between the desktop and mobile markets (the latter of which we’ll get to below) is how Intel positions Hyper-Threading. Almost all of  Intel’s desktop Core i5 chips across the last six desktop product generations are all quad-cores without Hyper-Threading, while its Core i7 family consists of quad-cores with Hyper-Threading. (Intel’s Core i5-4570T is the single exception to this — it’s a dual-core + Hyper-Threading chip.) Older Core i5 / Core i7 chips top out at 32GB of RAM, but Skylake raises this to 64GB for both types of processor. What about desktop PC performance? To compare performance between the Core i5 and Core i7 families, I turned to Anandtech’s excellent CPU Bench database. While AT doesn’t have records on every chip released by Intel or AMD, they’ve got a solid selection of comparable parts. I opted to check the Core i5-4690K versus the Core i7-4770K. The 4770K has Hyper-Threading, a base frequency of 3.5GHz, can Turbo up to 3.9GHz, and has 8MB of L3 cache. The Core i5-4690K has the same clock speed, but no Hyper-Threading and just 6MB of L3 cache. That’s about as perfect a match-up as you can ask for. The graph below was generated by comparing Core i5 and Core i7 in each and every benchmark and taking the geometric mean of the results. This diminishes the impact of outliers, though in this case, the arithmetic and geometric means are quite close to each other. I’ve split the data into three sections — general compute, gaming performance with 1x GTX 770, and gaming performance with the GTX 770 in SLI. Aggregate performance between the Core i5-4690K and Core i7-4770K. Data from Anandtech CPU bench There are some differences in the data sets that we need to discuss. The aggregate General Purpose ratio doesn’t reflect the impact Hyper-Threading can have on various applications. There are a number of applications where Hyper-Threading makes no difference, a handful where it decreases performance (though never by more than 8 percent) and a several benchmarks that show gains of 10-30%. If we set a 3% threshold for a tying score, Hyper-Threading gives the Core i7 a win in 21 out of 36 tests. It ties the Core i5 in 14 tests, and loses to it outright in just a single benchmark (x264). In workstation and consumer CPU workloads, Hyper-Threading sometimes helps a lot, sometimes doesn’t help much, but almost never hurts. Gaming, however, is a different animal. In gaming, Hyper-Threading never offers a single performance boost, while it impacted BioShock Infinite’s minimum FPS by 11% (meaning the Core i5 outscored the i7). The net effect is a 2% performance decrease for Hyper-Threading. In SLI gaming, we see a similar pattern, though this time it’s different games that take performance hits. The minimum frame rate for Sleeping Dogs was 10% faster on the Core i5 (56 vs. 61.8) and 5% faster in BF4 (86.4 vs. 82.9). What this means, in aggregate, is that while Hyper-Threading probably doesn’t hurt gaming in most titles, you can’t depend on it to offer a significant performance boost, either. While the above comparison uses older data from Haswell, there’s nothing about Skylake or Broadwell that changed the Core i5 / i7 comparison point. You can assume that the same metrics hold true for these chips as well — namely, that the Core i5 offers an equivalent level of performance. What about AMD? AMD isn’t a formal part of this article, but since I know people will ask, I took a look at how the FX-9590 compares against the Core i5-4690K. The news is not particularly good. There are a few well-threaded benchmarks where AMD can shine, including WinRAR, x265 encoding, multi-threaded Cinebench (both 11.5 and R15) and 7zip. The FX-9590 is utterly incapable of matching the 4690K’s single-threaded performance, which means AMD loses every test that can’t scale to eight cores or is single-threaded to start with. The gap between AMD and Intel in game benchmarks is much smaller than in general CPU performance. AMD’s FX-8350 and FX-9590 are capable of pushing perfectly acceptable frame rates. But the FX-9590 never outclasses the Core i5-4690K in any test. If you’re building a gaming box and you want to go AMD, you absolutely can — but pound for pound and watt for watt, the Core i5 wins this competition. Mobile Core i5 vs. Mobile Core i7  (Skylake, Kaby Lake) Mobile users now have three distinct choices to make, which clouds the issue a bit. There are previous-generation Core M chips as well as new Core i7 and i5 processors. The Core M chips are now limited to the m3 family — Intel has taken what used to be a distinct brand and folded it into the Core i7 and Core i5 families instead. This creates situations like the one shown below. These two chips look similar, with the same cache, almost the same clock speed, and similar GPUs — but they have different operating TDPs and hence offer different user experiences. Exactly how different isn’t something we can speak to without test hardware, but past systems showed marked variation depending on OEM design and thermal limits. To date, Core M hasn’t done particularly well — OEMs often saddled the processors with aggressive high-resolution displays and extremely thin chassis, leading to mediocre battery life. The Core i5 is in a similar situation: If you’re looking at the Core M-branded Core i5, we strongly recommend doing your homework and checking reviews of specific systems. Core M systems can deliver better battery life than their i5/i7 counterparts, but this will depend on the specifics of the manufacturer. Remember, high-resolution screens and ultra-thin systems with limited battery life will cost you just as much in power savings as you can get with a lower-TDP CPU — possibly more these days, since high-end chips account for a decreasing amount of power consumption. The other major difference we want to discuss is the newfound gap between Core i7 and i5 core counts on mobile. Prior to Skylake (6th gen), almost all Intel chips on mobile were dual-core below the Core i7 level. Now, there’s a group of Core i5 mobile parts that offer quad cores without Hyper-Threading support, as shown below: The difference between these three cores is that one of them supports Intel’s Iris Pro Graphics, while the other two are Intel HD Graphics-only. The Iris Pro 580 is Intel’s only EDRAM-equipped 128MB  Core i5. If you want a mobile processor with top-end graphics and a quad-core CPU, this is the Core i5 you want to purchase. Outside of these three cores, the general rule does still follow. Most mobile Core i5 and all Core i3 processors are dual-core with Hyper-Threading. Here are the features that separate mobile Core i5 and Core i7 processors: More cores: Many of Intel’s Core i7 processors are quad-core chips with Hyper-Threading enabled. This isn’t universal, however, and the company does offer a few dual-core + Hyper-Threading SKUs. Higher clocks: Intel’s dual-core mobile Core i7 chips typically have higher clock speeds than their Core i5 counterparts, even at the same TDP. More cache: Core i7 chips carry either 6MB or 4MB of cache. Core i5 chips run the gamut here. Older chips (pre-Broadwell) often carry 3MB, while Skylake and Kaby Lake chips are sometimes 4-6MB. The extra cache has only a small impact on performance. More addressable memory: Many older mobile Core i7 and i5 processors are limited to 16GB of memory, but there are Skylake (6th-gen) chips that support 32GB and even 64GB on some late Core i5 / i7 models. 16GB of RAM is fine for the vast majority of users. But if you think you might need more, check what your CPU is capable of at Intel’s database. How much performance you get out of a mobile Core i5 versus a Core i7 will depend a great deal on your laptop’s cooling solution and whether the chip can handle its own heat output. We’ve previously discussed how Intel gave OEMs more freedom to define their own TDP targets and skin temperatures. But this creates scenarios in which buying a faster Core M can actually result in worse performance, as the chip hits its thermal trip point and down-throttles to keep cool. Intel’s highest-end Iris Pro graphics are available in both Core i5 and Core i7 mobile SKUs We can’t point to specific instances where this has tilted performance between Core i5 and Core i7 chips, but it’s likely to create at least a little “slosh” between the two core families. Generally speaking, if you truly want to emphasize low power, pick the CPU that has lower base and turbo clocks. Intel historically defined TDP as “The CPU’s average power consumption when running typical workloads over a period of time.” A chip with more headroom is a chip that’ll hit its throttle point faster. Which chip should you buy? Right now at Newegg, Core i5 chips are running as low as $185 for the Haswell-based Core i5-4430, while the cheapest Skylake is $189 for the Core i5-6400. The Haswell is the better buy, with a 3GHz base clock, but the platform is older and you won’t be able to upgrade to a faster chip at a later date — assuming anyone still bothers. It’s a little surprising to see how much Haswell hardware is still in-channel. It’s been a year since Skylake launched and Intel normally turns its stock over fairly quickly. The cheapest Core i7 chip, in contrast, is $295 at Newegg for the Core i7-4770S, and there’s not much to recommend the Core i7 over the Core i5 family if you want to play games or do basic desktop work. The Core i7 can be faster, but many consumer applications top out around four threads. Many have hoped that AMD’s Zen will reinvigorate this market, but until that chip formally launches we’re stuck with the product roadmap Intel offers, and the Core i5 is the better deal for most people. Over a year ago, I wrote that DirectX 12 could offer the Core i7 a chance to prove itself, but we have yet to see that happen in the titles that have shipped to date. DirectX 11 and DX9 will remain important APIs for years to come, which means we have to wait and see which titles offer DX12 support and how it changes the Core i5-versus-Core i7 comparison. It’s harder to make this call on mobile. Poor cooling will cripple any laptop, and some of the boutique laptops on the market are sold with CPUs that they can’t possibly keep cool. I tend to favor the Core i5 over the Core i7 for mobile gaming because it helps preserve battery life and still offers good overall performance. CPU choice is just one element of a laptop — just be aware that higher-end CPUs may not deliver much of their expected performance if the chassis isn’t well designed for the chip it’s carrying. If you’re considering a laptop with a Kaby Lake or Skylake chip, as opposed to something older, I’d tend to go for the platform with the newest components and lower-resolution display if you want to maximize battery life, and the strongest GPU if you want to maximize gaming performance. The gap between Haswell and Skylake is irrelevant as far as gaming is concerned, while the difference between a GTX 970M and 960M is much larger.

Jeffrey Sickels I3’s do deliver. I’m still using a Sandy Bridge i3 2120 (3.3ghz) even for modern gaming. It’s been flying since early 2012. Kawaii Kurumi I agree i also have the i3 – 2100 but it does face some trouble when playing some games such as Far Cry 4 and all that and the PCI.E. is limited to generation 2 VirtualMark i7 if you can afford it. /article. close Even if you afford it it’s a waste of money if you don’t *need* it. You’re paying for something that you’re not using. Yes, you could argue that maybe you’ll need it in the future when it will spare you another upgrade and you may be right. But there are people using their computers in fixed scenarios and their performance needs won’t change until the next major OS upgrade which will come in the form of a new PC with new OEM license. Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it? Or would you stick to an i3-i5 because it’s already more than they’ll ever need? Crunchy005 Yep. For basic computer usage I would not buy anything over an i5 and I feel i3s are fine for that stuff, assuming a decent clock speed. Or even an AMD APU for that matter. The Hyperthreading is always nice but most gamers won’t use it that’s true, but lets be real here, gamers want the big core for benchmark numbers. I game and have the 4790k but I also have a minecraft server running in the background while I game and stuff so the extra threads are not a bad thing. Also the HT is really nice when i encode videos as well. Sunset Rider For basic computer usage you don’t even need anything above a Celeron, that’s what they’re for, basic computer usage. Buying an i5 would be overkill for basic usage, and it’s a waste of money because you don’t *need* it. MetusBatmanV3 You don’t need a large house, right? You don’t use every room in your house every moment of the day, right? You’re just wasting money because you don’t need the extra room, right? Why not build a house so the space is used all the time? Exactly, it makes zero sense because sometimes you need to do activities inside your house that requires more room than normal. Living in a tiny house isn’t the same as living in a house bigger than needed, right? That is why I buy a processor that can handle anything I’ll ever use it for, because I want to know that when the time comes I can complete the task in the least amount of time possible. Time is money, right? Lonnie Veal On point! But a lot of people, even techies, have unconsciously been co-opted by the Marketing Depts. i3 is slower than i5 is slower than i7 which is the best…because it costs the mostest? I regularly have arguments with staffers who insist they need an i7…even though all they are doing is regular office work…(I smile and tell them that if I Blocked all the Shopping websites, their i3 machine would operate even FASTER, BTW ;-) Paul Franklin Well said. Lonnie. I wish the Hardware industry had to abide by the same rules the canned food industry does… that is provide the price in terms of price/unit of speed. Not that I cant do the math. Usually the 80 20 rule applies, so buying the second tier product will provide the biggest ROI. MetusBatmanV3 Do you need a large house? No? So why are you complaining? Why not build a single room to live in? You can hush now. VirtualMark “Would you buy a 6-core i7 for your parents’ browsing machine just because you can afford it?” I’d tell them to buy the best CPU they can afford, it’s a fairly simple approach. The more powerful the system, the better the future proofing. Newer software tends to run slower on older systems, so I always like to get the best CPU for my budget. spoffle Afford and need aren’t the same thing. A lot of people could “afford” to go down the x99 route, but wouldn’t ever derive any benefit from doing so because they don’t push their hardware enough to make it a sensible choice. VirtualMark Nobody needs a computer for survival, all we need is oxygen, water and food. So what’s your point exactly? spoffle You know full well what my point is, don’t play dumb. Sunset Rider No he makes a good point, you don’t *need* anything faster than an 8 year old Core 2 Duo for basic web-browsing and Office. Actually you could get away with something even less powerful. spoffle This is exactly the point I’m making. VirtualMark You don’t have a point as far as I’m concerned. I could use DOS on an 80s computer if I wanted, but I work for a living and can afford a much more powerful machine. So I like to get the best CPU as I like to be able to run present and future software as smoothly as possible. spoffle You aren’t concerned at all, relative to my point, because you aren’t being sensible. There is a ratio of cost versus benefits, and for that vast majority of people who do very basic stuff with their PCs, by the time they actually needed the performance that a high end i7 offers, something new will be out that’s so much better that their i7 is long irrelevant in terms of the performance it offers. For example, look at how long a Q6600 stayed relevant in terms of the level of performance it offered versus what was necessary to perform basic tasks. With your method, most people are going to be wasting money. Joel Hruska The Q6600 was a damned good chip. Meaningfully good for years thanks to solid single-threading and fairly good scaling. I got one of the later G0 steppings and took it up to 3GHz. It wasn’t quite as fast as the Extreme Editions of the day, but it also cost a lot less. spoffle Most definitely, I ended up with a really good one that I could get to 4ghz. I actually got 5 years of use out of mine before I managed to sell it for a third of the price I bought it at. I’ve never known a CPU to deprecate so slowly. Matt Menezes My wife’s computer gets my hand-me-downs, and she has a Q6600 @ 2.8ghz (just because I didn’t want to raise voltage), 8GB DDR2, and a Radeon 6950 2GB. It can maintain 30FPS at 1080P with medium-high settings in most RPG games she likes (no ultra settings, no AA). Honestly, I can’t believe the legs the Q6600 has had – and to think that was the first quad-core CPU for consumers!! Joel Hruska I mean, there are now much faster CPUs — the Q6600 is probably about half the speed of a modern high-end Intel processor. But as far as longevity, yeah, that core was hard to beat. :) Matt Menezes Exactly. I could have spent hundreds upgrading the CPU, mobo, and RAM, but instead I jacked a bit of memory from a decommissioned computer at work and gave her decent hand-me-down GPUs whenever I upgraded mine. I didn’t want to spend money, I wanted to build a box for her with spare parts on a solid platform, and I’m just amazed that the thing is even relevant all these years later. cr1swell I’m still using my G0 Q6600, got it up to 3.915Ghz cpu-z validated as well. I’m still running my golden chip, but it’s finally showing it’s age. But for 175 bucks, this thing has done way more than I have paid for it. Maverick Leo I have 2 desktop that runs on Core 2 Quad 8600 on Intel board with 8Gb DDR2. It’s almost a decade old. When I bought it, it was for Photoshoping, Corel, Vegas other stuff, sans gaming. It already underwent several VCard, HDD and PSU replacement. And still working. I bought it for its power, and it never fails. My point here, future proofing can be relative, gladly I am already taking advantage of it. Four (4) years into service, Memory and CPU technology have gone too, far. There’s not much we can do. VCard might be upgraded but only few applications can took advantage of CUDA power that I USE in my shop. (e.g. CS6, Nero, MSO13, AutoCAD, Vegas, and a few free apps, thanx to Linux community). So, yes, you’re right. Buy computers for its intended purpose. Think a decade ahead, consider what module that will last into the future, and what needs replacement that will still be supported by then. Think SATA, PCI-E, etc. MetusBatmanV3 “benefits” is subjective, you clown. Get off your high horse and stop trying to dictate how other people spend their money. Spoffle Well you’ve completely misunderstood what I’ve said, so yeah, no. Huhster “but I work for a living and can afford” And yes we all get your point, but Spoffle still makes a very good point and you are just being childish and snarky in return. VirtualMark He makes the same tired point over and over again, and it all comes down to cost. Which was exactly my point – if you can afford the i7 then buy it. A faster computer is better than a slower one, end of story. And the rest of your comments don’t even deserve a reply, so I’d suggest that you conduct yourself like an adult if you wish to continue this discussion. Phobos I don’t know how can you be such a troll magnet yet it’s hilarious how you crush them with an ease . VirtualMark Lol it’s quite funny really. They all act smart, then start talking about cost, which just goes back to my original point. close Ok, maybe you weren’t the best example. I was thinking more of a person who can actually answer the question :). So it’s basically like you asking “what should I do to solve this problem” and getting the answer “whatever you can”. VirtualMark As you haven’t made any relevant points, your tacit concession on the matter is accepted. close Well the educational system isn’t what it used to. Come on, I don’t expect you to know anything about CPUs but not even language? Tacit? Concession? This is what you gather from me telling you that you know sh|t? Sarcasm won’t help you, I feed on the tears of people like you :)). That’s because every time you try to feel good about yourself with a witty remark I just pop up with some facts (hope you don’t need a thesaurus for this one) to put you down. I also bore pretty easily so try to keep up. Your “one-line” idea is plain wrong no matter how you put it. “The most expensive CPU you can afford” is not necessarily the fastest or best so you just cost you parents an extra $60 (or 80 pounds which is worse) and got them a weaker CPU. Way to go son. Also it implies that your parents understand that there will be higher costs in the rest of the platform (like a dedicated graphics card, more powerful PSU, more expensive motherboard, more expensive RAM, more expensive cooling system) and also operational costs (like more power consumption). You just cost your parents another $1000 just so they can get that slower CPU that is already more than they need, plus a few bucks extra each month on electricity and a noisier PC. They just wanted a browsing machine son and they gave you the best they had all your life. Why couldn’t you give them proper advice so they don’t end up spending that money with no tangible benefit? They could have gone on a nice trip with the money you let them spend for nothing because you didn’t care enough to send them to someone who knows this stuff, you ungrateful… So no matter how you put it, it’s either dumb or ignorant and any person spending their own money would confirm this ;). Just ask you parents and maybe they’ll give you a smarter answer than the one you were prepared to give them. VirtualMark Wow, now I see that you’re just plain stupid. I would have thought that it was obvious that a higher powered CPU would require more power and better cooling, and that the cost would be higher, and didn’t really feel the need to spoon feed the obvious to you. Honestly I don’t know why the hell you’re even mentioning it, it’s laughable. And you’re still banging on about cost, which just goes back to my original point – if you can afford an i7 buy it. So thanks for proving my point. Anyhow, I’m bored of you now. Go away please and play with your i5, you little cheapskate. Huhster “you little cheapskate.” You are so obviously a teenage pro-troll using a “rig” your daddy bought you. close Ok Mr. DJ then how’s this: If somebody comes asking a washed up “DJ” for CPU advice (yeah, I know what you are, a 20 something guy who tries to imitate the big names in music, who sometimes calls himself a producer without actually producing anything original and plays around on his ripped off Ableton – best you can afford, right? ;)), if someone doesn’t know what CPU they need, they probably also know nothing about this and don’t realize that a better CPU needs more power, better cooling. They might also not realize that choosing a better CPU comes with a different socket so a much more expensive platform overall (MoBo, RAM, discrete GPU as the MoBo doesn’t have video output, even bigger PSU because of this). But you also don’t know this ;). So how are you expected to give someone else this info? You didn’t pay for your DAW so I guess now I know how you tricked your parents into paying for it: the most expensive they could afford. So, you keep it up. It’s no shame knowing shit in some areas. Well, it is when you try to sound smart and fail. But you keep it up ;). If you got over sucking in your field you can get over anything. But enough about this. The point was made. You can pay extra for nothing, or you can read the article and pay for what you need. To each his own. VirtualMark Lol what a nonsensical rant. You shouldn’t have edited your post, as your first one was better. Namely: “sometimes the more expensive CPU is not the fastest” Sometimes being the key word there, well done, you’re learning. Usually it is faster, but occasionally it isn’t. So the i7 is still the better processor. Anyhow, the rest of your post is entirely irrelevant, and as such, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. close Oh joy. You’re a glutton for punishment. No, the keywords here are “ignorant/dumb/uninformed” ;). If you pay for the most expensive thing you can afford and only ever use a fraction of that because you have no idea what you need or what you buy then you are ignorant at best. And to prove it I showed you that there are cases when not only do you not get to get more than you need, you actually get even less than you would have with the cheaper part. So you pay more for less. Does that sound like something a smart person would recommend? Not really, eh? It’s about as smart as buying 10 loaves of bread every day just for yourself (and implicitly throwing away 9) just because you can afford it. You’re still determined that more expensive is better but I think it’s pretty clear that you lack both common sense and knowledge. As for the “tacit concession”, you’re getting repetitive with stuff you don’t seem to understand. It’s probably what you have to do when you’re reminded that you tricked your parents into buying the most expensive computer they could afford for you just so you can play with knobs and sliders and call yourself a “producer”. Tacit enough? :)) VirtualMark Lol your angry rants are getting longer and longer, you appear to be repeating yourself, and as you havent brought up any further points, your tacit concession on the matter remains noted. And I now consider the discussion closed, and probably won’t be replying any further. But please, keep ranting, I’m sure someone will read it. close You read it, pissed you off, came back for more. You looked like an eager beaver until you realized I nailed your description. So to quote the only thing you managed to say in the last few days in trembling “voice” while having the horrible revelation that you suck even at trolling: your tacit admission that you’re a DJ wannabe who knows shit about CPUs is noted. Sleep on that ;). Huhster OHHHHHH! OH NO SHE DIDN’T. claudette.musser = Randall Snoddy back in 2007 i went for gold and got a q6600 still using it so if i had to do it again i would go for gold again and use it for many years again Kawaii Kurumi Yep agreed, why the heck would parents who just browse the web and watch a bunch of movies require an i7 to do the work??? An i3 is more that enough to handle all of that in todays world, just grab the 6th gen i3 and plug it and go play 4K movies its more than enough MetusBatmanV3 I guess since you make $8 an hour you don’t understand what it means to make six figures a year. Spending a few thousand on a computer is nothing. Mooki What a stupid remark to make after a article that actually shows you that that is certaintly not the case and that a i7 only Potentially could be faster in a end users specific situation. Unless you just throw money at anything that has a higher number and then simply trust it was the best performance you were buying based on that. These sort of articles are nothing new so for my game PC i bought a 2500K and OC’s it to 4.6Ghz. The money i saved by not buying a i7 has been been spend on better components elsewhere. VirtualMark You say it’s a stupid remark, then go on to say about money you saved. Don’t you see the irony in your statement? Lol… clearly money was your concern, so my comment still stands. close VirtualMark, it’s already pretty clear that you confuse price with performance and you can’t establish a usage baseline in order to correctly size your computer for your needs. You throw money at something you don’t need or use. You’re still free to do it just don’t expect it to be considered normal or best solution by any smart person. Ignorance is bliss but comes at a price. So your parents will end up buying a bulky, hot, power hungry $2500 computer thinking that they *need* it when a $500 NUC would have been enough. Coming back to performance and price: i7 4910MQ 3.9GHz, 8MB cache – $570. i7 4950HQ 3.6GHz, 6MB cache + better GPU and TSX-NI – $630. So… You may never use/benefit from TSX-NI instructions, you may never use an integrated GPU, but you can afford the extra $50-60 so you pay more to get a CPU that’s slower. Smart advice… VirtualMark Nice essay, and a cute attempt to appear intelligent. But it doesn’t change my opinion, I’ll still buy top end CPUs. And I’ll always recommend to my friends and family to buy the best system they can afford. Obviously if their budget was small, then the i5 would be the better option, but if they could afford more, then go for the i7. It’s simple enough really, which part don’t you get? As for making use of the full CPU features, generally newer software will make use of those, so it’s good to future proof. For example, I use a lot of VSTs, and some of them have recently been patched to make use of newer instruction sets, and run a lot faster for it. close Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion (you know the saying, they’re like as*holes, everybody’s got one). I just enjoy bringing some people down to earth the second they try throwing crappy sarcasm along with their crappy opinions in an attempt to give them some weight. Since your opinion revolves around price tags we can all assume your advice was totally crap, being free and all. I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower. And your only argument is that “generally… at some point… maybe… my VST software will be improved by a better integrated GPU and TSX-NI instructions”. Also, TSX-NI is permanently disabled through BIOS in most motherboards (you wouldn’t know that, you only know price tags). So that’s what you get for asking a guy who knows little to nothing about a field. It’s ok if you like throwing money at something you’re not using or if your friends have to come to you (of all people) to get such advice. But that will never make it “best option”. It just means that you cannot add any value to such a discussion or properly answer this question, that’s all. You’re the guy who knows next to nothing about whatever domain but tries to look informed: “What car should I buy? The most expensive you can afford.” or “What should I eat? The most expensive thing you can afford.” Etc. VirtualMark “Oh but I’m not trying to change your opinion” Clearly you’re trying your damned hardest, and failing badly. “I just showed you that the more expensive CPU is slower.” No you haven’t. close That’s because your parents didn’t spend enough time to educate you in reading and now you just want to get back at them by telling them to buy more expensive, slower stuff. It;s pretty simple. And I have shown you, you just weren’t able to understand even when I gave you specific product names and official prices. It’s common among the more ignorant population. Paul Nelson I agree they should always buy the best system that they can afford. But, the best system is not necessarily one with an i7. Benchmarks have proven that, in some scenarios, the i5 is as capable or more capable than the i7 and therefore the i5 would be the better system. Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved on using an i5 on installing better graphics, faster storage or a more efficient power supply. VirtualMark Lol, you just proved my point again. Hint: “Especially if the maker decided to use the money saved” Paul Nelson Not at all. Your original statement was “i7 if you can afford it. /article.” My point is that the i7 is not always the faster processor and therefore not worthy of the extra money. Just because you can afford it, does not make it the correct choice. Spending extra on an i7 hoping that it will last longer is a false economy. Chip technology changes. Take the change from Power PC to Intel in Apple Computers. You could have bought the best G4 machine available in 2004, because you could afford it, yet in 2005 the change to Intel wiped out that generation of processors and they soon became obsolete. But it’s fine, I could afford it. Didn’t make it the right choice though did it? VirtualMark Sorry but your incoherent rant proves nothing. You said that the i5 could be faster if you spent extra money on a graphics card, clearly you have no concept of how a PC works. A CPU is not a graphics card, nor is it faster storage. They are completely different parts, you utter fool. Paul Nelson Oh no, you called me a fool whilst completely misunderstanding what I wrote. That actually made me laugh out loud. VirtualMark That’s an interesting story. Tell me another one – what did you hope to achieve here? Did you expect to be able to convince me and change my opinion? Can’t you see that it was a year ago and that I’ve moved on? Can’t you see that I don’t care about a thing that you have to say? Go away please, no need to embarrass yourself any further. MetusBatmanV3 i7 has hyper-threading, if you can afford it, yes, it is the best processor. MetusBatmanV3 Really, so what exactly will be wiping out the i7 next year? MetusBatmanV3 i5 doesn’t have hyper-threading except for one i5 CPU. Which means if you want to take advantage of that technology i7 would be the way to go and if you can afford it what is the issue? Speed isn’t the only thing to consider. Huhster Back under your bridge, please stop feeding him. spoffle An article, an end, an i7. There’s more, but they’re the most obvious. tetriminos http://s24.postimg.org/4n5o666p1/Screenshot_from_2015_07_31_14_32_04.png some dude I kinda hope there’s benchmark where they test multiple application at the same time, and see if HT have any effect or not. most of people run multiple application, heck I play game and watch youtube at the same time. Lagittaja This is kind of relevant, Linustechtips video “CPU Cores for Gaming, Streaming, & Rendering Simultaneously – Is More Actually Better?” He used 5960X to simulate other CPUs. Scenario was gaming Far Cry 4 with rendering video, Twitch streaming, stream capture, AV scan in the background. It’s not a perfect test but pretty damn good showcasing the difference. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgDZKGA89I I personally have a i7-3770K@4.7Ghz and I chose it over the i5 as I am a heavy multitasker. Plex media server so gf might be watching TV show while I’m gaming and server is doing transcoding. And I backup all my movies/TV shows and shove them through Handbrake with my own best quality/low filesize profile. Gaming/streaming. Multiple VM’s running in Workstation 11 in the backgroun. And so on. I so much want a 8c16t CPU :( GranFaloSentado Obviously i7 was the smartest choice for you. But for the 99% of the population, an i3 or even an AMD APU is more than enough, since they won’t use virtualization or they won’t be streaming video while having a heavily queried DDBB or a webserver. Lagittaja Well that’s the thing. You choose the CPU based on your needs! And for 99% of the population, a modern dual core Celeron/Pentium is more than enough. Even an i3 is overkill.. Heck, if I didn’t do any transcoding/streaming or running multiple VM’s at the same time > a lowly dual core would be enough for me. And I’ve been there and done that.. Purchased a Celeron G530 after I sold my OC’d 2500K as a placeholder before I purchased the 3770K, this was before IVB had even launched. Had it for quite a few months (edit: actually 7½) and it’s crazy how much you get for so little money nowadays. Joel Hruska I don’t think 99% is true. I’ve used the dual-core chips you’re talking about, and while they’re faster than Atom, they’re not that fast. If I had to choose between a dual core Pentium/Celeron and an AMD chip, I’d take the AMD core. Much better graphics performance and better overall multi-threaded perf. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1497 (As an example). Lagittaja So you’re comparing a ~63€ Pentium to a top of the line APU costing 136€, or ~85$ vs 150$. Good job. Since you did that I might as well just go and do this since it’s pretty much the same price difference. http://anandtech.com/show/9320/intel-broadwell-review-i7-5775c-i5-5675c/7 hue hue hue And if you’d compare in similar price brackets your “better overall multi-threaded perf.” doesn’t hold true even the slightest. A6-7400K is almost the same price as the G3420 and the Pentium pretty much rapes that A6. http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1256?vs=1492 Or A10-7870K vs i3-4330 http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/1192?vs=1497 Joel Hruska You’re right, I should’ve made my point more clear. I would not buy a low-end dual-core chip of any flavor. Between the Core i3 and the A10, it entirely depends on how much GPU perf you want. If you want the fastest integrated GPU you can buy at that price point, I’d buy the A10-7850K. If you care more about power consumption and want a strong CPU core, I’d buy the Core i3. Vice Squeezer I got a I5 and play on steam and play pandora at the same time.. never a conflict between the two.. youtube I’ve done that too.. but on pandora the music never stops.. Arian Hajiakbar How is I7-4500? Recommended? Joel Hruska It’s not clear to me why the i7-4500U is considered an i7 at all. It’s a dual-core chip with HT, and its clock speed (1.8GHz base, 3GHz top) is not unusual. It can’t address more than 16GB of RAM and its onboard GPU is an Intel Graphics 4400, not the HD Graphics 4600 that most i7’s carry. (The difference between the two isn’t huge, but I’d expect 4600 on an i7.) I think I’d look for something else. happycube lie7’s annoy the heck out of me. Matt Menezes Haha, lie7…that got me… :-) Naum Rusomarov From my experience, the i7 is better on the desktop if you’re planning on running more than two processing tasks concurrently. If the opposite is true then the i5 is perfectly capable for day to day work. You could even go with the i3 and you will still be fine. Mooki a i7 will only be better in such a case if at least one of those programs benefits from HT. As you can see it could even lower performance. Naum Rusomarov As far as I know the i7 processors have four physical cores, with HT enabled you get 8 cores in total. The i5’s have two physical cores plus 2 virtual cores due to HT, so in total you have four cores detected by the OS. p.s. This is on the desktop. The mobile i5 and i7 are a different story. UPDATE: I was wrong. The i5 have 4 physical cores, but no HT enabled. Thanks to the comments below. :) Sunset Rider No, desktop i5’s have 4 physical cores = 4 logical cores, desktop i7’s have 4 physical cores + HT = 8 logical cores. Eduardo Larios i5 have 4 cores, not 2+ hyper threading. Matt Menezes I see what you’re saying, but that could be misunderstood. An i5 could easily handle Outlook, Word, Chrome w/ 10 tabs, Visual Studio, multiple Explorer windows, SQL Server Management Studio, and YouTube playing music in the background. I say this because my work machine is an i3 (3.4GHz, 2C/4T) and it handles all those tasks just fine. As long as you have a decent IO subsystem (enough memory and an SSD) so the CPU isn’t constantly waiting, you can multitask all day long with a CPU that can address 4 threads like an i5. Now, if you are talking about applications that soak up every bit that a core provides and spawn threads left and right, then you might want to step up to an i7. That being said, even if you are only running 3-4 single-threaded apps that each peg an entire core, the only thing an i7 will give over an i5 is the tiny clock speed advantage (since HT won’t help). thepaintsaint In short, to figure it out for yourself and learn more, go to ark.intel.com. bob lebart If the user/builder wanted to save some $, and was mostly gaming, or just doing one main task, an overclocked i5 is great value. As the article said, for a multi-purpose machine, more threads are always better. My pc serves as a trading station (6 monitors, 2 different heavy market-steaming trading programs running, incl CNBC, 2 chats, multiple browsers up!!) and at other times it’s a gaming machine- a non-overclocked i7 Haswell, 16 gb ram, nVidia SLI system, and handles it all with plenty of headroom. Oh, and how could I forget: Photoshop…sometimes with all the above stuff running! Vice Squeezer I have thinking of upgrading to a I7 but my I5 is still fricking fast.. but to have 32 gigs of ram is very tempting.. games in the future will be more and more demanding for power and speed.. Mooki I would not do that if i where you it is simply not worth it unless you have some specific aplications that would benefit of that and are important enough for you. If not you will be way better off upgrading your videocard or SSD or anything else you think you might need. Vice Squeezer I just did that getting a 980.. but feel I still need to up my ram from 8 to 16 also wanting an upgrade on my mother board that supports blueray and wi fi, my ausus is four years old. I tried one of those blueray usb plugs still doesn’t see my speakers which are plugged directly to my sound card. Wanting a prettier tower.. a see thru one.. because both video and sound cards lite up.. jimv1983 What does having an i5 have to do with having 32GB RAM? With a 64-bit CPU the theoretical limit is like 2 million TB of RAM. I thought the only thing that limits that is the motherboard. Joel Hruska No. Intel and AMD chips have limits on maximum addressable RAM due to memory controller limitations and market segmentation. Right now, top end Xeons can address up to 1,536GB of RAM per chip, but that requires ECC RAM. jimv1983 Interesting. I didn’t know that. Are there any motherboards out there that have enough RAM slots to have 1,536GB of RAM? The biggest RAM sticks I have seen are 16GB and the most slots I’ve seen on a motherboard is 24 for a max of 384GB. Joel Hruska 32GB sticks are on the market. A high-end Xeon, according to Intel, can support 6TB of RAM in a dual-socket solution and 12TB in a quad-socket. However, this doesn’t square with the listed spec sheet on Intel’s own website. SuperMicro makes a motherboard that it claims can support up to 6TB of RAM using riser cards and Jordan Creek technology. Given that the largest server DIMMs I see are 32GB, that only works out to 3TB of RAM. Presumably the other 3TB will be available once 64GB DIMMs are out. Tim Tian ECC, not Buffered? Joel Hruska The spec sheet just said ECC. I’m not sure how much registered memory is still in use. Didn’t Intel phase out its fully-buffered DIMMs? Tim Tian FB-DIMMs, yeah, but I think you still need the RDIMMs for the full load out with RAM. Can’t find any half decent info though. Tim Tian Looks like disqus ate my reply again. Pretty sure FB DIMMs are being replaced by LR DIMMs, but R DIMMs (or LR DIMMs) are still required for more than 3 or 4 per channel. jimv1983 It would all depend on what the uses are. If I was building a computer to do simple browsing, media viewing, very light simple games, etc then I’d get the i5. If I was building a computer to play high end games, professional video editing or 3D graphics rendering I’d get an i7. This question is like asking would you buy a compact sedan or a huge truck. It all depends on your uses. Idiot Inside, Moron Outside Sum it up. i5 for gaming and i7 for more CPU intensive tasks using programs that can utililse the cores and threads. DecksUpMySleeve If it’s a workstation of any sort, 4-6MB cache all the way for me. Other than that I seek the wattage to performance G-spot for the i7 series. For example the i7-860 had the best performance per watt at it’s time. As will the i7-6920HQ right around the corner. For a gamer a high i5 will feel similar to any i7, but if you do rendering, digital art or video processing a low i7 will shine. spoffle Performance per watt isn’t a very good metric, with how far a lot of i5 and i7 chips will overclock, performance per dollar with a typical overclock added into the equation is the more sensible metric. Joel Hruska Most workstation users *don’t* overclock. Unless you’re buying from a vendor that guarantees it, like BOXX. spoffle Maybe they don’t, but I’m one of the ones that do, else I’m missing out on a level of performance that I otherwise wouldn’t see for a number of years. My current workstation has a 4930K that comfortably overclocks to 4.6ghz. Nothing would come close to that for raw performance at stock except those mental 18 core $4500 Xeon you can get on 2011-3. DecksUpMySleeve Sensible for the willfully wasteful. spoffle In what sort of context? DecksUpMySleeve Overclocking in general drops the processing per watt while upping the frequency, the processing may go up 5% for a 9% power hike. They optimize the default base clocks for a reason, and that 5% gain usually only translates to a very marginal difference unless the system is already near cap. I myself ran my i7-860(years back) at 2.7 instead of the 2.86 base clock and left the turbo to deal with demand hikes, ran cooler and therein never throttled due to temp under load. Everything I threw at it ran like butter. I find a 1/2-2/3rds full SSD to make a larger difference than clock speed ever could. When friends came over and played on my rig they went home sad to log on elsewhere. But back to my initial point the means doesn’t justify the ends in most cases for OCing, modern CPUs aren’t that much of a bottleneck in most applications. One less background process comes to the same effect, it’s better to keep those well managed than to ever OC. I myself know nearly every process and either use Msconfig to take them off startup or manually kill them through task manager. Works like a charm, in effect a ghz saved is a ghz earned. From what I read of your post though you hiked a hex core 3.9 to a 4.6ghz so a 17% clock increase translating to probly a 11% processing gain. I’m guessing your workload is hefty enough to possibly require such beastliness(12mb cache) but most overclockers are simply overkilling it, hampering overall performance and stability. On a side note; Broadwell-E with Turbo boost 2 technology may be something of interest to you in Q1 2016, though replacing your current system might not be all that rational, but none the less interesting. Skylake-E’s X models may be your next reasonable purchase. spoffle You’re looking at it very narrowly though, and your scope of overclocking is, well pretty weak. I’m talking a decent overclock, not a weak one that’s barely over single digits. Any PC I’ve had for the last 10 years, I’ve managed a hefty overclock. I’m talking in the 30-50% range. A few percent is a waste of time and effort. Also, I’m not sure why you’re comparing an SSD to an overclock. They aren’t comparable. When you’re doing light tasks, an overclocked CPU will still step down its clock speed to match the demand, so you’re not going to notice an overclock much doing light menial tasks where you’re going to notice the big SSD improvements. I’m talking heavy demand situations, as I use my system as a workstation, by applying a hefty overclock, I get a level of performance I’d otherwise be waiting years for. Unless I went down the multi Xeon route, and not at all if we’re talking single threaded performance. On top of that, the power consumption increase is vastly overstated, and the reason why CPUs are clocked conservatively is because they want to sell people who don’t overclock, new chips that are faster. There have been IPC (instructions per clock) improvements over the last few years, but they’ve been fairly conservative. Each new Intel CPU range that comes out is clocked about 5% faster on average, and they’ve been consistently upping the clock speed at that sort of rate whilst making the above IPC improvents too, so in reality they’re being held back for a few reasons, to give lay people an upgrade path (profit, and why they keep changing sockets) and cooling, the semi professional hardware like x79 and x99 already run hotter anyway, and have got loads of headroom. That’s why they sell unlocked K variety chips. DecksUpMySleeve I’m not understating the gains of OC, just practical advisories for the everyday workstation. Also I’m not sure you read the most recent edit of my post. I agreed that in specific cases the gains were more practical. I’m also very aware of the IPC clock gains, but with Skylake really being the end of the road for a couple years it’ll be a decent investment on arrival not soon outmoded. VirtualMark I find it’s better to undervolt modern chips, as it allows them to run cooler and thus run at their turbo frequency more often. I’ve tested my 4700HQ and it can run constantly at turbo now, even though it’s a mobile chip. Tim Tian Hmm. Interesting. Did you use the limited unlock overclock as well? And how much were you able to undervolt (I’d like a ballpark for my 4770MQ so I don’t need to reboot that often)? VirtualMark I used the Intel Extreme Tuning Utility, and was able to set the multipliers for 1-4 active cores. The undervolt I’m currently running is -94mV, although this will vary from chip to chip. I undervolted my Core 2 Duo laptop too a few years back, and found that it ran about 10°C cooler. Tim Tian Now I’m curious whether you have Win Vista/7/8 on your laptop, or a old version that runs on XP. anyway, sue to unrelated issues, my big laptop is dead with a “BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO” every time. Think I messed something up with MSConfig.exe. Nothings helped so far :/ Dustymack Thats like asking if you would like a Ford Edge or a Mustang. Sunset Rider Two years ago when I built my last PC, I debated between the i5-4670k and the i7-4770k. I ended up going with the 4770k because I reasoned, “This PC is going to last me the next 4-6 years before I need to upgrade again. How much is $100 worth to me througout 4-6 years? How much is a faster CPU worth to me throughout 4-6 years?” Seeing as how I was already spending near $1500 on a new PC, i figured spending another $100 on the processor wasn’t such a bad idea for the next 4-6 years. It’s been two years and my usage pattern has varied wildy, from simple web-browsing, to playing the latest vidya games, to encoding raw 32 GB videos. I haven’t once said to myself, “Darn, I wish I had bought an i5 and saved $100.” lopo Future proof is still i5 for gaming. If you do lots of video editing, then i7 is for you. Actually even i3 can play every game you want to play without any problems. You just need good graphics card but you wont need i7 if you dont do video editing and stuff that needs more power from cpu and less power from gpu. Mike kizaberg I have a I7 4700hq for graphics design and gaming to be honest, i also do a lot of benchmarking, while watching very high res videos online to. It does the job that i want it to do, while for those who are looking to do the very basic on computers should not even get a i3 or i5, they should just go with a celeron in that case. Robert Foy I had a i5 that someone gave me for a gift, 3 months later ran into some money and bought a i7 3770k, and boy what a difference it made with games, especially Planetside 2 and others. If you can afford it, get an i7, i5 min. i3 or any dual core would be a waste. This is coming from a gamer’s POV btw, if your not a gamer, then go with whats the most efficient performance/cost wise. But if a gamer, go with i7, you won’t be disappointed. AlbiteTwins That’s odd. Most benchmarks show that a desktop i5 or i7 from the same generation don’t make too much difference for most games, Planetside 2 included. http://www.hardwarepal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/planetside-2-benchmark.jpg Was the i5 you replaced one of the those low power consumption models (i5-3xxxS or i5-3xxxT) ? BenjaminShade Xeon E3-1231 V3 you can pick up one of these for $210 from microcenter or $250 reatail, and I believe it is the same basic chip as the i7 4770. It isn’t overclock-able but with hyper-threading a 3.8gHz turbo and 32gb addressable memory i doubt you will care. Plus it is built to higher specs being enterprise class so the silicon will physically last longer. It also allows for ECC memory in case you are one of those crazies that want’s to run your computer 24/7 for something like i dunno mining of crypto currency’s. Last but not least you can drop it in any standard lga 1150 mobo. Conservative411 90% of people only NEED i5. vision33r Sandy Bridge i7 is a good bargain right now, pair with a nice solid ASUS mobo it can last forever and still competitive today. Philip Du Toit I came for the comments. *Grabs popcorn* J.L. Cannot but wonder why no compiler guru has yet come up with a technique to virtualize threading so a single thread application can benefit from AMD multi-threading capabilities. Kind of inverse Hyper-Threading. Let’s hope HSA will bring something similar to the market, similar to hot-air for now that is, indeed. okay well not ever …. http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/07/7263-2/ tetriminos the reality is, things haven’t changed much since sandy bridge see this graph of the difference between i5 2500K and i7 4790 http://s24.postimg.org/4n5o666p1/Screenshot_from_2015_07_31_14_32_04.png KB Kingsberry I’m not a Gamer, however, I will be working with 4k video editing. Would the core i5 do just as well as an i7? I learned that I need at least a core i5 processor just to be able to work. TKosh So it is dual core now again???? What happened to duo core? dual core used to be the chips before the duo cores. Dora Hi, I need a laptop for software engineering and GAME engineering. I can’t decide between 2 asus computers (f555UA-EH71#x555la) one has i7 and intel hd 5500, other has i5 but nvidia gtx. Which one should I choose?

News & Analysis Allied with Intel, CEA-Leti Shoots for Moon Junko Yoshida 9/27/2016 10:38 AM EDT 3 comments Login to Rate Tweet GRENOBLE, France — With the inexorable rise of apps and software driven by Google, Facebook and Apple, Silicon Valley has long since ceased to be about the substrate that made its name. Hardware is passé and, to the chagrin of many chip designers, it doesn’t get the credit it deserves. Furthermore, unless you’re Intel, the last giant still standing in the valley, a constant M&A cycle engulfing semiconductor companies one after another doesn’t give you the time you need to ponder long-term issues — like what comes next after CMOS. This transition, however, poses a possible opening for a Grenoble-based French laboratories called CEA-Leti, which is promoting itself as an important partner to Silicon Valley. As one of the world’s largest organizations for applied research in microelectronics and nanotechnology, CEA-Leti is exploring the future of semiconductors. With a team of research experts and leading-edge industrial equipment, the French institute is going after breakthroughs in microelectronics for which most medium to small Silicon Valley companies have neither the will, resources nor bandwidth. During an interview with EE Times last week here, Marie-Noëlle Semeria, CEO at CEA Leti, told us, in unequivocal terms: “Innovation still is in hardware.” She said, “You can tune software [that runs on chips] but software isn’t enough” to develop key differentiating technologies. Semeria, a soft-spoken CEO who got the top job two years ago, is on a mission. Quietly but doggedly, she is punching holes in the almost 50-year old French laboratory institute. Marie-Noëlle Semeria, CEA-Leti CEO Semeria, physicist by training, has made it her task to bring out the best of the CEA-Leti’s expertise, find partners to take Leti’s breakthrough technologies all the way to “solutions” or “products on the market,” and get its own researchers engaged in “moonshot” projects that matter to the whole world, as she explained. Moonshot The best example of the ongoing efforts at CEA-Leti is a new R&D agreement with Intel — signed last May. Semeria calls the five-year contract with Intel a “moonshot.” Included in the new research framework is a plan for Leti to provide technologies that enable next-generation communication for the Internet of Things. “Nobody — other than Intel — has asked us to do such ambitious research,” said Semeria. For Intel, CEA-Leti researchers must go beyond incremental improvements in IoT, she noted. “They are asking us to develop technology whose speed is much faster — by one order of magnitude,” meaning 10 times faster. Central to the cooperation is the development of “technology enabling future of communication,” described Semeria. The research includes wireless communication systems and faster exchanges, the integration of connected objects and the study of low-consumption communication technologies. CEA-Leti will also work on security technologies and 3D displays. Semeria said that Intel screened all the scientific reports and papers and recognized CEA-Leti’s competence in a variety of fields including RF, security, high-speed, low-power communications and others. The contract with Intel is too big a deal for CEA-Leti to under-deliver. Semeria acknowledges that developing “demonstrators” on each of those new technologies won’t be easy. But “that’s why this is a ‘moon shot’ for us,” said Semeria. It “challenges all of us.” She added that the collaboration with Intel forces everyone – both at CEA-Leti and Intel – to work in a much more interdisciplinary manner. While disclosing the exact results of each technology development will be left to Intel, Semeria said, “We can still share what we’ve learned along with way with other medium to small companies in France or Europe, who can neither drive nor pay for such an ambitious project.” Next Page: Adding horizontal dimension Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > More Related Links IoT Networks Start to Sprout Smartphone-Bound VR/AR to Be Boosted by Lasers Parc: IoT To Be Self-Powered, Flexible, Transparent Smart Homes & IoT: What About Bob?

A smart home, a smart factory or even the entire Tesla fleet are robots. On Intel, i wasn't taking a shot at them but they will have the tendency to try and push as much work as possible to the cloud. That tends to not work very well because device makers and their suppliers always try to do as much as possible on device. That's why we aren't all using thin or terminal clients today.

Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author I liked your IOT statement spike_johan   9/29/2016 4:15:14 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate @realjjj The IoT can - I suppose - be likened to a type of robot as it is at its most basic just interconnected sensors. Never thought of the IoT as a robot before. A novel thought. Your statement on Intel gave me pause as I think Intel has been doing a fine job of staying current and moving out of just being a server-class kind of company. They have not just been taking in other people's laundry (ARM) to keep its IC plants chugging along but the company has also made two very strategic purchases that has positioned the company to keep current with the changing times. In doing, Intel has made some brilliant moves and has effectively changed its (IA) Intel Architecture-centric view of the world - which demonstrates a huge leap forward, shedding past constraints; something other giants have stumbled over in the past - and instead has come to see itself for what it is: the world leader in IC manufacturing technologies. But really its even better than that. Intel can now choose between three different roles: it can be the architect (using it's own IA, or its new acquisition IP), or architect/builder (once again using it's own IA, or its new acquisition IP), or simply act as the builder. About a year ago it bought an FPGA company called Altera and just recently acquired another company called Nervana for its machine-learning technology. Intel didn't throw out the baby with proverbial bath water by thinking to replace the default ARM processors with its own IA. This was a smart move for a couple of different reasons: 1) going to IA would have been expensive and demonstrated that Intel couldn't think beyond using its own architecture, and 2) sticking with the ARM cores kept the existing Altera customer base happy. Intel acquired Nervana not specifically for its machine-learning ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) but more so for its machine-learning algorithms and tools. An interesting note is both FPGAs and ASICs are custom silicon that lend themselves – via the programmable logic blocks – into being engines optimized for running machine-learning algorithms. The way I understand it, machine-learning at a high level is about things like pattern recognition by being able to dynamically model complex statistical relationships among phenomena. More importantly stated, machine-learning is a precursor to artificial intelligence (AI). And everyone these days are building their own custom silicon – Google, IBM, Facebook, Amazon, and now Intel. Why? Because application specific processing engines gets the job done quicker, smarter, and in the long run cheaper. So in my humble opinion, this new relationship w/ CEA-Leti is just another explicit example of Intel's technology investment prowess.

What's needed most is very low power high BW.   It would all tie together if they wouldn't focus too much on what partners think as their vision is often distorted by empty hope and financial needs. Intel, for example, needs to sell servers and that distorts their vision. Glasses- very low power everything and neuromorphic fit well -maybe CoolCube and very low power high bandwidth connectivity. Glasses are by far the most demanding form factor and that makes it the most important as everything can trickle down to other segments. Robots-  the core technologies enabling glasses can be put to great use but a few more things are needed. Server- anything that's very efficient can be applied here. IoT is everything and nothing but one can look at IoT as a type of robot.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board Most Recent Comments                 11/18/2016 12:39:51 PM realjjj Lots of options for electric bikes and pedelecs but prices are not great.

The end-to-end software-based CCAP solution provides unprecedented scalability, agility and cost savings, and enables fast deployment of new IP-based data, video and voice services. The CableOS solution will make its public debut this week during SCTE Cable-Tec Expo, in Harmonic's booth 1948. News Room SOURCE: Harmonic Inc. September 27, 2016 09:00 ET Harmonic Transforms Cable Access Market With Industry's First Software-Based CCAP Solution New CableOS™ End-to-End Offering Enables Groundbreaking Scalability, Agility and Cost Efficiency SAN JOSE, CA--(Marketwired - September 27, 2016) - Harmonic (NASDAQ: HLIT), the worldwide leader in video delivery infrastructure, today introduced the CableOS™ system, the industry's first software-based CCAP solution. Fundamentally changing the economics of operating a cable access network, the game-changing CableOS solution enables the migration to gigabit capacity and resolves operators' space and power constraints in the headend and hub. The end-to-end solution provides unprecedented scalability, agility and cost savings, and enables fast deployment of new IP-based data, video and voice services. The CableOS solution will make its public debut this week during SCTE Cable-Tec Expo, booth 1948. "Today's cable operators have a remarkable opportunity when it comes to rolling out next-generation gigabit broadband services," said Patrick Harshman, president and CEO at Harmonic. "The software-based CableOS solution provides the tools to take advantage of that opportunity, as well as gain the benefits associated with distributed access architecture. Leveraging the full extent of Harmonic expertise in developing software-based technologies, CableOS helps our customers simplify operations, generate new revenue streams and reduce TCO." Featuring the industry's first software-based CMTS Core server and full-spectrum DOCSIS 3.1 Remote PHY systems, CableOS Core software runs on 1-RU COTS Intel® processor-based servers in a headend, hub or data center. "As we continue to evolve our network and products to deliver leading-edge speed and performance to our customers, it's exciting to see the continuing wave of innovation being driven by our valued partners," said Tony Werner, president of technology and product for Comcast Cable. "Innovation in this space is particularly timely as our industry increasingly leverages software to deliver smart, simple and scalable infrastructure." A single CableOS Core server offers a quantum leap forward in its ability to support tens of gigs of capacity and multiple service groups in fewer rack units when compared with traditional hardware CMTS implementations. With CableOS, operators can cut space and power by up to 75 percent in a centralized CCAP deployment, or by more than 90 percent in a Remote PHY deployment. "Cable delivery infrastructure has traditionally been based on purpose-built silicon platforms," said Dan Rodriguez, general manager, Communication Infrastructure Division at Intel Corporation. "Scaling hardware-centric infrastructure to meet new services and IP demand growth leads to capacity, space and power challenges.

The first rule of car club is, presumably, to talk incessantly about car club. The three German car companies that bought HERE from Nokia have got together with the three big kit vendors and the two biggest chip vendors to push the connected car industry as we move towards the 5G era. Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Intel, and Qualcomm have reasoned that 5G will be the moment of truth for the connected car. The lower latency will enable things like remote control, instant emergency support and realtime services such as contextual navigation. The group seems keen on the term C-V2X, which stands for cellular vehicle-to-everything and seems like a needlessly convoluted way of saying connected car. As is so often the way when these consortia are unveiled, the rest of the announcement is heavy on buzzwords and lofty aspiration but light on specifics. Here are some of those aspirations: Defining and harmonizing use cases, technical requirements and implementation strategies. Supporting standardization and regulatory bodies, certification and approval processes. Addressing vehicle-to-everything technology requirements, such as wireless connectivity, security, privacy, authentication, distributed cloud architectures and more. Running joint innovation and development projects leading to integrated solutions, interoperability testing, large scale pilots and trial deployments. Needless to say everyone provided a canned quote, here are the least generic of them: Sajjad Khan, Director Digital Vehicle & Mobility, Daimler “The connected car enables us to offer our customers services, both inside and outside the vehicle, which make their daily routine tasks easier, increase comfort and safety and thus create considerable added value. The fundamental basis for this is a reliable and fast connectivity technology whose standards have global validity. Together with the other founding members of the 5G Automotive Association, we as Daimler AG are working on precisely that – with the aim of raising car connectivity as well to a new level with the advent of the next generation of mobile phone technology.” Ulf Ewaldsson, CTO, Ericsson “The success of 5G is dependent on cross-industry work in new eco systems to digitalize industries. With the creation of this Association we will leverage our latest technology, 5G, and work closely together with the car industry to jointly develop solutions as well as provide input to regulation, certification and standardization. We are excited to be co-founder and to work with leading automotive companies shaping the connected car solutions for the future.” Doug Davis, GM of the IoT Group, Intel “Intel’s leadership work in 5G technology development, long–term commitment to open standards, and collaboration with leaders in the automotive industry will drive an accelerated path to adoption of 5G in automotive and transportation. Partnering together with other industry leaders will ensure 5G can support the use cases that will deliver on breakthroughs in safety and services for automated driving, smart city and intelligent transportation solutions around the world.” That’s it really. The announcement seems timed to coincide with the Paris motor show, which starts in a few days and at which there is likely to be a fair bit of connected car action. Yesterday Here, the navigation company spun out from Nokia’s massive Navteq acquisition and bought by Audi, BMW and Daimler last year, announced ‘next generation vehicle-sourced data services’, which seems to mean big data for cars. In practice this will mean loads of sensors generating loads of data which is then processed by loads of processors to generate loads of decisions. A sort of miniature version of the IoT vision. All this cleverness will allow drivers, or perhaps the cars themselves, to make smarter decisions on things like traffic conditions, potential road hazards, traffic signage and on-street parking. The ultimate stated aim of Here is for as many car makers as possible to use it and thus generate a definitive flow of realtime data. Google might have something to say about that. “What we are seeing today is the technology and automotive industries coming together to create services that will elevate the driving experience for billions,” said Here CEO Edzard Overbeek. “This is also an important milestone for our Open Location Platform, which is ready to serve as the nerve center for future autonomous vehicles, smart cities and intelligent transportation systems.” It’s hard to argue with the conclusion that a major feature of the 5G/IoT era will be these smart/connected/autonomous cars. Car makers are desperate to differentiate through technology but the promised marriage between phones and cars has been a long time coming. It remains to be seen just how much real value having all these connected sensors will add to the driving experience but what is undeniable is that momentum is building. The second rule of car club is to bang on about it constantly, as we’re about find out.

Finally adding native PCIe 3.0 support in addition to native USB3 & 3.1 functionality. The new desktop platform features dual channel DDR4 memory support for a total of four DDR4 memory modules & speeds up to 3200Mhz. The socket can support up to 24 PCIe lanes, depending on the chipset. AM4s Key Features - DDR4 Memory - PCIe Gen 3 - USB 3.1 Gen2 10Gbps - NVMe - SATA Express AMD Zen Press Release "From 7th Gen APUs to upcoming Zen-based Summit Ridge desktop processors, the future-ready AM4 platform features the newest I/O standards and an AMD commitment to support it into the future. The initial Zen cores for Summit Ridge-powered desktops will utilize the AMD AM4 socket, a new unified socket infrastructure that is compatible with 7th Generation AMD A-Series desktop processors. With dedicated PCIe® lanes for cutting-edge USB, graphics, data and other I/O, the AMD AM4 platform will not steal lanes from other devices and components. This allows users to enjoy systems with improved responsiveness and the future looking technologies that the AM4 platform provides, resulting in a powerful, scalable and reliable computing solution for all their needs." 40%+ More Pins Than AM3+ & New Mounting Hole Spacing Just like previous generation AMD sockets AM4 is a Pin Grid Array socket with zero insertion force. It maintains the same locking mechanism as the previous generation and takes up exactly the same area as AM3+, measuring in at 40x40mm. One of the most significant changes however is the number of pins. AM4 supports 1331 pins which is a very significant increase over the 942 of AM3+ and quite a bit more than Intels LGA1151. In fact this makes it the first PGA socket that weve seen from AMD to accommodate more contact pins than Intels LGA. All AM4 APUs & CPUs featured integrated southbridges and natively support significantly more PCIe lanes & USB devices than before.That in addition to AM4s cross-compatibility feature have been the primary drivers of the hefty 40%+ growth in pin contacts from AM3+ to AM4. To accommodate this the number of traces going in and out of the socket has also increased dramatically. This has unfortunately necessitated and adjustment of the sockets cooler/heatsink mounting holes. Effectively breaking compatibility with all previous generation coolers for AM2, AM2+, AM3 & AM3+.  Click to show spoiler Backside of AMD AM4 Zen Summit Ridge & Bristol Ridge Processors: Noctua have already announced that they will be offering free upgrade kits to their customers. Allowing them to use their existing Noctua coolers on upcoming AM4 motherboards. ============================ AMD X370 Chipset For High-End AM4 Boards Detailed  Summit Ridge and Overclocking Support ! Details regarding the AMD X370 chipset have leaked out over at Planet3dnow. The details confirm that X370 will be the high-end chip designed to support the upcoming Summit Ridge processors. These processors will be designed using the next-gen Zen core architecture that offers up to 40% IPC increase over Excavator and higher efficiency. The chipset stack is known as Promontory and consists of four SKUs. While majority of these SKUs were detailed along side the Bristol Ridge launch, theres one that has been kept under wraps. This is the high-end X370 chipset which will be aimed at the enthusiast market. AMD Zen features a new design built from the ground up on the 14nm FinFET process node. For starters, the AM4 platform is only currently available through OEMs. The general public launch will be coming in a few months later, around CES 2017. Motherboards built by various AIBs will be aimed at the PC DIY market with loads of CPU and I/O features. General availability of the high-end boards is expected around February 2017 as detailed before. Lets take a in-depth look at all of the chipsets: AMD X370 For Enthusiast AM4 Motherboards: First up, we have X370, a high-end chipset for overclockers and tweakers who need robust platforms. This chip provides the ultimate low-level control to its users and delivers ultimate graphics card bandwidth. By bandwidth, AMD is referring to max PCI-Express lanes as this is the only chip in the stack that supports multi-GPU functionality. The chipset supports both, CFX (CrossFire) and SLI. AMD Feature AMD X370 and Summit Ridge processors will be aimed at enthusiasts, delivering the best overclocking performance. AMD has mentioned two full x16 (Gen3) lanes for GPUs. AIBs can add additional lanes through a PLX chip but that would add to the cost. X370 features full overclocking support with a very sophisticated GUI that will allow the best overclock tools and experiences. Since all AM4 CPUs have an unlocked multiplier, record breakers will definitely put X370 boards to the test on liquid and LN2 setups.  Click to show spoiler =========================== AMD After hours AMD Has Plans To Create The Starship Processor With 48 Cores / 96 Threads On The 7nm Node ! "Fudzilla reported on something pretty interesting a while back  and we never got around to covering it because it was about something that was pretty far out into the horizon. However, in light of recent announcements from AMD regarding the amended WSA agreement, I thought now would be a good time to finally go over it. I am talking, of course, about AMDs plans for a 48 core processor based on the 7nm process that has been code named Starship. Since all of this is basically just leaked paperwork at the moment. AMD possibly planning to skip the 10nm process  7nm Server processor codenamed Starship planned for 2018 AMD is currently working on its 14nm based Zen architecture and the showcase product on the server side will be the 32 core Naples processor. However, they already have plans for a 48 core chip that will be based on the 7nm process  and since the company will continue to use an SMT (Simultaneous Multi Threading) based approach to its architecture  we are looking at a very impressive count of 96 threads. Considering the fact that Starship will be based on the 7nm process not only will it be more economically viable (in terms of cost effectiveness and $ per transistor) than the 14nm implementation of Zen but it will also be much more power efficient. If AMD continues its value philosophy forward with Starship, then it can eventually go on to pose a significant challenge to Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi chips. The Xeon Phi co-processors will be the only offerings from Intel which will out strip the Starship in terms of the raw core count. As is usually the case with chips from the Blue giant however, they are very pricey and when it comes down to it, the use cases that these chips are targeting can be achieved just as easily by employing more than one processor as long as it is cost effective and power effective. Now this leak as well as AMDs recent WSA announcement has one very interesting implication. It would appear that the company is going to be skipping the 10nm process. The amended agreement covers only 14nm and also 7nm chips and the fact that Starship is thought to be coming soon after the Naples platform both suggest the chip designer will be skipping the 10nm node. It also lends credence to this starship leak since AMD has already included 7nm processors in its amended WSA agreement. Meaning, it plans to roll them out sometime before the amendment expires  probably around the late 2018 to 2019 time frame. It is worth adding at this point, that this could turn out to be completely inaccurate and simply a matter of omission due to 10nm node being not part of the contract  that said however, I must admit that the evidence currently points to AMD moving directly to 7nm. As is usually the case with such large processors, there will be smaller versions of the same (yield theory dictates that) and according to the source the TDP should vary between 35W and 180W for the entire range of servers. It is also not clear at this point whether AMD will be be using the Zen architecture for the Starship processor or whether it will be a new revision. One thing is clear though, the 2018 time frame is probably a best case scenario. As the process node is shrinking in size  it is getting harder and harder to beat physics. If the 7nm FinFET process is anything like past nodes, it will be based on a 10nm backbone, and EUV lithography (which is technically good till 5nm) should be able to take us that far. Even then, late 2018 is the earliest we can expect any working x86 processor on the 7nm node to materialize otherwise we are looking at the same 2019 estimates for 7nm chips." ====================== AMD and Lenovo donate AMD-based ThinkPad E-series notebooks to The Jamaica Positive Foundation It's not everyday that companies like AMD and Lenovo donate a bunch of laptops, so when the news that they donated some AMD-based Lenovo ThinkPad E-series notebooks to The Jamaica Positive Foundation - but it was when I discovered it all happened thanks to a simple Facebook post. Jamaica Prime Minister Andrew Holness posted on Facebook, where he donated a notebook to a student in his constituency. Lenovo GAM VP David Bennett followed Holness on Facebook, and together with his Jamaican heritage, noticed that the Lenovo laptop Holness was giving away in Jamaica was an AMD-powered one. AMD and Lenovo were then in contact with the Jamaican PM, who agreed to talk with the companies and over a courtesy call, PM Holness gave his gratitude for the donation saying that there was a digital divide in the country, so the notebooks would make some rather large differences in students lives. The local community weren't the only ones to benefit, as it opened a new avenue for opportunities for AMD in the Central America & Caribbean area, working with Lenovo US boss Emilio Ghilardi. It's great to see AMD getting out there and pushing their notebooks into the hands of more people, especially in areas of need. ============ AMD : Zen Outperforms Intels High-End Broadwell-E CPUs Zen Performance Demo vs Intels $1000 Broadwell-E i7 6900X During the event AMD treated the audience to the very first public, real-world performance showdown featuring Zen and a contemporary competing Intel high-end enthusiast class CPU. The demo involved two similarly specced PCs one configured with an eight core, 16 thread Zen engineering sample clocked at 3.0Ghz and the other configured a with an eight core, 16 thread Intel Broadwell-E processor also clocked at 3.0Ghz. Both systems started the same Blender render session at the same time and the Zen CPU was actually able to finish first. This marks the very first time that we have seen an AMD CPU outshine an Intel CPU in instructions per clock in more than a decade. Outperforming the Intel CPU core for core, and clock for clock. That demo represents a truly historic moment for AMD. The key takeaways here are  Zen has better or equivalent IPC to Intels highest performing desktop CPUs yet, Broadwell-E.  AMD states that 8 core, 16 thread Zen CPUs will scale to frequencies beyond 3.0Ghz. All New AM4 Socket & Platform AMD is finally bringing all of its desktop products under one roof. The next generation AM4 socket will be compatibel with both desktop APUs and CPUs. This includes the upcoming Excavator based Bristol Ridge APUs which are set to arrive some time during the next four months. As well as the brand new Summit Ridge family of high-performance Zen CPUs. All CPUs inside the Summit Ridge family will include the companys new platform security processor, PCIe 3.0 support, dual channel DDR4 memory controllers, copious amounts of L3 cache and updated storage features. Including USB3.1 and NVMe. AMD Desktop Platform Evolution AM4 AMD AM4 platform key technology features include: # DDR4 Memory # PCIe Gen 3 # USB 3.1 Gen2 10Gbps # NVMe # SATA Express Availablity & Closing Comments AMD confirmed that AM4 motherboards will begin shipping throughout the next number of months. The first processors to be available on the new socket are Bristol Ridge APUs, which will begin shipping some time before the Holiday season. The multi-core enthusiast Zen CPUs that have been the subject of most of this article will be available en mass in early 2017 CEO Lisa Su has confirmed. There were some hints that Zen could launch around CES, so January 2017 would be a good bet. It seems that all the stars are lining up for AMD, which has seen its fair share of struggles over the past several years. All the components are there to make Zen a successful product. It has taken more than a decade, but its finally here. An AMD product that can actually challenge Intels highest performing Extreme Edition CPUs. Its almost unfathomable at first thought, after all we all grew accustomed to seeing Intels enthusiast CPUs go uncontested for the longest time.

Eine große Allianz für vernetzte Autos entsteht Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Intel und Qualcomm gründen die „5G Automotive Association“. Es geht um die Zukunft. 27.09.2016 © dpa Der 5G-Standard ist extrem wichtig für das Autonome Fahren. © dpa Der 5G-Standard ist extrem wichtig für das Autonome Fahren. Deutsche Autobauer wollen gemeinsam mit IT- und Telekommunikationsfirmen die Technik für vernetzte und selbst fahrende Autos vorantreiben. Audi, BMW und Daimler schließen sich dazu mit den Netzwerkanbietern Ericsson, Huawei und Nokia sowie den Chipherstellern Intel und Qualcomm zur „5G Automotive Association“ zusammen, wie die Unternehmen an diesem Dienstag mitteilten. Der Verein wolle dafür sorgen, die Möglichkeiten des künftigen Mobilfunkstandards 5G bestmöglich auszuschöpfen und Fahrzeuge optimal zu vernetzen. „In der Automobilindustrie ist 5G von besonderer Bedeutung für die Digitalisierung und auf dem Weg hin zum autonomen Fahren“, erklärte Christoph Grote, Bereichsleiter Elektronik von BMW. Die Allianz sei für weitere Partner offen. 5G ist der Fortschritt Die Mobilfunkanbieter wie Telekom und Vodafone sind zum Startschuss der Initiative nicht dabei. Doch es gebe bereits Gespräche mit weiteren Mitgliedern, erklärte ein Audi-Sprecher, wollte jedoch keine Namen nennen. Die künftigen 5G-Nutzer wollen technische Anforderungen festlegen, Pilotprojekte dazu aufsetzen und auf die gesetzliche Standardisierung Einfluss nehmen. So weit ist die Mobilfunkindustrie aber noch nicht. 5G ist noch in der Versuchsphase, eine weltweite Übereinkunft über Details fehlt noch. Bundesverkehrsminister Dobrindt will Deutschland als erster Land überhaupt flächendeckend mit 5G ausstatten - bis zum Jahr 2025, wie die Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung berichtet. Mehr zum Thema Dobrindt will ultraschnelles Internet bis 2025 Der Mobilfunkturbo soll Daten zehn Mal so schnell wie der gerade schnellste Standard 4G/LTE transportieren. Die Reaktionszeit bei Eingaben soll gegen Null gehen. Das ist eine Voraussetzung dafür, dass Autos vollkommen autonom fahren können und ein sekundenweiser Ausfall des Netzes keinen Unfall verursacht. Die Allianz ist ein weiterer gemeinsamer Schritt der drei deutschen Premium-Autobauer, die im vergangenen Jahr zusammen schon den Navigationskartendienst Here von Nokia kauften.

As it turns out, Microsoft played a key role in Intel’s decision to make the purchase. A recent feature from Wired explains how, in late 2012, engineers within Microsoft attempted to sell then-CEO Steve Ballmer on an idea called Project Catapult. Doug Burger explained that in the near future, the world’s top Internet giants would be running web-based services so complex that they’d require a whole new architecture to run them. Project Catapult, which would use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), was Microsoft’s answer to that as-yet-realized conundrum. FPGAs, which have been around for decades, are programmable chips that engineers only recently realized could be useful in accelerating online services as they can be programmed to perform a very specific job and be very efficient about it. Ballmer reportedly wasn’t buying it but little did he know, Burger and the team that runs Bing had already started work on it. They’d have to go through three prototypes to finally find a solution that also worked for Microsoft’s other massive online services – Office 365 and Azure. Programming at the hardware level is a “nightmare,” according to former Microsoft Principal Researcher Jim Larus but in the end, it proves to be worth the hassle as Catapult hardware costs less than 30 percent of everything else in a server, consumes less than 10 percent of the power and processes data twice as fast as would be possible without it. Microsoft’s FPGAs come from Altera, the company Intel purchased last year. In fact, Microsoft is the reason Intel bought Altera but not the only reason. According to Intel executive vice president Diane Bryant, a third of all servers used by major cloud providers will utilize FPGAs by 2020.

TheMarker Sep 26, 2016 5:57 PM comments Print   Zen Subscribe now  Shareshare on facebook  Tweet send via email reddit stumbleupon The Aleph team: Michael Eisenberg, Aaron Rosenson, Edan Shochat.Eyal Marilus Business feature Israeli VC remains bullish, foreseeing $10b companies High-tech firms come home again to central Tel Aviv How 70 startup accelerators sprouted in Israel in just three years Aleph raises $180 million for second venture capital fund The venture capital investor Aleph said Monday it had raised $180 million for its Aleph II fund. The fundraising comes three years after the VC firm, which was led by partners Michael Eisenberg, Eden Shochat and Aaron Rosenson, raised its initial $140 million just three years ago and has since made 10 investments with it. Aleph focuses on early-stage investments. Aleph I’s portfolio includes Windward, which provides real-time data on global shipping; Colu, which is developing blockchain technology for the financial markets; Freightos, a platform for managing and pricing freighting shipments; and WeWork, which operates office space mostly for high-tech startups. One of the ideas behind Aleph is its focus on building big high-tech companies in Israel. “It was never an objective problem to build a $10 billion company in Israel. It was a problem of attitude. People believe in it now,” Eisenberg said in an interview in July. (Eliran Rubin) Intel lays cornerstone for smart building in Petah Tikva Intel laid the cornerstone for a new research and development center Monday in Petah Tikva, which is housed in a so-called smart building that supposedly will learn the personal habits of each of its 2,500 occupants who volunteer to share the information and create a personalized work environment. Among other things, Intel’s smart office will reportedly know what kind of coffee to prepare for them in the morning, remind them it’s time to get a haircut and recommend where to park their car in the company garage. Company officials claimed the building not only creates a friendlier environment for staff but also serves as a showcase for Intel’s internet of things technology. “Erecting the campus underlines the importance of our presence in Israel and reflects our values of innovation, technology and green construction,” alleged Maxine Fassberg, CEO of Intel Israel. The new 34,000 square meter building will be occupied by Intel staff from 13 different office sites around Israel. (TheMarker Staff) BioLine licenses liver treatment from Ben-Gurion, Hadassah Just two days after the drug giant Allergan said it would pay $1.7 billion for Tobira Therapeutics, which is developing treatments for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. The tiny Israeli biotech company BioLine said it was also getting into the action, reporting on Friday that it had signed a licensing agreement with BGN Technologies and Hadasit, the technology-commercialization arms of Ben-Gurion University and Hadassah Medical Center, to pursue a similar drug. BioLIne said it was buying their BL-1220 drug for treating NASH, a common, often “silent” liver disease. Developed by Prof. Smadar Cohen of Ben-Gurion and Prof. Yaron Ilan of Hadassah, pre-clinical results in animal models show that BL-1220 is able to restore liver function. The technology could be directed toward rapid regeneration of normal liver in both acute and chronic conditions of liver injury, said BioLine, whose shares jumped 22% to 4.60 shekels ($1.23) on the news Sunday. (Uri Tomer) Anodot raises $8 million for online-anomaly technology Anodot, which helps companies detect online anomalies in things like payments and e-commerce data, last week said it raised $8 million in funding. The round was led by the Israeli venture capital fund Aleph, joined by Disruptive Technologies and brings total funding for the company to $12.5 million. The proceeds will be used to expand global sales and operations and meet demand for its service. Based in Sunnyvale, California and Ra’anana, Anodot was co-founded by David Drai, the former chief technology officer of GetTaxi and cofounder of Contendo, a startup acquired by Akamai; Shay Lang, former vice president of engineering at Trustwave; and Dr. Ira Cohen, former chief data scientist at HP. Anodot brings machine learning and real-time streaming data together to identify, report and visualize business incidents as they occur, enabling its customers – often Business Intelligence analysts serving all aspects of a company’s operations – to quickly and effectively manage crises and uncover business opportunities.

Nevertheless, the JIT said that the prosecutors do not link the MH17 downing to the Russian state of Russian citizens' actions. The team said that there are some 100 people involved "in one way of another" in the MH17 plane's downing. "The investigation is essential to ensure that those responsible face prosecution and to deliver accountability. Today’s initial criminal report offers clear evidence that the missile was Russian-made, and launched from within territory held by Russian-backed separatist groups. We ask that Russia now engages constructively with the findings and ongoing investigation," Johnson said. He noted that it was important to reveal motivation of the attack, identity of perpetrators and the chain of command. "The UK will continue to offer full support to the investigation and we urge all states affected by this tragedy to do the same. Alongside this, we will keep doing all we can to support the relatives of the ten British nationals who lost their lives," Johnson added. Russia categorically denies any involvement in the catastrophe. On Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Moscow is disappointed with the investigation of the crash and JIT’s conclusion confirms the case is biased and politically motivated. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the probe's data are mostly provided by the Internet and Ukrainian security services. Flight MH17 crashed with 298 people on board on July 17, 2014, in eastern Ukraine, while en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, leaving no survivors. Kiev and Donbass militia in Ukraine’s southeast have blamed each other for the downing of the MH17 plane. ...

Twitter Facebook Meet Apache Spot, a new open source project for cybersecurity The effort taps big data analytics and machine learning for advanced threat detection Katherine Noyes (IDG News Service) 29 September, 2016 02:41 - - - - print email Comments Hard on the heels of the discovery of the largest known data breach in history, Cloudera and Intel on Wednesday announced that they've donated a new open source project to the Apache Software Foundation with a focus on using big data analytics and machine learning for cybersecurity. Originally created by Intel and launched as the Open Network Insight (ONI) project in February, the effort is now called Apache Spot and has been accepted into the ASF Incubator. "The idea is, let's create a common data model that any application developer can take advantage of to bring new analytic capabilities to bear on cybersecurity problems," Mike Olson, Cloudera co-founder and chief strategy officer, told an audience at the Strata+Hadoop World show in New York. "This is a big deal, and could have a huge impact around the world." Based on Cloudera's big data platform, Spot taps Apache Hadoop for infinite log management and data storage scale along with Apache Spark for machine learning and near real-time anomaly detection. The software can analyze billions of events in order to detect unknown and insider threats and provide new network visibility. Essentially, it uses machine learning as a filter to separate bad traffic from benign and to characterize network traffic behavior. It also uses a process including context enrichment, noise filtering, whitelisting and heuristics to produce a shortlist of most likely security threats. By providing common open data models for network, endpoint, and user, meanwhile, Spot makes it easier to integrate cross-application data for better enterprise visibility and new analytic functionality. Those open data models also make it easier for organizations to share analytics as new threats are discovered. Other contributors to the project so far include eBay, Webroot, Jask, Cybraics, Cloudwick, and Endgame. “The open source community is the perfect environment for Apache Spot to take a collective, peer-driven approach to fighting cybercrime,” said Ron Kasabian, vice president and general manager for Intel's Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Solutions Group. “The combined expertise of contributors will help further Apache Spot’s open data model vision and provide the grounds for collaboration on the world’s toughest and constantly evolving challenges in cybersecurity analytics.” Brand Post Transforming Venues Through Digital Enterprise Practice More from Avaya Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Now, open source storage has begun to catch up, with, for example, open source file systems that have become the default for high-performance computing (HPC) and in other mainstream applications too. Some are clustered or parallel file systems, which are designed to be spread or pooled across multiple storage nodes for redundancy and performance, and then mounted on multiple servers. The best-known example is Lustre. Others are network file systems, such as Red Hat’s GlusterFS, and then there is the Sun/Oracle-derived file system and volume manager ZFS, which is widely implemented and underpins many other open source projects. In addition, open source storage has made inroads into object storage with Ceph (also Red Hat-owned) and OpenStack Swift, as well as in big data and analytics, where Apache’s HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) is a leader.  Too much DIY The factor that previously slowed the acceptance of open source storage was that it involved so much more DIY. An open source operating system will be designed to run on a range of hardware. Download the standard distribution package and install it on pretty much any mainstream commodity desktop or server, and it will discover the hardware and run. Sure, you might – just might – find a Linux distribution that doesn’t support your age-old graphics card or disk controller, but in general it will work. Open-source storage isn’t so easy. For a start, most users will already have storage that they know and trust and, more importantly, which already has their data on it. Switching storage platforms isn’t quite as simple as moving applications or virtual machines to a new server. Tuning the storage system There is also a lot of variation in the underlying hardware and the application’s performance requirements, so even where a standard storage software distribution could work – for example, if you buy commodity storage, which is essentially an x64 server with a shedload of disk or flash attached – there can be a fair amount of work required to tune the resulting storage system and customise it to specific needs and workloads. That is changing though, and fast. More freely downloadable packages have appeared, albeit mainly aimed at trial users. And more companies offer services to help with hardware/software integration and tuning, and then to provide the sort of enterprise-grade support that we have come to expect from the one-stop-shop storage vendors. One example is Red Hat, which sells services for Ceph and GlusterFS, branding the latter as Red Hat Storage Server. An even bigger boost for enterprise respectability comes from Intel, which combines the Lustre parallel file system with technical services and support to create commercial packages such as Intel Foundation Edition for Lustre (IFEL). “Enterprises seem to be picking up IFEL because it’s packaged,” says Laura Shepard, director of HPC markets at DDN, which builds high-performance storage appliances around Lustre and IBM’s proprietary GPFS file system (now Spectrum Scale), adding tools and a management layer. Paradoxically, free and open source storage first saw greatest acceptance at the two opposite ends of the scale. At the high end are the HPC systems, but at the opposite extreme, some small and mid-sized businesses have used software such as FreeNAS, NAS4Free (both ZFS-based) or Openfiler to turn a suitable server into a NAS or block storage appliance. Free software Other examples potentially suitable for small and medium sized businesses include several companies distributing free versions of their software, although these sometimes come with limitations. For example, Nexenta Systems’s community edition of its ZFS-based NexentaStor NAS server is limited to 18TB and lacks enterprise features such as replication and auto-sync. Shepard says one reason for the acceptance of open source storage at the high end is that the sort of organisations that demand the highest possible storage performance for their HPC work, such as government-funded national laboratories, are also the kind of organisations that have highly skilled academics on hand who can build and maintain such systems using open source. Meanwhile, the big private sector users of HPC – she suggests there could be as few as 10 petascale commercial computing systems in the world, all of them in the oil and gas industry – are similarly structured. “At that scale they start to look like the national labs, so they have teams who can support large Lustre implementations,” she adds. More on open source storage An open source file system can bring huge scalability, parallel file system capability and advanced features compared to those bundled with commercial operating systems. OpenStack and Hadoop fuel use of open source storage by cloud providers and large-scale Web firms, but enterprises remain cool to the idea. Indeed, the very openness of open source storage makes it easy for them to adapt and tune to their specific needs. Also, an important aspect is that by using open source storage you attract the sort of staff that these projects need. “With open source there’s a sense of community, which means you can ask questions and you have a voice. You aren’t just fed things by a vendor,” Shepard says. “You have people moving around and you need those people who would otherwise be working on data science in a national lab, say.” On the debit side, these are massive development projects, warns Giorgio Regni, founder and CTO at Scality, which has open sourced its S3 Server but not its core object storage technology. “It’s a big, complex distributed system, not something relatively easy like a web server or backup server,” he says.  “We need hundreds of servers just to test our code. Ceph is the same. It takes six months just to understand the code before you can start contributing, and then your contributions need to be reviewed and tested.” Growth in open source use However, as the DIY challenge diminishes and the availability of commercial-quality support grows, the deliberate use of open source software for storage is moving beyond the tech-savvy hinterlands at the far ends of the storage scale. Even at the lower end, where most of the earlier free and open source storage projects aimed to fill the gap between simple home NAS servers and sophisticated enterprise-grade storage from the major hardware suppliers, that is no longer the case. Several things have catalysed this, say experts in the field. One is that greater acceptance and use of open source storage at the infrastructure level is feeding through into other parts of the datacentre. Another is that as well as the commercial organisations that offer the technical services needed to implement open source storage at the enterprise level, there are companies using it to build off-the-shelf storage appliances. “It’s all in tuning the stack and making it turnkey,” says Eren Niazi, who founded his company Open Source Storage to build complete systems based on commodity hardware and an open source framework that includes ZFS. “People want simplicity, something that can be up and running in 15 minutes,” he adds. “We include a three-year support contract too – open source users do need support. There’s questions at first, then six months later there’s packages to update and security to consider, and then as the storage expands you need to add more hardware.” Add the almost accidental use of open source storage software, packaged within appliances or other open source platforms, and newer open source storage projects such as Ceph and OpenStack Swift, both of which are object storage platforms and are squarely aimed at the enterprise, and all the indications are that open source storage is not just ready for the mainstream – it is already there.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas September 28, 2016 11:13 BST A search for 'Amy Schumer Torrent' was found to carry a 33% chance of connecting to a malicious website Mark Davis/Getty Images Known for her outspoken ways, American comedian and actress Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity on the internet, Intel security announced on Tuesday (27 September). Knocking Dutch electronic dance music artist DJ Armin van Buuren off of the list, Schumer has topped McAfee's annual Most Dangerous Celebrities list study. Covering a wide range of well-known figures including actors, musicians, TV hosts, comedians and athletes among others, the research determines which celebrities churn out the most dangerous search results that could potentially expose readers to viruses and malware looking to read up on their favourite icons. According to the firm, a normal search for the 'Inside Amy Schumer' star comes with a 16% chance of connecting to a virus or malware-laden website. A search for 'Amy Schumer Torrent,' on the other hand, carries a 33% chance of connecting to a malicious website highlighting the growing trend of cord-cutting users moving away from cable TV towards streaming videos, TV shows and movies online. "Savvy cybercriminals continue to leverage consumers' ongoing fascination with celebrity news - such as award and TV shows as well as movie premieres, album releases, celebrity breakups and more - to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites loaded with malware that can steal passwords and personal information," Intel notes. "Consumers are now, more than ever, streaming videos, TV shows and movies online. As file sharing and torrent use continues to grow in popularity, it's no surprise that TV and movies are a target for cybercriminals seeking to create malicious files." After the 'Trainwreck' actress, Justin Bieber came in second with 15%, followed by 'Today' show anchor and 'The Voice' host Carson Daly. Successful rapper turned Hollywood star Will Smith came in at number 3 followed by popular musicians Rihanna, Miley Cyrus and 'Funcomfortable' comedian Chris Hardwick. Here are the top 10 celebrities with the highest risk percentages: McAfee's Top 10 Most Dangerous Celebrities online 1. Amy Schumer - 16.11% 2. Justin Bieber - 15% 3. Carson Daly - 13.44% 4. Will Smith - 13.44% 5. Rihanna - 13.33% 6. Miley Cyrus - 12.67% 7. Chris Hardwick - 12.56% 8. Daniel Tosh - 11.56% 9. Selena Gomez - 11.11% 10. Kesha - 11.11% "Consumers today remain fascinated with celebrity culture and go online to find the latest pop culture news," Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security, said in a statement. "With this craving for real-time information, many search and click without considering potential security risks. Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware. As a result, consumers need to understand what precautions to take to enable safe online experiences." Intel's study was conducted using its own site ratings to determine the number of risky sites generated by searches on Google, Bing and Yahoo.

Anti-virus experts have published a new list of musicians, TV and film stars whose names have been hijacked to attract internet users to sites that carry malware. Actress and comedian Amy Schumer topped the annual list of the most dangerous celebrity names to search for online. The comedian and actress Amy Schumer (pictured) is the most dangerous celebrity to search for online as hackers are using her name to lure unsuspecting fans to malicious sites that will install viruses or malware onto their computers to steal passwords and personal information Hackers use the fascination with celebrity news to entice unsuspecting fans to visit sites that can download viruses onto their computers and steal passwords or personal information. TOP TEN MOST DANGEROUS CELEBRITY SEARCHES  The top 10 celebrities from this year's study with the highest risk percentages include:  1 Amy Schumer 16.11%  2 Justin Bieber 15.00%  3 Carson Daly 13.44%  4 Will Smith 13.44%  5 Rihanna 13.33%  6 Miley Cyrus 12.67%  7 Chris Hardwick 12.56%  8 Daniel Tosh 11.56%  9 Selena Gomez 11.11%  10 Kesha 11.11% The study by Intel Security found that Justin Bieber, Carson Daly – host of Today and The Voice in the US – actor Will Smith and singer Rihanna were also popular choices for cybercriminals. In the UK, singer Ellie Goulding was the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, along with singer Rita Ora, producer Calvin Harris and Geordie Shore TV stars Charlotte Crosby and Holly Hagan. Nick Viney, consumer vice president at Intel Security, which is known as McAfee in Europe, said: 'The desire for consumers to stay up to date with the latest celebrity gossip can often make them unwittingly vulnerable to cybercrime. 'Many consumers are quick to click but do they actually stop and consider the potential risks this poses by doing so? 'Cybercriminals are keen to exploit this craving for real-time information on celebrities, and will lead consumers to sites that download harmful malware onto devices to ultimately steal an individual's all important, and incredibly valuable, data.

Share this article Share 13 shares Intel Security assessed the risk of sites when searching for celebrity names (shown above). Using terms like torrent, MP4 or free download with the celebrity name increased the risk Singer Justin Bieber (pictured) was the second most risky name to search for online according to the research by Intel Security. They warn that fans need to take greater precautions when searching for content by or about these celebrities 'It's clear more needs to be done to help consumers understand the threats online and what precautions they need to take to ensure their data, is kept safe when searching for celebrity news.' The research found that a search for Amy Schumer carries at least a 16 per cent chance of clicking on a site that carries viruses or malware. Searching for Justin Bieber carries a 15 per cent risk of being diverted to a malicious site. Often the sites were disguised as legitimate news sources but actually took users to sites that downloaded malware. Singer Ellie Goulding (pictured) was the most risky celebrity search in the UK followed by Charlotte Crosby and Rita Ora. It demonstrates how hackers are using the modern obsession with celebrities to target internet users The risk increases for those hoping to find free downloads of music or video featuring the stars. Searching for Amy Schumer Torrent increases the risk to 33 per cent, for example. To conduct the study, Intel Security performed common search terms on Google, Bing and Yahoo for celebrity names and examined the number of risky sites that came up. The firm then used this to calculate an overall risk percentage for each celebrity. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF WHEN SEARCHING  Intel Security and McAfee offer a number of tips to internet users when searching for content about celebrities. Think before you click Are you looking for the latest episode of Amy Schumer's TV show, 'Inside Amy Schumer'? Don't click on that third-party link.  Instead, get your content directly from the original source at comedycentral.com to ensure you aren't clicking on anything that could be malicious. Use caution when searching for 'torrent'  This term is by far the riskiest search term.  Cybercriminals can use torrents to embed malware within authentic files making it difficult to determine if a file is safe. It's best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available. Keep your personal information personal Cybercriminals are always looking for ways to steal your personal information.  If you receive a request to enter information like your credit card, email, home address or social media login don't give it out thoughtlessly.  Do your research and ensure it's not a phishing or scam attempt that could lead to identity theft Browse safely using protection software McAfee WebAdvisor software will help keep you safe from malicious websites by helping to identify potentially risky sites.  A complimentary version of the software can be downloaded at mcafee.com/mcafeewebadvisor Use cross device protection Consumers need to protect all facets of their digital lives regardless of where they are, what device they use or where they store their personal data.  Use solutions that work across all your devices to deliver protection against threats, such as malware, hacking and phishing attacks. * Courtesy of Intel Security  Read more: Amy Schumer is No. 1 on the 2016 McAfee Most Dangerous Celebrities List | Intel Newsroom Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Good pup!

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive.. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

The SPARC S7 is closely related to the SPARC M7, unveiled in October 2015. Both are used within Oracle’s engineered systems and RISC servers, which power Oracle Cloud and many other clouds. In this Profit interview, John Fowler, executive vice president of systems at Oracle, explains how the SPARC S7 brings new levels of performance, efficiency, and security to the cloud. Profit: How is Oracle’s new SPARC S7 different from the SPARC M7? Fowler: The SPARC M7 had breakthrough technology. What we were trying to do was really improve security with Silicon Secured Memory and encryption, and greatly improve the efficiency of analytics applications by putting some logic in the processor design that helped with analyzing and scanning data. We think that’s really the next 10 years of processor evolution. It’s not just cores and performance, but putting in more specific features to help software. What we decided to do in the SPARC S7 is take those same core technologies and bring them to horizontal scale and highly scale-out price points. Profit: Why does Oracle, a cloud company, continue to invest in creating the world’s most advanced microprocessors? Fowler: We are working to build the world’s best infrastructure for customers, and we want them to be able to use x86 and also RISC microprocessors. In the case of SPARC, we’re able to put in unique features based on our understanding of software. So for example, we’ve incorporated security features and integrated data-analytics acceleration. Profit: Why and how does Oracle remain such a good partner with Intel? Fowler: We partner with Intel to make all of our software work and build a full family of hardware products around Intel. It’s not either/or. It’s really an and strategy. x86 and SPARC give customers choice. Profit: At the SPARC S7 launch, you emphasized three themes: security, efficiency, and simplicity. Why those three things? Fowler: Cloud computing exacerbates many of the technical challenges people have in enterprise computing. By its very nature, you’re sharing resources, so security becomes even more important. The second thing is, since you’re sharing resources and infrastructure, you want to be as efficient as possible because that’s a basic cost equation. And finally, what people expect of the cloud is the ability to rapidly provision new services and go compete by moving quickly. Profit: How do the new SPARC processors make these environments more secure? We are working to build the world’s best infrastructure for customers, and we want them to be able to use x86 and also RISC microprocessors. John Fowler, Executive Vice President, Systems, Oracle Fowler: We built in a very wide capability of encryption of the chip, but more importantly, we built in dedicated processor resources to handle encryption. What this means is your application can run at virtually the same performance encrypted as unencrypted. The second big area we worked on was protecting memory. Since an application can access any memory it’s entitled to, we added a technical capability so an application can’t do that unless it has a matching key for all types of memory. Profit: What are the benefits of using the new SPARC processors in Oracle’s own cloud environment? Fowler: We deploy both x86 and SPARC in our cloud. Customers can choose to use SPARC, and what they gain are advanced security—the encryption and memory protection—as well as very high performance and efficiency per core. Profit: Oracle also recently released a SPARC-based Oracle Compute Cloud service. How is it different from other cloud infrastructure services? Fowler: It’s different because it offers SPARC. From Oracle, you can get both x86 and SPARC infrastructure as a service. They’re priced identically. We expect to see customers that are interested in higher levels of mission-critical security or doing data-analytics type applications, because that is where SPARC is differentiated. Profit: What is the Data Analytics Accelerator in SPARC processors? Fowler: The Data Analytics Accelerator is able to scan very large amounts of data for strings and filter and decompress data from memory, and it does it at an enormous rate. The software support for this is integrated into Oracle Database 12c today. We’ve opened up the programming interface and created a developer community around this. Profit: What about the need for interoperability between on-premises and public clouds? Fowler: We believe the next decade is about enterprises making choices between using cloud services, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, and on-premises computing. We’ve linked the management tools and the provisioning tools so that if you want to straddle these worlds—move workloads back and forth—you can.

Several tech vendors are partnering with three automakers to create an association that is aimed at accelerating the development of 5G technologies for self-driving cars. The companies on Sept. 27 announced the 5G Automotive Association, which will work to develop, test and promote technologies that will form the basis of the next-generation infrastructure that will be needed to make autonomous vehicles a reality. Networking vendors Ericsson, Huawei Technologies and Nokia and chip makers Intel and Qualcomm are being joined by automakers Audi, BMW and Daimler in the initiative, which officials with the companies said is an example of the need for partnerships to speed the development of the necessary technologies. "The success of 5G is dependent on cross-industry work in new ecosystems to digitalize industries," Ericsson CTO Ulf Ewaldsson said in a statement. "With the creation of this association, we will leverage our latest technology, 5G, and work closely together with the car industry to jointly develop solutions as well as provide input to regulation, certification and standardization." Li Yintao, president of Huawei's 2012 Labs, said in a statement that the association "demonstrates the clear need for a cross-sector collaboration between the mobile industry and car industry for joint innovation, and to establish a platform to align on timeline and priorities and solution roadmaps." The group will be able to drive everything from worldwide regulations and certification to standardization efforts for autonomous cars and 5G technologies, he said. The burgeoning self-driving car market is getting a lot of attention from many corners. Tech vendors and component makers are rapidly building up their portfolios of products aimed at the space, and companies from Google and to Uber are running tests with such vehicles. Car manufacturers are teaming with tech companies—as illustrated by the partnership between BMW, Intel and Mobileye to get autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021—to drive their efforts. In addition, governments also are pushing efforts. The Obama administration in January unveiled plans to spend almost $4 billion over 10 years to fund pilot projects in hopes of accelerating autonomous car efforts in the United States. 5G is seen as a key enabling technology. Though standards for the next-generation connectivity technology aren't expected to be finalized until 2020, tech companies are rolling out pre-standard 5G technologies and products. 5G promises data transfer speeds that will be 10 to 100 times faster than current 4G LTE, as well as significantly lower latency and the ability to support many more devices and systems. All this will be important for the car-to-car and car-to-cloud communications (or V2X—vehicle-to-everything) that will be crucial in enabling vehicles to operate without human intervention. The vehicles will need to communicate with each other as well as other intelligent environments—such as smart cities—to navigate from one point to another and to avoid obstacles from other cars to pedestrians. "We expect 5G to become the worldwide dominating mobile communications standard of the next decade," Christoph Grote, senior vice president of electronics for BMW, said in a statement. "For the automotive industry it is essential that 5G fulfills the challenges of the era of digitalization and autonomous driving." The new association will address technical and regulatory issues, and will look at such tasks as defining and meshing use cases, technical requirements and implementation strategies as well as giving support to standardization and regulatory groups, officials said. Members also will address a range of V2X technologies, from wireless connectivity to security, privacy and distributed cloud architectures. They also will jointly run development projects that lead to the creation of integrated offerings, interoperability testing, and large-scale pilots and trials. Group members said the association is open to other companies joining.           LATEST NETWORKING ARTICLES   Cisco Posts Modestly Good Quarter, but Outlook is Soft Nutanix Brings Networking Into Its Enterprise Cloud Platform Cypress Adds Connectivity Option to WICED IoT Platform BT, CA Make Deeper Pushes Into Growing SD-WAN Space Cisco Brings Flexible Payments, App Site to Spark Collaboration Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Promontory, my dear Watson Microsoft boasts its cloudy Hadoop big data mill's faster than yours Amazon: Students, we'll give you $2.5m for a chat-up, AI? Microsoft’s self-installing Windows 10 operating system has reached the 400 million mark, the firm announced at its Ignite conference in Atlanta this week, up from the previous high of 350 million in August. This adoption rate means the firm’s self-imposed target of a billion devices by mid-2018 looks increasingly unlikely, but the Redmond giant can take some consolation in the fact that business enthusiasm seems to be growing. The latest version of Windows hit its one-year anniversary on July 29, a date that also marked the ending of the free upgrade offer period for users of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. As El Reg pointed out at the time, this meant that Microsoft now faces the challenge of trying to get people to pay for Windows 10, which is tough if users weren’t convinced enough of its merits to upgrade for free already. Nevertheless, 350 million devices in one year is better than where previous versions of Windows were at the same point in their lifecycle, helped no doubt by Microsoft’s helpful approach of automatically downloading it and upgrading your PC without you having to bother doing this yourself. But there are signs that businesses and professional users at least are keen on Windows 10, with European IT market research outfit Context reporting that Windows 10 Pro adoption is on the rise. Context said that Windows 10 Pro accounted for a quarter (24 percent) of Windows Business PCs sold through distributors in Western Europe during August, up from 18 percent in July and 16 percent in June. However, this means that Windows 7 still remains the business platform of choice, and August’s figures from NetMarketShare show that Windows 7 is still the largest operating system in use overall, accounting for just over 47 percent of computers accessing the web. But the researchers expect that European business spending on Windows 10 could pick up even further towards the end of this year, helping to drive “a modest improvement” in overall PC sales for the second half of 2016, compared to that seen in the first half of the year. Windows 10 Pro is a step up from the basic Windows 10 Home that many consumer PCs ship with, and includes key added capabilities such as the ability to be joined to a corporate Active Directory Windows domain. However, Redmond cheesed off many business users earlier this year when it retroactively removed from Windows 10 Pro a feature that enabled admins to restrict access to the Windows Store, and thus control what apps users can install. The move was portrayed by many as an attempt to upsell businesses to the Windows 10 Enterprise edition, which is only available through volume licensing deals. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 115 Comments More from The Register Microsoft Azure sets up shop in France Bonjour, mes fluffy white amis 22 Comments What strange madness is this?

Promontory, my dear Watson Microsoft boasts its cloudy Hadoop big data mill's faster than yours Amazon: Students, we'll give you $2.5m for a chat-up, AI? Ageing fans of 1980s home computer games will soon be able to get their hands on Sir Clive Sinclair’s rebooted ZX Spectrum device, which is now set to be launched in October and available just in time for Christmas. The eagerly awaited Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega+, which was bankrolled via crowdfunding site Indiegogo, is to get an official launch on October 20th, as detailed in an official release from Sir Clive’s Retro Computers outfit. Andy Maddock, chief executive of SMS Electronics, the firm manufacturing the Vega+, enthused that “we are excited that the project is going ahead and will soon be in volume manufacture.” The firm said that the device will be available in “selected online retail sites in time for Christmas 2016.” The Vega+ takes the form of a hand-held games console with a colour LCD screen so it can be used anywhere, but can be connected to a TV for home use, just like its predecessor. It is claimed to be compatible with “every Spectrum game that exists,” and will ship with 1,000 licensed games pre-installed. Official pricing for the Vega+ has yet to be disclosed, but Retro Computers said that it isn’t too late for eager contributors to pledge on Indiegogo to secure a classic black Vega+ while the crowdfunding campaign is in the InDemand phase. Earlier limited edition versions in red, white or blue are no longer available. The hardware and software for the Vega+ have been designed and developed by a team of techies led by a former ZX Spectrum games developer. The team has focused on delivering maximum compatibility with previous generations of the Speccy. However, it is based on modern hardware, and includes features such as support for micro SD cards to enable preferences, and game-saves to be stored for later recall, as well as future firmware upgrades to be delivered. It also features switchable Kempston or cursor key joystick emulation, plus access to programming mode via the familiar BASIC commands. Here at The Reg, we’re hoping that the ZX Spectrum Vega+ lives up to its promise, as we are looking forward to picking up where we left off with Manic Miner and other 80s classics like Elite and Chuckie Egg. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 41 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Enabling access layer bandwidth to evolve incrementally beyond 1 Gigabit per second (Gb/s), it will help address emerging needs in a variety of settings and applications, including enterprise, wireless networks, and more. "End user data needs – both wired and wireless – are continuing to grow, especially as more and more users access the network via ever-faster wireless technologies enabled by IEEE 802.11ac™. The 1000BASE-T uplink from the wireless to wired network is no longer sufficient, and users need a way to tap into higher data rates without having to overhaul the 70 billion meters of Cat5e / Cat6 wiring already sold," said David Chalupsky, board of directors, Ethernet Alliance; principal engineer, Intel Corporation; and chair of the IEEE 802.3bz task force. "IEEE 802.3bz is an elegant solution addressing not only the demand for faster access to rapidly rising data volumes, but also capitalizes on previous infrastructure investments, thereby extending their life and maximizing value." Building upon the success of and laying out an upgrade path for 1000BASE-T, IEEE 802.3bz defines 2.5 Gigabit (2.5G) and 5 Gigabit (5G) BASE-T Ethernet. It specifies Ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) parameters, physical layer specifications (PHYs), and management objects for balanced twisted pair transmission media found in structured cabling. Facilitating up to five times the speed without requiring expensive infrastructure changes, IEEE 802.3bz enables cost-effective network bandwidth scaling. This enterprise technology addresses various needs, including scientific and research computing, content production and editing, industrial design and automation, machine vision, and more. "IEEE 802.3bz is a valuable addition to Ethernet's expanding family of standards; its deployment will enable the faster wireless connections promised by the next generation of wireless access," said John D'Ambrosia, chairman, Ethernet Alliance; and senior principal engineer, Huawei. "The Ethernet Alliance is excited by the promise and opportunities presented by IEEE 802.3bz. We are committed to validating the industry's expectation of the multi-vendor interoperability of this standard as the follow-on to 1000BASE-T, considered the most successful Ethernet project ever."

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics engineers (IEEE) has finalised the 802.3bz standard, which defines 2.5Gbps and 5Gbps ‘BASE-T Ethernet’. It is claimed the standard will allow businesses to reuse up to 70 billion metres of Ethernet cabling, making it an achievable and cost-effective upgrade. Faster Ethernet “End user data needs – both wired and wireless – are continuing to grow, especially as more and more users access the network via ever-faster wireless technologies enabled by IEEE 802.11ac,” said David Chalupsky, principal engineer at Intel and chair of the IEEE 802.3bz task force. “The 1000BASE-T uplink from the wireless to wired network is no longer sufficient, and users need a way to tap into higher data rates without having to overhaul the 70 billion metres of Cat5e / Cat6 wiring already sold. “IEEE 802.3bz is an elegant solution addressing not only the demand for faster access to rapidly rising data volumes, but also capitalizes on previous infrastructure investments, thereby extending their life and maximising value.” The need for faster Ethernet to support wireless demand has long been recognised by the industry, with Cisco among the vendors which formed the NBASE-T Alliance in 2014 with the intention of creating multi-gigabit networks. The adoption of speedier 802.11ac Wi-Fi is a reaction to growing demand from mobile devices on corporate networks. But the full potential of the technology cannot be realised if wired infrastructure does not evolve too. Separate initiatives are underway to increase the amount of bandwidth going into data centres. Industry body the Ethernet Alliance claims the new standard will address needs in scientific and research computing, content production and editing, industrial design and automation, machine vision, as well as the need for faster wireless networking. “IEEE 802.3bz is a valuable addition to Ethernet’s expanding family of standards; its deployment will enable the faster wireless connections promised by the next generation of wireless access,” added John D’Ambrosia, chairman, Ethernet Alliance and senior principal engineer at Huawei.

These 3 Stocks Tripled in 12 Months The Motley Fool 9/28/2016 Dan Caplinger © Provided by Fool Tck Mining The stock market has done well over the past year, with most major market benchmarks producing returns in the 10% to 15% range since September 2015. The Dow and S&P 500 hit new record levels during the summer months, and although volatility has returned to the markets, investors seem reasonably comfortable with the prospects for stocks going forward. Yet even the solid returns from the overall market pale in comparison to what a few select stocks have managed to produce. Quotes in the article Teck Resources Ltd TCK ▼ 22.63 -0.69 -2.96% Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD ▲ 8.67 +0.21 +2.48% Tobira Therapeutics Inc TBRA = 42.09 0.00 0.00% Allergan PLC AGN ▼ 196.00 -3.98 -1.99% Below, we'll take a closer look at three stocks that have tripled since this time last year to see if investors can squeeze any more gains out of them.© Provided by Fool TCK Chart TCK data by YCharts. Teck Resources gets its momentum back The commodities markets have finally started to move back in the right direction, and Teck Resources (TCK) has been a primary beneficiary of that trend reversal. The company produces certain amounts of precious metals such as gold and silver, both of which have jumped sharply over the past year. Yet Teck is better known for its other mined products, including copper, zinc, molybdenum, and metallurgical coal. Better prospects for those markets have helped send Teck up 279% in the past 12 months. The Canadian mining company has done a good job of cutting costs in its operations, working to make itself as efficient as possible to weather the downturn in commodity prices. Refinancing its debt allowed Teck to take advantage of low interest rates, buying itself a couple extra years to hope for a more extensive turn higher in sales. In addition, a new investment in an oil sands project could bring further diversification to Teck, and it could prove well-timed if oil can rebound from its recent slump. Overall, investors are hopeful that Teck has turned the corner, and continued favorable moves in commodities could send the stock still higher. Will AMD serve up some tasty chips? Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been extremely volatile in its history, producing lackluster long-term performance that reflects its secondary status in many of the markets that it addresses. Playing second fiddle to Intel in the PC chip space for decades, AMD has made more inroads in the graphics chip market -- but even there, it faces competitive challenges. Over the past year, though, Advanced Micro has taken strides to become more competitive, and that has helped send its stock up 277% since September 2015. Its launch of its new Polaris graphics chip architecture has given AMD a viable position in the GPU space, and investors have increasingly high hopes that its pipeline of future chips using 14-nanometer transistor sizes can match up to those that its rivals produce. At the same time, AMD posted an adjusted operating profit in its most recent quarter, reaching what CEO Lisa Su called "a significant milestone" for the company. Takeover speculation has also pushed Advanced Micro shares higher. Overall, AMD's gains assume that the tech company will live up to its full potential, so anything short of that could cause shares to lose much of the ground they've gained. Tobira gets a big buyout The most common way for stocks to jump is through buyouts, and that's what Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) shareholders enjoyed recently. After suffering through a long period in which its stock price got cut in half, Tobira received a buyout offer from Allergan (AGN) that sent the biotech up by more than 700% in a single day. That brought its overall 12-month return to 218%. Tobira is looking at potential treatments for the liver disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which Allergan has identified as an area of interest for the larger biotech company. Yet the failure of Tobira drug cenicriviroc to meet its primary endpoint in a phase 2 clinical trial during the summer led to a big loss for the stock, and few investors were confident that phase 3 trials of the drug would produce any better results. Allergan thought differently, though, and was willing to offer a combination of cash and contingent value rights that could be worth as much as $1.7 billion. Those rights could produce some additional return in the long run if the drug meets specified milestones, but Tobira has already generated most of the value it can for shareholders. Stocks that triple are exceedingly rare, and often, what sends them to their new heights doesn't lend itself to repeating. Tobira has almost no chance of moving any higher than it currently is, but Teck has the better prospects to add to gains if its target market keeps behaving well in the months and years to come.

These are the 10 most dangerous celebrity names to search for on Google Jethro Nededog Sep. 28, 2016, 1:14 PM 130,323 facebook linkedin twitter email print Comedy Central/"Inside Amy Schumer" Amy Schumer's year of being Hollywood's "it girl" can now include the honor of "most dangerous" celebrity to search for on the internet. Intel Security just released its annual Most Dangerous Celebrities study. Aside from including some interesting tidbits about the current culture of internet security and those who aim to thwart it, it also lists the celebrity names that are most likely to expose computers to viruses and malware if a person searches for them on the internet. Malware publishers often set up websites with celebrity pictures and information on them to entice unsuspecting fans, and those sites can then be used to steal passwords and personal information.  According to the study, the most dangerous types of internet searches of entertainers are those for comedians, musicians, late-night television hosts, and the strangely specific category of "The Voice" coaches. This year, Schumer bumped Armin van Buuren, an electronic dance music DJ, from the top spot on the list. In fact, he didn't even make it on this year's list. Who else made the list of dangerous online searches for celebrities? Here's a look at the top 10: View As: One Page Slides 10. Kesha Getty 9. Selena Gomez Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP 8.

From tourism to big data, Guizhou Province in southwestern China has presented itself as a tourism destination as well as an information technology pilot for the world to see. (Xinhua/Xu Yong) SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- From tourism to big data, Guizhou Province in southwestern China has presented itself as a tourism destination as well as an information technology pilot for the world to see. Mr. Chen Gang, deputy director of a task force directing the national big data pilot project in Guizhou, a mountainous province known for its scenic landscape and ethnic diversity, has spent almost a week on the U.S. west coast to talk about what is going on with his province. On Monday, Chen led a provincial delegation to Santa Clara, at center of Silicon Valley in northern California, to promote a big data pilot zone in Guizhou, the only one receiving designation and funding from China's central government to build big data infrastructure, experiment on internet of things (IoT) and cloud computation, and other applications. On Tuesday, he was in downtown San Francisco, north of Silicon Valley, to showcase Guizhou's tourism resources. With a doctoral degree in chemistry and a top leadership position within government institutions at Guiyang, the provincial capital, Chen did not see tourism and big data as two industries far from each other. At the Santa Clara event, he cited city management as an area where big data has a role. For instance, data mining helps Guiyang municipal authorities to see where passengers, both local residents and tourists from outside the city, need short rides to go from one place to another. The city, already overloaded with private cars, therefore is able to improve taxi services and car-sharing practices while cracking down on unlicensed cabs. He told more than 150 people at the event, including some from businesses in Silicon Valley, that multinational American companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm, Dell, International Business Machine (IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) have joined Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE, China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and other leading Chinese information technology companies to operate research and development (R&D) centers or projects in Guizhou. Baidu, an internet company headquartered in Beijing, the Chinese capital, has explored the possibility of road testing its self-driving vehicles in the province, once hard to reach with any transportation means for centuries but now proud to have a web of highways and local roadways through mountainous terrains reaching every county and city seats and rural villages. The mountain park province, as Chen called it, is boasting the world's largest water fall, arguably one of the world's oldest military fortress and the world's largest botanic garden, plus mountains, canyons, karst caves, forests, grassland, wetland and lakes, 3 of them on the list of world heritage sites recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As colorful as the natural scenes are the people living on the territory, Chen noted at the San Francisco event attended by state and city officials and tourism industry representatives, adding that 17 ethnic hill tribes are there in Guizhou to show their rich and diversified and strikingly beautiful heritages, from clothing to music and dance, from construction structures of their residence to festive rituals. Tourists to Guizhou saw a 40 percent increase last year, he said. At both events, Chen showed pictures of a new structure, a radio telescope known as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, the world's largest and most sensitive of the kind, inaugurated in Guiping county, Guizhou, on Sunday, Sept. 25. Built with a 4,450-panel reflector as large as 30 football pitches to survey neutral hydrogen in deep space, observe celestial objects called pulsars, help with spacecraft tracking and communication, FAST is expected to help search for extraterrestrial intelligent life, or ET, possibly existing somewhere in the universe. Chen said FAST is a new must see for visitors to his province. Previously a top administrator in a district of Beijing before being reassigned to Guizhou about three years ago, the official did not consider switching the topics from tourism to big data as a frog leap. He believes both industries can work on a eco-friendly development strategy for a province relatively less industrial and yet having huge economic potentials. However, Min Song, a Chinese-American presiding over local U.S.-China Cultural and Communication Association, who helped organize the big data promotion event, was amazed. He visited Guizhou once on a business trip some 20 years ago, when it was one of the least developed provinces in China, said he never thought about the province would be turned into a high technology host of any kind. "You are all welcome to tour Guizhou," Chen told his audiences.    1 2 >>      1 2 >>   [Editor: huaxia] Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo Copyright © 2000 - 2016 XINHUANET.com All Rights Reserved.   From tourism to big data, Chinese province presents itself in Silicon Valley                Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo   Source: Xinhua | 2016-09-29 01:25:10 | Editor: huaxia   Photo taken on Sept. 27, 2016 shows the scene of an event to promote tourism in China's Guizhou Province, held in San Francisco, the United States.

He told more than 150 people at the event, including some from businesses in Silicon Valley, that multinational American companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Intel, Qualcomm, Dell, International Business Machine (IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) have joined Baidu, Alibaba, Huawei, ZTE, China Telecom, China Mobile, China Unicom and other leading Chinese information technology companies to operate research and development (R&D) centers or projects in Guizhou. Baidu, an internet company headquartered in Beijing, the Chinese capital, has explored the possibility of road testing its self-driving vehicles in the province, once hard to reach with any transportation means for centuries but now proud to have a web of highways and local roadways through mountainous terrains reaching every county and city seats and rural villages. The mountain park province, as Chen called it, is boasting the world's largest water fall, arguably one of the world's oldest military fortress and the world's largest botanic garden, plus mountains, canyons, karst caves, forests, grassland, wetland and lakes, 3 of them on the list of world heritage sites recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). As colorful as the natural scenes are the people living on the territory, Chen noted at the San Francisco event attended by state and city officials and tourism industry representatives, adding that 17 ethnic hill tribes are there in Guizhou to show their rich and diversified and strikingly beautiful heritages, from clothing to music and dance, from construction structures of their residence to festive rituals. Tourists to Guizhou saw a 40 percent increase last year, he said. At both events, Chen showed pictures of a new structure, a radio telescope known as the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, the world's largest and most sensitive of the kind, inaugurated in Guiping county, Guizhou, on Sunday, Sept. 25. Built with a 4,450-panel reflector as large as 30 football pitches to survey neutral hydrogen in deep space, observe celestial objects called pulsars, help with spacecraft tracking and communication, FAST is expected to help search for extraterrestrial intelligent life, or ET, possibly existing somewhere in the universe. Chen said FAST is a new must see for visitors to his province. Previously a top administrator in a district of Beijing before being reassigned to Guizhou about three years ago, the official did not consider switching the topics from tourism to big data as a frog leap. He believes both industries can work on a eco-friendly development strategy for a province relatively less industrial and yet having huge economic potentials. However, Min Song, a Chinese-American presiding over local U.S.-China Cultural and Communication Association, who helped organize the big data promotion event, was amazed. He visited Guizhou once on a business trip some 20 years ago, when it was one of the least developed provinces in China, said he never thought about the province would be turned into a high technology host of any kind. "You are all welcome to tour Guizhou," Chen told his audiences.    1 2       1 2    分享 Xinhua Weibo Facebook Twitter Reddit Diigo Delicious Digg Linkedin MySpace Sina Weibo Kaixin Renren Q-zone Tencent Weibo Sohu Weibo NetEase Weibo • China-U.S. tourism sees decade of progress: official • Feature: Cultural festival in Istanbul seeks to boost tourism, commerce • China, Thailand ink MoU to develop quality tourism • Mexico to promote tourism in China Chinese vice premier meets with int'l advisors of CIC in Beijing 1st Int'l Bamboo Architecture Biennale held in east China Crnival promoting Chinese intangible cultural heritage opens in Beijing Alataw Pass: Largest land port on Kazakhstan border in China's Xinjiang Israeli parliament holds ceremony in memory of Shimon Peres Afghan girl students attend class at Surya High School in Kabul Pakistan hosts around three million Afghan refugees Singapore police rescue 2-year-old boy held hostage for 17 hours Back to Top Close 010020070750000000000000011100001357208191

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration Memristor that forgets makes a good model neuron New device mimics how neurons alter behavior once they're activated. by John Timmer - Sep 28, 2016 10:45 pm UTC Login to bookmark 37 Memristor characterization silicon at Hewlett Packard Labs. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise While the human brain isn't particularly quick at handling complex calculations, it performs a variety of tasks, such as image analysis, far more accurately than any computer. And, when it comes to energy efficiency, a brain beats a traditional computer with ease. Which is why it's somewhat ironic that all the original attempts to model a brain were forced to use software running on traditional computers, since that was all we had. Recently, however, there have been a variety of attempts to build hardware that acts more like a collection of neurons than anything that Apple or Intel have designed. While some of that uses traditional silicon-based transistors, other efforts have explored a relatively newer development, the memristor. Now, an international collaboration that includes everyone from Hewlett Packard Enterprise to the Air Force has designed a memristor that behaves a bit more like a neuron: its recent activity influences how it responds. This is accomplished by allowing metal to diffuse within the solid memristor. The idea behind the new design was apparently inspired by our understanding of neurons. In many cases, the activity of a neuron isn't only set by the signals it's receiving right at that instant. Instead, it has the biochemical equivalent of short-term memory. If it's received signals in the recent past, it's easier to activate that neuron by an additional signal. Over time, that memory fades, and the neuron goes back to its normal level of responsiveness. Now, it's undoubtedly possible to provide an artificial neuron with a small bit of memory and circuitry to read it, all of which could provide similar behavior. But this team managed to do it using just a single memristor. The secret was a clever bit of materials science. A memristor is a device with two states that it can be switched between. In one, it provides high resistance to current traveling through it; in the alternate state, it allows current to pass more freely. In this case, the authors fabricated a memristor using a silicon-oxygen-nitrogen material (the precise composition varied, and they also tested a hafnium oxide). To carry the current in the "on" state, they embedded some silver nanoparticles. This led to the sort of behavior you'd expect from a memristor. When sufficient current was applied to the device, the heat generated by its resistance allowed the silver to diffuse within the solid, forming small "wires" that connected the two ends, allowing current to pass easily. The intriguing thing is what happens once the current is switched off. Normally, you'd expect that things would stay in the low-resistance state. But something called (and I am not making this up) Ostwald ripening occurs. When there's a bunch of small particles embedded in a solid, the energetics of that depends on how compatible the two materials are. If they're not very compatible, it becomes energetically favorable to minimize the contact between them. That means fewer, larger particles. And, because solids can (to a limited extent) diffuse within each other, that's exactly what happens. Smaller particles shrink out of existence, as their component atoms diffuse over and join larger ones. For this memristor, this is precisely what happens to the silver. Instead of remaining in longer, wire-like structures, it quickly condenses back to a small collection of larger particles through Ostwald ripening (why yes, I will use that term as often as I possibly can). This has a very specific effect on the device. If signals in the form of current have transited it within the last few seconds, it'll still be in the "on" state, and the current will travel with low resistance. Longer than that, however, and Ostwald ripening ensures that it goes back to the off state, meaning that any additional signals face high resistance. This also sets an activity threshold for the memristor, as it has to receive more than one signal in quick succession before it will become active—again, a bit like a neuron. The authors of the paper describing this device spend a lot of time arguing that this behavior specifically mimics how neurons handle the calcium they use to help trigger activity. That's probably overstating it, as neurons are quite a bit more complex than a single electronic device. Still, there's no question that this device acts a lot more like a neuron than most typical circuitry does. And the authors have managed to make them using a variety of materials, so it's apparently robust behavior. Whether this will end up useful enough to end up in a neural computer isn't clear at this point. But I'm always enthused at having more potential tools available to anyone who's trying to assemble something like that. It's impossible to know in advance which combination of hardware approaches is eventually going to prove compelling. Nature Materials, 2016. DOI: 10.1038/NMAT4756  (About DOIs).

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)More Over the past month, voter registration databases in states across the United States have continued to come under attack by hackers, FBI Director James Comey warned lawmakers today. "There have been a variety of scanning activities, which is a preamble for potential intrusion activities, as well as some attempted intrusions at voter registration databases beyond those we knew about in July and August," he told the House Judiciary Committee. "There's no doubt that some bad actors have been poking around." Comey did not say whether those hacking attempts were on behalf of any foreign government, but his comments came amid increasing concern over suspected Russian attempts to break into U.S. political institutions and influence the upcoming presidential election. In August, the FBI issued a warning to state governments noting that hackers infiltrated the Illinois State Board of Elections two months earlier and then tried to breach election systems in Arizona. Sources have told ABC News that Russian hackers were likely behind the cyberattacks. Speaking to lawmakers today, Comey said the FBI is trying to figure out "just what mischief is Russia up to in connection with our election." Top Intel Official Tells Americans to End 'Hyperventilation' Over DNC Hack but Calls Breach Potentially 'Serious' He emphasized that voter registration databases — not the voting system itself — are being targeted by hackers. "This is very different than the vote system in the United States, which is very, very hard for someone to hack into because it's so clunky and dispersed," Comey said, adding that states should be in contact with the Department of Homeland Security and "make sure that their deadbolts are thrown and their locks are on." He added, "That is work that goes on all day, every day." During a separate House hearing, a top Department of Homeland Security official, the head of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and the secretary of state of Georgia all said a cyberattack could not change the outcome of the 2016 election. A cyber-expert from New York University agreed, calling it unlikely, but a Princeton University professor described it as possible. Dr. Andy Ozment, the assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications at DHS, said hackers who broke into the voter registration system in Illinois and targeted a similar system in Arizona appear to have been looking to copy the personal information in those databases and perhaps then sell that information online. The aim was apparently not to affect the election process, he said. "We have not seen intrusions intended to in any way impact individuals' votes and actual voting," Ozment said. For months, the FBI has been investigating what appear to be coordinated cyberattacks on Democratic organizations -- the most damaging so far being the hack of the Democratic National Committee. Not only did the hack apparently allow cyberoperatives to steal opposition research on Republican nominee Donald Trump, but many suspect it also led to the theft of internal messages that appeared to show efforts by DNC officials to undermine Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during the primary season. After those damaging emails were publicly released by WikiLeaks, Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down as the DNC's chairwoman. Many suspect Russian hackers are also to blame for these cyberassaults on Democratic organizations. In late June an "unknown actor scanned a state's Board of Election website for vulnerabilities" and, after identifying a security gap, exploited the vulnerability to conduct a "data exfiltration," or unauthorized data transfer, the FBI said in a recent bulletin. Then in August, hackers used the same vulnerability in an "attempted intrusion activities into another state's Board of Election system," the FBI said. "The prospect of a hostile government actively seeking to undermine our free and fair elections represents one of the gravest threats to our democracy since the Cold War," Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., wrote in a recent letter to Comey.

The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber and Google which are also working on autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardisation and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until some time around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. Last year BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, joined forces to buy digital map maker HERE for 2.8 billion euros (US$3.15 billion) from Nokia and this week will introduce a service that allows drivers to see for themselves what road conditions are like miles ahead using live data contributed by other vehicles.

By Zhai Yun Tan, Staff September 28, 2016 Save for later Saved Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella walks off the stage after delivering the keynote address at the Microsoft Build Conference in March 2016. Nadella is an Indian-born American. Eric Risberg/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of While the technology industry is heavily criticized for lack of diversity, Asians are rarely part of the discussion, owing to the prevailing stereotype of Asians as engineers and coders well-loved by Silicon Valley. But a lawsuit filed Monday by the US Department of Labor may change the narrative. Palantir Technologies, a data company co-founded by tech financier Peter Thiel and partially financed by the investment arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, was accused of routinely discriminating against Asian job candidates in its hiring process. The lawsuit is the first of its kind against a Silicon Valley company, Rose Darling, a senior trial attorney for the Labor Department tells the Associated Press. The suit is unusual because company reports and industry studies show that Asians are overrepresented in the tech industry. Efforts to diversify hiring practices more often focus on adding women, African Americans, and Hispanics into the workforce instead of Asians. Recommended: Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Palantir denied the allegations Monday and said it will contest the suit. It said that the government's case "relies on a narrow and flawed statistical analysis relating to three job descriptions from 2010 to 2011." Test your knowledge Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/18 Still, the lawsuit brings some scrutiny to bear on Asian representation in Silicon Valley, bringing to the surface an issue that the Asian American community has rallied around in the past: Representation doesn't mean diversity has been achieved. While Asians are well-represented in the tech industry, the representation doesn’t extend to the executive level, a phenomena that applies to other minority groups as well. A study released May 2015 by Ascend, a pan-Asian organization of business professionals in North America, found that while Asians represent 27.2 percent of the professional workforce for tech giants Google, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, LinkedIn and Yahoo, only 13.9 percent of them are executives.   “The common assumption is that Asians are successful since so many of them already work in Silicon Valley companies,” Janet Wong, a former partner at KPMG and study co-author said in a press release. "However, our deeper EPI analysis reveals that while Asians are well-represented – even overrepresented – at the staff and professional levels, they are underrepresented in the management pipeline and barely seen at the executive levels." The executive positions are dominated by white men followed by white women, Hispanic men and Asian men, with black women and Hispanic women at the tail end. There are as many Asian professionals as white professionals in these companies, but the report finds that white women and men are 154 percent more likely to be an executive. Asian women are especially underrepresented at the management level. Some of the reasons the researchers gave for the small number of Asian employees transitioning to management positions include a lack of role models and gaps in leadership expectations and training. “I consider myself third-generation Chinese American, and I grew up with my parents and grandparents, and their culture was what I grew up with,” Ms. Wong told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. “They told me all I needed to do was stay in school, make good grades, and that was all I needed to be successful. They never taught me the soft skills or leadership skills. So when I started my career, I thought all I had to do was keep my head down, do good work, and I’d be acknowledged and have a successful career.” Other studies have also found  wage gaps between minorities and whites in the high-tech industry, although the gap between Asians and whites is smaller than for other minorities, as USA Today reported in 2014. Some Asian employees in the tech industry have spoken out on social media about that the lack of dissent in the Asian community, and theorized that it could be part of the reason why the problem persists. “We are the “model minority” – quiet, hardworking, well-educated, successful in a middle class sort of way.… It’s good enough that we don’t complain about the erasure of our individual identities and work ethic and personal successes, we don’t complain about the bamboo ceiling, we stay quiet on issues of race,” wrote Tracy Chou, software engineer at Pinterest in a LinkedIn post. “To my fellow Asians in tech: It’s time for us to start caring, to start talking, to start doing something about the racial disparities in our industry.” Some Asian Americans in the tech industry may feel awkward discussing this when it may seem as if they already have a foot in the door. Some may point to Indian executives at companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Nokia as examples of Asians representation in the tech industry, the Wall Street Journal reports.  Anil Dash, an Indian American and a two-decade veteran in the tech industry, argues in a Medium post that those are rare. In fact, Mr. Dash tells The Christian Science Monitor in a phone interview, the situation is getting worse compared to when he entered the field. “There has been a lot of pushback … (and sentiment of) I got in, why am i going to complain?” Dash says. “Especially for first generation immigrants who are excited about the opportunity, but also don’t know the tradeoff they’re making.” Dash points out the tendency for these companies to hire foreigners in the tech industry as one of the reasons. These employees with no permanent immigration status – many are Asians –  face problems securing their status and don’t hold much leverage in asking for career advancement. The Ascend report recommends examining the hiring processes to ensure biases are absent and to develop culture-specific leadership programs. Many tech companies now  have initiatives to increase the numbers of Asians and other minorities in leadership positions, The Los Angeles Times reports. Dash, like Chou, says he believes that Asians in the tech industry, especially Asian men, should begin speaking up for themselves and for other minority groups. Non-Asian minority groups still face hurdles in accessing capital, technology, and perceptional biases in even getting their foot in the door compared to Asians. “We should acknowledge that we haven’t said enough about anti-Black and anti-Latino attitudes, and that we have not articulated our complicity in industry sexism and misogyny. Indeed, we have often helped build these systems of exclusion, not merely remained silent while they were enforced,” he wrote in the Medium post two years ago. “We can do justice to our peers and coworkers who are working in an unfair system, bringing them closer to the level playing field they deserve.” Next up Test your knowledge Would Google hire you? 10 test questions to find out Focus Can familiarity build trust?

I’m writing this paragraph in Word for Windows on Windows 10. The process is as smooth as you’d expect on PC hardware built for Windows, with no hesitation or freezing, and all the features are enabled. But I’m not using a Windows PC; I’m using a three-year-old MacBook Air. And I haven’t had to give over the Air entirely to Windows. Instead, I’m running Windows 10 and its apps concurrently with the brand-new macOS Sierra. For instance, the Windows version of Word is running in its own window, right alongside open Mac apps, including Apple Mail and Safari. I’m doing this all with the new version of a 10-year-old program, Parallels Desktop, from a Seattle-area company of the same name, which came out last month for $80. It’s faster and smoother than ever, and has some new tricks, including a new Mac utility suite that’s also sold separately. With ParalleIs Desktop, I can hop back and forth between Sierra and Windows 10 — and even between individual apps — with ease. I just copied and pasted the paragraph above into Apple’s proprietary Notes app, exactly as I could from a native Mac app. And I wrote this sentence in Notes and copied and pasted it back into the Windows version of Word. Then I copied and pasted the whole thing again from Word for Windows into Google Docs running in Safari natively on the Mac. Windows 10, windowed, on a three-year-old MacBook Air Through all this, the aging Air performed smoothly and quickly, even though I’m now running three Windows apps and 11 Mac apps, including two browsers — Microsoft Edge and Apple Safari — with about 15 tabs open, total. That includes two instances of the constantly updating TweetDeck app for Twitter power users. The only sign of strain is the constant, low whir of the fans. But, to be honest, my faithful Air cranks up the fans pretty often these days even when running just macOS, and did so even before Sierra. (God, I hope Apple gives the Air a power bump, and soon.) When Parallels first came out, in 2006, I called it “a pleasure to use” and “the best of both worlds.” After using this new version, Parallels 12, I can say with confidence that, in my tests, it still is. If you love and use the Mac, but need to use a few Windows apps, Parallels does the trick. The world has changed However, the world has changed a lot since then, and the need for Parallels has diminished for average Mac users. When it was launched, shortly after Apple switched the Mac to the same Intel processors that Windows used, it was a big deal, because there were still lots of apps only available for Windows, or which — like Microsoft Office — were vastly better on Windows. Parallels also offered a smoother solution than Apple’s own method for solving this problem: a feature called Boot Camp that’s still built into the Mac. Boot Camp also allowed running Windows on a Mac, but it required you to carve out a separate Windows partition on your hard disk, and you could only run one OS at a time. You had to reboot each time you wanted to switch. Mac-native and web-based apps are more ubiquitous now than in 2006 Now, however, the web and web apps have drastically reduced Mac users’ need to run local Windows apps. Macs have become more common (though still a minority of PCs) and app makers have produced many more good Mac-native apps than existed in 2006. Even Microsoft has brought the native Mac version of Office far closer to parity with the Windows version. Perhaps even more important has been the rise of smartphones and tablets, where Apple maintains a strong position. Many PC use cases have moved to mobile apps, and Apple’s iOS mobile operating system gets excellent versions of these apps, and often gets them first. The Mac-Windows rivalry has been replaced by the iOS-Android rivalry, and iPhone and iPad users aren’t at an app disadvantage. But some still will find it useful So why would anyone still need or want Parallels? Well, some programs and sites, especially in banking and finance, are still Windows-only, or still require Internet Explorer, which lacks a Mac version. Some people who work for big companies still need to use in-house apps that run on Windows only. Some power users of Office still prefer the Windows version. Developers also find it useful. And Parallels doesn’t just run Windows 10: it can run multiple versions of Windows, Linux, and even older Mac operating systems in virtual machines. Plus, heavy-duty PC games are still written almost entirely for Windows. Parallels can solve the first set of issues, but, while it has gotten better at Windows games, it can’t handle enough of them well enough for me to recommend it to gamers. (The company does say that Parallels 12 can, with the proper settings, let you play Blizzard’s Overwatch, as an example. And it says it can handle the Xbox app on Windows 10, because the Xbox is doing the work. But I didn’t test games.) Interoperability between the two systems is impressive, and goes well beyond copy and paste. For instance, I was able, on the first try, to get Apple’s Siri (now on the Mac) to launch the Windows Calendar app and to get Spotlight to launch Groove Music on Windows. And I was able to get Cortana, the Windows assisant, to launch Keynote from the macOS. Icons for Windows 10 and for individual Windows programs you’re using show up in the Mac’s Dock just like Mac apps, and can be kept there permanently if you like. On the Windows side, Mac folder icons live on the desktop next to local Windows ones. You can open and work on Mac files with your Windows apps. And a C: drive appears in the Mac Finder’s list of sources, so you can call up Windows files. The Mac’s Command key works as the Windows key when you’re using Windows. Parallels has always stored its virtual machine in a big file in the Documents folder on the Mac, which also includes files you saved to the virtual PC. But it takes up less room than you’d think, and, in Sierra, this big file can automatically be moved to the cloud. In my tests, Parallels 12 cost me only about nine gigabytes, even though I have two Parallels virtual machines: a new Windows 10 one and an older one running Windows 8. Fetching things from the cloud worked quickly. A new utility The company is also touting a new companion utility, called Parallels Toolbox, which lives in the Mac’s toolbar and lets you do a variety of things with one or two clicks. These include locking the screen, muting the mic, archiving files, downloading streaming media from the web, and recording actions on the screen. It works whether you’re running Mac or Windows at the moment. In my tests, it worked well, and the company says it will add more features over time. But it’s expensive for a utility bundle, at $10 a year. (A basic version is bundled with the standard edition of Parallels Desktop; the edition which will get more features is included with pricier Pro and Business versions of Parallels, which cost $100 a year.) Pricing As noted above, the basic edition of Parallels 12 costs $80, at parallels.com. But unless you got it as a free upgrade, you’ll also have to buy Windows 10. I bought a copy for $120, using a very nice Parallels wizard that takes you to Microsoft’s web store to buy it, then installs it for you. It will also install a legal disk image of Windows if you get one elsewhere. Bottom line I have a soft spot for breakthrough products like Parallels, even years after they appear. I remain impressed by its quality and performance. And I can recommend it for developers, or average Mac users who just need to use a few Windows apps. Correction: an earlier version of this column mistakenly omitted the fact that a basic version of Parallels Toolbox is bundled with the standard edition of Parallels Desktop.

ITProPortal Search RSS News Features Analysis Guides Reviews Categories Business Hardware Security Software Mobile Enterprise Cloud Networks Public Sector Startups Web Enterprises would rather go for IaaS instead of PaaS or SaaS By Sead Fadilpašić DevOps teams spend most of their time managing complex environments, a new report says. Shares Just above half of enterprises (51 per cent), which decide to deploy a cloud solution, opt for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), over Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), or Software-as-a-Service (Saas).  This is according to a new report by Intel DCM, based on a survey of 204 US-based IT managers, directors, software engineers and DevOps responsible for overseeing their enterprise cloud strategy. The report also states that DevOps teams spend most of their time monitoring complex environments in their organisation.  That includes tuning infrastructure, and remediation analysis. Besides Software-as-a-Service, and Platform-as-a-Service, IaaS is considered a main category for cloud computing services. It provides virtualised computing resources, over the internet. It works by having a third party provider hosting all the hardware, software, servers, storage and any other infrastructure components. Applications are also handled by the host, including things like system maintenance and backup.  The biggest advantage of IaaS platforms is that they are an extremely scalable resource, which can be expanded or shrunk, depending on the needs of the business using it. IaaS is usually considered the number one option for temporary or experimental workloads.  There are many Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers out there, with Amazon (Amazon Web Services – AWS), Google (Google Compute Engine), and Microsoft (Windows Azure) standing out as the biggest competitors. Other notable mentions include Rackspace (Open Cloud) and IBM (SmartCloud Enterprise).

Packed with visitors sporting virtual reality headsets and operating drones with their hands, the halls were filled with technology that Intel was eager to put on display to demonstrate its shift from supplier of chips for computers to all-around tech company ready to take on the challenges of a changing environment. “What we are seeing here are the newest technologies the brain is capable of inventing,” Maxine Fassberg, CEO of Intel Israel, said in a brief interview in the sunny courtyard outside the hall, at the HaTachana site, Tel Aviv’s old railway station, where DLD is being held. “Intel is the connection between these brains that work daily on futuristic developments and Israel’s ecosystem of innovation.” In April the chief executive officer of Intel Corp., Brian Krzanich, laid out the company’s new strategy of transforming Intel from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices. To make this shift, Intel said it planned to increase investments in its data center, Internet of Things and memory and connectivity businesses, as well as growing its business in gaming and home gateways. Intel also announced it would reduce its global workforce by 11 percent by mid-2017. And indeed, on display at DLD were technologies that included virtual reality headsets, drones, wireless gaming headsets and sensors, developed both in Israel and at Intel sites globally, which Intel hopes will power its products and those of other companies. Robot tanks designed by Intel do battle at the DLD Tel Aviv Innovation Festival. September 27, 2016. (Luke Tress/Times of Israel) Among the technologies was a headset fitted out with an Intel RealSense camera that allows users to juxtapose virtual reality within real surroundings. You could, for example, look at the room around you and then, looking through the headset, use your hand to click on a virtual button and choose furniture – say, a couch – to place into the room. In this way you could see how the space would look with that couch in it. Israeli startup OutSense had on display a toilet with a box attached to the seat fitted with a tiny Intel computer that connects to a mobile app that helps analyze excretions. “We want to make sampling of stool history,” said Dr. Yaara Kapp-Barnea, the chief executive of the company. The stool analysis data is sent to a cloud and from there can be used to manage health, nutrition and stress issues, Kapp-Barnea said.

(Luke Tress/Times of Israel) Intel’s other technologies included the Wigig for wireless gaming, in which a headset without cables allows you to play games by moving your head; a robot fitted with a camera that manages to detect and avoid obstacles; a drone that can be activated without a joystick, by just moving your hand in front of a camera; and a smart home, in which devices like lights, TV and the front door can be operated through a computer fitted with a camera that reads hand or head gestures and would be thus suitable for people with disabilities.

Together with Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm Incorporated the automotive giants are launching the “5G Automotive Association” that will develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardization and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration. The goal of this new endeavor is to address society’s connected mobility and road safety needs with applications such as connected automated driving, ubiquitous access to services and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation. With next generation 5G mobile networks and continued strong LTE evolution, which includes Cellular Vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, the focus of information and communication technologies (ICT) witowards the Internet of Things and the digitalization of industries. As an evolution to today’s networks, next generation mobile networks are expected to handle much more data volume, connect many more devices, significantly reduce latency and bring new levels of reliability. For example, 5G can better support mission-critical communications for safer driving and will further support enhanced vehicle-to-everything communications and connected mobility solutions. These new solutions bring new technological and business opportunities for both the automotive and ICT industries, and the members of the association will closely collaborate to realize the full potential together. The association will address key technical and regulatory issues, leveraging next generation mobile networks and integrating vehicle platforms with connectivity, networking and computing solutions. Through this new association, the companies will be looking to define and harmonize use cases, technical requirements and implementation strategies as well as supporting standardization and regulatory bodies, certification and approval processes. Addressing vehicle-to-everything technology requirements, such as wireless connectivity, security, privacy, authentication and distributed cloud architectures will also play an important role in the scope of the association later down the line. Christoph Voigt is appointed Chairperson of the Board and Dino Flore is appointed Director General of the Association. The Association will support and work in close cooperation with national and regional initiatives, such as the European Connected & Automated Driving Pre-Deployment Project. audiBMW ConnectedDriveHERE mapsMercedes Benz Previous post BMW testing a 1 Series Sedan M Performance in Spain Next post Video: BMW M2 Versus Porsche Cayman S on the Track RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Most BMWs to lose ConnectedDrive services in 2017 If you currently have a new-ish BMW with ConnectedDrive or BMW Assist features, such as SOS, BMW Assist eCall and Concierge Call, it’s likely you will … Will the Inline-Six engine be the new norm?

Internally termed as 'Bison', the ultra thin pixel 3 laptop will come with a 12.3 display and completely supports tablet mode too. Bison is speculated to be powered by either Intel core M5 or Core i5 processor wherein it'll be supplemented by 8GB and 16GB RAM for 32GB and 128GB hard disks respectively. With 10mm thickness and finger print scanner, the price of this Google's hardware may start from 799$. Reportedly, the Andromeda OS is also coming in a Huawei-made Nexus tablet which would likely hit the markets by end of this year or early 2017. Being named as Huawei 7P, Google's tablet comes with 7 inch display and 4GB RAM. Andromeda OS, being the mix bag of Chrome and Android, is something to looking forward for and it'll first be introduced in all Nexus-tablets. Google, which recently launched a counterpart to WhatsApp in the form of Allo, is considering to target Apple's MacBook with 'Bison'. Also, the company is planning to release its pixel smartphone at an official event next week.

Properly insuring these vehicles and their occupants, says Quadrant Information Services, will require new, high-speed approaches to data analysis. Pleasanton, CA (PRWEB) September 28, 2016 In August, Ford Motor Company announced plans to produce fully autonomous cars by 2021. These vehicles will be manufactured in high-volume production and will be tailored for ride-hailing and ride-sharing operations, which means they will not have steering wheels, brake pedals, or other controls for human occupants.1 “This is a new world for insurers,” said Michael Macauley, CEO of Quadrant Information Services, a leading supplier of pricing analytics services to property and casualty insurance carriers. “The industry will need a whole new set of data tools to deal with this.” Macauley noted that at the moment, auto insurance rates are based on what an insurer knows about the driver, the driver’s residential area, and the car. The combination of a teenage driver, a new Corvette Stingray and a high-crime neighborhood, for example, would yield one rate. A middle-aged driver with a perfect record, a quiet home town and a five-year-old Honda would yield quite another. Now, however, the industry is confronting a situation wherein there may be no driver, in which case, the owner’s age and driving record would be largely irrelevant. Coverage and rate decisions would be based on a wide range of variables, among them traffic patterns, prevailing climatic conditions (there is some question as to how well driverless cars manage in rain and snow2) and, above all, the track record of the various technologies involved. “These vehicles,” Macauley said, “will be the work not so much of a single manufacturer, but of a consortium.” He noted that Ford’s announcement of its forthcoming driverless cars described partnerships with Velodyne (lidar sensors that capture high-resolution images of the area around the vehicles), SAIPS (an Israel-based computer vision and machine learning company which Ford acquired in August), Civil Maps (a California-based company that develops high-resolution 3D maps), and Nirenberg Neuroscience (a machine-vision company that specializes in object recognition and bringing human-like levels of intelligence to machine modules). Prospective competitors are making similar arrangements; BMW, Mobileye and Intel, for example, recently announced that they are partnering on fully-autonomous vehicle technology to apply in a shared environment by 2021.3 Questions have been raised about the safety of self-driving vehicles, particularly since a driver in a Tesla Model S in self-driving mode was killed when the car drove itself into the side of a semitrailer in Florida last May. In its statement about the incident, Tesla did not delineate the driver’s level of engagement at the time of the crash, but it did note that “neither the autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the semitrailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.”4 Some manufacturers—including Ford—are pursuing a path towards a fully computer-managed, no-human-driver car, because they feel that hybrid approaches which allow for some degree of human control, such as Tesla’s, contain an unacceptable level of built-in risk. Google, for example (which has its own driverless car program), decided on the no-wheel, no-pedals approach after allowing its employees to drive the company’s test cars. “There was a brief period when people would be a little nervous and monitor the car very carefully,” Google engineer Nathanial Fairfield said, “and then they would start to relax and trust the system, and then they would over-trust the system and start to get distracted.” After watching a driver rummaging around in his back seat in search of a phone-charging cord, Google engineers decided it would be too risky to create a system wherein a driver would be expected to take control of the car at a critical moment.5 “Obviously,” Quadrant’s Macauley said, “it’s not going to be up to the property and casualty insurance industry to determine when driverless cars take to the road, how they operate, and what kinds of technology they use. It is, however, going to be up to insurance carriers to understand the situation and evaluate the risks posed by different operators—if that’s even the right word—in different cars on different roads and in different weather, using a variety of technologies. To do that, they will need robust, cloud-based computing and powerful, high-speed data analytics. This is essential, because with people putting themselves on the road while in the hands of technology they don’t control, the importance of making sure drivers are properly insured is exponentially high—as will be the demand for that insurance. In this emerging world of new and very complex risk factors, big data tools, such as those under development at Quadrant, will be crucial to the ability of agencies to find the right plans for their customers.” About Quadrant Information Services: Quadrant Information Services, headquartered in Pleasanton, CA, provides pricing analytics solutions for property and casualty insurance companies. Quadrant gives actuary, product development, pricing, sales and marketing personnel at its client companies—which include all the major insurance carriers in the United States— the data they need in order to make accurate, data-driven decisions.

The unit was meant for serious hobbyists, and came as a bare piece of metal to which you could add your choice of parts. Much assembly was required. Then, in December of 2012, DJI released the Phantom, and everything changed. The company was so used to operating in the background that the first Phantom didn’t carry DJI’s brand, save for a small, removable sticker. But the product quickly blossomed into a massive hit. "They kind of reinvented the whole industry with that," says Michael Blades, a drone industry analyst with Frost and Sullivan. The Phantom was powerful enough to appeal to professionals, but simple enough for beginners. It had serious range and stability, but required no assembly out of the box. "That really bridged the gap between a toy and tool," says Blades. In the four years since, DJI has emerged as the clear industry leader. "They became the 800-pound gorilla."" Reading this, I was struck by how easily you could replace "Flamewheel" with "Apple I," and "Phantom" with "Apple II," and you’d be describing the beginnings of one of the most famous innovation stories in US history. But DJI isn’t based in the US — it’s a technology company based in China, and that should worry Silicon Valley. The great U.S. hope failed DJI isn’t just a drone company, it’s the drone company. If you’ve got the cash, you start by looking at DJI and then work your way down a growing list of Chinese quadcopter makers. GoPro entered the drone market last week with the announcement of its foldable Karma. The great US hope inexplicably failed, however, to include two features any thrill-seeking GoPro fan requires: collision avoidance and follow-me. DJI’s brand-new Mavic Pro delivers those missing features and then some for roughly the same price as the Karma, including new hands-free gesture controls that let you wave your arms to get the drone’s attention and then signal it to follow you. What could be better for the self-obsessed snowboarders, surfers, or mountain bikers that dominate GoPro advertising? I shouldn’t be too hard on GoPro. After all, it’s a newcomer to flight — unlike another US drone maker, 3D Robotics. Like DJI, 3DR grew out of the DIY drone scene popular with hobbyists and aerial cinema pros. It even hired Colin Guinn, former head of DJI North America. 3DR’s Solo drone looked like a strong competitor to the DJI Phantom when it launched last year. Unfortunately, the company ran into manufacturing and supply chain issues that crippled delivery. 3DR has since turned its back on consumer drones in order to focus on enterprise applications, causing it to shed a number of employees in the process. Colin Guinn left 3DR earlier this month. DJI’s class-leading machine vision technology is provided by Movidius, soon to be a new division of Intel. So at least the Valley is represented by having its silicon inside some of China’s most advanced drones. But the code enabling Mavic’s advanced flight capabilities is developed in-house by DJI. Intel is also a major investor in Yuneec — DJI’s chief competitor. In April, DJI filed a patent lawsuit against China-based Yuneec, leading some to speculate that DJI will look elsewhere for its Vision Processing Unit chips after the Intel acquisition was announced three weeks ago (DJI’s new Mavic Pro uses Movidius’ latest VPU). In the 2000s, China was notorious for producing a glut of cheap gadget clones of absurd quality and laughable branding like "Nokla" and "iPhonc." Back in the day when most of The Verge's founders wrote for Engadget, we ran a series called Keepin' It Real Fake, or KIRF. Almost without exception those brazen knock-offs were of Chinese origin. "They can copy fast, but they can’t innovate," went the refrain. DJI is the tip of the spear DJI is no KIRF. Far from it, and probably the most highly visible exception that China has yet to produce. DJI’s innovations are most visible at the product level, but they can also be seen in manufacturing, retail, and the customer experience. I’d wager it’s only the point of a spear headed right for the heart of Silicon Valley. And if DJI is the tip, then companies like Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo, and Huawei form the shaft that will quickly follow.

Amy Schumer Is The Most Dangerous Celebrity To Search For In 2016 By Ed Biggs in Lifestyle / Showbiz on 28 September 2016 Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest StumbleUpon Reddit Fark Email Comment Follow Amy Schumer Amy Schumer Justin Bieber Ellie Goulding Will Smith Rita Ora Rihanna Calvin Harris Internet security Intel Security (McAfee) published its annual list of the most dangerous celebrities to search for online in 2016. She’s long been a thorn in the side of the patriarchy with her irreverent and forthright brand of comedy, but now Amy Schumer is proving to be actively dangerous – to internet users who search for her name! A new report conducted on various search engines by anti-virus experts shows that Amy Schumer has been the most dangerous name to search for online in 2016, as the internet security firm Intel Security published its annual list of the TV, music and film stars whose names are most regularly hijacked by hackers to lure people to sites carrying malware. Amy Schumer is the most dangerous celebrity to search for online in 2016 Hackers use the public’s interest in celebrity news to entice unsuspecting fans to web addresses that download viruses to their computers, or steal passwords and personal information for the purposes of identity theft. Often, such sites are cleverly disguised as reputable news outlets. The research shows that a search for Amy Schumer carries a 16.11% risk of clicking on a rogue site like this – the highest of any celebrity in the United States. In descending order, Justin Bieber, TV host Carson Daly, Will Smith and Rihanna all have a greater than 13% chance of producing such a result. More: Watch Amy Schumer’s hilarious ‘KissCam’ moment with boyfriend Ben Hanisch For British users, the most dangerous celebrity to search for was Ellie Goulding, with fellow pop stars Rita Ora and Calvin Harris and reality TV stars Charlotte Crosby and Holly Hagan in the top five. Nick Viney, consumer vice president at Intel Security – known as McAfee in Europe – said of the new report: “The desire for consumers to stay up to date with the latest celebrity gossip can often make them unwittingly vulnerable to cybercrime. Many consumers are quick to click but do they actually stop and consider the potential risks this poses by doing so? “Cybercriminals are keen to exploit this craving for real-time information on celebrities, and will lead consumers to sites that download harmful malware onto devices to ultimately steal an individual's all important, and incredibly valuable, data.” More: Amy Schumer argues about wine with Ramona Singer during parody debate Contactmusic Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest StumbleUpon Reddit Fark Email Comment Follow Amy Schumer Advertisement Related Amy Schumer & Whoopi Goldberg: 'We're Not Leaving America' Goldie Hawn Plots Comedic Comeback After Working With Amy Schumer Amy Schumer buys $12.1 million NYC penthouse Amy Schumer Responds To Formation Parody Backlash Amy Schumer: 'Jay Z and Beyonce approved Formation video' Amy Schumer Branded Racist For 'Formation' Beyonce Parody Amy Schumer And Goldie Hawn Share Beyonce Parody Video Advertisement Amy Schumer Pens Open Letter To Those Who Walked Out Of Her Show After A Donald Trump Joke Amy Schumer Reads Open Letter About Tampa Walkouts Onstage Fans Walk Out Of Amy Schumer Show As Comedy Turns Political Amy Schumer Dissing Trump Causes Some Fans To Walk Out Of Florida Gig Amy Schumer Named Most Dangerous Celebrity To Search Online Amy Schumer Is The Most Dangerous Celebrity To Search For In 2016 Amy Schumer Makes History On Highest-paid Comedians List Advertisement Movies and Trailers Trainwreck Movie Review Amy Schumer makes her big screen debut with a script that feels like a much-extended...

Intel's Beignet OpenCL For Linux Now Supports LLVM 3.9 Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 28 September 2016 at 06:44 AM EDT. 2 Comments With the recent Beignet 1.2 release some Phoronix readers expressed disappointment that this Intel OpenCL implementation for Iris/HD Graphics hadn't supported the recently-released LLVM 3.9. Well, now it does. The patches have landed. It ended up being rather invasive supporting LLVM 3.9 with over 200 lines of new code to accommodate API changes made for this six-month update to the LLVM compiler stack. It would have been nice to see Beignet support this latest LLVM release earlier on, but at least now it's in Git for those wanting to pair it with the newest LLVM code. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets ​L&T Technology Services to focus on top 30, adjacent customers Rajesh Kurup   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Keshab Panda, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, LTTS Mumbai, Sept 28:   L&T Technology Services Ltd (LTTS), Larsen & Toubro’s engineering and research and development arm, is to focus more on its top 30 customers who contribute 65 per cent of its revenues. The company will also concentrate on adjacent companies that work in the same space as its clients. This is under the company’s policy, T-30 and A-3, which came into effect in April 2016, LTTS Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Keshab Panda told BusinessLine​ in an interview. LTTS revenues from T-30 accounts stood at 65 per cent of the total in FY16, which is expected to grow at the same or a higher pace this year, he said, declining to provide “futuristic” statements. Some of the top customers for LTTS are Danaher, Scania, UTC, P&G, John Deere and BMW, among others, according to the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) filed with market regulator SEBI. The company has developed Internet of Things (IoT) solutions such as UbiqWeise and iBEMS in emerging technology areas to support its customers, Panda said. LTTS has also tied up with Intel as its go-to-market partner for its smart buildings platform, iBEMS, which enables Net-Zero, energy generation management, predictive and preventive maintenance to help steer-away from energy consumption to energy generation and helps customers save up to 40 per cent of energy costs. Using UBIQWeise, LTTS has designed a smart connected thermostat that is WiFi capable and controls all aspects of indoor air leveraging IoT, cloud and mobility solutions. This solution has been rolled out in the North American market, Panda said. For the company, Europe and the US is about 80 per cent of the market, and these geographies are expected to grow on a revenue basis even though it could be steady on a percentage basis. The company is also looking at focusing more on Japan and Korea in Asia, he said, adding LTTS does “very little work” in West Asia, while exposure in the UK is close to zero. MONETISING PATENTS Further, LTTS has 168 patents of which 34 are owned by the company and 134 are co-authored with global clients. The company is also looking to monetise them. “We will look at monetising the patents, which are filed across different geographies.” However, he did not give a time line for the monetisation. LTTS debuted on September 23, following a $134-million initial public offering (IPO). The Rs 900-crore IPO of L&T Technology Services was oversubscribed 2.53 times during September 12-15. The price band for the offer was fixed at Rs 850-860. This is the second company from the L&T group to hit the market with an IPO since July, when L&T Infotech had launched a public offer. The flagship Larsen and Toubro is already listed.

English Cafe > Tech > Samsung Huawei’s smartwatch likely to run on Samsung Tizen OS   Published : 2016-09-28 16:47 Updated : 2016-09-29 14:28 [THE INVESTOR] Chinese tech behemoth Huawei is reportedly planning to develop smartwatches running on Tizen, an open-source operating system developed by a group of tech firms including Samsung Electronics and Intel. Local daily JoongAng Ilbo reported that Huawei has recently joined hands with Samsung, a leading Tizen alliance member, to deploy the operating system in its next smartwatches. The anticipated collaboration is the first of its kind since the launch of Tizen in 2012.  The local daily quoted an industry insider as saying, “Huawei was looking for an OS other than Google’s Android as the US firm had not been very collaborative.” Samsung, on the other hand, is said to have pledged to fully cooperate in having the Tizen OS tailored for the Chinese firm’s digital watches. Samsung has been trying to increase the presence of Tizen in the global OS market for the past years, but Google and Apple still enjoy dominance in the OS segment -- 86.2 percent and 12.9 percent, respectively, as of the second quarter this year, according to research firm Gartner. Samsung has rolled out low-range Galaxy Z smartphones and home appliances fitted with the Tizen OS. A spokesperson of Samsung, said, however, “Samsung has not officially received any request for such collaboration from Huawei yet.” By Kim Young-won (wone0102@heraldcorp.com) 영어뉴스를 통한 ListeningㆍReading 실력 향상 단기 학습 프로그램 [NEST] 1.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Lenovo X1 Yoga Review By Hubert Nguyen on 09/27/2016 05:00 PST Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Photos Introduced a while ago, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga has shipped for some time. We have waited to have both the LCD and OLED options before publishing this review. In our initial coverage of the X1 Yoga, it was evident that the only 14-inch OLED laptop display should be given a chance of proving itself in the real world. The X1 Yoga is Lenovo’s latest thin & light business laptop that continues a successful series built to pass military durability tests. The configuration tested has the following specifications: Intel i7 6500 2.5-2.59 GHz processor Other configurations include i5-6500U, i5-6300U, i7-6500U, and i76600U 8GB RAM Win 10 Pro LCD IPS and OLED display Samsung 512GB SSD over PCI-E Design With dimensions of 13.11 x 9.02 x 0.59 inches (333 x 229 x 15mm) and a weight of only 2.8 Lbs, the Lenovo X1 Yoga is positioned in the thin & light category of laptops which tends to blend portability and productivity well. The 2.8 lbs weight is comfortable, and well within the norm for this category of laptops. This is equivalent to Lenovo’s own Y900 (2.8Lbs) and the Dell XPS13 9350 (2.8 Lbs) that we previously reviewed but not as light as the Surface Pro 4 (1.73 Lbs) which remains the thinnest and lightest PC in this performance range. As usual with the Lenovo X1 Series, the keyboard is very comfortable, and keys have a travel distance of 1.86mm (60g of force), which is ideal for my use. The keys are large and comfortable, and I find the keyboard to be excellent in general. The only think that caught my attention is that the “Fn” button on the right side is now at the corner of the keyboard, where the CTRL key normally is. It’s slightly annoying at first, but I got used to it, eventually. The trackpad feels like it’s made of glass, and is very smooth. Its size is 100x58mm is nice, and Lenovo allows the users to either click on the pad itself or use one of the two physical left/middle/right buttons just above the trackpad. Normally, they are there to be used with the TrackPoint controller which is the red button between the B/G/H keys. Many Lenovo customers are die-hard fans, although I am not one myself. The Thinkpad X1 Yoga has a relatively large number of ports, and a quick look at the specs show WiGig, OneLink+, Mini DisplayPort, HDMI, 3 x USB 3.0, microSD. The three USB 3.0 ports are a great thing if you often work with USB devices such as Ethernet to USB adapter, mouse or USB keys, just to cite the frequent ones. The microSD port is hidden in the back of the laptop, next to a SIM card tray. As it was the case with previous models, the X1 Yoga has an integrated wireless broadband option (4G LTE-A). For power users, this is much better than creating a hotspot with your phone, if you can afford the additional SIM card subscription. Digital Pen (Wacom) The Lenovo X1 Yoga has an integrated Wacom Active ES pen. Note that this is different from the earlier Wacom EMR pens that Lenovo used to have. In case you want to buy compatible Wacom pens it’s a critical detail to know. The X1 comes pre-installed with the Wacom driver and the Wacom Pen Radial Menu utility. It lets you change things such as the pen tip sensitivity, the physical buttons functions and the pen calibration (it’s pretty time-sensitive). I’m no artist, but I’ve used Wacom tablets in the past. In general, I’m impressed with the pen, and the speed of the ink. The normal ink is very fast, and things will slow down as you use complex brushes but this is so much better than what we had just a year ago. If you wonder, it works well with Photoshop CC of course. Durability: MIL-STD-810G Drop Test compliant The ThinkPad X1 Yoga is one of the rare, if not the only, 13”-14” with a thin & light form factor. This has been one of the X1 staple features since the beginning, and it remains a potentially important criteria for users who may need extra durability over good looks. You can learn all the necessary details about the MIL-STD-810G tests, but the gist of it is that the Lenovo X1 Yoga design was dropped from a height of about 4-feet, and all its surfaces (faces, edges, corners) were tested and visually inspected for damage. The test was originally designed to make sure that U.S military equipment could survive the transport and storage in tough conditions. Lenovo says that the X1 passes eight military tests, but doesn’t provide details about which ones. The only one that I’m sure was included is the drop/shock test. Learn more: What is MIL-STD-810G? Not part of the MIL-STD-810G standard is the tough skin that the X1 has. I have used several generations of X1 laptops, and they are incredibly resilient to scratches and blemishes. Some of the issues that I had with all-metal aluminum bodies is that they could scratch pretty easily if there’s even a bit of dust/sand in the backpack. And the scratches can be quite visible. I never worried so much about the X1 family of laptops. The X1 Yoga passed the following tests: Humidity, Low Temperatures, High Temperatures, Sand, High Vibration, Shocks, 15000ft Altitude and Temperature Shock. Fingerprint touch sensor This time, Lenovo has integrated a touch fingerprint sensor (vs. swipe sensor). It works exactly like a smartphone fingerprint reader that you set up with a little utility for a few seconds. It worked very well and had very few false-positive (zero for now, but I assume it does happen sometimes). It is also more advanced that most options you can find for Desktop computers — it’s pretty amazing how primitive those finger-swiping USB sensors are. Because I use a fairly strong (long) password, and I don’t want to fallback to a measly 4-digit pin, I find the fingerprint sensor to be very convenient. Now, you can use a very strong password and won’t have to deal with it every time you come back to your locked laptop. Learn more: How do Fingerprint Scanners Work? Display: IPS or OLED The Lenovo X1 Yoga comes with two 2560×1440 touch display options: IPS or OLED. I had the opportunity to try both, and I will also compare it with the Lenovo Y900 IPS display as well. Note that there is a 1080p IPS Touch that I have not tested. The IPS display of the Lenovo X1 Yoga seems noticeably better than the Carbon X1 Gen 3. The backlight looks more evenly distributed, the colors look better, and the view angle seems to have improved as well. Since this was one of the rare weakness of the Carbon X1 Gen 3, I wanted to check that first. The brightness of this LCD display is 345 NIT when measured in our offices. The Lenovo Y900 IPS display comes with a glossy finish, which makes the colors “pop” more and can make the image seem a bit sharper thanks to the 3200×1800 resolution. However, it is more reflective outdoors, and of course, the Y900 is not a “milspec” computer, so it is not as durable. The Lenovo X1 Yoga’s OLED display looks amazing and it’s a pity that the photos don’t fully show the difference. The OLED technology allows the X1 Yoga to have a nearly infinite image contrast and colors that feature an amazing saturation. Even the brightness is higher, topping 455 NIT in our measurements. If you can afford it, I highly recommend selecting the OLED version of this computer because you will use the display 100% of the time, it’s worth it. Learn more: LCD vs. OLED. Which is Best And Why? If you look at The ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2015 or ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2014, you would notice that the display, while very decent, didn’t compare favorably with other Lenovo laptops such as the Yoga 2 and Yoga 3 Pro. It’s because to pass the Mil-Specs drop test, Lenovo couldn’t use the exact same display between X1 and Yoga laptops. The good news is that the OLED X1 Yoga solves this beautifully, now surpassing other Lenovo laptops, and quite frankly every other 13”-15” that I have looked at, in overall image quality (but not in resolution). The OLED X1 Yoga makes other laptop screens uninteresting. There are both touch and non-touch versions of the Lenovo X1 Yoga, so it’s up to you to choose which one fits your needs best. People have very strong opinions about touch in Windows laptops, and I’ve heard arguments both for and against. My take is that touch is convenient because it can be faster than swiping and tapping with the trackpad. I also understand that some people use a lot of keyboard shortcuts and don’t want to pay extra for the touch option. You will need to decide based on your own habits. Webcam The Lenovo X1 Yoga webcam works well for web chat with a clear shot and framing where your face is. The image quality is not impressive at all, even in good lighting, and it gets worse in low-light. It’s OK for video chats, but it would be nice to see something better here. Unfortunately, laptop webcams have been largely outpaced by smartphone selfie cameras in terms of image quality. The thing is: while the technology is there, OEMs aren’t really pushing for webcam performance. System Performance The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga has a wide range of options when it comes to computing power. The review unit we have is equipped with an Intel Core i7 6500 (2.5-2.59 GHz) processor and 8GB of RAM. Benchmarks show us that the X1 Yoga behaves very much like other computers that have a similar processor configuration. Keep in mind that because the graphics unit is integrated into the Intel processor, most computers of the same “CPU class” will behave very similarly when running games. This is completely normal, and unless an OEM does something horrible, this is what you should expect. There are other ways to differentiate. The general performance is very satisfying, and this computer can run most tasks without any particular problem. If you want to do specific things such as video editing, you can also use Intel’s QuickSync hardware which will accelerate certain forms of video-encoding. Other laptops with discrete graphics processors may outperform the Lenovo X1 Yoga at specific tasks, but they may also come with a higher power consumption, larger form-factor or a different set of pros/cons altogether. The same is true for gaming laptops. Speed and relation to value and weight If we look at performance through the prism of “value” (price), the Lenovo X1 Yoga does OK. It doesn’t particularly shine, and it’s not surprising since Core i5 laptops tend to have better performance/value (that’s their whole point of being). However, the performance in relation to the weight is one of the strengths of the Lenovo X1 Yoga, and keep in mind that we have not even tested the most powerful version of the X1 Yoga. There’s another one with a Core i7-6600U processor that should be a little faster. Since this laptop has a digital pen, let’s look at the Creative performance vs. money spent: Battery: 52Wh + RapidCharge With a 52 Wh battery capacity, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga is comparable to a Dell XPS 13 (9350) and superior to the Envy 13t-d000 (45 Wh). However, the Yoga 900 (66 Wh) and the new Yoga 910 (64 Wh) have superior capacities. Note that the X1 Yoga has a rapid charging capability that somewhat compensates for the potential difference in sheer capacity. RapidCharge enables much faster charging from 0% to 80% battery in 30mn. In general, it is extremely effective if you can have access to a plug from hop to hop. If that is not an option, then you may want to think about a higher capacity laptop. In general, I can get some real work done for about ~4.5 hours, and accessing a plug by then is not an issue. Rapid-charging is ideal for folks like me since we often stop for 20-30mn during tradeshows to write something and post it to the back-end. Electric outlets are plentiful in conventions. Conclusion: durable, light, fast With a hardware platform that is comparable to other laptops in its class, the Lenovo X1 Yoga has a few key differentiators that are remarkable: Durability, OLED display option, Rapid charging. It is through this angle that we tested it. While it is possible to find many 13” (The X1 Yoga is a 14”) laptops that have an Intel Core i7-6500U, it is much harder to find some with all three qualities above. The OLED display option is simply sublime and worth the extra money, if you can afford it. OLED and Rapid Charging can benefit just about anyone. The extra durability and low-maintenance of the chassis is a cool extra, but unless you work environment is downright hostile, it’s more of a “nice to have” in my book — but still very appreciated. For businesses, durability also implies productivity gains for their IT staff, so it’s money right there. In the end, it is not the performance that makes the Lenovo X1 Yoga unique, but the experience and its convenience. And all of this is extremely well packaged into a 14”, 2.8 lbs chassis. What’s not to like? I give the OLED X1 Yoga a 10/10 — that’s the one I recommend getting, but the IPS is great too. Filed in Computers.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 28 September 2016 | MYT 2:00 PM German carmakers and technology firms form 5G telecoms association Striking back: Audi is one of the carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise to take on rivals like Uber and Google. Pictured is the Audi Q2 car at the 86th International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland. — Reuters FRANKFURT: German car makers Audi, BMW and Daimler launched an alliance with mobile telecoms network equipment firms Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm to accelerate development of the infrastructure needed for self-driving cars. The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber and Google which are also working on autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardisation and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until some time around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. Last year BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, joined forces to buy digital map maker HERE for 2.8bil euros (RM11.59bil) from Nokia and this week will introduce a service that allows drivers to see for themselves what road conditions are like miles ahead using live data contributed by other vehicles. —  Reuters You May Be Interested US FCC drops planned reform of business data services market AOL to cut 500 jobs Airbnb offers travel services in push to diversify Malaysia intervenes to help sagging ringgit: official China badminton star Lin Dan apologises for affair with model while wife was pregnant Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Luis Enrique backs Messi to sign new deal and end career with Barca Billionaire Widjaja family puts Singapore on the spot The Star's executive editor Soo Ewe Jin passes away advertisement Latest News US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Most Viewed in Tech Hotlink Fast: Get 17GB of data with the new Internet pass Sign your name digitally in iOS Mail Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump Airbnb, San Francisco must work harder to resolve lawsuit: judge Toyota sharpens focus on electric cars through new in-house unit Tesla's Musk closes SolarCity deal, more challenges lie ahead Infosys CEO says Trump election may weigh on margins US extends ZTE reprieve on exports curbs until Feb 27 Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

S omewhere deep inside Dell’s R&D labs, white-coated workers have toiled day and night to splice the DNA of Dell’s Latitude and XPS families. The fruit of their labours is one of the finest ultraportables to ever see the light of day: the Dell Latitude 13 7370. As a starting point, you couldn’t ask for any better: the XPS 13 is an Ultrabook to aspire to, all carbon fibre, metal and understated design. It’s fast, light, beautiful and well-equipped in every category. The Latitude 13 7370 takes those strengths and moulds them into a more business-friendly form. Bag-friendly build quality It gets off to a great start. The base is cast from perfectly smooth, gently rounded plates of carbon fibre, while the silver metal lid of the XPS 13 has been exchanged for a less ostentatious charcoal-coloured sheet.  Build quality is excellent. Pick it up, twist it, abuse it and you’ll get nowhere: the slender lid barely budges more than a couple of millimetres, and the base flexes only once you start to exert the kind of force that would snap a lesser device. Dell says the Latitude 13 7370 is strong enough to survive the barrage of MIL-STD-810G tests, and I’m inclined to believe it. For a 13in laptop, the Latitude 13 7370 is unusually tiny. It’s easy to see how Dell’s done it, however: the “InfinityEdge” display has a bezel no more than a few millimetres wide. Short of getting rid of bezels entirely, the Latitude 13 7370 couldn’t be any smaller. Nor, at 1.12kg, could it be much lighter. This shrinking process hasn’t led to any obvious compromises, other than the position of the webcam; below the screen isn’t ideal for conference calls. The keyboard is a touch small, but this won’t be noticeable in everyday use. The Scrabble-tile keys have just enough scoop in them to grip the finger, and the feel is superlative, every key dipping down with a delicate, light action. If you’re the type that curses the fashion for touchpads with integrated buttons, you may now rejoice freely: the Dell’s touchpad has two separate buttons, which operate silently. Office-friendly display If you ruled out the XPS 13 because of its glossy screen, then Dell’s decision to equip the Latitude 13 7370 with a matte anti-glare coating will be a definite plus. Most of the pre-configured models come with a perfectly adequate Full HD display, but pushing up to the range-topping $5,579 model earns you a QHD+ 3,200 x 1,800 screen, not to mention the fastest available Core m7 and a larger 43Whr battery. The Full HD display on the model reviewed here is fine, but not amazing. Purists will rightly gripe about the dynamic contrast – if colour accuracy is key, it’s a significant downside – and there are other reasons to moan. The anti-glare coating makes images look a touch soft, and colours lack punch and vibrancy, although the peak brightness (278cd/m2) and contrast ratio (1,324:1) is decent. The overall quality is good enough for everyday office applications, but if you’ve spent time with the XPS 13’s high-DPI display, or any of Apple’s Retina displays, you’re likely to be underwhelmed. Battery-friendly CPU Eagle-eyed readers may have already spotted where the Latitude 13 7370 deviates from its XPS-branded sibling: it’s powered by Intel’s low-voltage Core M processors. This isn’t the shortcoming you might imagine. In most situations, you’re unlikely to notice the difference between these and Dell’s Core i3 or i5 laptops. Unless you subject your work laptop to heavy, extended workloads – virtualisation, video editing, that kind of thing – for the whole working day, the Core M’s ability to crank up the clock speed to deliver brief surges of power is the perfect compromise between performance and battery-friendly power consumption. Depending on your budget, you can buy yourself a Latitude 13 7370 in vPro-enabled Core m5 or m7 flavours, and take your pick of 128GB or 256GB M.2 NVMe SSDs. Whichever you choose, you’ll get 8GB of DDR3 RAM. Prices start at a considerable $4,635 and work up to around $5,579, at which point you get that upgrade to the QHD+ screen, a faster Core m7 CPU and a carbon-fibre lid. Dell sent me the Full HD Core m5 version for review, and it put in a very decent performance. A score of 22 overall in PC Pro’s benchmarks is exactly what we’d expect from a Core m5 device, and while it drops around 85% behind the Core i7 XPS 13 in the multi-tasking benchmarks, it’s a much less dramatic 35% to 40% slower in the video transcoding and image processing tests. That might sound like quite a margin, but in reality the super-quick NVMe SSD does a great job of masking the processor’s shortcomings. It was only once I’d started Photoshop CC churning through heavyweight filters that I began to miss the beefier Core i7 processor in the Dell XPS 13. Battery life is good enough to last a working day, but only if you take a full hour for lunch. In our video-rundown test, where we calibrate the screen to a brightness of 170cd/m2, the Latitude 13 7370 lasted 7hrs 6mins, which is 52mins less than the XPS 13. However, given that the XPS 13’s battery is almost 70% larger, that’s quite an impressive figure – and a good indicator of just how efficient those Core M processors are. Dell has done a great job of covering the connectivity and security side of things. The Intel Wireless-AC 8260 provides 2x2 stream 802.11ac Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth 4.2 and NFC.  And it’s great to see that physical connectivity hasn’t fallen by the wayside. There’s a single full-sized USB 3 port, and this is backed up by microSD and two USB Type-C ports, both of which are Thunderbolt 3 capable. A micro-HDMI is present too, while a physical fingerprint reader and full-sized smart card reader round off the selection. Budget-friendly price? The Dell Latitude 13 7370 isn’t without rivals. HP’s EliteBook Folio 1020 was stratospherically expensive when it first launched, but has since dropped in price to the extent that you can find it for significantly less than Dell is charging for its machine. Then there’s the Dell XPS 13. Several folk in the  office have an XPS 13 as their business laptop, and as long as you can live without the security options of the 13 7370, it’s a cheaper, more powerful alternative. Despite this, the Latitude 13 7370 is a superb business ultraportable. It’s expensive, but once you take into account the fantastic build quality and its excellent array of features, not to mention the three years of on-site warranty, it’s by no means overpriced. If you’re looking to buy a light, portable laptop that’s purpose-built for a life in and out of the office, it gets most things right.  Related Reviews Review: HP EliteBook Folio G1 - great looks, terrible battery life Review: Asus VivoBook Pro N552VW Review: Asus Transformer Book Flip TP200SA Review: Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  dell latitude 13 7370  |  laptop  |  pc  |  review  |  ultraportable   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Apple’s fancy new Mac book is $US199     Gallery: The PCs of PAX Australia 2016     Review: Seagate Barracuda Pro blows us away     Mag Lev is the zero gravity turntable of your sci-fi dreams     With Pixel, Google is barrelling headfirst into Apple’s backyard   NOTE: You must be a registered member of PC & Tech Authority to post a comment.

At 10 years the winery is producing about 5,000 cases a year. Buy this photo Brenna Wiegand/For the Capital Press Sean Driggers operates Pudding River Wine Cellars near Salem, Ore. Though much of his wine is aged in stainless steel barrels, Driggers specializes in oak barreling and the endless flavor nuances it affords. The conversion of a poultry barn into a winery is not as dramatic as the life change Sean Driggers underwent in his quest to make fine wine. Pudding River Wine Cellars east of Salem originated on property Driggers’ in-laws, John and Karen Bateman, purchased 20 years ago. In 2004 Driggers, an avid wine enthusiast, helped them put in a vineyard. Before that, Driggers and his wife, Stacey, lived in Seattle, he a mechanical engineer in telecommunications and she an Intel engineer. Stacey’s job transferred, but the prospect of starting from scratch made Sean see red — and white — and he took the plunge into commercial winemaking. In its 10 years, Pudding River Wine Cellars has made a splash with its small-lot, boutique wines and makes custom wine for half a dozen other producers. Driggers has high praise for Chemeketa Community College’s viticulture school he and his father-in-law attended in 2005. Driggers went on to attend CCC’s winemaking school. “It was a consuming hobby for 15 years, but nothing beats going to school,” he said. “At school I learned everything I needed to know for making wine.” First harvest was in 2006 and the whole family took part in launching the venture. “It’s just me now,” he said. “I run the tasting room, do all the books, labor, festivals, marketing and events in addition to the vineyard and making the wine.” Production has multiplied several times and the winery, set up for 3,000 cases a year, is now producing 5,000. “It’s a lot of cycles,” Driggers said. “I employ more farm labor. We worked the vines by ourselves the first couple years and it about killed us.” The winery broke even its third year and started turning a profit in the seventh year. In the process Driggers has learned it’s best to “celebrate” the capriciousness of Mother Nature. “Oregon has some pretty variable vintages; upstarts are always at risk,” Driggers said. “September of 2013 a typhoon came through here and dumped 7 inches of rain in a week-and-a-half.” Back at the winery, Driggers says the key to exceptional wine lies in its barreling. “It’s a nuance; like adding a spice, and I think that’s where winemakers get to use their genius,” he said. “I learned from some key people over the years and it has become one of my specialties.” The varieties aged in oak are put in barrels whose insides have been charred to a certain “toast level.” The residual charcoal mellows out the wood so the wine “doesn’t taste like wood” and makes for buttery, sweeter wines more like their French counterparts. “…But that effect lasts only a year, two at the most,” Driggers said. “If you want that flavor; that spice, you have to use new barrels every year and figure out what you want to use for each wine. “We’re getting a good reputation for that,” he added. “We won a gold ribbon at the Oregon State Fair in 2007 for our Pinot gris and every year after that have not been able to make enough. “I’ve almost stopped doing the competitions anymore with the increasing wine tourism,” Driggers said. “People from all over the country come to this area already knowing which wineries they’re going to visit.” Marketplace Auctions Hay Real Estate Tractors Share and Discuss Guidelines User Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Mesa Preps For Landing The On-Disk Shader Cache Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 27 September 2016 at 07:55 PM EDT. 19 Comments Just a few days ago was the fifth version of the proposed Mesa on-disk shader cache and it's looking like it may finally be ready for merging with some of the prep infrastructure work having landed today in mainline Mesa. For those behind on their Phoronix reading and are unfamiliar with on-disk shader caches, it's about caching compiled shaders to the disk. This avoids having to recompile shaders frequently, which can be a big deal for some games. With games like Shadow of Mordor and Unreal Engine 4 this can lead to a smoother gaming experience. The work so far for this Mesa on-disk shader cache is just for the i965 Intel driver support but hopefully in the not too distant future can be supported by other Mesa/Gallium3D drivers. What landed today were the initial functions for implementing an on-disk cache of objects. Objects are handled using a 20-byte sequence, which can be like a SHA1 hash of the contents, and supporting a MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DIR environment variable. The default limit for this new Mesa GLSL cache directory is 1GB. More details on this prep work via this commit with hopefully the rest of the enablement not being too far behind. 19 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Others need a push to get them more involved in the sport. Running and biking has proven to be the best method for rapid and consistent fat loss, and it’s great for your heart and body. But whether you’re running or biking, cardio can be somewhat of a lonely pursuit, and if you don’t have adequate encouragement, it’s more than tempting to give up on your workouts altogether. Oakley and Intel have teamed up to bring you the perfect solution for your solitary, difficult cardio workouts: known as the Oakley Radar Pace, this eye/ear device acts as an excellent coach and personal trainer, whispering directly into your ear. It monitors a variety of things, including distance traveled and your heart rate. Like all wearable devices, the Radar Pace syncs to your smartphone using Bluetooth. To measure distance traveled, it will hijack your phone’s GPS. Through the integrated smartphone tool, it can keep track of your progress as well as measure your stride rate, which is all part of a progress report. The stride rate will be calculated using personal details about your height and leg length as well as your MPH. To get the full Radar Pace experience, it’s recommended that you monitor your heart rate as well. You can do this with a third-party heart rate monitor. You can purchase a Bluetooth-enabled device with the sole purpose of monitoring your heart or you can sync to another fitness tracker such as a Fitbit or Apple watch. When you ask Pace for a progress report, it will factor in your heart rate and let you know when you need to move faster or slow down in order to get the best workout without overextending yourself. As you run, you can either ask Radar Pace how you’re doing, or it will tell you without any prompting after a certain distance covered. It will update you on your mileage, heart rate, and stride rate, all while offering some cardio tips for improving your progress. Pace was designed with the user in mind. Just in case you ask a question at the same time that Pace tells you something else, it will log your questions and answer them in order. After you’ve finished your workout, you can tell Pace to end the workout. Or, if you need to pause the workout for any reason, just let the computer know. The Pace app also offers a variety of cardio workouts recommended specifically for you. If you don’t like the workouts provided, you can make your own and have Pace monitor your progress according to those. The tech side of the glasses is impressive, and the design isn’t too bad either. The shades are lightweight with some basic features like Bluetooth, music playback, Siri or Cortana control, a three-mic array, and a tiny embedded computer system. Because most of the glasses’ functions are performed through your smartphone, you don’t have to worry about being weighed down by heavy glasses. The adjustable earbuds attach to the sunglasses’ ear pieces. They can be bent to fit into your ear or shifted parallel to the ear pieces when you don’t need them. They can also be removed entirely. Users report that the glasses and the earbuds are comfortable, of high quality, and stylish. There are other fitness wearables that perform similar functions as the Oakley Radar Pace, but Oakley and Intel are the first to successfully pair sunglasses and ear pieces. It’s a unique device that could change fitness for a lot of people. At $449 a pop, it’s an expensive investment, but it may be entirely worth it if it helps you improve your progress, and will be available for order at the beginning of October.

The H-series VMs will be available in six different sizes, based on Intel E5-2667 V3 3.2 GHz (with turbo up to 3.5 GHz) processor technology, utilizing DDR4 memory and SSD-based local storage.  The H-series VMs also include a dedicated RDMA backend network enabled by FDR InfiniBand network, capable of delivering ultra-low latency.  RDMA networking is dedicated for MPI (Message Passing Interface) traffic when running coupled applications. Microsoft see a large number of enterprise customers embracing Microsoft Azure for their enterprise HPC workloads. Enterprise customers bursting their HPC jobs to Azure for additional compute power helping to solve complex design of experiments (DOE), optimizations, and other critical projects. One of its premier partners, Altair Engineering, with its suite of enterprise computing products is a current example of integration between customers’ on-premises environment and H-series VMs in Azure. “We are excited about the introduction of new non hyper-threaded compute and network optimized H-series VMs in Azure, we worked closely with the Microsoft Team to test our solutions for performance and scaling on the H Series VMs,” said Sam Mahalingam, CTO Altair Engineering. “Based on the testing we are confident not only to deliver high performance to our customers but also provide deep integration with the Azure environment to enable HPC cloud environments.” H-series VMs can deliver great performance running a variety of applications, helping businesses around the world reducing their product development cycle and bring products faster to market. “We are pleased to see the launch of the new Azure high performance H series VMs with InfiniBand and Linux RDMA technology. This performance accelerates the pace of product design cycles using simulation and helps engineers discover better designs, faster,” said Keith Foston, product manager at CD-adapco, a Siemens Business. H-series virtual machines provide on demand compute capacity for our customers that want to solve complex automotive crash simulation problems.  Through partners like d3View we can bring large scale computing capabilities to customers when needed. “We see a great need for the best-in-class compute power and capacity. With the introduction of Azure’s new H-Series with E5-2667 processor and RDMA InfiniBand network, running large-scale simulations across hundreds of cores will offer reduced turn-around time for simulation engineers and scientists,” said Suri Bala, CEO d3View. “Multi-physics simulation software like LS-DYNA is designed to scale to thousands of processors and with the H-Series, we look forward to helping our customers in evaluating designs quickly.” The low-latency RDMA network enabled by FDR InfiniBand in the H-series VMs, particularly using the H16r and H16mr sizes, make up an ideal combination for delivering the necessary scale and performance for very large CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations. “The RDMA technology in the new H series VMs is critical when running large scale-out jobs on the cloud,” said Rod Mach, CEO TotalCAE. “With clock frequencies flattening out the last few years, RDMA technology enables jobs to scale out to large number of nodes. Our testing of CFD codes with the TotalCAE Portal enabled us to achieve reduced runtimes at large core counts that would not be possible without RDMA technology in Azure.” Non-RDMA-enabled H-series sizes can be deployed with various Linux distributions and Windows Server OS images available in the Azure Marketplace.  RDMA-enabled H-series VM sizes can be deployed using Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, and CentOS-based 7.1 HPC and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP1 HPC images. The H-series sizes are initially available in the South Central US Azure region, and will be rolled out across other regions in the near future.

UPDATE: 5pm ET: Today, in a letter sent to clients and first reported by VRM Intel, the company said it is shutting up shop. “While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations…. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off” (See reader comment, below, for the full letter.) LeisureLink’s closure strands several resort/hotel type managers as well as traditional vacation rental managers. Back to our original story: Earlier this year, the company said it had received a $17 million round of funding, with investors Clearstone Ventures, Kinderhook Industries and Escalate Capital Partners participating. Since its founding in 2007, it has raised more than $34 million. On Friday, SoCal Tech reported that the company has been sending email messages to clients that say: “We’ve been working aggressively to complete a corporate transaction. Regardless of what you may have heard we are still in that process and anticipate a positive outcome.” Tnooz’s voice and email messages to top-level executives this morning have not been returned, as of this afternoon. The only executive we could reach on the phone has declined to comment. In August, Utah-based LeisureLink sold several of its consumer-facing websites to Aspen-based Ski.com. Earlier this year, an official had told Tnooz that the company was working on releasing new, public APIs for distributors and suppliers. The goal was to enable LeisureLink rates and inventory to be passed over to Airbnb, HomeAway’s Escapia software, and Seekda’s Regatta booking engine. In 2014, LeisureLink was bought by VacationRoost, which changed its group name to LeisureLink. LeisureLink’s online chat system for customer service was closed today. When Tnooz contacted an account manager by phone, he was telling customers that all he could say was that “the company is going through a corporate transaction and they are hoping to get the business details resolved quickly.” Apparently any such potential deal fell through.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

Required fields are marked * Comment Notify me of followup comments via e-mail Name * Email * Website Jeffery Hill I am trying to figure out if this fall under Utah or California. The address was Utah. I just left a message with the Atty General’s office. I believe that under the law notices were suppose to have been sent to all creditors within 30 days of the closure which I believe was Sept 23rd. So it’s possible that those have been sent but I have not received anything yet. In the long run, I’m sure no one will see any money. This is essentially a bankruptcy and I’m sure the assets will not cover what it owed. If anything is paid out it will be pennies on the dollar. If anyone knows anything else, please post Reply 3 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I did get a letter from the Utah Atty General’s office, they said it falls under California law. They suggested contacting an attorney there. Reply 3 weeks ago   Geri Hauck We have yet to receive any forms or paperwork as stipulated in their notice of closure. Reply 1 week ago   Former LL Client Odd how Leisure Link still has its ties to Homeaway and VRBO has anyone heard back from the Utah attorneys office? Reply 4 weeks ago   Cote Property Management I heard back from the Utah Attorney Generals office, they said to file a complaint with California, which I did. They also suggested contacting an attorney. I think there needs to be a class action suit. I know there are places that suffered must larger losses then me and wonder if any of them have started anything? Reply 4 weeks ago   Peter in Colorado Every vacation rental manager should know that Advance Deposits paid by guests must be kept in separate bank accounts until those funds are earned. How was LL able to bypass this basic obligation and use Advance Deposit payments to fund their operations without committing fraud? If fraud has been committed, who is being held culpable? I would like to be able to tell my staff and my clients (who are all losing money on this!) that someone is being held to account for this fiasco! Reply 1 month ago   Cote Property Management So, since there are so many of us who have lost substantial funds due to the mismanagement of Leisure Link, aren’t there legal steps that can be taken? I have sent a message to the Attorney General’s office in California and Utah but wonder what we can do as a group. Perhaps if everyone sends a complaint to the Utah Attorney Generals office, it’s online, easy to fill out, maybe someone will look at the seriousness of this issue. Reply 1 month ago   Matthew Gurley Have you reached out to the channels directly? I’m happy to make an intro. matt@mybookingpal.com Reply 1 month ago   Peter Burns Our company is in the last minute discounts for luxury vacation villa properties. We recently started a financing arm of our company, http://www.hlvillas.com/financing/, that may be helpful to those Property Management Companies suffering because of lost revenue due to Leisurelink’s bk. We offer working capital loans and additional debt products that are from non-bank sources. Let us know if we can assist. Reply 1 month ago   Rhonda Vinje I’m sorry for those that have lost their jobs over this fiasco, however you can find work again. How does one go about getting their money refunded? Who can we contact? Shame on those that robbed us of our hard earned money.That was my 1st vacation in FORTY YEARS!! I can only hope that Karma bites you in the A$$! Reply 1 month ago   Matthew Gurley Hey Rhonda, If you file a chargeback on your credit card it should be refunded by the credit card company. Reply 1 month ago   Rhonda Vinje Hey there…. That’s a negative, we tried that, Chase declined it. But thank you for responding. We paid in good faith & in full using our debit card. I should clarify, we got our vacation, but not our security deposit back. I was thankful the house existed & the key worked in the door knowing now what was going on behind-the-scenes! I will be VERY Leary next time around. Who can you trust today, there’s a scammer on every corner. Reply 1 month ago   Kristen Cherry The difficult part of the merchant of record solution is no OTA has a great system for managing payment or declined cards, which for some of the OTA channels can be a significant percentage, add in the process of making changes and modifications to existing reservations and the business of “handing this over” becomes the easy and necessary solution. Nobody could have foreseen this ending….the theory and vision were there…the execution fell flat. Property managers already have 10 jobs from managing homeowner expectations, wowing guests, maintenance -you name it. Managing the OTA channels from allotment, content, pricing, payments, and promos is just to daunting and unrealistic. Other intermediaries will gain market share – but established infrastructure will be critical. Reply 1 month ago   Displaced Worker from LL Please forgive me as I shamelessly use this platform to solicit employment. Desperate times call for desperate measures! I am among the many blindsided employees of LeisureLink who were left jobless. Are any of you competitors hiring? I was with Hawaiian Beach Rentals before VacationRoost bought them out, then worked with VacationRoost prior to their acquisition of LeisureLink, finally settling in a comfortable position with LeisureLink. Therefore, I have experience in many different sectors of the business. I worked remotely for my entire time with the company- over 5 years in total. I am located in Southern California (Inland Empire). I see that many of you are outside the US. Maybe a remote US employee is just what you need! 😉 However, I have come to terms with the unlikelihood of finding another remote position, so hopefully some of you are local enough to utilize my eagerness to work with you. If at all possible, I would love to stay within the same (or similar) industry. Thanks for your consideration. Reply 2 months ago   Alex Aydin Send me your resume. We are hiring. Reply 1 month ago   Richard Vaughton I have to follow up on Alex’s comment here and is a common discussion point amongst managers and is well placed. Offering up full cash management to a third party is a risky situation. Managers are responsible to owners and this third party cash managament can cascade problems significantly. Look at Vacasol another “mid agent” sitting between contratctors, self marketing and creative channel distribution, now in bankcruptcy procedings and with clients possibly out of pocket. Any technology partner should be that, a conduit to booking success, with a means of transacting money seamlessly through secure, ring fenced bank accounts. Even UK banks will only secure £75K, so collect direct and manage efficiently. Its also not just the question of the being way out of pocket, its the lack of dynamic access to OTA’s on which many now rely. As for the $17m or $34m of however much was involved, it would be interesting to see the full story at some point.. Reply 2 months ago   Leisurelink Employee Alex if Leisurelink posed such a credit risk why did you try to buy them? Reply 2 months ago   Alex Aydin I think any company’s greatest assets is their employees. Leisurelink had very good, hard working and dedicated staff. It is a shame that they ended up in this situation. Reply 2 months ago   Former LL Employee It is a shame @AlexAydin. We busted our humps and it’s sad and disappointing that it ended like this. No severance either unfortunately. I don’t hold any grudges though. I’m grateful for the opportunity and the experience. Any former competitors out there that are looking to hire, I’d love to send you my resume! I have 3+ years experience working for an Online Travel Distributor as an Account Support Specialist troubleshooting software and listing issues for out clients. I would be a very worthy addition to your team ! Reply 2 months ago   Alex Aydin Send us your resume. We are looking to expand our support team. https://www.mybookingpal.com/sub-careers/applyform?id=2 2 months ago   Alex Aydin Lesson to be learned from Leisurelink   With the situation that former LeisureLink clinets and suppliers find themselves in, it can be a frightening time for property managers. We are hoping that all LeisureLink suppliers receive some, if not all, of the funds that are still owed to them. If, and when, suppliers receive their funds, they are still dealt with the daunting task of searching for another channel manager while the risk of another LeisureLink situation looms in their mind. To avert another LeisureLink situation, property managers must first understand why the situation occurred in the first place. The epicenter of the LeisureLink failure revolved around credit risk and business continuity. Credit risk was due to the model LeisureLink used where they operated as Merchant of Record. In that model, LeisureLink collected the funds given from guests and OTAs and would then transfer the funds owed to the supplier typically after guest departure from the property. This is where the property management risk comes into play. If the channel manager, as the Merchant of Record fails, then the supplier runs the risk of not getting paid. To avoid this as a supplier of properties, choose a channel manager that allows the property manager to act as Merchant of Record. This will allow property managers to receive payments directly from guests or OTAs. As Merchant of Record, property manager eliminates any possibility of credit risk on behalf of the channel manager. Reply 2 months ago   Steve Sherlock @Sean – perhaps Tnooz can discuss this internally, though for those folks making pretty serious accusations and who aren’t prepared to put their name to the accusation, then perhaps those comments should be removed. For all you know those making the accusations are competitors of those they accuse. Bit of a sordid affair all round. Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley This is completely incorrect. I would truly appreciate it if you would stop trolling our company online. This is completely unprofessional and considered defamation. BookingPal is a separate entity and competitor of LeisureLink. If you took 20 minutes with me to look at our platform you would realize it’s completely different. Contact me for more details. Reply 2 months ago   BookingPAL is not your pal All the way at the top, the former President of Leisurelink, Richard Barajas, is now an adviser for BookingPal. I dont believe I would want anyone that helped steer a company into despair advising me on a damn thing. whether he was a current executive or not is irrelevant. A company doesn’t go down in five minutes…its an evolution of piss poor decision making and that very well goes back to the tenure of Richard Barajas and many other idiotic people. He was the President in December 2013 Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley Again. Defamation and incorrect. I advice Tnooz admins to please remove this user from your pages. Our board of directors can be found directly on our website. 1 member used to work with LeisureLink. We are an American built company and only 3 years old in the space, and completely different from LeisureLink. Do some research. Our integrations are different, products are different, channel support is different. BookingPal only supports a fraction of channels LeisureLink did. If this was remotely true we would have the exact same connections right? Please act professional and join us to help LeisureLink users regain access to distribution in a way where they cannot possibly lose money. A key difference between us and Leisurelink is the ability to allow the PM to be merchant of record (something LeisureLink tried and failed to repeat consistently). This way a PM can use us, remain merchant of record, and not have the chance to lose funds in a situation like LeisureLink’s ever again. Reply 2 months ago   Richard Barajas I hesitate to respond to a nameless, non-specific post but I feel compelled to do so until Tnooz recognizes this as defamation and a defenseless position that should be removed. The most important things I’d like to communicate are 1) I’m saddened to see this outcome for LeisureLink. All the employees, including myself, worked hard and did our best for our customers and our company. 2) BookingPal is a top-notch, professional organization with great technology and people. They have built a solid integrated infrastructure from day 1 targeted to serve the Vacation Rental marketplace. I encourage you to contact them and decide for yourself. Reply 2 months ago   Erica We are customers of a property that got screwed over by Leisure Link and guess what? When we arrived to the property they made us pay twice for the room we had already paid for in full, because Leisure Link hadn’t paid them. So guess who really got screwed here? Me the guest and you know what? $500 extra is a lot to me whereas I’m guessing it’s nothing to you Richard Barajas. So now we have paid twice for a room because you and your company. I plan to contact news agencies in Colorado to get the word out about your sham-full business practices. Reply 1 month ago   martin alletson Dear Sir. I realize no one ever wants to go out of business unless there is no other way. We are a small independent hotel 128 rooms and are owed about $40,000. from LL as I have no way of knowing the companies debt, would you be kind enough to just tell me what if any chance we have of collecting that monies owed. Reply 1 month ago   Matthew Gurley Hey Martin, Email me at matt@mybookingpal.com. I will put you in touch with the channels directly. They have been able to assist in come cases. 1 month ago   Eric fitzgerald I have worked for this company for 2 years, I have 2 months they have not paid me for, any idea how I can collect what is owed to me, thank you Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley Hey Eric, Feel free to email me. I can loop you in with Expedia and AirBnB. If there are any funds that they were still holding and had not sent to leisurelink already, they can send the funds directly to you. Reply 2 months ago   Former LL Employee I was with LeisureLink for 3+ years and I’m disappointed that it ended like this. How did we come to this point? I believe we should’ve put more energy, focus, and capital on our Technology instead of going out and signing up new clients first and foremost, which I believe caused issues with scalability and ultimately led to our downfall. Any contemporaries out there hiring? I’m located in Los Angeles, CA. Reply 2 months ago   Wendy And where does this leave us, the individuals that booked and paid thru .com sites, who have upcoming reservations but the hotel has not received payment (and probably won’t receive) Reply 2 months ago   Matthew Gurley We are very sad to see LeisureLink go and to see the effect it has had on property managers in our industry. BookingPal is the leading platform the industry, allowing you to reach these OTA’s with a full integration and be merchant of record. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. We are here to help you through a smooth transition. Reply 2 months ago   Sean Raftree We are all shocked with this news and have working diligently to transition LeisureLink clients to RedAwnings’ industry leading platform. We also have been working closely with the OTAs to re-process existing reservations through RedAwning connectivity. We’re here to help! For more info go to https://www.redawning.com/content/fast-connectivity-account-transitioning Reply 2 months ago   Eric Mason For those suppliers or guests that are owed funds, contact the credit card companies and seek a solution from them. I am aware of another sales organization/channel that went of out business who also owed their suppliers thousands, and I believe the credit card companies were able to help to some degree. Also going forward look hard at who is merchant of record, are there options or structures to help avoid this in the future.

Reply 2 months ago   Steve Sherlock I mean…if you do the wrong thing driving a car, you can end up in court or jail for that matter. But you can screw people out of literally thousands and thousands of dollars as a business person, and literally walk off scot-free. Go figure! I think laws should change whereby c-suite and director roles have some basic legal accountability, and maybe then they’d give their strategies and execution a bit more thought!!? Reply 2 months ago   Colorado PM This is so unfortunate but you wonder how a Harvard MBA and a board of directors that include executives from publicly traded companies waste $30+ millions. LeisureLink was known for big parties at MTS, expensive dinners and over promising. Some account managers were great and feel bad for them. They owe us $200K so many will be unemployed before ski season thanks to an inept management team and board members. Reply 2 months ago   Julie Hightower They haven’t paid our hotel for people who stayed in June, July, August & September. In speaking with Expedia today, they actually invoiced them for all reservation up to and including September 24th. You can’t invoice Expedia until the day of the reservation. So just before they close, they decided to screw us one last time. They currently owe $65,000. We have 45 reservations still on the books for the next six weeks, unfortunately if Expedia can not assure us payment for these, we will be forced to cancel them.

Obviously we are out quite a bit of money also. So for those of us in the hotel business with large sums of money owed by Leisure Link for past reservations what is our recourse? Any talk of a class action lawsuit? I have filed my invoice for “assignment of creditors” but being a small fish in a big pond I am not sure that will make any difference. Reply 2 months ago   Julie Hightower How did you get the paperwork for the “Assignment of Creditors? We didn’t even get the letter that is posted here.

We brought 3 great employee assets from the LL team onboard that were unfortunately effected by decisions our of their hands. With our product, you are receiving and accepting credit cards, not us or a third party. This means you have no credit risk in using us. I’d be happy to discuss further. Reply 4 weeks ago   Eric Mason Yes, this is disheartening to hear and unfortunately, this will leave some consumers and suppliers in a very difficult situation. One suggestion for consumers caught up in this is to reach out ASAP to your credit card company to see if there is any relief they can extend. We’ve been talking a lot about this on Vacation Rental Professionals, a Linkedin Group (https://www.linkedin.com/groups/69889) as well. There will be other suggestions on how to possibly handle this and other solutions that can be leveraged in light of this newly created void. Reply 2 months ago   VaycayHero Sad to see the news of LeisureLink ceasing its operations and we wish nothing but the best to them. At VaycayHero, we have successfully transitioned many vacation rental property managers from LeisureLink, and we are actively working to do the same for property managers who are caught in this crossfire.

It was not distributed to the suppliers – we’re a property manager and they still owe us thousands for winter bookings. Julian strung us along saying it was just due to disorganization because they grew so fast or that they were waiting for payment from Expedia or booking.com. I think Julian has a lot of explaining to do to his employees and suppliers. He’s probably walking away with millions and the rest of us are being screwed. I guess that’s what a Harvard MBA does for you. Reply 2 months ago   Carl They screwed us too! We are a property manager, small company, they owe us $9000. Very painful! Reply 2 months ago   Mike (wife was employee) My guess would be that $17 million was a theoretical amount to be disbursed over time if goals and milestones were met. Putting money into LL was a risky idea and they didn’t get all that money in a lump sum. I know they were hurting to operating money for a while even after securing that money.

They had strong people and I know worked hard to serve their clients well. RedAwning has opened our doors to help clients quickly transition and maintain their distribution and we are happy to see our industry leading position in vacation rental reservations and channel management expand, while we’d rather see it happen another way. Reply 2 months ago   Jane Doe Just received this from them: Dear Valued Partner, LeisureLink has been helping suppliers of vacation rentals generate bookings through third party channels for over nine years, and has experienced accelerated growth for the past several quarters. Supporting this growth and building the technology solutions for the industry has been a capital intensive process. LeisureLink is privately-owned and has historically met these capital needs with investments from its owners. For the last 12 months, LeisureLink has been working with an investment bank to raise additional equity capital to fund the Company’s growth for the future. The Company expected this process would yield an infusion of needed capital this summer. While LeisureLink attracted considerable interest from many strategic buyers and investors, management has determined that none of these parties are likely to complete a transaction before late Q4 of 2016. This timing and the continuing cash needs of the Company has created a liquidity deficit which prevents the Company from continuing its daily operations. As a result, we have no choice but to stop operations and not process any new bookings as of September 27, 2016. At this time, all employees of LeisureLink are being terminated and the platform turned off. LeisureLink values the working relationships built over these last 9 years and appreciates the loyalty of its employees, vendors, customers and partners and is trying to cease operations as smoothly and orderly as possible, given the circumstances. To that end, the Company has agreed to undertake an Assignment for Benefit of Creditors (“Assignment”), which is a process designed to manage an orderly disposition of the Company’s assets and to distribute those proceeds to creditors according to their legal rights and priorities. As required by law, the Assignee will be mailing notices of the Assignment to all creditors in the next 30 days, providing further information about the Assignment and providing creditors with a proof of claim form through which creditors can file a claim for any obligations due.

The goal is to develop new technologies to take advantage of LTE and 5G advancements, create standards, and overcome regulatory issues. If they succeed, it will be easier for them companies to develop and implement new technologies. For instance, we could see smarter traffic management, and maybe platooning, advance further in the autonomous sector. By acting as a group, they will also be able to address regulatory issues more easily. All of these companies are capable of developing advanced vehicle communication systems on their own. Audi, in fact, has been pursuing vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology and launched a stoplight timer in models in some cities.

Resend activation e-mail Technology Lab / Information Technology Programmable chips turning Azure into a supercomputing powerhouse Chips are boosting network speeds, slashing latency, and accelerating Bing. by Peter Bright - Sep 27, 2016 7:15 pm UTC Login to bookmark 135 An Altera Stratix V developer board, which uses the same kind of FPGA as Microsoft is deploying in Azure. Altera Microsoft is embarking on a major upgrade of its Azure systems. New hardware the company is installing in its 34 datacenters around the world still contains the mix of processors, RAM, storage, and networking hardware that you'll find in any cloud system, but to these Microsoft is adding something new: field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), highly configurable processors that can be rewired using software in order to provide hardware accelerated implementations of software algorithms. The company first investigated using FPGAs to accelerate the Bing search engine. In "Project Catapult," Microsoft added off-the-shelf FPGAs on PCIe cards from Altera (now owned by Intel) to some Bing servers and programmed those FPGAs to perform parts of the Bing ranking algorithm in hardware. The result was a 40-fold speed-up compared to a software implementation running on a regular CPU. A common next step after achieving success with an FPGA is to then create an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) to make a dedicated, hardcoded equivalent to the FPGA. This is what Microsoft did with the Holographic Processing Unit in its HoloLens headset, for example, because the ASIC has greatly reduced power consumption and size. But the Bing team stuck with FPGAs because their algorithms change dozens of times a year. An ASIC would take many months to produce, meaning that by the time it arrived, it would already be obsolete. With this pilot program successful, the company then looked at ways to use FPGAs more widely across not just Bing but Azure and Office 365 as well. Azure's acute problem wasn't search engine algorithms; Azure CTO Mark Russinovich told us it was network traffic. Azure runs a vast number of virtual machines on a substantial number of physical servers, using a close relative of Microsoft's Hyper-V hypervisor to manage the virtualization of the physical hardware. Virtual machines have one or more virtual network adaptors through which they send and receive network traffic. The hypervisor handles the physical network adaptors that are actually connected to Azure's networking infrastructure. Moving traffic to and from the virtual adaptors, while simultaneously applying rules to handle load-balancing, traffic routing, and so on, incurs a CPU cost. This cost is negligible at low data rates, but when pushing multiple gigabits of traffic per second to a VM, Microsoft was finding that the CPU burden was considerable. Entire processor cores had to be dedicated to this network workload, meaning that they couldn't be used to run VMs. The Bing team didn't have this network use case, so the way they used FPGAs wasn't immediately suitable. The solution that Microsoft came up with to handle both Bing and Azure was to add a second connection to the FPGAs. In addition to their PCIe connection to each hardware server, the FPGA boards were also plumbed directly into the Azure network, enabling them to send and receive network traffic without needing to pass it through the host system's network interface. That PCIe interface is shared with the virtual machines directly, giving the virtual machines the power to send and receive network traffic without having to bounce it through the host first. The result? Azure virtual machines can push 25 gigabits per second of network traffic, with a latency of 25-50 microseconds. That's a tenfold latency improvement and can be done without demanding any host CPU resources. Technically, something similar could be achieved with a suitable network card; higher-end network cards can similarly be shared and directly assigned to virtual machines, allowing the host to be bypassed. But this process is usually subject to limitations (for example, a given card may only be assignable to 4 VMs simultaneously), and it doesn't offer the same flexibility. When programming the FPGAs for Azure's networking, Microsoft can build the load balancing and other rules directly into the FPGA. With a shared network card, these rules would still have to be handled on the host processor within a device driver. This flexibility means that for Azure, just as with Bing before it, FPGAs are a better solution than ASICs. This solution of network-connected FPGAs works as well for Azure as it does for Bing, and Microsoft is now rolling it out to its data centers. Bing can use the FPGAs for workloads such as ranking, feature extraction from photos, and machine learning. Azure can use them for accelerated networking. Currently, the FPGA networking is in preview; once it's widespread enough across Microsoft's datacenters, it will become standard, with the long-term goal being to use FPGA networking for every Azure virtual machine. Networking is the first workload in Azure, but it's not going to be the only one. In principle, Microsoft could offer a menu of FPGA-accelerated algorithms (pattern matching, machine learning, and certain kinds of large-scale number crunching would all be good candidates) that virtual machine users could opt into, and longer term custom programming of the FPGAs could be an option. Microsoft gave a demonstration at its Ignite conference this week of just what this power could be used for. Distinguished engineer Doug Burger, who had led the Project Catapult work, demonstrated a machine translation of all 3 billion words of English Wikipedia on thousands of FPGAs simultaneously, crunching through the entire set of data in just a tenth of a second. The total processing power of all those FPGAs together was estimated at about 1 exa-operations—one billion billion, 1018 operations—per second, working on an artificial intelligence-style workload. While not a primary target for the company, the scale of cloud compute power—combined with the increasingly high performance interconnects that FPGAs and other technology enable—mean that cloud-scale systems are in time likely to be competitive with and eventually surpass the supercomputers used for high-performance computing workloads. With this kind of processing power on tap, it won't be too long before Azure becomes a collection of supercomputers available to anyone to rent by the hour.

Along with Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm, the German automakers announced the formation of the "5G Automotive Association," which will develop, test and standardize the fifth generation of high-speed wireless communication. Audi Audi's traffic light information system is the first step in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) integration, set to launch in select smart cities this fall in the U.S. "The goal is to address society's connected mobility and road safety needs with applications such as connected automated driving, ubiquitous access to services and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation," the companies said in a statement. The next-generation mobile network, also known as 5G, would involve not only cellular bandwidth improvements but also Internet connection speeds that are faster than the current 4G, or Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard. The Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance, a non-profit industry group working on new cellular communication standards, has said 5G would enable data rates up to 1Gbps second, allow for a vast increase in the number of devices that could simultaneously be connected on the same network and offer more efficient mobile networks for a lower investment cost. Self-driving cars not only rely on cameras and sensors to navigate, but also up-to date GPS and map data that can be used to identify the immediate location. In the future, autonomous vehicles will also be able to communicate with other vehicles and the infrastructure around them, known as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications. DOT For example, Audi recently announced that ts 2017 vehicles will be able to communicate with traffic lights in order to inform drivers when they will switch from red to green. Next-generation 5G mobile networks will include Cellular Vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, which shifts the focus of information and communication technologies towards the Internet of Things, the 5G Automotive Association said. "As an evolution to today's networks, next generation mobile networks are expected to handle much more data volume, connect many more devices, significantly reduce latency and bring new levels of reliability," the group said. "For example, 5G can better support mission-critical communications for safer driving and will further support enhanced [V2X] communications and connected mobility solutions." The 5G Automotive Association said it will address key technical and regulatory issues, the integration of vehicle platforms with 5G connectivity, privacy and security, a distributed cloud infrastructure and onboard vehicle computing systems. The group plans to run joint innovation and development projects and interoperability testing, as well large scale pilots and trial deployments. "It will facilitate global regulation, certification and standardization efforts for autonomous driving and future car services based on 5G technologies," Li Yingtao, president of a Huawei's 2012 Labs business.

The unprecedented collaboration between the three German premium brands is linked to their joint acquisition of Nokia’s HERE Maps, and the trio will join Huawei, Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, and the Finnish brand in the cross-industry partnership. Few projects of this kind have linked so many big corporations, so their results will be interesting to follow. The association has the goal of developing communication solutions and support standardization of protocols that will enable car-to-car connectivity, along with intelligent transportation solutions like car-to-infrastructure technologies. As BMW explains in a press release, the 5G Automotive Association wants to solve society’s connected mobility needs and road safety problems with advanced technology. The partnership will employ the next generation of mobile networks, which will operate on the 5G standard, an evolution of the LTE technology. Thanks to the tech, the 5G Automotive Association will employ Cellular Vehicle-to-everything communication, abbreviated by the C-V2X term. In layman’s terms, the idea behind this partnership is to place a reliable Internet connection in every car on the road, and to let vehicles “talk” to each other. Because the automakers involved five serious players of the communication and technology industry, they are sure that the models that will benefit from this technology will employ the latest developments in these systems. With 5G speeds, cars will be able to connect to more devices than ever, and the generated network will be able to handle an unprecedented data volume, while also reducing latency. Evidently, the association must be sure that the formed network will ensure a new level of reliability. Nobody wants to live in fear that his or her self-driving car, connected to the Internet, will ever suffer from lag or a connection that has timed out. Employing multiple solutions from several players in the telecom industry should provide a level of redundancy that will adequately support the network.

(Photo: AFP Relaxnews) German car makers Audi, BMW and Daimler have launched an alliance with mobile telecoms network equipment firms Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm to accelerate development of the infrastructure needed for self-driving cars. The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber and Google which are also working on the autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardisation and accelerate the commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until sometime around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. 5G Automotive Association audi bmw Daimler Trending Articles New Zealand vs Pakistan Live Score: 1st Test Day 3 at Christchurch Chris Martin Parties With SRK, Shraddha Kapoor Ahead of Global Citizen Festival Colin de Grandhomme: A Zimbabwean Who Makes His Mark For New Zealand Hrithik-Kangana Legal Tussle Isn't Over yet, Says the Actor's Lawyer Trending Articles New Zealand vs Pakistan Live Score: 1st Test Day 3 at Christchurch Chris Martin Parties With SRK, Shraddha Kapoor Ahead of Global Citizen Festival Colin de Grandhomme: A Zimbabwean Who Makes His Mark For New Zealand Hrithik-Kangana Legal Tussle Isn't Over yet, Says the Actor's Lawyer Force 2 Review: It Isn't Unwatchable but Is Wildly Inconsistent Force 2 Movie Review: You'll Love to Hate Tahir Raj Bhasin Hrithik-Kangana Legal Tussle Isn't Over yet, Says the Actor's Lawyer Force 2 Movie Review: Fast-paced Plot Will Keep You Hooked From Our Network Demonetisation: Myopic Opposition walks straight into trap laid by PM Narendra Modi- FirstPost One dead, 10 injured in explosion in Nagda industrial town - Pradesh18 CM Vasundhara Raje appoints chairmen and members of various boards - Pradesh18 About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Post-Demonetisation, ICICI Bank Got Rs 32,000 crore Deposits: Chanda Kochhar Donald Trump's Daughter Ivanka Sits in on Landmark Japan PM talks Watch: Big5@10- Friday Edition European Leaders, Barack Obama Vow to Hold Fast to NATO Fiat Chrysler Recalls Vehicles For Fuel Leak, Wiper Problems Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles Forza Horizon 3 PC What does it take to run Forza Horizon 3 at 1080p60? A lot of horsepower. By Richard Leadbetter Published 27/09/2016 Last weekend, we showcased the PC port of Playground Games' Forza Horizon 3, running at close to its absolute best at 4K resolution with a silky smooth 60 frames per second. It took an overclocked Core i7 and Nvidia's Titan X Pascal to get the job done, but typically, impressive performance at ultra HD tends to scale down nicely to less capable graphics hardware running at 1080p. However, Forza Horizon 3 appears to be something of an exception. Reports of inconsistent, stuttering performance are far and wide, even using PC hardware that far outstrips both the CPU and GPU power of the Xbox One, so we went back to the game to see the extent to which the issues could be replicated on our test system. The results are bizarre to say the least - using an Intel Skylake-based system, some of the performance issues and inconsistencies almost defy belief. Typically, a game that runs flawlessly at 4K on the new Titan X should run perfectly with performance to spare on Nvidia's GTX 1060 - but not Forza Horizon 3, which actually runs significantly more slowly. The GTX 970 - quite possibly the most popular enthusiast-level GPU installed in the most PCs today - shows a huge performance deficit compared to the 1060, but its shortfalls are nowhere near as pronounced as the R9 390 compared to the new RX 480, with a gap often in excess of 20fps (!). Bearing in mind that the R9 390 outperforms the RX 480 in many titles, this differential is remarkable. The list of WTF-level performance issues just continue to stack up the more hardware we tested: Nvidia's mighty Titan X Pascal cannot run this game smoothly at 1080p on ultra settings with the default 4x MSAA in effect - even though it runs smoothly at 4K with multi-sampling disabled. And this leads us on to the first key revelation in optimising Forza Horizon 3 to run at anything like a smooth 60fps: utilising MSAA simply murders any chance of flawless performance. We take an extended look at Forza Horizon 3's puzzling performance profile, testing out Titan X Pascal, GTX 1060, RX 480, GTX 970 and R9 390. We also look at how weaker CPUs have issues streaming the game world. Turning off MSAA removes many of the frequent coughs and splutters the game possesses, but it's far from a cure-all. Frame-rate dips appear to be either background streaming related or purely graphics related. Minimising the latter isn't super-difficult. Dropping shadows and world car detail level from ultra to high claws back a lot of performance, while paring back the reflection settings can improve frame-rate with no real substantial impact on image quality during the heat of gameplay. This can help to address the more sustained drops to frame-rate, but the fact is that the game still has severe streaming issues that requires sheer CPU brute force to overcome. Our Core i7 6700K overclocked to 4.6GHz and paired with 3000MHz DDR4 appears to power past most of the issues, but swapping out the i7 for a Core i5 6500 3.2GHz - similar in performance terms to a fully overclocked Core i5 2500K based on our previous tests - shows the stuttering issue in full effect. Adjusting settings to trim back draw distance could help here, but it's a Hobson's Choice of a situation - even on ultra settings, pop-in is noticeable and scaling back the dynamic geometry setting causes the pop-in to occur closer to the player position. Dropping back from ultra textures is also worth experimentation - there's not a great deal to differentiate high and ultra. Even medium looks presentable. When everything goes right and your PC powers past Forza Horizon 3's performance shortcomings, the end result is simply breathtaking. Here, we're playing the game at 4K, 60fps. LOD settings on Xbox One appear to be somewhat dynamic, which may explain its excellent consistency level. The PC version does have a dynamic load-levelling system too - just like Forza Motorsport 6 Apex - but the issue here is that at high and ultra settings, MSAA is forced on and you can't turn it off, meaning that stutter is never too far away. All of which makes it sound as though Forza Horizon 3 is a nuclear disaster of a PC port - but this is not the case. While it is clear that some fairly profound optimisation is required - plus a good deal of driver attention from both Nvidia and AMD - the fact is that a beautiful, smooth experience at full ultra settings and 8x MSAA is relatively easy to attain, even with a slower i5 and GTX 970. However, it involves making a compromise that many PC owners won't be happy with: engaging the 30fps limit. To its credit, the 30fps cap doesn't just limit frame-rate, it also enforces proper frame-pacing, meaning that each frame persists for 33ms - something we confirmed for both AMD and Nvidia hardware, and absolutely crucial in making what is a relatively low frame-rate for PC gaming actually work out. Combined with the excellent quality motion blur, this is a viable way forward for enjoying the game in its current state. Xbox One's 30fps experience is still beautifully solid - it's an excellent console racer. Right now, the bottom line is that while a smooth 60fps is possible, the raw brute force required to get the job done on the higher presets is likely beyond the reach of most mainstream gaming PCs, and that's a shame, because the experience clearly benefits immensely. Disabling MSAA is the first step on the journey to a smoother ride, but even doing that comes with some reservations - Xbox One runs with 4x MSAA and it looks great. Even at 4K, no multi-sampling can lead to some intrusive visual artefacts - especially on pixel break-up on power lines. Obviously, these become more of an issue as you scale down resolution. Quite why MSAA is an issue at all - and why enabling it even causes performance issues at 1080p with the fastest single-chip GPU money can buy - is something of a mystery. Doom 2016 secrets and collectibles guide Where to find all the classic levels, and much more. We can't help but think that this game needs some work - enough to warrant perhaps holding fire on a Windows Store purchase. While the issues we've encountered are by turns frustrating and even at times inexplicable, at least we're able to physically play the game. Colleagues at Eurogamer Portugal report that the game instantly crashes whenever a race is started, while Eurogamer Germany tells us that the game crashes every couple of minutes. User reports also show a number of issues relating to basic stability. Clearly, something needs to be done - and hopefully it will be, because when this game is running smoothly at 60fps with all the dials turned up to the maximum, the end result is simply glorious. Resolution, frame-rate, effects and art quality all scale beautifully to provide a premium, top-tier experience. But it shouldn't require a stupendously expensive rig to get the job done - fingers crossed that Playground Games is taking a good, long, hard look at getting Forza Horizon 3 into shape.

The three companies, which are among the leaders in 5G research and development, on Tuesday joined major European car makers BMW, Audi and Daimler, as well as US semiconductor technology giants Intel and Qualcomm to form the “5G Automotive Association”. In a joint media announcement from Munich, where BMW is headquartered, the association members said their goal was to address society’s mobility and road safety needs, with applications such as connected automated driving, while ensuring ubiquitous access to services, and integration into smart cities and intelligent transportation. ZTE, Huawei push 5G-ready gear for SoftBank deployment in Japan “The creation of this association demonstrates the clear need for cross sector collaboration,” said Li Yingtao, the president of Huawei’s innovation engine called 2012 Labs. “It will facilitate global regulation, certification and standardisation efforts for autonomous driving and future car services based on 5G technologies.” Alfons Pfaller, the head of infotainment development at Audi, added that connected cars “will shape the future of individual mobility, and next generation mobile networks will take car-to-x connectivity to a new level”. The association said it would welcome more partners from the automotive and broader information and communications technology industry. “Chinese smart car start-ups like us would definitely want to join this new 5G automotive group, so that we can understand potential 5G-related solutions,” said Shen Haiyi, the founder of Beijing-based Zhiche Auto. “We expect the association’s founding companies to help deliver major innovations in vehicle-to-vehicle as well as vehicle-to-everything communications.” ZTE first to complete all key technology tests for China’s national 5G network Shenzhen-based ZTE, which is China’s largest listed telecommunications equipment manufacturer and a leading 5G proponent, offered no comments when asked by the South China Morning Post about not participating in the new 5G association. ZTE and Huawei are both currently involved in the deployment of advanced 5G-ready mobile infrastructure in Japan by SoftBank Corp, the domestic telecommunications subsidiary of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. The newly formed 5G alliance followed Facebook’s establishment of the Telecom Infra Project in February. This initiative has signed up more than 300 members, including Intel and Nokia to help step up 5G standardisation and global adoption. “The wireless industry has always put a strong emphasis on standardisation,” Bernstein Research senior analyst Pierre Ferragu said in a report. He pointed out that complete 5G standardisation was still many years away, but deployment could happen earlier on a small scale. Initiatives like the 5G Automotive Association and the Telecom Infra Project appear to be a new approach to speeding up international standardisation efforts.

Most of the Macs currently shipping use either integrated graphics from Intel or discreet AMD chips, but that could change in the coming years. As first spotted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Nvidia is seeking software engineers tasked with helping produce “the next revolutionary Apple products.” According to the job post, the role would require “working in partnership with Apple” and writing code that will “define and shape the future” of graphics-related software on Macs. Gurman writes: There are three current job listings on Nvidia’s database referencing Apple, with the latest one appearing last week. All three job listings for the Santa Clara, California-based company cite software development for the Mac, while one specifies an Nvidia Mac graphics driver team, pointing to the potential of Nvidia chipsets returning to the Apple computers. Nvidia and Apple both declined to comment. One of the ads is for a Metal and OpenCL software engineer who will be working within a team of exceptional and passionate engineers to implement and extend Metal Compute and OpenCL on the Mac. As Gurman hinted, Nvidia most likely needs these GPU experts and software engineers for developing macOS graphics drivers for some of its GPUs that could end up in future Mac models. Macs have always been dissed for slow and poorly supported graphics. indeedI, most of the high-end graphics cards are unavailable to Mac owners who crave graphics power and performance. Apple itself does not write its own graphics drivers and is reluctant to officially support the latest and greatest graphics cards for gaming. Here’s Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang discussing GPU technology’s capability and its role in artificial intelligent applications at the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference 2016 which kicked off on September 21 in Taiwan. While discreet Nvidia chips are unlikely to end up in future Mac notebooks due to space constraints, it would make sense to use them in a future Mac Pro model, higher-end iMacs and it could also make a nice fit for a next-generation 5K Thunderbolt Display with integrated graphics that the rumor-mill thought Apple was building at some point. Nvidia’s latest Pascal-based Tesla P4 and P40 GPUs feature improved performance and response time and can detect and sense images, texts and voices. These GPUs will begin shipping next month.

REUTERS/Fabian BimmerMore FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German car makers Audi, BMW and Daimler on Tuesday launched an alliance with mobile telecoms network equipment firms Ericsson , Huawei [HWT.UL], Intel , Nokia and Qualcomm to accelerate development of the infrastructure needed for self-driving cars. The pact is another example of Germany's premium carmakers collaborating to build technology expertise necessary to take on new rivals like Uber [UBER.UL] and Google which are also working on autonomous driving technology. The new alliance, branded the 5G Automotive Association, will "develop, test and promote communications solutions, support standardization and accelerate commercial availability and global market penetration," the founders said in a statement. One of the aims of 5G, the technology standards for the next generation of much faster and more reliable mobile telecoms networks, is to enable a wide variety of devices to connect up and operate via the Internet - the "Internet of Things." Network equipment providers such as Ericsson and Nokia have said the 5G technology currently in development could be available for use as early as next year but mass-market upgrades to mobile networks are not expected until some time around 2020. A spokesman for the newly formed partnership said there were talks with several network operators to join the association, declining to give any names. Last year BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi, joined forces to buy digital map maker HERE for 2.8 billion euros ($3.15 billion) from Nokia and this week will introduce a service that allows drivers to see for themselves what road conditions are like miles ahead using live data contributed by other vehicles.

Performance-Boosting HiZ Patches Revised For Intel's Vulkan Linux Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 27 September 2016 at 06:39 AM EDT. 3 Comments A revised set of 11 patches were published this week for implementing basic HiZ (Hierarchical Z) support within Intel's open-source Vulkan "ANV" Mesa driver. These patches don't yet enable HiZ for all cases, but currently just for basic ones. With this basic support, enabling rendering to HiZ increases the FPS by about ~15% on basic triangle and multi-sampling demos. When enabling fast depth clears, it's about an additional 30% frame-rate gains for these triangle and multi-sampling Vulkan demos. These patches are a great start but not until the rest of the HiZ support is squared away will we probably see any significant benefit in the Vulkan Linux games like Dota 2 and Talos Principle. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Image: wang song/Shutterstock Some of the world’s biggest telecoms and automotive companies have agreed to join the 5G Automotive Association, to integrate 5G technology into future connected and autonomous vehicles. Once two very separate industries, telecoms and vehicle manufacturers are now rapidly merging together with the advent of connected and future autonomous vehicles. This culmination has resulted in the forming of a new organisation, one that will include the biggest names in the automotive and telecoms industries, known as the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA). Ahead of a 5G future The new association includes AUDI, BMW and Daimler from the automotive side; and Ericsson, Huawei, Intel, Nokia and Qualcomm from the telecoms industry. The ultra-fast mobile broadband platform remains experimental in many places, but governmental organisations like the EU have put in place plans to roll out 5G into 28 European cities by 2020. Referred to as cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication, 5G in vehicles will better support mission-critical communications for safer driving. It will do so by handling much greater quantities of data across many devices. The association has said that its formation will iron out all the regulatory work involved with bringing a new 5G standard into play in these companies’ vehicles, as well as the technical issues that need to be overcome. One of the biggest issues, the organisation said, will be to ensure data privacy, authentication and distributed cloud architectures are secured in all partnering vehicles. Daimler and BMW in particular made headlines for this subject earlier this year, after their discussions with Apple to potentially develop the tech giant’s autonomous vehicle project. Essential for autonomous driving However, talks between the parties broke down over Apple’s insistence that the car’s data be uploaded to its own iCloud service. Led by Audi’s Christoph Voigt, the 5GAA has issued a call for other automotive and telecoms industry players to join the group, having already confirmed that several companies have expressed an interest to join in the future. Speaking on what the founding of the 5GAA means for the participating companies, Dr Christoph Grote of BMW said: “We expect 5G to become the worldwide dominating mobile communications standard of the next decade. “For the automotive industry it is essential that 5G fulfils the challenges of the era of digitalisation and autonomous driving.” Related: telecoms, mobile networks, internet of things, internet, autotech Colm Gorey is a journalist with Siliconrepublic.com editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Comms Are telecoms companies just paying lip service to ‘going green’? 6 Oct 201623 Shares Hiring Now Join us to create the technology of tomorrow A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Working at the leading edge of IoT Innovation for mobility and the internet of things Comms EU sets out plans for free public Wi-Fi and 5G minimum by 2020 16 Sep 201626 Shares Machines What will the industrial internet of things mean for you? 17 Aug 2016110 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

Image: Route66/Shutterstock Reports of a new Huawei Nexus tablet and Pixel 3 laptop released by Google next year could herald the true convergence of Chrome OS and Android. Andromeda is on the way. Last October, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google’s vision of future operating systems was all mobile. Chrome OS was becoming a relic of the past, and Android was the future. Billing it as a 2017 plan, little else was known at the time, although a combined Andromeda OS did make sense. Now, fresh reports of a new Huawei Nexus tablet and Pixel 3 convertible laptop released next year could prove the showcase for Google’s new Andromeda OS. Android Police reported on Pixel 3 yesterday, detailing a planned “ultra-thin” 12.3in display that can support both a tablet mode and a laptop. “Powering it will be either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM,” according to the report. It will have notable inclusions of numerous sensors, stylus support, quad microphones, fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports and a 3.5mm jack. Perhaps Apple’s enthusiasm for a jack-less device isn’t catching on in the short term, but given that this rumoured laptop is a good year from completion, this could all change. 9to5Google separately reports a new Huawei Nexus tablet, citing sources close to the project, much like Android Police. The new Andromeda OS is the suggested platform for both devices, with the Huawei tablet expected as early as the new year. It’s a busy time for Google. It’s pinning plenty of its hopes on what many perceive as the next stage of instant messaging: conversational commerce. Google bought API.AI, a natural language and speech recognition company earlier this month. Google’s answer to Amazon Echo due out on 4 October, signals a speeding up of the impending smart home push. Indeed, 4 October could provide an early look at Andromeda. We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016. — Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) September 24, 2016 A change of operating systems – just as the number of connected devices skyrockets, as the internet of things push hits speed –will perhaps be the biggest Google shift of all.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Mobile World FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Andromeda to Be Featured on Google-Huawei Nexus Tablet and Pixel 3 GO Andromeda OS could be previewed next month Sep 27, 2016 07:53 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  A few days ago, an official from Google hinted that the October 4 event would have historical significance, similar to the launch of Android eight years ago. The comment set tongues wagging and some say that Google might preview Andromeda, a hybrid between Android and Chrome OS, during next month's event. A report by Android Police reveals that Google might feature Andromeda OS on an upcoming Pixel 2-in-1 laptop in Q3 2017. Apparently, the laptop that turns into a tablet is dubbed Pixel 3 and would run the new Andromeda OS, which is a version of Chrome OS baked into an Android-based OS. The Pixel 3 is also internally known as Bison and might come with a 12.3-inch touch display, an Intel m3 or Core i5 processor, 8 or 16GB of RAM, and a 10-hour battery life. Dual USB Type-C ports, stylus support and multiple sensors might be featured on the laptop that turns into a tablet. The price of the upcoming Pixel 3 could start at $799. Andromeda could debut on a Google-Huawei Nexus tablet Another report by 9to5Google shows that Andromeda would also launch on a 7-inch Google-Huawei Nexus tablet. There have been some reports about a new Nexus tablet in the past few months, but it seems that Google has been keeping the secret pretty well. Back in June, a Huawei executive said the company was working on another Nexus device, but not much on the upcoming tablet has been heard since then. So Google's big surprise for the October 4 event could be a Nexus tablet running Andromeda OS. The report suggests that the tablet could come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820, 4GB of RAM, and a 13MP rear camera. 9to5Google also confirms that Google is testing the upcoming Andromeda OS on a Nexus 9 tablet, but that consumers won't be able to see the OS on this tablet model. Google is also expected to unveil the Pixel and Pixel XL soon. October 4 is exactly one week away, so expect more information to surface until the official event. #Google#Andromeda#Huawei Nexus#Pixel 3#Android subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Pixel Leaks in New Image Showing Off the Pixel Launcher Google Is Testing Andromeda Android-Chrome OS on Nexus 9 Google Official Builds Up Hype Around October 4 Event Specs for Google and Huawei's Rumored Nexus 7P Tablet Leaked Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update Hacker Breaks into Italian Government Website, 45,000 Users Exposed Three UK Hacked, Details of 6 Million Customers at Risk Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Nokia's Return to Smartphone Business Confirmed for 2017 HTC 10 Evo to Be Announced on November 22 Blue Coral Galaxy S7 edge Goes on Sale at Sprint and Verizon Google Suspends Lots of Pixel Buyers Accounts for Reselling Them - Update    Google's Andromeda OS could come soon New Android APKs Google Play Store APK: Updated November 18th, 16:08 GMT Google Spotlight Stories APK: Updated November 18th, 13:53 GMT YouTube Kids APK: Updated November 18th, 13:49 GMT WB Movies All Access APK: Updated November 18th, 13:29 GMT WWE SuperCard APK: Updated November 18th, 13:21 GMT The Guardian APK: Updated November 18th, 12:57 GMT Apple Music APK: Updated November 18th, 12:48 GMT Reader comments Load old comments   Nokia's Return to Smartphone Business Confirmed for 2017 more on: Nokia D1C i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Which is a very good thing because the software will cost a lot of users more than they paid for Windows Server 2012, especially if they're slow to talk to Microsoft about their upgrade. Microsoft revealed its Windows Server 2016 licensing plan in December 2015, explaining that it wanted per-core licensing rather than the per-CPU licensing it had used in the past and revealing that costs would rise with the following table. Don't say you weren't warned: Microsoft flagged Windows Server 2016 would cost more than Windows Server 2012 in December 2015 It's not hard to see why Microsoft wants to make the change: newer CPUs in more powerful servers can run more virtual machines than ever before. Moving to per-core licensing therefore gives Microsoft a way to charge for the amount of computing power you tap. But moving to per-core licensing also means Microsoft benefits from the fact that new Xeons just have more cores these days. Take a look at Intel's list of fourth-gen Xeon E7s, for example, and you'll find just one model with fewer than eight cores. It's going to be hard to avoid extra costs when you buy new servers. So while Microsoft shareholders will like this change, analyst firm Gartner's view of the new regime is titled Changes to Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Licensing Will Increase Your Costs for Higher-Powered Servers.. Which is a pretty self-explanatory title. The document explains the situation with the following table. What Windows Server 2016 will cost, based on core count inside your servers The good news is there are still chances to avoid some of the extra costs. Gartner advises that if you talk to Microsoft well ahead of renewing software assurance, you may be able to “remain under the current per-processor model for another three years, thereby delaying the change to per core.” If that's not possible, the firm recommends planning your next round of server purchases sooner rather than later, to give yourself more time for budgeting. If you intend to roll over an existing agreement, you still have work to do because Microsoft is making “core grants” to help those on per-CPU licences move to the per-core world. But as the Windows Server 2016 licensing datasheet (PDF) explains, you need to conduct an inventory of your servers to get Microsoft's best offer when renewing licences. If you don't conduct that inventory, Microsoft will default to “8 core licenses per processor and 16 cores per server for each Standard and Enterprise edition license for servers they currently own.” Don't forget, too, that System Centre has also moved to per-core licensing. So there's another tab needed on your calculation spreadsheet. Cloud-herding A significant enterprise Windows Server user of The Register's acquaintance, who asked to remain anonymous, said he doesn't feel the price rise is justified by the new features in Windows Server 2016. “People are already paying software assurance, that's already the shiny new stuff tax,” he said. The user does have some sympathy for Microsoft, saying “I do understand it's tricky - but they should have just upped the Datacentre license as a whole, or put a mid tier license in that does something like allowing 16 VMs max per host to allow people to continue on if they wanted.” He's also concerned about the cost and complexity of the new regime, as more than one licence will be needed once you reach 16 cores on a machine. One last thing: Microsoft is also running a deal called the “Azure Hybrid Use Benefit” that “lets those using Windows Server with Software Assurance bring their on-premises licenses to Azure.” If you take up this offer, “Rather than paying the full price for new Windows Server virtual machines in Azure, you only pay for the base compute rate.” Microsoft says that can save 41 per cent. “For each Windows Server 2 processor license with Software Assurance, customers may run two virtual machines with up to 8 cores each, or one virtual machine with up to 16 cores, at the lower price.” Windows Server 2016's being billed as “Cloud-ready”. It looks like its licensing regime may also be readying you for using more cloud. ® Sponsored: Magic quadrant for enterprise mobility management suites Tips and corrections 20 Comments More from The Register VMware flings vCenter Server away from Windows, if you want vSphere update adds vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server Appliance migration tool 13 Comments Windows 7, Server 2008 'Convenience' update is anything but – it breaks VMware networking Virtualized VMXNet3 NICs borked by Microsoft install 26 Comments Windows Server-as-a-service: Microsoft lays out Server 2016's future Want to use Nano Server?

One of the biggest surprises comes from Romania, where the market is going through a rapid growth compared with the other countries and the with previous years. For ABC Data, Romania had one of the highest revenue growth, which means more than 79% in the first half of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The actual figures are consistent with the company’s strategy to strengthen the position and the build of a strong portofolio of  partners in Romania. The dynamic growth in the first half of 2016 has resulted from investments and activities undertaken on the Romanian market and the CEE region. In Romania, ABC Data Distribution has signed contracts with local key suppliers such as Lenovo, BenQ, TPVision (for Philips TVs), ASUS Components and Networking, Synology and Eaton. At the same time, the company completed some regional agreements with  3D Pixelio or Navitel (before the contract was signed with Intel). Such an approach has enabled the dynamic development of the ABC Data Distribution offer in Romania. So today it provides access to the local resellers in over 1,000 brands and approximately 220,000 products (a few months ago the offer was 180,000). No other vendor offers a portfolio so rich and diverse like this. “The rapid development of ABC Data can be explained better by the main product categories. The largest increase was driven by notebooks, desktops, networking, PC and gaming components. The Customers also were interested in buying wearable, those small and easy to use devices that connect to the smartphone. We note, however, an increase in the demand for Apple products and networking. These indicators show that our market is maturing from year to year. There is an undeniable need for the better equipment of high-speed connections to the Internet and to be integrated with the mobile devices” , said Alexander Gheorghiu (photo), ABC Data Distribution commercial director. “In our competitive domain it is impossible to stand still. We need to constantly develop. This is why, in addition to the strong strengthening of the Group, we will put a great emphasis on the regional diversification” , said Andrzej Kuźniak, vice president of the administration board of ABC Data. “We are the only distributor, in this part of Europe, which operates directly in eight European countries. The top traders appreciate that they have us as a partner and we can cooperate effectively not just in one or two countries but in the whole region “, said Andrzej Kuźniak. According to IDC and PMR, until 2018, the IT distribution revenues in Western Europe should increase from 95 billion dollars to around 100 billion, which means an increase of 5%. At the same time, in the EEC, the increase will be from 15 to 18 billion, more exactly of 20%.   About ABC Data   With over 25 years of experience, ABC Data is the only regional distributor of IT and electronics that operates directly on eight markets in Central and Eastern Europe: Romania, Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary.

English Cafe > Tech > Samsung Samsung ups ante in 3-D NAND war   Published : 2016-09-27 16:31 Updated : 2016-09-27 22:48 [THE INVESTOR] Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest memory chipmaker, will reportedly start to install manufacturing tools for the 3-D NAND flash memory next month at its manufacturing complex being constructed in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The installation of the chip equipment is in line with Samsung’s efforts to speed up the launch of the manufacturing complex amid the neck-and-neck competition among global chip companies to secure an upper hand. Samsung aims to launch the manufacturing park in December or next January, several months earlier than previously scheduled, local business news outlet Chosun Biz reported.  The manufacturing complex will then be fully operational as early as March next year after completing a series of test runs in January. “As more semiconductor companies, including Intel and Toshiba, are increasing their bets on the memory chip business, Samsung seems to be trying to advance the launch of the complex and further get ahead,” said an industry source who wished to be unnamed. Samsung has poured 15.6 trillion won (US$14.2 billion), as part of the first batch of investments, to build the Pyeongtaek complex, which will incorporate the four chip manufacturing lines, dorms and other facilities on the 2.8 million square meter land. The total amount of investment in completing the construction of the complex is estimated to reach 100 trillion won. Samsung had previously planned to roll out DRAM chips from the first of the four production lines at the complex, but recently decided to churn out 3-D NAND flash memories, which are in high demand in recent months. The first manufacturing line is expected to boast a monthly production capacity of 90,000 to 100,000 wafer sheets. The 3-D NAND flash memory is deployed in the solid-state drive, a storage system which is increasingly replacing the hard disk drive. Samsung is the world’s largest SSD maker with its market share accounting for 37 percent. The global DRAM sector, on the other hand, suffered from months-long price drops due to oversupply and market saturation.

These same rumours suggest that the OS will reside alongside ChromeOS and Android and that it will be designed for laptop-like devices. What we really want to know is why this OS even exists. First, let’s get the facts out of the way Android Police claims that their sources have confirmed the existence of the OS as well as work on a device that it’s expected to debut on. The device has been dubbed the Pixel 3 laptop and the project is code-named Bison. In terms of specs, the device is expected to sport an Intel m5 or i5 CPU, 8GB or 16 GB RAM and offer 32GB or 128 GB storage. The screen will be about 12.3-inches and you’ll get USB-C, a fingerprint reader, touchpad with haptic feedback and more. Of course, all of these specifications are subject to change. Sources have apparently told Android Police that the project is an attempt to build an OS that melds ChromeOS features into Android. Andromeda and the Pixel 3 are expected to debut in Q3 2017. But what does this mean? Android started out as an OS for touch-screen mobile phones, later evolving to include tablets when the need arose. Originally, the OS was all about apps, but later, the focus shifted to the browser and now, it’s at messaging and AI. Android was never a good fit for true computing. A laptop was still needed for real work (not just emails) and thus, ChromeOS was born. It came at a time when desktop apps were shifting to the cloud, when collaboration was the name of the game (This was in 2011, Apple. Take note.) ChromeOS worked because it brought with it cheap devices that gave you access to the full desktop web and associated web apps. It was like a stand-alone Chrome browser. Devices were hassle-free to maintain and run and since everything was stored in the cloud, you never lost any data. Of course, you needed an active internet connection to make full use of it. As time passed and ChromeOS started getting more popular, the lack of apps started to really hurt. Doing things on the web is great, but offline is sometimes better. It was then that Google announced plans to merge Android apps into ChromeOS. Image: 9to5google It’s a move that makes sense. Android is a mobile OS where apps and mobile browsing are king. ChromeOS is a “desktop” OS where the “desktop” web is king. Throw apps into the mix and ChromeOS suddenly becomes more flexible. So what’s the catch? The catch here is that ChromeOS is still only about the browser. Android apps do work, but they run just about as well as they would on a tablet. Think of them like UWP apps on the Windows Store. They’re not as great as true desktop apps, they’re a stop-gap. Andromeda is supposed to change that. Rather than integrate Android into ChromeOS, Andromeda is apparently trying to integrate ChromeOS into Android. Andromeda might, in fact, be a portmanteau of Android and Chrome, but don’t take our word for it. As far as facts are concerned that’s all we know. So why does it exist? Thinking about it, I think I understand why Google is working on Andromeda. We spend most of our time on our phone and in apps and it’s only when we need to “work” and our phone isn’t up to the task that we switch to a PC. Representational image: Reuters Say you’re browsing the web on a tablet, you’d rather just use it in tablet mode. But what if you want to work on a document? You can work on the docs app, but it’s also more convenient to work on Google Docs in a desktop web browser. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could do that on the same device? This, I believe, is the idea behind Andromeda. I could be completely in the wrong of course. The difference between ChromeOS running Android and Android running ChromeOS is subtle, but it’s significant. Is this the future?

Well, now there are rumors that Google will unveil an Andromeda-powered 'Pixel 3' laptop, which will hit the market in Q3 2017.     The purported Pixel 3 would arrive with a 12.3-inch display, with Google wanting its ultra-thin laptop to be used in 'tablet' mode, too. We could see a Lenovo Yoga-type of flexibility with the Pixel 3, especially as it is supposedly powered by an Intel Core m3 or i5 processor, 32/128GB of storage and 8/16GB of RAM. We should see two models of Pixel 3, one with the Intel m3/32GB storage/8GB RAM and the higher-end model with Core i3/128GB storage/16GB RAM.   Android Police reports that there should be a fingerprint scanner and more on the Pixel 3:   Intel Core m3/Core i5 processor 8/16GB RAM 32/128GB storage Fingerprint scanner 2 x USB Type-C 3.5mm audio jack Stylus support Stereo speakers 10-hour (or so) battery Backlit keyboard Glass trackpad w/haptic feedback Andromeda OS   Google is looking to directly fight against Microsoft and Apple, with the Surface and iPad/MacBook line of products with its next-gen Andromeda OS and Pixel 3 laptop. We have some respectable specs which I'm sure will change between now and Q3 2017, and an extensive nearly neverending list of Google services and products that will power the Pixel 3 (and any Andromeda-based device).   If we do see Andromeda and it's as good as the rumors suggest - and even more excitedly if it's better than the rumors - we could be looking at the future of Google and its operating systems.

By: Tech Desk | Updated: September 27, 2016 4:28 pm Google Andromeda OS on Pixel 3 convertible laptop could be launched in 2017: Report (Source: Reuters) Google is working on a new OS called Andromeda, which will be a fusion of Chrome OS and Android and this could make an appearance on the Pixel 3 laptop which launches in 2017. Google has already hinted at some serious hardware plans with the upcoming October 4 ‘Made by Google’ event.  The company is reportedly preparing two new Android smartphones, a 4K Chromecast, a home WiFi router dubbed Google WiFi. While these hardware products are certain to make an appearance on October 4, the latest rumour hints that Android and Chrome OS are set to merge. Google, has been long rumoured to be working on combining the core assets of Android and Chrome for a unified OS experience. Microsoft has adopted the strategy with its Windows 10 and Apple’s macOS on desktop and iOS on mobile share a lot with the Continuity features. Now Google seems to be planning a new OS combining Chrome and Android codenamed ‘Andromeda’. According to Android Police, Google is testing Andromeda on an ultra-thin laptop known internally as Bison, which will be known as Pixel 3 when it launches.  Since Sundar Pichai took over as Google CEO, he has been constantly talking about efforts to bring Android features like Google Play Store to Chrome OS and the new initiative to merge both the OS seems valid. Android Police further reports that Bison will run Android and not Chrome OS leading to culmination of a new platform altogether. The Android Police report also states that the new OS will be more than just running Android apps on Chromebooks.

The device reportedly features a 12.3-inch display and will be powered by Intel’s Core m series processor. With seventh generation processors, Intel has almost killed m series by keeping only m7 in the offering. So expect the processor to upgrade from Core m to Core i processor. The device is reported to come with 32 or 128GB storage and two variants offering 8 or 16GB RAM. Android Police notes Google’s Bison features a backlit keyboard and glass trackpad with force detection similar to Apple’s latest MacBook. Google aims to make the device less than 10 mm thick, which should undercut every other tablet offering in the market. Google is reportedly planning to launch this device in Q3 2017.

You can unsubscribe at any time. Thank you for subscribing. Something went wrong. Thanks for signing up! Over the last few years, I’ve been merrily collecting Sonos wireless speakers for my home. PLAY:1, PLAY:3, PLAY:5, SUB, SOUNDBAR? I love them all. Hooked up to my music library, with Google Play Music in support, it’s the complete, whole home package. Sonos owners will be all too familiar with the Sonos Controller apps, available for OS X, Windows, iOS and Android. They do a great job of helping users navigate through large music libraries and push selected tunes to selected speakers. I use the Sonos Controller on various platforms, and works really well. But sometimes, when I’m browsing through my music library on a PC, I may stray across a track I haven’t heard in a while, and want to play it immediately. Forget opening up the Sonos Controller, searching for the track, choosing a speaker and streaming it – I want to play it now! This tip may well be known to everyone apart from me, but I’m going to share it anyway! This evening, I was editing some file names in my music library. The files themselves are stored on a QNAP NAS, but I was editing the file names over the network on an Intel NUC PC running Windows 10. I right clicked on a file and noticed the Cast to Device option. To be honest, I’ve never paid much attention to Windows’ media casting feature. It’s used to push media to DLNA devices – handy for connected TV playback, for example but I have my media streaming covered using other methods (like the Sonos Controller app!) I’m not sure why I decided to rollover the option this time, but on doing so I noticed that my Sonos speakers were listed. Now, I’ve assumed for some time that Sonos had locked down their speakers really tightly – to the point where the Sonos Controller app was the only way to stream music to them. But what the heck! I thought I’d see if Windows 10 could push music out to the Sonos speakers natively. Expecting to hear the familiar tone of a Windows error, rather than the new Suede album I’d selected for streaming, I was shocked to hear the popular beat combo rocking the Living Room! Of course, from a features perspective, casting from Windows to Sonos simply can’t match the Sonos Controller app, which remains my “go to” source for music library access. But if you’re working in Windows File Explorer and you need to spin some tunes on Sonos sharpish, Windows 10’s Cast to Device is a really handy option. shares Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Reddit Email Subscribe Join the mailing list Sign up to our mailing list and you will receive the latest news, reviews and how to guides delivered directly to your inbox.

Rohit Hi! You can also cast 24 bit music through Sonos. Sonos won’t let you do it but you can cast it! Midix I’m afraid that it will get converted on the way. DLNA protocol used by Cast To function is limited to specific formats only and if both endpoints do not agree upon the format, then the audio gets converted on the server end (Windows PC in this case) to the format acceptable to audio renderer device (Sonos PLAY in this case). Maarten DLNA 24 bit is no issue. It will play. Midix The Cast functionality is available also from Windows Media Player, so you can control your media library from there.

The comedian tops an annual list of “most dangerous” celebrities, musicians and TV hosts compiled by the security software company McAfee. Searching for their names is most likely to generate results that expose people to malware, the company said. Pop star Justin Bieber is No. 2 on the list, followed by Carson Daly at No. 3, Will Smith at No. 4 and Rihanna at No. 5. Next are Miley Cyrus, Chris Hardwick, Daniel Tosh, Selena Gomez and Kesha. This week, a fake article claiming Brad Pitt had died was also putting people at risk of being hacked. A fake article that appeared to come from Fox News was floating around Facebook on Tuesday, touting the headline “R.I.P Brad Pitt.” People “fascinated with celebrity culture” and eager for news often search and click without considering security risks, said Gary Davis, a consumer security executive at Intel Security, which owns McAfee. “Cybercriminals know this and take advantage of this behavior by attempting to lead them to unsafe sites loaded with malware,” he said. The company advises people not to click on third-party links but instead go to the original source, such as ComedyCentral.com to watch Schumer’s show “Inside Amy Schumer.” People should use particular caution when searching for “torrent,” by far the riskiest term. BitTorrent is a tool that allows people to upload and stream content. It has been subject to allegations of enabling piracy. “It’s best to avoid using torrents especially when there are so many legitimate streaming options available,” McAfee said. As always, people should be especially cautious if they get a request to enter personal information, like a credit card number, email address, home address or social media login. “Do your research and ensure it’s not a phishing or scam attempt that could lead to identity theft,” the company said.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Microsoft catapults datacenter performance with FPGAs by Wayne Manion  11:30 AM on September 28, 2016 Gamers and content creators are not alone in their frustration with the last decade's slowing increases in CPU performance. Massive datacenter operators like Microsoft are coming up with new ways to increase server performance using unconventional hardware. Microsoft in particular is upgrading 34 datacenters around the world with field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in an operation the software giant calls "Project Catapult." Microsoft says its researchers have been planning these upgrades since 2010 and have done pilot rollouts since 2012. The company says it evaluated GPUs and application-specific integration circuits (ASICs) as well as FPGAs in its acceleration research. Microsoft claims its FPGA deployment strategy results in a performance increase of an order of magnitude compared to CPUs, with a comparatively modest 30% increase in cost and 10% increase in total power consumption. Wired reports a 40-fold performance increase compared to a CPU when running Bing algorithms. Microsoft's "acceleration fabric" deployment strategy calls for the distributed integration of FPGAs into nearly every new box in their datacenters rather than a concentration of many FPGAs into a smaller pool of servers. For that purpose, Microsoft is using Stratix V D5 FPGA daughtercards from Altera inside Intel Xeon-based machines. Intel completed its purchase of Altera for $16.7 billion in cash and shares at the end of December 2015.
