Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California.

In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Caption TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Since 2007, Adrian has overseen the creation of all of Six to Start’s main projects, including Zombies, Run!, We Tell Stories, and Smokescreen, and its research and development projects with clients including Disney Imagineering, the British Museum, and Microsoft.

Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Building Habit-Forming Products with Nir Eyal Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Building Habit-Forming Products Hundreds of millions of people use Firefox every day. But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse. Moderator & Host: Andrew Losowsky, Lead, Mozilla Coral Project. Andrew has turned a street into a museum, a volcano into a magazine, and academic research into a life-sized board game. A John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 2013, he now runs Mozilla’s Coral Project, which helps news organizations build better communities around their work. Because journalism needs everyone. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

Building products with partners, considerably moreso. Varying resources, goals, strategies and cultures pose challenges. But partnering well on products is often worth the effort. This month April Underwood, head of all product & partnerships at Slack, will draw from her experiences at Google, Twitter, Travelocity and more to help us navigate the complexities of marrying products and partnerships. She'll be interviewed by our very own Bertrand Neveux, who has built products with partners for most of his career at and leading up to Mozilla.

Advertising. Dogfooding. Email clients. Mozillians form strong opinions on all sides of these (and other) topics, often for legitimate reasons. We’re not alone. Leading software firms such as VMWare and Facebook also grapple with contentious technology and process issues, and Jocelyn Goldfein has firsthand experience of this. She's led engineering teams building software for both consumers and the enterprise; apps and the web; and for license fees and for free. These teams are like us: they debate how to best release software - and a host of other issues. Drawing from these experiences, Jocelyn will provide frameworks for how Mozilla can navigate these discussions effectively to drive better outcomes. Speaker: Jocelyn Goldfein has held senior engineering leadership roles spanning from high-growth companies like VMware and Facebook to small startups. She is a widely recognized industry spokesperson on scaling engineering operations, mobile engineering, and diversity in tech. Goldfein currently is an independent angel investor and advisor to startups.

How can larger software organizations keep up with this rapid, perpetual change? In the natural realm, 'complex adaptive systems’ allow for flux and change in tumultuous environments. Our December speaker will draw on these models to illustrate how modern organizations can decide and move quickly. Mike will share how leading tech and product organizations are not simply adapting to increased change, but innovating and thriving in these dynamic environments by: operating around networks vs hierarchies distributing authority processing information effectively embracing structured and facilitated methods for collecting feedback and gaining consent on group action. Speaker: Mike Arauz is a Founding Member and Acting President at August, a New York based consulting firm that builds high-performing teams for the world’s most meaningful missions. Previously, Mike was a Partner at Undercurrent, where he worked with leaders of global companies to transform how their organizations work and thrive in the 21st century, including GE, Pearson, and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

User research and user-centered design help get us there, but once we have a sense of how our audiences think and behave, how can we go beyond the anecdotal to extrapolate to the macro? What ways can we better understand the needs of millions of users who think, act and operate differently than us? Our October speaker Frances Haugen will share from her product management and software engineering experiences with products used by millions of Google and Yelp customers. She'll help us understand how data - done 'right' - connects us to millions of users we don't know personally. And she'll outline what doing data right means for product development, and how product owners can build things their users love. Speaker: As both a Senior Product Manager, Software Engineer and Data Scientist for companies including Yelp and Google, Frances has worked at the intersection of data, design and humans throughout her career. An Electrical and Computer Engineering undergrad, Frances says she sees the world as comprised of hi and low cast filters.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes. Speaker: Deanna Zandt creates and implements web strategies supporting civic engagement and cultural agency, drawing off her background in linguistics, advertising, telecommunications and finance. She’s worked with The Ford Foundation, Deutsche Telekom, Planned Parenthood, and Jim Hightower’s Hightower Lowdown; and has also advised the White House on digital strategy and public engagement. Deanna has been a regular contributor to Forbes.com, as well as NPR’s flagship news program, “All Things Considered” and is a frequent guest on MSNBC, CNN International, BBC Radio and Fox News.

News sign-up Intel emphasises brand experiences News, 17 April 2017 Topics PCs, computing DANA POINT, CA: Intel, the technology group, has successfully reinvigorated its brand by focusing on how its tech products can drive and deliver compelling experiences. Steve Fund, CMO at Intel Corp., discussed this subject at the Association of National Advertisers' (ANA) 2017 Brand Masters Conference. And he reported that the firm's decision to focus on the immersive, empowering and engaging experiences its products and technology provide in its marketing constitutes a major shift from the brand's iconic "Intel Inside" positioning. "Intel was known for what it was, not for what it is – or where it's headed," he said. (For more details, read Warc's exclusive report: How Intel marketing remade the brand.) The company, according to Fund, needed to make sure that consumers know it is responsible for much more than making the processors which help drive computers. "We didn't evolve our brand; we evolved our business. We didn't invest sufficiently to keep the brand relevant and fresh. The brand was stuck in the past and [everybody] thought it was a microprocessor inside of a PC," he said. "We needed to demonstrate the relationship between the brand and the business, and relate the brand promise to what the engineers do. "To have a healthy business, you need to have a healthy brand. Business performance always eventually follows brand performance." Partnerships with actors Jim Parsons, singer Lady Gaga and quarterback Tom Brady have all added an element of star power to its marketing, too. And emphasizing experiences also offers a clearer path to engaging millennials. "Our consumer base was ageing, and older consumers refresh PCs slower than younger consumers," said Fund. "We needed to become more relevant to millennials and go from being the PC component to an experience exponent – to go from being stuck inside to enabling amazing experiences outside. "We've inserted Intel into pop culture, showing up when and where millennials were receptive to our message. We're leveraging their passion points: music, sports, entertainment and gaming."

Twitter Facebook Microsoft begins denying updates to some Windows 7 users But the no-support-on-new-silicon dragnet sweeps up innocent PCs, too, as false-positive reports mount IDG Gregg Keizer (Computerworld (US)) 15 April, 2017 05:56 - - - - print email Comments Microsoft this week began blocking Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs equipped with the very newest processors from receiving security updates, making good on a policy it announced but did not implement last year. But the company also refused to provide security fixes to Windows 7 systems that were powered by AMD's "Carrizo" CPUs, an architecture that was supposed to continue receiving patches. The decree that led to the update bans, whether allowable or not under Microsoft's new policy, was revealed in January 2016, when the company said making Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 run on the latest processors was "challenging." Microsoft then ruled that Windows 10 would be the only supported edition on seventh-generation and later CPUs and simultaneously dictated a substantial shortening of support of both editions. The biggest impact was on Windows 7, because it had become the standard in enterprises -- Microsoft's most valued customers -- with deployment shares far north of 50%. According to Microsoft, Windows 7 was to be fully supported on sixth-generation processors -- Intel's were dubbed "Skylake," AMD's included Carrizo -- until July 17, 2017. At that point, some Skylake-equipped PCs would continue to receive some security updates; other such PCs would get nothing. Microsoft later walked back the cut-off, first by extending the end-of-support date to July 2018, then by repudiating the sixth-generation proclamation for those systems on a we'll-support-them list. The last move -- which took place in August -- meant that in most instances only seventh-generation and later processors from AMD and Intel were on Windows 7's and 8.1's no-go catalog. Even so, Microsoft on Wednesday acknowledged that it had blocked updates from reaching machines equipped with AMD's Carrizo processor, then promised to correct the snafu. "Microsoft intends to continue to support Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 with this processor and plans to address the issue causing the message in a future update," said Edison Pus, identified as a Microsoft representative, on the company's support forum. Pus did not specify when the update to the update would appear. A shorter version of that message was also added to the "Known issues" section of the Windows 7 and 8.1 monthly roll-up and security-only updates. Because the update ban cannot be reversed by users, they must wait until Microsoft issues a correction. During the interim, their PCs will be vulnerable to exploitation of the vulnerabilities Microsoft patched on Tuesday. Other users also encountered the update injunction, but in those cases the messages were deliberate. "Windows 7 keeps giving a warning that my Intel Core i7 (7700k) processor is not supported," reported someone tagged as DenverBraganaza, in a message posted Tuesday to Microsoft's support forum. That CPU is one from Intel's seventh-generation architecture, codenamed "Kaby Lake," and thus is on Microsoft's no-no list for Windows 7 and 8.1. Others, however, said that their PCs had been barred from this month's updates -- and future updates -- even though the processors are not seventh-generation, raising the issue of false positives from whatever test or diagnostic Microsoft used to determine whether to block the machine. One false positive report came from a user whose machine ran an Intel processor introduced around the same time as Windows 7, and had been refused April's update for the OS. That report, along with at least one other, were posted on AskWoody.com, a site operated by Woody Leonard, a Windows patch expert who writes for Infoworld. (Like Computerworld, Infoworld is an IDG publication.) Microsoft did not immediately reply to a request for confirmation that it has officially begun enforcing the stop-support policy. Microsoft This is the 'no-patches-for-you' pop-up that some users of Windows 7 and 8.1 have seen this week as Microsoft denied them security updates because their PCs were powered by the newest processors. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

While the company’s Ryzen 7 line-up is aimed at high-end desktop users, boasting eight physical cores with 16 threads, Ryzen 5 processors compete slightly lower on the performance ladder. The processors feature an impressive number of CPU cores, and compete squarely in the mainstream gaming market alongside Intel’s Core i5 processors. Intel’s new 7th-gen Core i5 desktop processors all feature four physical cores and the same number of threads, while the Ryzen 5 chips boast up to 6 cores with 12 threads. AMD’s new chips are based on the company’s Zen microarchitecture, while Intel’s newest line-up of desktop processors is built on its Kaby Lake architecture. Specifications and Pricing The specifications and local pricing of the AMD and Intel CPUs are detailed below. Pricing information for all products was taken from Wootware. Processor Cores Threads Base Clock Boost Clock TDP Price AMD Ryzen 5 1400 4 8 3.2GHz 3.4GHz 65W R2,749 AMD Ryzen 5 1500X 4 8 3.5GHz 3.7GHz 65W R3,099 AMD Ryzen 5 1600 6 12 3.2GHz 3.6GHz 65W R3,579 AMD Ryzen 5 1600X 6 12 3.6GHz 4.0GHz 95W R4,099 Intel Core i5 7400 4 4 3.0GHz 3.5GHz 65W R3,062 Intel Core i5 7500 4 4 3.4GHz 3.8GHz 65W R3,399 Intel Core i5 7600 4 4 3.5GHz 4.1GHz 65W R3,844 Intel Core i5 7600K 4 4 3.8GHz 4.2GHz 91W R3,999 Comparison The two desktop processor ranges are similar in terms of pricing, despite the increased core/thread count of the Ryzen chips. However, performance comparisons between Intel’s Core i7 line-up and AMD’s Ryzen 7 octa-core processors found that while AMD’s chips were superior in multi-threaded tasks, Intel’s Kaby Lake processors had the edge in single-core benchmarks. Intel’s Core i7 chips also featured better gaming performance, although this could be an indicator of better driver support and Zen’s inclination towards DirectX 12 and Vulkan performance. AMD’s Ryzen processors could be the better buy for certain users, such as gamers looking for a CPU that can breeze through streaming and playing simultaneously. Intel’s processors remain a good choice for regular gamers and professional users, as they offer better IPC and single-core performance. Intel chips also include integrated graphics, making them a valuable option for users with no need for discrete graphics hardware.

Frankly, I've never seen so much drama unfold so quickly in the tech community — what an exciting time to be a PC enthusiast! As we begin to recover from the roller coaster ride that was Ryzen 7, we now have Ryzen 5 to address. Getting the ball rolling, AMD has announced four models in its more affordable series, including a pair of six-core CPUs as well as two quad-core models. AMD's Ryzen CPUs: Good For Games, Better For Everything Else It's not often that the CPU market has any degree of disruption. And that was the logic behind the launch of AMD's Ryzen CPUs, with the chip manufacturer aiming to offer more performance by selling CPUs with more cores and threads than their Intel counterparts for less money. Read more If You've Got A Ryzen CPU, AMD Has A Power Plan For You It's not often you turn to your power settings to get a better frame rate, but it's been necessary for anyone who has picked up a Ryzen CPU in the last month. And to make matters a little easier, the chip maker has released a special power plan to help performance. Read more The 1600X is configured similarly to the Core i7-6800K and stands as the flagship of AMD's Ryzen 5 family, boasting six cores and 12 threads with a base clock frequency of 3.6GHz and a boost speed of up to 4GHz. Like all Ryzen CPUs, the 1600X is unlocked, but we wouldn't necessarily expect to squeeze much more out of the stock settings given what we've seen from Ryzen 7. AMD says the 1600X will be almost 70 per cent faster than the Core i5-7600K when measuring multi-threaded performance in Cinebench, though that isn't a huge surprise considering the Ryzen part has two more cores plus eight threads. Alongside the 1600X is a second six-core part known as the 1600, which comes downclocked by 400MHz but is nonetheless completely unlocked. As was the case when we reviewed the 1700X and 1700, it's likely that the 1600 will be a much better buy than the 1600X. However, we only have the 1600X on hand for today's testing. The 1500X and 1400 represent AMD's new four-core/eight-thread Ryzen 5 parts and these come clocked even lower out of the box. The 1500X operates at a base clock of 3.5GHz with a boost of 3.7GHz and the 1400 runs at 3.2GHz but can boost to 3.4GHz (and again, both are unlocked). For those wondering, the 1500X and 1600 will ship with the Wraith Spire cooler while the 1400 comes with the smaller Wraith Stealth cooler. Unfortunately, we only have one quad-core model on hand for review and that's the higher-clocked 1500X. Price-wise, the 1600X is set at $359 alongside the Core i5-7600K, though we suspect you may be better off buying the standard 1600 for $39 less at $320. Folks seeking a sub-$300 Ryzen 5 chip have the 1500X and 1400 to pick from at $275 and $245, prices that compete with lower-end (locked) Core i5s and higher-end Core i3s such as the $249 unlocked 7350K, which we know to be terrible value. By the way things look on paper, the Ryzen 5 1400 should have Intel's entire Kaby Lake-based Core i3 range begging for mercy while the locked Core i5 models should be equally if not more rattled. In the first of what will likely be many write-ups about Ryzen 5, we'll be pitting the 1500X against the locked Core i5-7500 and the 1600X against the unlocked 7600K. The Core i7-7700K, 6900K and 1800X will be included purely for comparison's sake, and although we haven't had time to add results for the six-core 6800K, we think it's unnecessary anyway. Given Ryzen's pricing scheme, Broadwell-E can be considered a write-off at this point.

AMD's chips are now good for 35GB/s whereas we were previously seeing around 32GB/s with DDR4-2933 memory. Even with lower rated memory, Ryzen CPUs are delivering at least 10 per cent more bandwidth than the Kaby Lake CPUs. This will hand the 1500X a massive advantage over the Core i5-7500 in memory-intensive workloads as it has over 40 per cent more bandwidth at its disposal. Synthetic & Application Performance Using Cinebench R15 to measure single and multi-threaded performance we once again find extremely impressive figures from the Ryzen CPUs. The 1600X lays waste to the 7600K's multi-threaded score, essentially doubling it. That said, for single-threaded workloads, the higher memory clock speed of the Core i5 results in the 1600X being 11 per cent slower here. Moving to the 1500X, we find it's just 15 per cent slower than the 7700K in the multi-threaded test and 21 per cent slower when looking at single-thread performance. However, when compared to the similarly priced 7600, the 1600X offered 45 per cent faster multi-threaded performance and six per cent faster when looking at single-thread. As we found when testing Ryzen 7, this points to Ryzen 5 offering vastly superior productivity performance compared to competing Intel CPUs. The 7-Zip benchmark shows similar margins to what we just saw in Cinebench R15, though this is a real-world application and the gains here can actually be enjoyed by the average user. There are two tests here: one measures the performance when compressing files to an archive and another measures performance when extracting an archive. It's interesting to note that Intel's compression and decompression performance is similar. The AMD CPUs are much faster at decompression than they are compression, though to be fair they are anything but slow at either. In fact, the 1600X crushes the 7700K in both tests, being 15 per cent faster when compressing and 44 per cent faster when decompressing. When compared to the 7600K, the 1600X is more than twice as fast when decompressing. Meanwhile, the 1500X is over 60 per cent faster than the 7500 in our decompression test, which is a massive difference and the vast majority of users will open archives more commonly than they will compress them so this is a big win for Ryzen. The Monte Carlo simulation is an old favourite and this heavy Excel workload crushes weak CPUs. It's also a great test for measuring multi-threaded performance as it uses all available threads. We've seen it do a good job of utilising a dual-Xeon configuration with 40-threads. I realise most of you are more interested in gaming performance than heavy spreadsheet work but this is a good indicator of real-world performance in applications that utilise multiple threads. Here we see that the 1600X is 10 per cent faster than the 7700K and 62 per cent faster than the 7600K, while the 1500X was 20 per cent slower than the 7700K but 18 per cent faster than the 7600K and 61 per cent faster than the 7500. So when compared to similarly priced Intel CPUs, Ryzen 5 delivers around 60 per cent more performance in this application. Before jumping to the game benches, let's check out the performance results from Premiere Pro CC. This is a different workload from our previous Premiere tests. It's still a 4K video export, but we reduced the video length to speed up the test. The 1600X took 241 seconds to complete the workload, which was 31 per cent faster than the Core i5-7600K, while the 1500X managed to match the 7600K and overtake the 7500 by 22 per cent — another excellent application result for AMD. Gaming Performance Testing games is where things tend to get tricky. In Battlefield 1, the 1800X and 1600X fall short of the 7600K's 153fps average, but if we look at the minimum frame rates they're both faster than the 7600K. In fact, when comparing minimum results, the 1800X matched the 6900K while the 1500X was just 4 per cent slower. The 1500X on the other hand loses out to the Core i5-7500 in both the minimum and average frame rates, though it's still possible to overclock the 1500X for greater performance and we will explore this later in the review. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was tested using the DX11 API at 1080p with the high quality preset. Here the 1600X matches the performance of the 1800X though unfortunately both are slower than the 7600K by almost 10 per cent when comparing the minimum frame rate. That said, the 1500X makes out quite a bit better, beating the locked 7500 by a slim margin. The DX11 Hitman results are quite competitive for the 1600X and 1500X which is great as the 1800X doesn't fare that well against the 7700K or 6900K, at least when looking at the average frame rate, though I should note the minimum result is good. Moving on, the 1600X roughly matched the 7600K while the 1500X was a good bit faster than the 7500 — a great result for the 1500X here. The plan was to include Mafia III to showcase how well Ryzen can perform in some games. Previously this was a title where the Ryzen 7 processors did well, even beating the 7700K under certain conditions. However, this retest shows the 1800X quite a long way behind the 7700K. Something has changed with this title. The 1800X has taken a big hit, particularly to the minimum frame rate and the same is also true for the 6900K. Conversely, the 7700K has gained a few extra frames, so it seems some optimization might have been done to make this title less demanding on the CPU. This could also be down to improvements made by the Nvidia display driver. I believe the game was patched last week but there was no mention of any performance changes. The Nvidia driver has also been heavily updated since they previous testing was conducted but the improvements mostly focused on DX12 performance. I expected the 1600X to easily beat the 7600K here and the 1500X demolish the 7500. Instead, performance is competitive among these processors and again something has changed here. Moving to Ashes of the Singularity we see that the 1800X is able to close in on the 7700K for the normal batch test, that said it does slip away in the heavy batch test. The new Ryzen 5 models look rather competitive when comparing the 1600X to the 7600K and the 1500X against the 7500. The latter chips are separated by almost 10 per cent in the normal batch test — yet another strong result for AMD's affordable quad-core CPU.

By Adario Strange2017-04-17 02:52:25 UTC The NBA playoffs have begun, so it's time to prepare for the funniest insults to be hurled at your favorite players. But just before the start of the hunt for the championship, Intel released what might be the best LeBron James jab ever: Crybaby LeBron.  No, not just LeBron crying about an imagined foul. Intel (promoting its Intel 360 Replay technology) gave us the gift of actually seeing LeBron's adult mug transformed into wailing toddler, and it might be best diss disguised as a disarming commercial ever.  Respect to LeBron for letting Intel do this to him, but we'll probably be seeing this Crybaby LeBron image in the hands of haters on the sidelines in the coming weeks.  'Rick and Morty' meets 'Grand Theft Auto' is twisted and brilliant Someone mashed up the 'The Last Jedi' trailer with clips from 'The Force Awakens' 'SNL' agrees with the internet, turns Harry Styles into a perfect Mick Jagger Tying this dog to a chair was really bad idea Topics: Advertising, Intel, lebron james, NBA, NBA Playoffs, Sports, Watercooler About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

While there is little to suggest that hardware will take center stage in New York two weeks from now, people can look forward to learning more about Microsoft’s vision for consumer and enterprise technology. High-end, innovative products like those of the Surface range have seen spikes in demand. This article takes a look at Microsoft Corporation’s most exciting Surface hardware developments. Reports claim an all-in-one smartphone will be added to the Surface lineup. The venture is yet to get an official title, although rumors have dubbed it the Surface Phone. The alleged, upcoming mobile device is said to offer near-PC like capacity, using the latest in Intel’s early 2017 processors. Anticipation is also growing for the incoming Surface Pro 5. An upgrade to the 2015 Surface Pro 4 was expected to arrive a year after its release. Microsoft held back on upgrading the tablet in 2016. It is alleged that the company wants to take advantage of this year’s processor releases in this case too. For Microsoft Corporation, gone are the days of cramming in the world’s most favored device specs in the name of competing with top tech giants. This strategy has proven less than successful. Speaking to executives and top investors, the fail of its Lumia smartphone purchase remains a sore point for the company. But CEO Satya Nadella claims to see this loss as a learning experience. Last year, the Microsoft chief exec assured the AFR that his company has learned from the hardware mistakes of the past. “We will continue to be in the phone market,” Nadella assured, “not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.”   To see a list of high yielding CDs go here.   Nadella tells the paper that from now on, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) will be more interested in how users and company’s make use of its devices and not on what is most sellable. According to him, this alone will push the tech giant further into the every device category. The process will see Microsoft bringing unique products to the table and further its pursuit for the “ultimate mobile device” “We don’t want to be driven buy just envy of what others have,” the CEO reports. “What can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI.” Sources have been chiming in about the Surface Pro 5 as well. Online reports relay more speculation than actual facts, although credible tech sources rarely miss the mark when it comes to Microsoft’s developments. Leaks regarding the latest addition to the Surface range, the ultra-premium Surface Studio, came months ahead of the PC’s official unveiling. Better yet, the rumors building up to its launch proved right on the money. With this computer, Microsoft held nothing back. Microsoft holds nothing back. The Microsoft Surface Studio from Microsoft Corporation is only half a year into its release. Despite this, the all-in-one PC is already beating analyst projections. Microsoft’s trend-defiant approach to consumer technology is clearly paying off. It sets the U.S. software major’s products aside with distinct and alluring features that eclipse conventional hardware. The Studio should ideally be recognized in a class of its own even though this large, vibrant, touchscreen machine comes as a massive threat to the likes of the Apple iMac. The Surface Studio continues with the ideals which have pushed the Surface range to the fore. It is a powerful, Windows-based and ultra-premium machine with a 27-inch touchscreen display. Studio supports the Surface Pen and new Surface Dial as well. The display can even be leveled flat and used as a digital drafting desk. In many ways the device outperforms and outclasses its competitors, and all this was foretold long before Microsoft showcased it. Surface Pro 5 changes nothing major. We can only hope for same prediction accuracy as we indulge in talks about the Surface Pro 5. Tablet consumers anticipated for a revolutionary follow-up to the 2015 release, but now things don’t look too exciting. If online reports are anything to go by, then Pro fans can look forward to more powerful processor, more bundled packages and the adoption of more relevant ports. Reports have chimed in claiming the upcoming Surface Pro 5 will run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 635 chip. Other reports insist that Intel’s new Kaby Lake chips will be put into the device. Battery drainage is offered as the greatest reason to choose Snapdragon 635 processors over the 7th gen Intel Core chips. Although the very reason for Surface Pro series is to cram the best possible PC capacity into a tablet device. This ideally renders the Kaby Lakes as the better option. Even though both rumors are not at all far fetched, analysts seem to favor the latter chipset for the Pro 5. According to Paul Thurrot, the incoming incoming Surface won’t be much of a redesign. Thurrot is a popular and reputable conveyor of Windows-focused development. In a tweet sent out this week, he speaks of a dull revamp, or so he is told. “Surface Pro 3 will not change the Surface Connect power connector, I was just told.” he wrote via Twitter. “Kaby Lake, Nothing dramatic.” Surface Phone is a no show. In truth, excitement for the Surface Phone is dwindling. Those close Microsoft’s supply claim the device has been pushed back by at least a year. There are also news outlets reporting its arrival to be as late as 2019, triggering waves of frustration among some hopefuls and more doubt about its actual release. The smartphone market is truly immense and in this league of giants Microsoft is only a tiny player. If you are in possession of a smartphone, and who isn’t, chances are your device runs either Google’s Android or Apple iOS. Those in Eastern demographics and other developing regions could also be using Samsung’s Tizen OS or that of BlackBerry. Point is, Microsoft remains a distant runner up to all of these smartphone players. Although the Windows operating is undeniably mature and widespread, it finds very little love when translated into phones. “Seeing will be believing,” writes Ed, a reader who commented on a LearnBonds article last week. “With all MSFT’s resources I don’t know what’s taking so long. There is no better time like the present,” he stated. “And unless it will run conventional Windows software or require minimal conversion, a Surface Phone won’t succeed.” But Microsoft isn’t deterred. “What we are going to do is focus [our] effort on places that have differentiation.” Nadella reports. “If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated in Windows Phone, its manageability, its security, its Continuum capability. That is the ability to have a phone that, in fact, can even act like a PC.” Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > Reviews > Xiaomi Mi Air 13 review: A great first effort Reviews Xiaomi Mi Air 13 review: A great first effort Harish Jonnalagadda April 15, 2017April 15, 20170139 Xiaomi made its name by selling affordable mobiles that offer great value for money. But with growth slowing down in China and other markets, the manufacturer has decided to expand into a host of new categories, including home automation, smart lighting, air purifiers, home appliances, and even scooters. Another area that Xiaomi turned its attention to is the notebook segment. Although sales in this category have been falling steadily over the last decade, Xiaomi felt that there was room for one more player, which is why it rolled out the Mi Air notebook last year. The notebook is available in 12.5-inch and 13.3-inch variants and several configuration options, and I’ll be taking a look at the beefier Mi Air 13, or as it is more commonly known, Xiaomi’s answer to the MacBook Pro. Available for the equivalent of $700, the Mi Air 13 severely undercuts the MacBook Pro while offering similar hardware in a chassis that’s near-identical to its design. Here’s a look at what the Mi Air 13 can do. Specs Hardware CPU: 2.7GHz Intel Core i5-6200U, 3MB cache RAM: 8GB DDR4 2133Mhz SSD: Samsung NVMe SSD 256GB GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 940MX at 5Ghz, 1GB GDDR5 Camera: 1280×720 pixels Sound: Realtek ALC255 Speakers: Customised AKG 2x2W OS: Chinese Windows 10 Home Edition Display Type: IPS LCD Size: 13.3-inch Resolution: 1920×1080 pixels, 166 PPI Brightness: 300nits Contrast: 800:1 Connectivity WiFi: Intel dual-band 802.11ac (Intel 8260 modem) Bluetooth: v4.1 Ports: USB Type-C, two USB 3.0, HDMI, 3.5mm headphone jack Keyboard and touchpad Full-size US layout 3 nits bright backlighting Multi-touch glass touchpad Battery Capacity: 40W Density: 578Wh / L Fast charging via USB Type-C Dimensions Size: 309.6 x 210.9 x 14.8 mm Weight: 1.28 kg   Chassis   The design of the Mi Air 13 is an exercise in minimalism. There’s no branding on the cover of the notebook, and the only way you’ll realize this is a Xiaomi notebook is when you flip the lid and notice the Mi logo beneath the display. Xiaomi says that it was going after a clean look with unbroken lines at the front, and it certainly managed to achieve that. As a result, only you will be able to see the logo, whereas onlookers will wonder how you’ve managed to get rid of the logo of a certain fruit manufacturer from the front. The notebook has an abundance of aluminum, and barring the touchpad and the glass-coated front panel, the rest of the Mi Air 13 is built on a unibody aluminum frame. The design is uncannily similar to that of the MacBook Pro, and the Mi Air 13 manages to be lighter at 1.28kg as well as smaller, thinner, and not as wide. That’s an achievement in and of itself considering the notebook has the same panel size as the MacBook Pro. The diminutive form factor is achieved by eliminating bezels from around the panel. Dell used it to great effect in the XPS 13 and XPS 15, and Xiaomi used a similar technique in the Mi Air 13. While the bezels aren’t as thin as that on the XPS 13 — there’s still a noticeable border around the panel — Xiaomi maximize the screen real estate. Overall, the Mi Air 13 has excellent build quality, and the aluminum frame is durable. The material itself doesn’t feel as polished as what you get on the MacBook Pro, but that’s the only issue in an otherwise well-designed notebook. Ports Like most notebooks in this segment, the Mi Air 13 does not have a dedicated Ethernet port. What it does have is an Intel 8260 Wi-Fi ac network card, a 2×2 card that can hit a maximum throughput of 867Mbit. Xiaomi continued its utilitarian stance even when it comes to the onboard ports, and as a result you get a single USB-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, and an HDMI out along with a 3.5mm audio jack. The USB-C port is a welcome addition, and it is used to connect high-res monitors and charge the notebook. Given the increased bandwidth, you can do both with a single cable. That said, the lack of a card reader is a noticeable omission considering the segment the Mi Air 13 is targeting. Hardware The Mi Air 13 offers a 13.3-inch Full HD IPS panel sourced from Samsung. It isn’t an OLED display, but it comes close to one, as it has excellent contrast, color accuracy, and viewing angles. Xiaomi is known for offering great panels in its handsets, and the manufacturer is continuing that tradition with the Mi Air 13. While not an issue with the panel itself, the glossy coating on its surface means that reading text in outdoor conditions becomes a problem. As for the hardware itself, the Mi Air 13 offers a Skylake Intel Core i5-6200U clocked at 2.30GHz, along with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. One notable addition is a discrete GPU in the form of an NVIDIA GeForce 940MX. It isn’t quite as powerful to run the latest AAA titles at maximum settings, but it is definitely better than the integrated Intel HD 520. On the subject of gaming, the Mi Air 13 has two fans that barely bake any noise. You’ll only hear them come into play under intense workloads like gaming, and even then they do a great job of cooling the chassis. In regular use, the Mi Air 13 doesn’t heat up at all. The sound is delivered via speakers tuned by AKG, and they’re sufficiently loud and detailed. The notebooks allows for two M.2 SSDs, and one of those slots is taken up by a 256GB SSD. While there’s an option to upgrade storage, you won’t be able to switch out the memory modules as they’re soldered onto the motherboard. When it comes to real-world usage, the hardware on offer makes using the Mi Air 13 a delight. The Skylake 6200U unit along with 8GB of RAM and the Samsung-made SSD allow the notebook to breeze through most everyday tasks, and the GeForce 940MX is a welcome addition for those looking to play games on the machine. Battery like and keyboard The Mi Air 13 comes with a 40Wh battery, and while that is a long way from being the largest in this segment, Xiaomi offers fast charging, with the battery charging up to 75% of its full capacity in just 45 minutes. Given the size of the battery, the Mi Air 13 has great battery life. The notebooks lasts around six hours on average that includes a mix of web browsing, multimedia playback, and writing. As is always the case, you’ll drain the battery much faster if you’re gaming. The keyboard is easily one of the best I’ve used on a Windows notebook, and it is just as good as the one on my MacBook Pro. The keys are spaced out evenly, key travel is decent for a notebook that’s as sleek as the Mi Air 13, and the smooth texture makes it easy to use for extended durations of time. The one drawback is the backlight. Although the keyboard is backlit, there’s no way to adjust the intensity of the backlight — you can either turn it off or on with a toggle. Similarly, the touchpad is also one of the best in this segment. It is large and recognizes gestures really well, and has buttons integrated into the glass panel. Verdict Overall, the Mi Air 13 is one of the best notebooks you can buy for $700. The fact that it is limited to China is an issue when it comes to warranty, but resellers that list the notebook offer their own 12-month warranty. You can also use code GAir on GearBest to get it for $689. The notebook combines a minimalist design with great internal hardware, all backed by a vivid display and a keyboard that’s a delight to use. The Mi Air 13 comes with a Chinese version of Windows 10 by default, and you can install your own version should you have a key handy. If you want a notebook that delivers excellent value for money, get the Mi Air 13.

Last November, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stood on stage at the LA Auto Show and proclaimed, "data is the new oil." This is not a news, of course. For years, tech companies from Google to Facebook have drilled for data shared by connected devices and tapped into geysers of cash. Now that cars are becoming connected, automakers and others want in on the data-for-dollars boom. It's estimated that over 380 million connected cars will be on the road by 2021 globally, more than double the number now. The data they generate will be red meat to marketers since they'll be able to log people's location, driving habits, in-car entertainment choices, and more, while automakers and others will be able to better predict maintenance issues and provide other services to keep customers happy and loyal. The automotive industry is still in the very early stages of figuring out how to cash in on connected car data. Through several partnerships and acquisitions focused on advancing vehicle connectivity and refining data analytics, automotive mega supplier Delphi's recent moves give a glimpse of what the future of driving data collection could look like—and how automakers could turn massive amounts of car data into big bucks. Delphi recently acquired a minority stake in two Israeli companies. One, Valens, develops chips that can move data up to six times faster within vehicles than current technology. The other, Otonomo, has designed an agnostic data collection platform that can serve as a broker between automakers and third parties. These latest investments in connected car big data solutions are part of a larger and long-term strategy by Delphi. In 2015, the company purchased data-analytics start-up Control-Tec, while earlier this year it acquired Movimento, which provides over-the-air software update capabilities for automotive applications. If you put together the pieces of Delphi's acquisition strategy, it's easy to get a larger picture of where the company—and the auto industry—is headed with connected car data. Concrete Example of Leveraging Car Data The Otonomo investment, which was part of a recent $25 million funding round for the start-up, perhaps provides the most concrete example of how automakers could leverage vehicle data and what it means for car owners. Car & Driver noted in an article this week that "what makes [Otonomo's] services attractive to automakers is the ability to aggregate data from multiple companies and provide a more comprehensive data set to interested parties." While automakers such as Ford with its Ford Pass platform and GM with its OnStar AtYourService feature are currently supplying data to third parties in order to offer discounts and perks to drivers, an industrywide data-collecting platform could supercharge the commercial potential of connected cars. Companies ranging from auto insurance companies to roadside retailers would, of course, be eager to buy such connected car data. Related Who Should Control Connected Car Data? Who Should Control Connected Car Data? But car owners may not be so keen to have automakers harvest driving data, and consumer advocacy groups such as AAA as well as politicians have asked automakers for details on how they extract, process, and use driver data. As part of legislation sponsored by Senator Ed Markey (D-Mass.), the federal government would establish standards that not only safeguard driver privacy, but also force the auto industry to be more transparent about how it is used. Delphi noted to Car & Driver that data harvested by Otonomo is anonymized and drivers can opt out of receiving connected services, although the magazine added that this "doesn't mean that drivers who do use those services would have any say in what automakers do with the data those services collect." It also pointed out that since a Republican-led Congress recently voted to roll back FCC restrictions on how ISPs can sell data collected from their customers, Markey's legislation likely has the same possibility of passing as the proverbial snowball's chance in hell. You can bet that Delphi and Otonomo will be followed by other prospectors looking to strike it rich by mining vehicle data. And it's also not too farfetched that, as Otonomo CEO Ben Volkow predicted in a CNN article earlier this year, by 2020 automakers may make more money selling vehicle data than cars themselves.

John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Apr 16, 2017 at 2:06PM Throughout its history, gaming has been the heart and soul of NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). For the recently ended fiscal year 2017 in January, NVIDIA's gaming revenue increased 44% to $4 billion, or 58% of total revenue. After a more than 200% increase in calendar 2016, NVIDIA's stock has stalled as investors wait to see if competition from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices will break NVIDIA's momentum. However, there are three notable catalysts -- both short-term and long-term in nature -- that could continue driving demand for NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPU). Nintendo Switch Nintendo Switch is powered by NVIDIA. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC.  The new Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY) Switch video game console is powered by a custom NVIDIA Tegra GPU. The graphics specialist has a history of making GPUs for consoles going back to the original Microsoft Xbox in 2001. After much anticipation, Nintendo finally launched its new Switch console on March 3, 2017, and the early signs look great -- Switch is on pace to be a big hit. The Wall Street Journal recently reported in March that due to strong demand, Nintendo is ramping up production from an initial 8 million units to 16 million units for the first year. Further, a report from DFC Intelligence estimates the Switch console could sell 40 million units within its first four years on the market. This would put Switch on pace to sell about as well as Sony's PS4, which has sold more than 50 million units since its fall 2013 launch. Nintendo's production increase of Switch could translate to an additional $400 million in revenue for NVIDIA, according to an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. This implies a $50 cost per unit for the NVIDIA GPU inside each Switch console.  As if the news can't get any better, another report suggests that Switch production may move beyond 16 million to 20 million in the short term. These numbers are not surprising given Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aime's comment that Switch was setting new records for Nintendo every day in the U.S., as of mid-March 2017. Based on potential Switch sales of 40 million units, NVIDIA stands to gain as much as $2 billion in additional revenue from Switch sales over the next four years. As some analysts express concern about increasing competition from Intel and AMD, Nintendo Switch is an under-the-radar catalyst for the GPU maker that many probably didn't see coming. E-sports Looking further out, the growth of e-sports is a major opportunity for NVIDIA to expand its high-performing, GeForce GPU user base. The global audience for e-sports is estimated to be 385 million and growing. NVIDIA has its GeForce GPU brand very well entrenched with some of the biggest e-sports tournaments in the world. Currently, NVIDIA has a roughly 70% share of the discrete GPU market. E-sports is a perfect marketing opportunity for GPUs since a lot of gaming tournaments are broadcast to millions of spectators online through Amazon.com's Twitch or Alphabet's YouTube. With these streaming services, millions of e-sports fans get to witness a GeForce GPU in action in front of their eyes. No graphics maker can ask for better exposure than that. E-sports gamers are competing at the highest levels to win big cash prizes ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. To win e-sports championships, gamers need crisp, fast gameplay and the best graphics. Since NVIDIA created the first GPU in 1999, it has catered to the needs of high-end gaming enthusiasts who can't settle for anything less than top performance. NVIDIA has a long history with e-sports. In 2004, NVIDIA hosted the GeForce LAN event, which included gaming tournaments. In 2015, NVIDIA announced a partnership with the largest e-sports company in the world, ESL (originally known as Electronic Sports League). The graphics specialist has even set up an e-sports lab to work with professional gamers to better understand what e-sports players are looking for in GPU performance. The graphics company has hosted professional gaming tournaments for Activision Blizzard's Hearthstone and Starcraft 2 and is currently the official hardware platform for ESL One's Counter-Strike: Global Offensive e-sports tournament. Additionally, NVIDIA was the official graphics hardware provider for The International Dota 2 Championships for the second consecutive year in 2016. The Dota 2 tournament is one of the most popular and biggest tournaments with a cash award of $20 million in prize money, one of the biggest prize pools in e-sports -- or any sport, for that matter. Cloud gaming While e-sports is a great way to market its technology to existing PC gamers, NVIDIA needs a way of bringing new gamers into the fold. Over the long term, it's important for the installed base of PC gamers to grow, otherwise NVIDIA will find it difficult to grow its Gaming segment. NVIDIA estimates that 200 million PC gamers use its GeForce GPUs, but there are well over 1 billion PC gamers in the world, according to market researcher Newzoo. Of course, not every one of these 1 billion-plus PC gamers are interested in high-end PC gaming. Still, there are very likely plenty of gamers in this pool that NVIDIA has yet to reach, especially ones who would like to try high-end PC gaming but are not able to spend $3,000 on a state-of-the-art gaming PC. NVIDIA has been trying to reach these would-be PC gamers with its GeForce NOW subscription service. GeForce NOW is essentially a service that allows you to rent a high-end gaming PC from the cloud. After registering, gamers can play for free for eight hours on a GeForce GTX 1060 PC, or four hours on a GeForce GTX 1080 PC, all streamed from cloud servers. Additionally, gamers can pay $25 to play about twice as long on both GPUs. The cost of the service is about the same as upgrading to a new, high-end GPU every year. The main appeal of the service would be not shelling out several thousand dollars for a high-end gaming PC up front, making GeForce NOW a more economical option to get started in PC gaming. 3 sneaky ways NVIDIA can maintain its gaming dominance These partnerships with Nintendo and major e-sports tournaments will be very valuable to NVIDIA in the coming years. The company's GeForce NOW cloud gaming service will help NVIDIA with the important task of expanding the installed user base of its GPUs. In addition, Nintendo's Switch is proving to be an unexpected catalyst in 2017 and beyond. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

 Inside Mark Zuckerberg's controversial decision to turn down Yahoo's $1 billion early offer to buy Facebook Mike Hoefflinger Apr. 16, 2017, 12:00 PM 19,065 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook This is an excerpt from the book “Becoming Facebook” by Mike Hoefflinger. It’s the inside story of Facebook told by the former Head of Global Business Marketing, chronicling the 10 major decisions Facebook made that led from their disastrous stock drop in 2012 to one of the biggest companies in the world. This section comes from the chapter “How Facebook Turned Down 1 Billion”, and discusses how what made Mark Zuckerberg turn down what was ( at the time) a substantial buyout.   In the summer of 2009, Silicon Valley’s (and my) past met its (and my) future. I had worked at Intel from 1992 to 2008 and directly for former CEO Andy Grove from 1999 to 2001. In January 2009, I had moved to working at Facebook after interviewing with its business and engineering leaders as well as with Sandberg and Zuckerberg. When I had reached out to both Grove and Zuckerberg to see whether they’d be interested in connecting with each other over lunch, both agreed. We found ourselves sitting at one of the outdoor tables on the small patio behind Facebook’s eclectic building adjacent to a Palo Alto neighborhood at the top of South California Avenue. The 50-year-old landmark, affectionately known inside Facebook simply by its street number—1601—and home to the entire company for a brief period prior to the 2011 move into its much larger and ever growing campus in nearby Menlo Park, has since been leveled to make room for larger buildings, dissociating our memories of navigating privacy crises, building client relationships, achieving unprecedented growth and surviving existential competition with Google from the place where we lived them. Grove was the 72-year-old Silicon Valley legend. Cofounder, CEO and chairman of Intel, the company that more than any other gave the Valley its name and whose microprocessors were responsible for enabling personal computing and cost-effective servers and, with them, the Internet. When Silicon Valley talks about building on the shoulders of giants, it’s Grove’s shoulders we’re talking about. His passing in March 2016 was the end of a world-altering era. Zuckerberg was the 25-year-old ascendant newcomer building services at a scale and speed only possible because of Grove’s legacy. It was a meeting of the veteran who had made possible a billion connected computers and the rookie on his way to connecting the billion people on those computers. In the early stages of the conversation, the two circled slowly and respectfully in shallow waters. Grove trying to determine the legitimacy—his bar was notoriously high—of his lunch companion, something I had seen him do in dozens of one-on-one meetings a decade earlier with the likes of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Yahoo’s Jerry Yang, Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, eBay’s Meg Whitman and LoudCloud’s Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz (now better known as the venture capital firm a16z). Zuckerberg, in turn, was looking to find common ground with Grove, the statesman who had jumped off the pages of the management bible Only the Paranoid Survive—a must-read for self-respecting technology l-eaders—and who now sat in front of him. A few minutes in, Grove made his move. A direct question meant not to disrespect or trivialize but to penetrate to a more interesting place for both of them: “How did you turn down Yahoo’s $1 billion?” Yahoo's $1 Billion Thomson Reuters Grove’s question deserves a quick refresher of the circumstances to which he was referring. Much has been made of the what-could-have-been acquisition offers for Facebook in its early years. Between 2004 and 2007, a string of suitors including Friendster, Google, The Washington Post, Viacom, MySpace, News Corp, Viacom again, NBC, Viacom a third time, Yahoo, AOL, Yahoo again, Google again and Microsoft were rumored to have made acquisition overtures of one kind or another to Facebook. The most talked-about was Yahoo’s offer in June 2006, said to have initially been worth $1 billion. Venture capitalist and Facebook board member Peter Thiel, the earliest outside Facebook investor and formerly key player at PayPal, recalled the July 2006 Facebook board meeting between him, fellow venture capitalist Jim Breyer and the then 22-year-old Zuckerberg, held to discuss the 10-figure offer at a time when Facebook was barely two years old and had only eight to nine million users and $20 million in revenue:  Both Breyer and myself on balance thought we probably should take the money and run. But, Zuckerberg started the meeting like, “This is kind of a formality, just a quick board meeting, it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. We’re obviously not going to sell here.” Zuckerberg’s argument was that there were all these things we were going to build at Facebook, and he wanted to have a chance to build those products [Facebook was about to open beyond colleges and launch the News Feed]. [Yahoo] had no definite idea about the future. They did not properly value things that did not yet exist. They were, therefore, undervaluing the business. With a decade of Facebook success behind us, we can recognize Zuckerberg’s decision as prescient (judging by 2016 levels, Yahoo undervalued Facebook by more than 300 times). At the time, however, the young CEO and his board were widely questioned and publicly derided. Willpower Scott Olson / Getty Images It was that very derision that had prompted Grove to ask the question: “How did you turn down Yahoo’s $1 billion?” Even in 2009, three years after passing up the acquisition, it was still a defining—and possibly touchy—question since Zuckerberg’s decision had not yet been fully vindicated. Facebook’s valuation, which had run up to $15 billion in 2008 with Chinese investor Li Ka-Shing’s $120 million investment, had declined by as much as 80% to $3.1 billion in the lightly traded private secondary exchange earlier in 2009. Facebook had only just crossed 200 million monthly users globally and was still neck-and-neck with MySpace in the United States. Its eventual $100 billion IPO three years later was not yet a gleam in anyone’s eye. Zuckerberg recognized, however, that Grove was not asking the question in its judgmental form but rather with genuine interest in Zuckerberg’s process. He answered it in that spirit. “I just thought we could do it,” he said, referring to growing to a much larger scale and eventually becoming a successful public company with much greater valuation. While Zuckerberg’s answer may seem arrogant on paper—especially in the context of talking to someone who had done what Zuckerberg was still far from accomplishing—Grove saw there was in Zuckerberg no artifice, no arrogance and no lack of understanding of the difficulties that still lay ahead. In that answer, one visionary CEO with willpower recognized another across a chasm of nearly two generations. There was—at that moment—no difference between the two, as the torch passed viscerally from one Silicon Valley era to another. As a footnote to the moment, Zuckerberg would carry that torch forward to being named Time magazine’s Person of the Year the following year (an honor Grove had received in 1997), and by 2016, Facebook’s valuation would go on to eclipse the highest ever reached by Grove’s Intel in 2000 (not adjusting for inflation). Curious, Grove followed up: “Where does that willpower come from?” Zuckerberg considered the question—possibly for the first time—and concluded simply, “Jewish mother.” From "Becoming Facebook” by Mike Hoefflinger, Copyright © 2017 by Mike Hoefflinger.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel Cannonlake chips show up in Geekbench, Sandra benchmark results 04/12/2017 at 11:06 AM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Word on the street is that Intel’s upcoming 10nm Cannonlake processors might not ship until 2018. But it looks like someone at Intel is testing some pre-production units, because two different Cannonlake chips have shwoed up at benchmark sites recently. Geekbench shows a listing for what seems to be a low-power, entry-level Cannonlake chip, while the Sandra website has a listing for a higher-performance Cannonlake processor. You probably shouldn’t read to much into the specs shown for either chip, since there’s plenty of time for things to change before the first Cannonlake processors hit the streets. But it’s always nice to see confirmation that the next-gen architecture is ready for testing. The Geekbench listing is for a 1 GHz single-core 64-bit processor with support for hyperthreading ( so you have 1 core, but 2 threads). It also supports burst speeds up to 1.2 GHz, features 256KB of L2 cache, 4MB of L3 cache, and support for at least 8GB of DDR4 memory. The chip in the Sandra database is a 3.3 GHz dual-core processor with support for hyperthreading, 256KB of L2 cache and 4MB of L3 cache. via @rquandt, AnandTech forum, and /r/apple Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Intel Cannonlake chips show up in Geekbench, Sandra benchmark results" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest Kangal Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Microsoft’s Next Surface Book Will Be Education Focused That Runs Windows 10 Cloud: Poised To Take On Google’s ChromeBook N. GutierrezApr 16, 2017 02:19 AM EDT Facebook Linkedin Twitter Google+ Print Email (Photo : Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Microsoft's rumored new Surface device is reported to run on Windows 10 Cloud and would sport an ARM-processor. Microsoft was seen to be out powered by Google in terms of education laptop systems in the previous years. Yet, this time the company aims to create a new Microsoft Surface Book that would target education along with the rumored integration of Windows 10 Cloud. According to Digital Trends, Microsoft is planning to release an education focused Microsoft  Surface Book, especially for students. As people know Chromebook takes the lead in the category, but Microsoft was reported to take on the prime with full force and releases its rumored Windows 10 Cloud.

Windows 10 Cloud was then explained to be a system that would only allow Universal Windows Platform apps, Win32 programs, and other apps to be downloaded from the Windows store. Hence, the expected new Microsoft Surface Book was considered by some to be the perfect alternative for Chrome OS. Liliputing mentioned that as Google Chromebooks were said to be favored by students due to its security patches, the new Microsoft Surface Book which would be Cloud-based could be a formidable competitor as well. The Windows 10 Cloud system would indeed aid administrators’ total control over their student’s laptops as reported. IDC PC sales tracker, Jay Chou also added that “The saving grace for Microsoft right now is that Chromebooks are having trouble at anything outside English-speaking markets right now.” “They have good traction in the U.S. and Canada, and nothing much more beyond that,” further adding another advantage of a possible new Microsoft Surface Book over Chromebooks. Some rumors were leaked about the new Microsoft Surface Book education-focused device as well. The device was speculated to run an ARM-based processor that would lessen the cost and provide a long lasting battery. But some expect it to sports Intel’s Kaby Lake chips. Another rumor is that the device will not carry the Surface name but a ‘Cloudbook’ series instead similar to the Surface, Nexus, and Pixel series. Meanwhile, other rumors regarding Microsoft’s May 2 event aside from the new Microsoft Surface Book was shared by PC World. It was mentioned that a Surface Pro running on Intel Kaby Lake chipset is expected by tech enthusiasts. Windows 10 replacing Windows mobile was also rumored to become possible as well. Lastly, it was speculated that Microsoft might be unveiling its Cortana-powered devices along with improved features that failed during the Windows 10 Creators Update. Microsoft’s May 2 #MicrosoftEDU event in New York City was speculated to be the launch date for the new Microsoft Surface Book Windows 10 Cloud education based device. Nonetheless, any details or hints about the device weren't given by the Washington-based company.

Blacktech Week Marlon Nichols, co-founder of Cross Culture Ventures, Chris Bennett, founder of Soldsie.com and Wonderschool, and Brian Brackeen, founder of Miami-based startup Kairos, talk about startup life at a VC in Residence fireside chat at WeWork. 1 of 2 Technology April 16, 2017 8:25 PM What would a venture capitalist say about that? Startups get a chance to find out By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Access to capital is lacking — that’s a common refrain among Miami area entrepreneurs, and particularly in minority communities. So Derick Pearson and Felecia Hatcher, founders of Code Fever and Blacktech Week, thought let’s bring the venture capitalists here. At a recent conference Pearson talked Marlon Nichols, co-founder and managing partner at Cross Culture Ventures and former investment director at Intel Capital, into agreeing to be Code Fever and Blacktech Week’s first VC in Residence. The program, thought to be one of the first of its kind, will have top venture capitalists spend a month in Miami advising and guiding black, Latinx and Caribbean entrepreneurs. Nichols, who generally splits his time between offices in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, took up residence at WeWork earlier this month and has been holding office hours, fireside chats and lunch and learns that will continue throughout the month to help sharp founders think through the businesses that they are building. It wasn’t a hard sell and the arrangement is benefiting both sides of the table. “You can’t beat coming to Miami in April, but more importantly, Miami is rich in culture and our investment thesis is about understanding global culture to try to predict where consumers are going to spend their dollars,” said the Jamaican-born Nichols in an interview last week. He leads one of the relative few black-led venture capital funds in the U.S. “Black and Latinx cultures have been known for early adopters, so for understanding what is going on in those communities as well as the Caribbean community, Miami is a melting pot. For me it is a lot of learning.” The new VC in Residence program is one of a number of Code Fever initiatives, which include producing Blacktech Week and Weekend, and it recently received $1.2 million in Knight funding. Entrepreneur-in-residence programs are commonly hosted at universities and accelerators to support entrepreneurs, solve problems and help innovate. Code Fever believes that borrowing from this model and inviting VCs to spend a month in residence in communities where there’s little access to funding can help reshape the way black communities are valued in the innovation sector. It’s a big challenge. Only about 1 percent venture capital funding goes to black founders, and only 13 black women founders in the entire nation have raised a million dollars or more in venture capital. In the half-hour office hour visits so far, Nichols has met with tech startups developing products or services for student debt, media content, cloud-based secure storage, educating inmates, dentistry and others. Most of the entrepreneurs are not yet at the stage for venture capital or do not have appropriate businesses for that kind of funding, but the door is still open. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them. Marlon Nichols, Cross Culture Ventures Some were interested in advice for preparing themselves for investment, others wanted mentorship on starting up or just wanted to talk strategy. And it hasn’t been all tech — Nichols met with a cupcake entrepreneur who wanted to talk about the best way to grow her business. And when companies are ready for investment, he wants to know about them. “I think gone are the days when all investments happen in Silicon Valley. ... Amazing companies can be created any where in the world and I want to keep my finger on the pulse of that. ... The biggest thing I will get out of this is developing a network here – with entrepreneurs I will keep in touch with, with angels here and organizations. They will help be eyes and ears for great investment opportunities here.” Nichols is also holding frequent fireside chats, bringing in entrepreneurs who have experience starting and growing companies. “The best resource for new entrepreneurs is successful entrepreneurs as well as unsuccessful entrepreneurs,” he said. “There is just a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from both.” Last week, Nichols hosted entrepreneurs Brian Brackeen of Miami-based Kairos and Chris Bennett of Wonderschool and Soldsie.com for a fireside chat, dinner and networking. Bennett grew up in Miami but moved to San Francisco in 2009. While both entrepreneurs have raised millions in venture capital and angel funding and gave advice on that, they also dished on the realities of startup life — including 180-degree pivots, botched pitches with important VCs, building and overbuilding without reaching product-market fit and somehow keeping a team focused through the toughest months. We also learned that Brackeen wakes himself up at 3 a.m. because he does his best work then, but don’t bother him at 3 p.m. — that’s nap time. Bennett is a big proponent of accelerators – he participated in NewME and 500 Startups — and he said he would do another one today. He also said the benefit to Silicon Valley is there are so many entrepreneurs, engineers and investors to learn from. “Talk to as many VCs as you can, because you learn what they care about. ... The best way to get ready for talking to VCs is to join an accelerator. The next best way is to surround yourself with entrepreneurs who have been successful and learn from them,” he said. Brackeen is bullish on the 305, including on the number of angels in South Florida and the growing infrastructure such as co-working spaces and accelerators — and maybe soon, innovation districts. “You can have the same success as a San Francisco company if you find the right people, find the right lawyer, find the right investors. There is not one model for the result,” he said. See more of their conversation here.   Coming up on Tuesday is a lunch and learn with Silicon Valley startup attorney Brian Patterson and a fireside chat with Diishan Imira, CEO and co-founder of Mayvenn. Pearson and Hatcher plan to bring more VCs down. Find more information about the VC in Residence program at blacktechweek.com/funding. For his part, Nichols said he has been impressed so far with the potential of Miami. “Successful ecosystems have universities spinning out technologies and talent, investors and angel groups, accelerators and co-working spaces — and challenges unique to those communities, that is the biggest thing. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them.” Nancy Dahlberg; @ndahlberg READ MORE: Blacktech Week receives $1.2 million in Knight funding to expand entrepreneur programs LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 13 days ago Moby microbe 1:25 13 days ago Moby microbe 5:13 4 months ago Mark Cuban: AT&T, Time Warner merger needed for competition with major tech companies 0:37 7 months ago A laser-powered robot caterpillar View More Video Technology Kids prefer the TV for their viewing, but love other devices Tensions spike over N.

Finally, we have the B350 and X370 KRAIT GAMING motherboards, both of which feature white LED illumination instead of Mystic Light RGB lighting on the X370 GAMING PRO CARBON AC.

Patent Reveals a Coming AR/VR Movie Delivery System for Theaters, Home systems & Headsets Years ago the big film studios began introducing 3D experiences for movies goers and handed out 3D glasses as you entered the theater. This week Patently Apple discovered a patent filing from Warner Bros. Entertainment describing new systems that are in development that will bring movie goers Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and mixed reality films. And yes, users will be handed 3D/AR/VR headsets to watch these next-generation movies. The difference with these films will be that they're being designed to work in the theater and at home with iTunes or Netflix. So next-gen headsets are going to be needed to be able to watch this kind of content. Warner Bros. patent notes that these movies will work on headset powered either by Intel or ARM processors.   The patent filing lists HoloLens and other types of headgear already in the market that will be compatible with this future system – but this is likely where Apple will step in with an ARM system. There's no way that Apple is going to miss out on this next-wave of movies from Warner Bros. and other studios.   So even though Apple isn't mentioned in the patent by name, it's clear that this form of entertainment is going to provide some of the needed content to make new headsets popular with consumers.   Likewise, the system may work with live streaming of film and entertainment and this is where 5G networks will come into play. The new 5G networks begin rolling out sometime in late 2018. I doubt that Apple will want to late to the party and so this is something we can expect in the not-too-distant-future. This isn't going to be a project for a decade from now, but more like two or three years down the road at the latest.   After reading the Warner Bros. patent, it's clear as day that AR and VR enriched movies will play an important role in exciting the market to join this next wave of devices supporting AR and VR movies, games and live experiences.   Patent Background   "Virtual reality" is a term that has been used for various types of content that simulates immersion in a three-dimensional (3D) world, including, for example, various video game content, and animated film content. In some types of virtual reality, a user can navigate through a simulation of a 3D environment generated based on the computer model, by controlling the position and orientation of a virtual camera that defines a viewpoint for a 2D scene that is displayed on a two-dimensional display screen. A variation of these technologies is sometimes called "augmented reality." In an augmented reality setup, the display technology shows a combination of the user's surroundings that is "augmented" by one or more digital objects or overlays. Augmented reality content may be as simple as textual "heads up" information about objects or people visible around the user, or as complex as transforming the entire appearance of the user's surroundings into a fantasy environment that corresponds to the user's real surroundings.   Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have been applied to various types of immersive video stereoscopic presentation techniques including, for example, stereoscopic virtual reality headsets. Headsets and other presentation methods immerse the user in a 3D scene. Lenses in the headset enable the user to focus on a lightweight split display screen mounted in the headset only inches from the user's eyes. Different sides of the split display show right and left stereoscopic views of video content, while the user's peripheral view is blocked. In another type of headset, two separate displays are used to show different images to the user's left eye and right eye respectively. In another type of headset, the field of view of the display encompasses the full field of view of eye including the peripheral view. In another type of headset, an image is projected on the user's retina using controllable small lasers, mirrors or lenses. Either way, the headset enables the user to experience the displayed virtual reality content more as if the viewer were immersed in a real scene. In the case of augmented reality (AR) content, the viewer may experience the augmented content as if it were a part of, or placed in, an augmented real scene.   These immersive effects may be provided or enhanced by motion sensors in the headset that detect motion of the user's head, and adjust the video display(s) accordingly. By turning his head to the side, the user can see the virtual reality scene off to the side; by turning his head up or down, the user can look up or down in the virtual reality scene. The headset may also include tracking sensors that detect position of the user's head and/or body, and adjust the video display(s) accordingly. By leaning or turning, the user can see the virtual reality scene from a different point of view. This responsiveness to head movement, head position and body position greatly enhances the immersive effect achievable by the headset. The user may be provided the impression of being placed inside or "immersed" in the virtual reality scene. As used herein, "immersive" generally encompasses both VR and AR.   Immersive headsets and other wearable immersive output devices are especially useful for game play of various types, which involve user exploration of a modelled environment generated by a rendering engine as the user controls one or more virtual camera(s) using head movement, the position or orientation of the user's body, head, eye, hands, fingers, feet, or other body parts, and/or other inputs.   To provide an immersive experience, the user needs to perceive a freedom of movement that is in some way analogous to human visual perception when interacting with reality. Content produced for VR can provide this experience using techniques for real-time rendering that have been developed for various types of video games. The content may be designed as a three-dimensional computer model with defined boundaries and rules for rendering as video output. This content can be enhanced by stereoscopic techniques to provide stereoscopic output, sometime referred to as "3D," and associated with a VR application that manages the rendering process in response to movement of the VR headset, to produce a resulting VR experience. The user experience is very much like being placed inside a rendered video game.   In other types of VR and AR, the simulated 3D environment may be used primarily to tell a story, more like traditional theater or cinema. In this type of VR or AR, the added visual effects may enhance the depth and richness of the story's narrative elements or special effects, without giving the user full control (or any control) over the narrative itself.   However, the technology for experiencing anything similar to cinematic content delivered using VR or AR equipment or methods is in a very early stage of development. Actual implementations of technology are quite limited, and users have thus far been largely or completely untouched by VR or AR in their experience of narrative content.   It would be desirable, therefore, to develop new methods and other new technologies for mastering cinematic content for VR and AR use, that overcome these and other limitations of the prior art and enhance the appeal and enjoyment of narrative content for new immersive technologies such as VR and AR.   Warner Bros. Entertainment Solution   The invention by Warner Bros. Entertainment relates to the production, configuration, and providing, by a computer, of digital data for virtual reality or augmented reality output.   In one aspect of the invention, a computer-implemented method includes communicating, by a cinematic data distribution server over a wireless network, with multiple immersive output devices each configured for providing one of an augmented reality (AR) output or a virtual reality (VR) output based on a data signal, wherein each of the multiple immersive output devices is present within eyesight of a display screen.   For example, the multiple immersive output devices may be worn by moviegoers or home theater users. The method may include configuring the data signal based on digital cinematic master data that includes at least one of VR data or AR data. The method may include transmitting the data signal to the multiple immersive output devices contemporaneously, such that each of the users receives and processes the data and shares a contemporaneous immersive video experience.   In another aspect, the method may include outputting an image based on a video data portion of the digital cinematic master data on the display screen, contemporaneously with the transmitting. The users may thereby enjoy an AR experience in addition to the video on the screen, or if using fully VR equipment that obscures the screen, may enjoy a cinematic presentation that both supplements and duplicates the presentation on the screen.   For serving AR immersive output devices, configuring the data signal may include encoding the AR data for augmenting video data for output on the display screen, and including the AR data with the video data in the data signal.   The AR data may be configured to provide various effects. In an aspect, the AR data, when received by the multiple immersive output devices, continuously extends images on the display screen to areas beyond an outer limit of the display screen, for each person viewing AR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices.   For example, a person wearing an AR immersive output device may see elements of the scene that extend upwards, downwards, or sideways beyond the frame.   In another, alternative aspect, the AR data, when received by the multiple immersive output devices causes images that do not appear on the display screen to appear in a non-screen display volume to each person viewing AR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices.   For example, the non-screen object may be caused to appear in front of, above, or below the display screen, or even behind the viewer. These effects may similarly be provided by configuring VR data for a VR output device.   The data signal may be configured to provide each user with an "objective" experience, a "subjective" experience, or a mixture of objective and subjective experiences.   To provide a subjective experience, the cinematic data distribution server configures the data signal such that the images that do not appear on the display screen (i.e., the images that are visible only using an AR or VR output device) appear in a coordinate system defined relative to the each person viewing AR or VR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices.   To provide an objective experience, the cinematic data distribution server configures the data signal such that the images that do not appear on the display screen appear in the same coordinate system defined relative to the display screen, or in other words, a coordinate system that is relative to the cinema or home theater and the same for all immersive output devices.   To provide a mixed experience the cinematic data distribution server configures the data signal such that at least one visible object is defined individually relative to each person's subjective coordinate system, while at least one other object is defined in the common coordinate system and is the same for all viewers.   In another aspect, a user may be able to interact with objects depicted in AR or VR output. Accordingly, the method may include providing in the AR data or VR data code enabling each person viewing AR output on one of the multiple immersive output devices to interact with at least one of the images, causing the AR output or VR output to change.   In a related aspect, the method may include changing video output shown on the display screen based on the each person's interaction with at least one of the images. For example, different versions of a scene may be provided in stored cinematic data, and the version selected at runtime may be selected based on an aggregate of feedback from the different users.     Warner Bros. Entertainment patent FIG. 4 above illustrates a concept diagram illustrating elements of a system for outputting immersive content to multiple users in a cinema or home theater setting; FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram illustrating components of a stereoscopic display device for providing an immersive VR experience.   Patent FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating components of, and concepts concerning, a cinema or home theater space for multi-user VR or AR; FIG. 8A is a flow chart illustrating elements of serving VR or AR data to an AR or VR output device providing a cinema experience.   In another area of the patent filing, Warner Bros. explains that several viewers of a home theater or cinema presentation may be equipped with the content consumption devices. The apparatus may include, for example, a processor based on Intel's architecture a system-on-a-chip designed by ARM, or any other suitable microprocessor.   The processor may be communicatively coupled to auxiliary devices or modules of the 3D environment apparatus using a bus or other coupling. Optionally, the processor and some or all of its coupled auxiliary devices or modules may be housed within or coupled to a housing having a form factor of a personal computer, gaming console, smartphone, tablet, laptop computer, set-top box, wearable googles, glasses, or visors, or other form factors.   A user interface device may be coupled to the processor for providing user control input to an immersive content display process operated by a VR or AR immersive display engine executing on the processor.   User control input may include, for example, selections from a graphical user interface or other input (e.g., textual or directional commands) generated via a touch screen, keyboard, pointing device (e.g., game controller), microphone, motion sensor, camera, or some combination of these or other input devices.   Control input may also be provided via a sensor coupled to the processor. A sensor may comprise, for example, a motion sensor (e.g., an accelerometer), a position sensor, a temperature sensor, a location sensor (for example, a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and controller), an eye-tracking sensor, or a microphone. The sensor may detect a motion or other state of a user interface display, for example, motion of a virtual-reality headset, or the bodily state of the user, for example, skin temperature or pulse.   The device may optionally include an input/output port coupled to the processor 202, to enable communication between a VR/AR engine and a computer network, for example a cinema content server or home theater server.   Such communication may be used, for example, to enable multiplayer VR or AR experiences, including but not limited to shared immersive experiencing of cinematic content. The system may also be used for non-cinematic multi-user applications, for example social networking, group entertainment experiences, instructional environments, video gaming, and so forth.   While many forms of devices are covered, they note specifically "In a fourth type of device, a laser projector or projector mounted to the user's head and directed to the user's eyes projects images directly on the user's eyes, making the retinas the only screen on which the augmented content is displayed.   Examples of devices for immersive and non-immersive AR output include Microsoft's HoloLens; Google Glass by Google; Digital Lightfield by Magic Leap; Space Glasses by Meta Company; and castAR glasses by of castAR.   Patent FIG. 1 noted above is a schematic block diagram illustrating aspects of a system and apparatus for the production and configuration of digital data for virtual reality or augmented reality output coupled to a distribution system; FIG. 13 is one of many flowcharts associated with the AR/VR System for Cinemas and Home Theaters.   Warner Bros. Entertainment's patent application was filed back in Q4 2016 and published this week by the U.S. Patent Office..

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Your Nvidia Titan Xp has little to fear Home Hardware What Xbox ‘Project Scorpio’ means for PC gaming By Jeremy Laird on April 13th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Microsoft has dished the deets on its upcoming ‘Scorpio’ hardware update for the Xbox console, and in what amounts to uncharacteristic detail and candour given the ruddy thing isn’t going on sale until the end of 2017. But what are we poor PC peasants to make of the Beast of Redmond’s latest game box and its towering on-paper capabilities? In short, what influence will Project Scorpio’s trick new hardware have on future PC games? As ever with such developments, there is no single and simple answer. Scorpio’s hardware is at the very least a tale of two halves even if they are crammed into a single computer chip or SoC. I speak, of course, of the critical CPU and graphics elements. The media razzmatazz has largely centred on the graphics half of the equation and there’s no denying Scorpio packs some serious pixel-pumping power for a grotty little games console. The headline figures for the GPU rock in at 40 so-called compute units running at 1,172MHz. That compares with ye olde Xbox One’s 12 units at 853MHz and the One S with the same number again, albeit running at 914MHz. It’s AMD, of course, who supplies both the graphics and the CPU designs for the Xbox and, in the Red Team’s standard parlance, a compute unit packs 64 of those, er, shader thingies that make the pixels look so very pretty. We’re talking 768 shaders in the Xbox One and 2,560 of the bump-mapping blighters in Scorpio. If that sounds impressive, AMD’s current fastest GPU, the elderly Radeon R9 Fury X packs 4,096 shaders. And lest you forget, the Fury X is a generation behind and not nearly as fast as Nvidia’s best GPU du jour, the preposterous Titan Xp. On the CPU side of the Scorpio equation, Microsoft has stuck with eight low-power AMD Jaguar-derived cores, albeit running upclocked from 1.75GHz to 2.3Ghz and benefiting from several detail tweaks. The other major part of the package involves the memory and bandwidth combo, which in these consoles is a little more complex given the single-chip architecture means shared memory for GPU and CPU. Anyway, there’s a healthy uptick here too, from 218GB/s and 8GB to 326GB/s and 12GB. The very first observation to make is that while Scorpio moves the game on massively for consoles, it is not exactly frightening today’s high-end PC hardware, much less what will be available when Scorpio actually arrives and, in turn, the PC hardware that will appear over Scorpio’s lifetime. For some perspective, consider that main Scorpio CPU-GPU-SoC thing as a whole clocks in at seven billion transistors. That’s for everything – the CPU, the graphics, the other SoC gubbins, the lot. Nvidia’s biggest GPU, as found in the silly new Titan Xp and indeed the slightly more sensible 1080Ti, packs no fewer than 12 billion transistors. Add billions more for Intel’s finest CPU and a bleeding edge PC’s CPU and GPU alone are more than twice as complex. Even the next tier down in Nvidia’s GPU range, the GTX 1070 and the vanilla GTX 1080 are alone about on a par for complexity with the unified Scorpio chip. So while consoles tend to do more with less, there’s a limit to that philosophy. The PC’s performance and fidelity advantage isn’t being challenged. That’s especially true when it comes to the CPU side of things. Put simply, Scorpio’s CPU cores continue to suck. A fair bit of Microsoft guff has been regurgitated by the tame media regarding Scorpio’s modified cores, the reduced internal latency, 31 per cent faster core clocks, how the new SoC is more customised than before. But I’m not terribly impressed. Clearly, they’re still mostly the the same crappy low-power cores as before, not proper desktop cores. Ermegerd, is that a magnetic hard drive? Put another way, remember what a kicking AMD got for the poor performance of its outgoing FX PC processor? Well, it’s a hell of a lot better than the CPU in any Xbox, including Scorpio. Even AMD’s new Ryzen CPU has been taking a bit of a beating for supposed iffy gaming performance. It would completely obliterate the feeble cores in Scorpio. That’s the disappointing bit, then: That the initial development target for a lot of games for several years to come will still be a system with pretty pathetic CPU cores. The rub here is that while it’s relatively straightforward to add at least some graphical detail to a game when porting for the PC (just chucking in some high res textures can do a power of good for the look of a game), taking advantage of additional PC processor power tends to require a more fundamental rethink of the game engine and indeed the game itself. Which, let’s be honest, isn’t usually going to happen. The exception to all this and what might – just might – prove a saving grace, is the new so-called GPU Command Processor in Scorpio. It’s basically a section of dedicated circuitry on the main SoC design to run DirectX 12 API invocations. In English? Think of it as a DX12 hardware accelerator for some of the more CPU-intensive bits of the game engine like draw calls. It could be a game changer by freeing up even Scorpio’s weak CPU cores to do interesting and innovative things. But it’s far too early to say for sure. If that’s the bad and yet-to-be-proven news, the good is that Scorpio’s focus on pukka 4K capability means that developers will put a lot of effort into making games look great at high resolutions. To pinch a quote from Kevin Gammill, Group Program Director of the Xbox Core platform, “it’s about delivering those pixels with 4K assets, so they look great. It’s about delivering those pixels with HDR and wide colour gamut fidelity. It’s about delivering those pixels with no loss of frame-rate compared to the 1080p version of that title – that’s super-important to us.” In other words, proper high-res textures, geometry and effects that on the one hand really make the most of the detail 4K can deliver and on the other are optimised to reduce performance overheads. And, of course, Scorpio should accelerate the development of games with proper HDR support, which is just another string in developer’s bows when it comes to making games look awesome. Of course, you very likely don’t have a 4K PC screen and you almost certainly don’t have an HDR monitor. But all that should still benefit PC-relevant resolutions like 2,560 by 1,440, otherwise known as 1440p, that sit in between full 4K and 1080p. One part of the Scorpio graphical package for which the benefits to the PC remain to be seen involves tweaks to the graphics engine that go beyond simply adding more functional units. Apparently, Microsoft and presumably AMD took a good look at how developers actually make game engines and then tweaked detailed aspects of the graphics architecture to suit. That’s not going to help existing PC graphics cards. But will we see any of those same hardware tweaks in AMD’s new Vega GPUs, due later this year? My guess is that we may see some similar elements, but probably not everything. So the benefit-cost calculation for the PC in that regard remains to be seen. Overall, Scorpio looks like it’ll be a great thing for PC gaming in terms of plain old eye candy. Whether it will enable more innovation and complexity at the core of game engines is a tougher question and will likely depend on how that funky hardware DX12 setup engine in the Scorpio SoC pans out.

When all you can do is slightly upgrade the power and add useless features like social media, you prove there is no next gen. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:38 particlese says: They’re supposedly also stuffing all the Freesync 2 stuff into the thinger, which should mean low-faff HDR/high-bpp/wide-gamut capabilities will (hopefully) catch on sooner than if it were just AMD pleading with display companies to make things lovelier for us. It’ll spread the joy of non-proprietary variable refresh rate around a bit more, too, although I haven’t myself found that to be the revelatory feature some profess it to be. On the minus side, that’ll all supposedly be implemented exclusively via HDMI, so they’re missing the opportunity to encourage display manufacturers to bung our lovely royalty-free display port into their super-sized photon launchers. Not that it makes a ton of difference in practice, but HDMI is the only display interface which has ever caused me problems, and it did so for a while in various ways, so I tend to be a jerk to it when the opportunity presents itself. So basically, I’d love to someday see a 50″+ screen with Display Port, high (120Hz+) refresh rates which aren’t just marketing “features”, and user-friendly HDR/bpp/gamutStuff; and this newfangled thinger looks to be encouraging much of that. Hooray! Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:47 The Almighty Moo says: Any thoughts on it’s out of he box support for the new FreeSync and HDMI standards Jeremy? I know you covered the standards themselves in a previous article, but I’d be interested to know your thoughts on the effects of this support on the PC / Monitor market. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:46 Jeremy Laird says: Good question. First part of the answer would involve the extent to which games use monitors on consoles. I don’t know the answer to that, but my hunch is the heavy majority of consoles are hooked up to TVs. That said, I happen to know from some corporate work I did recently that at least some monitor makers are very keen to sell screens to console gamers. So, I’d expect at least some to try to crack the market by offering a ‘full’ console experience. Whether TVs will fully support it all is a separate question. Do TV makers engineer for console specifically? Honestly, I don’t know. My knowledge of that aspect of the TV market is pretty thin. That said, HDR is quickly becoming the norm as is HDMI 2.0. My experience recently with an HDR TV is that everything works much more seamlessly than before. Hooking a modern PC up to a 4K TV is a non issue in terms of the res, if not perhaps HDR functionality, for now. That said, I think that most of the features of Freesync 2 if not necessarily Freesync 2 itself along with higher bandwidth interfaces are going to become pretty common. Things have been developing pretty fast in the last couple of years and I don’t see that stopping. Displays just keep getting better. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 14:17 funkstar says: Don’t TVs have to support variable refresh rate if they want to be HDMI 2.1 compliant? According to DigitalFoundry, Scorpio supports *both* Freesync AND the new HDMI VRR standard, so TV manufacturers should be covered Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:10 SquarePeg says: The reason for Jaguar cores in the Xbox Scorpio is backward compatibility. All Xbox and PS4 games till now are built from the ground up for the Jaguar CPU architecture. They wouldn’t run on Ryzen’s “Zen” architecture without an update for every current gen game ever made.

Ryzen is in effect a superset of Jaguar in terms of the instruction set. So basically, no. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 10:33 Sakkura says: There could perhaps be some very low-level optimizations, like accounting for the timing of how many cycles the architecture will spend on different instructions and structuring the code to take optimal advantage of that… but who would even give a crap about losing such optimization advantages if you were moving from Jaguar to Zen? The latter can easily overcome that deficit, and more to boot. So you’re right. It’s about cost and cooling. Zen is still new stuff, and AMD knows it’s finally got a CPU architecture people will actually pay for. So the price tag would be higher. And while Zen is surprisingly efficient, it’s still a high-power/high-performance architecture optimized for running at higher clocks.

It’s about delivering those pixels with no loss of frame-rate compared to the 1080p version of that title – that’s super-important to us.” It’s odd, how they expect to get more than 4 times more work out of less than 4 times the computational power. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 10:47 Asurmen says: Well, Scorpio does have more than four times the power? Also capability is more than just tflops. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 13:07 Don Reba says: Ah, yes, you’re right, I did the math and it is indeed a bit more than 4x rendering power. And when you increase the number of pixels by 4, you pretty much just need 4 times the rendering power. Geometry and fragment shaders don’t take up a large proportion of the computation budget. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 13:59 Sakkura says: On the other hand, the Xbox One usually doesn’t render at 1080p anyway. It’s typically 1600×900 or 1280×720 that then gets upscaled to 1080p. So if we say the Xbox One is capable of 1600×900, and Scorpio is capable of 5 times that much, that’s still a little short of 3840×2160. I suspect we’ll be seeing a lot of games rendering at 2560×1440 and upscaling to 4K. Maybe even 1080p upscaled as well. That will still look very nice on a TV, much better than 720p or 900p upscaled to 1080p. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 14:41 funkstar says: According to DF (going by MS reports) performance testing indicates that all 900p and above titles should hit 4k at the same framerates 14/04/2017 at 16:35 Kinsky says: The Xbox One is barely capable of 1080p and forces developers to employ shortcuts galore to achieve even 900p in some cases, such as using uncompressed video/audio files to reduce CPU load, lower texture resolution, lower poly models, and noisy postprocessing effects like bloom and motion blur to cover up the ugly. Scorpio is setting 4K as its target, but seems barely capable of that as well. This likely means we can continue to expect multi-platform releases and ports (i.e. Battlefield) to have ridiculously bloated installation sizes, poor texture resolution, an over-reliance on postprocessing effects, all that sort of thing. But hey, at least they can put a cool-looking bullet point on the console’s features page. 16/04/2017 at 16:51 fish99 says: Given that most xbone games are 30 fps and Microsoft have said they’re targetting 4K 60fps for the Scorpio, they need more than 4x the performance. And as pointed out above a lot of xbone games don’t even run 1080p. Of course the reality is Microsoft can’t force developers to target 60fps, and most of them would prefer to make the game look better at 30fps since they think it sells better in console land (i.e. the bulk of console games want shiny over smooth). Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 06:32 ElementalAlchemist says: Anyone expecting Scorpio to suddenly change things for PC needs to reign in their expectations. This is not a new generation of consoles, it’s not an Xbox 4, in the same way a PS4 Pro is not a PS5. The baseline/lowest common denominator for game development (excluding the Switch) is still the original Xbone. Games are still going to be developed first and foremost to run on that and the original PS4. All Scorpio will do is (notionally) provide some higher framerates and resolutions (and the jury is out on just how well it will actually perform in practice). So nothing will change for PC going forward in the short to medium turn. We’ll still get the same poorly optimised ports that, on a design basis, are hamstrung by the hardware limitations of the Xbone. Log in to Reply 15/04/2017 at 14:18 scritty says: While games still have to work on the Xbone, all the extra graphical fluff in the world is not going to make these new iterations world beaters. Also CPU speed is vital for many genres of games. Not FPS and 3rd person action games so much, but games where many AI agents are used (like RTS games, 4X games and most strategy games) being hamstrung with an old – if up clocked Jaguar CPU means these consoles will lag a long way behind even a low end PC in all those genres. But all I see on consoles is one 1st person shooter and 3rd person action game and the odd annual updated sports franchise after another, and I guess if that’s all you ever want to play… more power to you. They offer good value. I don’t play games like those though so consoles offer no value for me at all. The day Dwarf Fortress comes out on console and allows me to have over 2000 dorfs and other AI entities in play at one time with no lag? Is the day I consider buying one.

But screw that: let’s go ahead and over promise on the next lot. Result? This’ll be another load of lower resolution upscaled titles at 30fps. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 04.16.17. 04.16.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am A Chip Revolution Will Bring Better VR Sooner Than You Think Getty Images David Kosslyn and Ian Thompson are the founders of a virtual reality company called Angle Technologies. Two years into this stealth project, backed by $8 million in funding, they won’t say much about the virtual world they’re building—at least not publicly. But they will say that they’re building it in a way that alters the relationship between computer hardware and software. When a PC or a game console runs this virtual world, the GPU chips play an unexpectedly large role, taking so much of the burden off the main processor. GPU is short for graphics processing unit. These chips were originally designed as a better way of rendering graphics for games and other software. And they still play this all-important role for the virtual world under development at Angle. But that’s not all. Kosslyn and Thompson are shifting countless other tasks onto these chips, just because GPUs are so good at running so many calculations in parallel. A single machine can hold hundreds of GPU chips, and each chip can operate largely on its own. Juggling hundreds of digital tasks at the same time, Kosslyn and Thompson say, these chips can get you far closer to the illusion that you’re standing in an alternate universe. Related Video How a Chip Is Made When they first started building their virtual world, Kosslyn and Thompson pushed most of those tasks through the CPU, a computer’s main processor. But that just didn’t work. As Kosslyn explains, they used the CPU to create new objects as you moved through this world—trees, bushes, rocks, and whatever else they needed to mimic reality. Loading each object into the chip took about one-fifth of a millisecond—far too long, considering just how many objects they needed to load. “If you scale that up to 10 million objects, you’re suddenly crushed by the order of magnitude. Just loading the world is incredibly slow,” Kosslyn says. “We thought: ‘Man, if only we had a parallel way of doing all these pretty much independent operations really quickly.’ And, well, that’s exactly what the GPU is really good at.” Their approach is part of a much wider shift across the world of hardware and software. For decades, the processing power available from individual computer chips increased every 18 months or so, according to the oft-quoted Moore’s Law. But in recent years, this trend has begun to slow, even as modern software applications demanded far more processing power than ever before. “Some people call it the end of Moore’s Law,” says Google chip engineer Norm Jouppi. “I like to call it the retirement of Moore’s Law, because it’s not totally dead yet but it’s definitely not working as hard.” The result: Companies and coders are now moving workloads off the main CPU and onto a wide range of alternative processors. If they can’t get enough processing power from a single chip, they need many. These changes have already pushed through the massive data centers that underpin the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. Because their sweeping online services can no longer handle all tasks on CPUs alone, these companies are moving major processing loads onto GPUs, programmable chips called FPGAs, and even custom-built chips, such as the AI processor that Jouppi helped design at Google. Neural networks and other forms of AI are often the driving forces behind this shift. Related Stories Paul Sarconi Intel’s Got a Plan to Dominate VR. First Stop? March Madness Cade Metz Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers Klint Finley Intel’s 15 Billion Reasons Why an AI Chip Revolution Has Arrived The shift is so big, it’s sending ripples across the worldwide chip market. The fortunes of nvidia, the world’s largest GPU marker, are on the upswing. And Intel, which isn’t a big player in GPUs, has spent billions acquiring companies that make FPGAs and various AI chips. Now, as Kosslyn and Thompson show, the trend is also moving to the other end of the internet, pushing onto PCs and game consoles. Neural networks are helping to drive the change here as well, but in the long run, VR may be the bigger driving force. With virtual reality, so much of the processing must happen on the client, not in the data center. VR must operate in real-time. It can’t spare the added milliseconds needed to send its calculations over the wire. That spoils the effect. And by the same token, it can’t spare the added milliseconds needed to shove all calculations through the client’s main processor. “There are tasks that are completely intractable on the CPU,” Kosslyn says. For their virtual world, Kosslyn and Thompson are working to leverage all the extra GPU processing power available on high-end PCs and game consoles. “We’re mostly trying to fill in those few milliseconds when GPUs can do work besides rendering graphics,” Thompson says. But in the long run, as virtual worlds become more popular—and even more complex—this could push hardware sellers to pack even more GPU power into PCs and consoles. Device makers may also push GPUs or other alternative chips into the VR headsets, so that they can operate without help from PCs and consolers. And the trend could reach smartphones, which are often used in lieu of dedicated headsets. Zvi Greenstein, general manager for consumer VR at nVidia, says the company views virtual reality as an enormous market opportunity. Kosslyn and Thompson warn that the tools for building code that runs on GPUs is still a little rough around the edges, but companies like nVidia are working to change that. Related Video Google’s Daydream View Is a VR Eye Pillow Frank Soqui, the general manager of Intel’s virtual reality and gaming group, questions how many VR developers will really transfer workloads onto GPUs. But keep in mind that GPUs are mostly the domain of nVidia, one of Intel’s primary competitors. Nonetheless, Soqui does believe that the market will continue to shift towards alternative processors. Intel recently acquired a startup called Movidius, which makes specialized chips for devices that can sense the world around them—gizmos like robots and driverless cars. But Soqui says Movidius chips can also help VR headsets process what’s happening in the real world, such as in where you head in pointing. Meanwhile, Microsoft has already build a specialized processor for its Hololens augmented reality headset to help the device keep track of your movements, among other things. In the end, this is yet another example of computing tasks shiftings off the CPU and onto something else. The upshot? Developers like Kosslyn and Thompson must think very differently about how these build their software. But that’s just one consequence of this change. It also means yet another shift in the global chip market, even further towards GPUs and other alternative processors. And, most notably, it means that virtual reality will evolve very differently than it would if coders kept most tasks on the CPU. VR will get much better, much faster. Go Back to Top.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement AMD Ryzen 5 desktop chips are now available for $170 and up 04/11/2017 at 10:04 AM by Brad Linder 3 Comments As promised, AMD’s new Ryzen 5 chips for desktops are now available for purchase. Prices start at about $170 for a Ryzen 5 1400 quad-core processor, but things really start to get interesting when you spend a little more money. For $250 you can pick up a Ryzen 5 1600X hexa-core chip with hyperthreading, which means you get 12 threads with top clock speeds of 4 GHz for roughly the same price as an Intel Core i5 quad-core (and quad-thread) chip. As AnandTech points out in a Ryzen 5X/Intel Core i5-7600K review and comparison, Intel’s chips have a lead in single-core performance, but you get 200 percent more threads with the Ryzen chip, which makes AMD’s new processors pretty competitive for certain applications. What’s also noteworthy is that the Ryzen 5 chips are the second set of processors based on AMD’s new Zen architecture, and they share a lot of DNA with the pricier/more powerful Ryzen 7 chips that launched earlier this year. Among other things, every Ryzen chip is “unlocked,” which means there’s nothing stopping an enthusiast from trying to overclock a Ryzen 5 chip in order to get Ryzen 7-like performance. Even more affordable Ryzen 3 processors are coming soon, and later this year we should start to see the first Ryzen chips designed for notebooks and other computers where 65 watt or 95 watt processors might not be viable options.

For years, if you had the Core i5-2500k (32nm) you could Overclock that thing 4.5GHz and pair it with the fastest GPU’s for a high-end rig. There haven’t been bottlenecks ever since these latest titles and latest GPUs. And if you were on the same platform (1155), you could make the upgrade to the Core i7-3770k (22nm) and overclock that to 4.5GHz as well, giving you extra Single-Core Performance and Extra (hyper) Threads, whilst being cooler as well, to manage newer titles and GPUs better. Then the 4th-gen 22nm Core i5’s (4670k and 4690k) and Core i7’s (4770k and 4790k) arrived with little gains. But the 6th-gen 14nm did bring some nice improvements. Especially in the form of the Core i5-6500, which was now fast enough to run most games and most gpu’s without bottlenecking. All in budget! The Core i5-6600k was a slight improvement and… Read more » Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 17 hours 40 minutes ago Latest News Pipo launches X11 touchscreen mini PC and X10 with pen support Pipo's been selling a line of weird mini-desktop computers featuring built-in … [Read More...] Onyx Boox Typewriter is an E Ink 2-in-1 laptop As expected, Onyx is showing off several new products at the Hong Kong Global … [Read More...] HP is building Rockchip & Android laptop (or maybe a Chromebook) Most of HP's current laptops, tablets, and even smartphones run Windows … [Read More...] Deals Deals of the Day (4-14-2017) A Google Home smart speaker normally sells for $129, making it cheaper than an … [Read More...] Featured articles Onyx Boox Typewriter is an E Ink 2-in-1 laptop As expected, Onyx is showing off several new products at the Hong Kong Global … [Read More...] What’s new in Android O?

Freedman | April 14, 2017 MORE $1799 from Amazon Editors' rating: The Pros Colorful screen; Fast SSD; Comfortable, RGB-backlit keyboard The Cons Screen dimmer than average; Short battery life; Verdict The MSI WE72 7RJ is a powerful workstation with a speedy SSD and comfortable keyboard, but its battery life is paltry and the screen could be brighter. Review The MSI WE72 7RJ is like a mullet -- business in the front, party in the back. While the $1,799, 17-inch workstation is unassuming when it's closed, it has a comfortable, customizable RGB keyboard and a screen with vivid colors that will make photos and videos shine. Mix that with a blazing-fast SSD, and this workstation is prepared for both work and a little bit of play. However, with the MSI WE72 7RJ's short battery life, you'll want to make sure you always take a power brick along for the ride. article continued below Design: Straight Off the Batmobile From afar, the WE72 looks like most other workstations: black and blocky. But there are a few details that I really appreciate: Its subtle, silver logo is placed above the Workstation logo, and the black aluminum lid has a few small, symmetrical bumps -- it looks like the hood on the Batmobile. When I lifted the lid, I was greeted by the thick-bezeled, 17.3-inch 1080p display and an island-style keyboard with RGB backlighting. At 6.2 pounds and 16.5 x 11.3 x 1.2 inches, the WE72 has a larger footprint than competing workstations, but it's not the heaviest. That honor goes to the Lenovo ThinkPad P70, at a backbreaking 7.6 pounds. The Dell Precision 5520 (4.4 pounds, 14.1 x 9.3 x 0.4 inches) and HP ZBook Studio G3 (4.6 pounds, 14.8 x 10 x 0.7 inches) are on the smaller side, but they also have 15-inch displays. As one would expect from a workstation, the WE72 has a ton of ports. On the left side are the Kensington lock slot, Ethernet jack, a pair of USB 3.0 ports (HDMI out, Mini DisplayPort, USB Type-C), and separate jacks for headphones and a microphone. On the right are a disc drive, USB 2.0 port and an SD card slot. Display: Colorful, But Not Bright Enough The colors on the WE72's display are rich and vivid, but I wished I could turn the display brightness higher. When I watched the trailer for Thor: Ragnarok, red face paint stood out against actor Chris Hemsworth's skin, and the Hulk was the perfect shade of forest-green. The WE72 covers an astonishing 196 percent of the sRGB color gamut (100 percent is excellent), handily beating the desktop-replacement average (120 percent), Precision (113 percent), ThinkPad P70 (158 percent) and ZBook Studio (169 percent). MORE: Best Laptops Those colors aren't just vivid; they're accurate, too. The WE72's Delta-E score is just 0.4 (0 is ideal), which is lower than the average (1.3), ZBook Studio (2.4), Precision (1.5) and ThinkPad P70 (0.7). Unfortunately, the WE72's panel is dimmer than the average (293 nits), measuring just 200 nits. The ZBook Studio (241 nits) and ThinkPad P70 (277 nits) also missed the mark, but they're  brighter than MSI's machine. The 335-nit display on the Precision was way more luminous than the competition's. Keyboard and Touchpad Typing on the SteelSeries keyboard on the WE72 is an absolute pleasure. Its 1.4 millimeters of travel doesn't feel shallow, and the 71 grams of actuation force (55 to 60 is typical) gives it a punchy, responsive feel. On the 10fastfingers.com typing test, I zipped along at 117 words per minute with an error rate of less than 1 percent (my usual max is 115 wpm with a 2 percent error rate). The touchpad, though, is merely serviceable. At 4.2 x 1.8 inches, there's plenty of room for navigating, and the Synaptics drivers support basic gestures like pinch-to-zoom and two-finger scrolling, but don't work with more complex Windows 10 gestures like tapping four fingers to open the Action center. Audio: Loud and Proud When you're done using the WE72 for work, you can use it as a stereo. This thing gets nice and loud. When I listened to Blue October's "You Make Me Smile," it instantly filled the space in one of our test areas, and the drums, guitars, bass and vocals were well-balanced. Just don't turn the volume all the way up, or it gets a little whiny. Performance The MSI WE72 will blast through everyday tasks, thanks to its 2.8-GHz Intel Core i7-7700HQ CPU, 32GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD and an Nvidia Quadro M2200 GPU with 4GB of VRAM. I had 40 tabs open in Chrome, one of which was streaming a 1080p episode of "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah," and there wasn't even a hiccup. On the Geekbench 4 overall performance test, the WE72 achieved a score of 14,400, beating the desktop-replacement average (13,193) but falling behind the Precision (Intel Core Xeon E3, 15,309). Blink and you'll miss it -- the WE72 copied 4.97GB in just 6 seconds, a rate of 848.2 MBps. The average is 561.1 MBps, and the Precision (462.7 MBps) and ZBook Studio (508.9 MBps) are both slower, but the ThinkPad P70 tied MSI's workstation score. MORE: Best MSI Laptops On our OpenOffice Spreadsheet Macro, the WE72 paired 20,000 names and addresses in 3 minutes and 22 seconds -- a hair faster than the average of 3:24, and the ThinkPad P70 and ZBook Studio (tied at 3:23). The Precision was speedier, at 3:08. The WE72's Nvidia Quadro M2200 with 4GB of VRAM isn't meant for gaming (it just passed 30 frames per second on our Hitman benchmark), but it will give you a solid boost in AutoCad or Photoshop. On 3DMark Fire Strike, it notched a score of 5,331, falling short of the average (9,092, though this includes high-end gaming laptops) and the ThinkPad P70 (Nvidia Quadro M4000M, 6,645), but outperformed the Precision (Quadro M1200, 3,987) and ZBook Studio (M1000M, 3,351). Battery Life: Desk-Bound There's a reason we call the WE72 a desktop replacement. It lasted just 2 hours and 57 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test, which involves browsing the web continuously over Wi-Fi. While the category average is 4:19, the ZBook Studio (5:08), ThinkPad P70 (5:53) and Dell Precision 5520 (a whopping 11:57) lasted far longer. Heat The WE72 stayed nice and cool in our testing. After streaming 15 minutes of HD video from YouTube, it measured 90 degrees on the touchpad, 88 degrees on the center of the keyboard and 85 degrees on the bottom. Webcam The 720p webcam on the WE72 is solid, with accurate colors and lots of detail. In test shots  taken at my desk, the camera caught the red stripes in my shirt exactly, and I could make out individual hairs on my head. Additionally, the lights behind me weren't blown out the way lesser webcams usually make them appear. Software and Warranty Most of the software preloaded on the WE72 is useful. MSI Dragon Center is a hub to monitor system performance, customize fan speeds, calibrate your battery and register your laptop. The True Color app adjusts your screen to remove blue light (great for working at night) and provides specialized settings for gaming, movies and work. Of course, there's also some bloatware that comes on every Windows 10 PC, like Candy Crush Soda Saga, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Twitter, Facebook, March of Empires and Sling. MSI sells the WE72 7RJ with a three-year warranty. See how the company performed in our Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands ranking. Bottom Line The MSI WE72 7RJ is a capable workstation that will handle any task you throw at it with aplomb. It offers strong performance, a fast SSD and a very comfortable keyboard; but while the screen outputs vivid colors, it's not as bright as competitors' offerings. If you can drop a bit more cash, the Lenovo ThinkPad P70 (starting at $1,889) offers a brighter screen and lasts almost twice as long on a charge. But if you're not taking the WE72 away from your desk and don't need the brightest screen out there, it's still a solid machine for almost $200 less than Lenovo's workstation.

Credit: (NMSU photo by Tiffany Acosta) Jordan Glaze, a New Mexico State University junior majoring in both mechanical and aerospace engineering and Innovator in the Aggie Innovation Space, helped Josiah Brooks create a prototype of a feed intake device for cattle. MEDIA CONTACT Available for logged-in reporters only CHANNELS Agriculture, Engineering, Environmental Science KEYWORDS Animal Science, Engineering, Student Research Newswise — New Mexico State University Department of Animal and Range sciences junior Josiah Brooks is creating a feed intake device for cattle, and he is working with the Aggie Innovation Space to design and develop parts for a prototype.   Through an NMSU College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences USDA-Hispanic Serving Institution LEADERS grant awarded to the Animal Science Department, Brooks is conducting a research trial to develop a marker system to determine feed intake in grazing cattle that will allow researchers to investigate how grazing management and supplementation programs can improve cattle health and performance.    To properly manage rangelands, ranchers need to understand grazing cattle nutrition and have the ability to quantify how much cattle eat when they are grazing in a pasture, according to Eric Scholljegerdes, Animal and Range Sciences associate professor and Brooks’ faculty adviser.   Researchers obtain this data with an inert marker (not digested), titanium dioxide, which is typically administered to cattle twice daily. Unfortunately, this dosing method requires manpower and interrupts grazing. Brooks is working on a device that will be inserted into the stomach of cattle and will automatically release the marker over a period of time.   To create a cap and a plunger for a prototype, Brooks has been working with Jordan Glaze, an Aggie Innovator in the Aggie Innovation Space Presented by Intel in the College of Engineering.   “The Aggie Innovation Space has allowed us to develop parts for this device that would otherwise be unavailable,” Scholljegerdes said. “We are very grateful for the wonderful help we have received thus far from the personnel at the Aggie Innovation Space. Without their help we would not be where we are at in the development process.”   As a former engineering student, Brooks knew about the Aggie Innovation Space and started working with Glaze in late 2016.   “I’m extremely happy with the Aggie Innovation Space,” Brooks said. “Jordan, specifically, because working with that level of technology is extremely challenging. I didn’t realize how much effort went into designing something on a software program.”   “You can’t do that without patience and you can’t do that unless you have a passion,” he added. “You feel welcome as a student even though you are not in the department, a completely different department, but they help and that’s what they want to do and that’s their passion. It’s been a very positive experience for me. I wouldn’t have gone back if I didn’t get that experience.”   A junior majoring in both mechanical and aerospace engineering, Glaze said he has enjoyed working with Brooks on his first animal science project. A few of projects Glaze has recently assisted on are from the industrial engineering department, art department, geology department and a community outreach project for a dog wheelchair for a NMSU employee.   “The Aggie Innovation Space is based around developing cross disciplinary skills focused on engineering specifically, but also branching out into different disciplines such as this case being animal science,” Glaze said.   “We guide projects from the very first stage, and work with our clients to help them get to the prototyping and later the manufacturing stages,” Glaze noted. “We work very hard to make projects successful, but focus on not doing the project for the client. We want them to learn and take away something when the project is said and done, and hopefully give them the guidelines to follow for future projects.”   While Brooks and Glaze are continuing to work on a prototype, Scholljegerdes hopes to test the device on cattle this summer. If successful, Brooks and Scholljegerdes would like to patent the device. Permalink to this article COMMENTS | COMMENTING POLICY Comment/Share Share Leave a comment...

Casey April 13, 2017 Pros / Fantastic general performance; Excellent battery life; Durable design; Comfortable keyboard; Lots of ports Cons / Dull, lo-res display; Gets hot; Slow SSD Verdict / The Dell Latitude 5280 offers great typing and 12+ hours of battery life, but temperature and screen issues hold it back. Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home The 12-inch Dell Latitude 5280 is a great choice for frequent business travelers. Not only does it fit in smaller luggage, but it also has fantastic battery life, which allows you to leave the power cord at home. The Latitude 5280's speedy 7th Gen Kaby Lake CPU enables solid performance, and its comfortable keyboard allows for tons of typing. A dim default display and warm skin temperatures keep Dell's laptop from a higher rating, but if you're looking for a durable, reliable machine, the Latitude 5280 should definitely be on your list. Specs Design Dell kept things simple with the 5280's design. The notebook's matte-black, carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer shell looks and feels sturdy, and its polycarbonate keyboard deck provides a comfortable area for your wrists to rest while you're typing. The Latitude's first USB 3.0 port, USB Type-C port and HDMI port are all located on the machine's left side, while the headphone jack, second USB 3.0 port, VGA port and Ethernet port sit on the right. You'll find an SD card reader at the rear of the device. The laptop has a number of ports that its competitors do not. The AsusPro for example, doesn't offer HDMI, VGA or Ethernet, while the ThinkPad X1 Carbon has no VGA and requires a dongle for its micro-Ethernet port. Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home Weighing 3.2 pounds and measuring 0.8 inches thick, the 12.5-inch Latitude 5280 is heavier and thicker than the 14-inch AsusPro B9440 (2.4 pounds; 0.6 inches) and the 14-inch Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2.5 pounds; 0.6 inches). Durability and Security Mobile professionals will appreciate the Latitude 5280's ruggedness, as Dell built the notebook to survive the dangers of everyday use and accidental abuse. Having passed 15 MIL-SPEC standard tests, it can work in the most grueling conditions, including extreme temperatures (from 140 degrees to -20.2 degrees Fahrenheit), drops, shocks and blasts of dust. Provided that they don't mind spending a little extra, your IT managers will appreciate all of Dell's security options. The system comes standard with a FIPS 140-2-certified TPM 2.0 chip for secure data. Intel's vPro technology for remote management costs an extra $21, as does a smart card reader. If you want an IR webcam for Windows Hello login, one is available for $35. Unfortunately, there's no fingerprint reader option. MORE: What is vPro? Display When configuring the Latitude 5280, pay $70 extra for the 1080p screen or go home. Our review model had the base-level, 1366 x 768 display, which was weighed down by poor color, low resolution and dimness. We don't know how much better the 1080p screen would have performed on our tests, but at least it would be sharper and fit more content on the screen. Watching the Thor: Ragnarok teaser trailer on the base screen, I noticed that Asgard's normally copper hue had faded to a light gray, while normally verdant trees looked sickly and what little life there was in Cate Blanchett's face was drained away. According to our colorimeter, the Latitude 5280's 1366p screen  produces 71 percent of the sRGB color spectrum. That's below the readings from the AsusPro B9440 (103 percent) and ThinkPad X1 (104 percent), and the 96-percent category average. The Latitude's panel emits up to 243 nits (a measurement of brightness). That's notably less than the 299-nit category average, as well as the results from the AsusPro B9440 (291 nits) and the ThinkPad X1 (275 nits). This dimness leads to a poor range of viewing angles, with color darkening at 45 degrees when viewed from the left or right. Keyboard and Touchpad Typists will enjoy click-clacking away on the Latitude 5280, as its comfy, backlit keyboard enabled fast input during my testing. I reached 82 words per minute on the 10fastfingers.com typing test, beating my 80-wpm personal average. While the 1.2 millimeters of travel in the keys is lower than the 1.5-2.0mm we hope to see, the 65 grams of actuation force makes up for that, sitting well above our minimum 60g comfort level. The Latitude's 3.9 x 2.1-inch touchpad tracks input accurately and supports Windows 10's app-switching gestures. Dell's Touchpad utility offers an easy way to disable tap-to-click and enable other gestures. The pair of left- and right-click buttons beneath the touchpad offers a solid feel to each click. Audio The Latitude 5280's speakers filled our largest conference room with strong sound. Listening to Rick Ross' "Trap Trap Trap" on the notebook, I noted its sturdy bass, accurate-sounding synths and clear vocals. Dell preloads the Waves MaxxAudio Pro sound-adjustment utility, but the default settings seem to be the best for clarity and strength. If you like to play with settings for sound-space width, audio details and bass, you'll have fun with this app. MORE: Best Bluetooth Speakers for Home or On-the-Go Performance With its Intel Core i7-7600U CPU, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, our review configuration of the  Latitude 5280 packs enough punch for solid multitasking. I didn't experience any slowdown even after splitting my screen between a dozen Chrome tabs (including ones for TweetDeck, Slack and Google Docs) and a 1080p YouTube video. The system also maintained its performance as I ran a full-system scan in Windows Defender, edited a Microsoft Word document and played a round of Candy Crush Soda Saga. Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home The Latitude turned in a great score of 8,690 on the Geekbench 4 general performance test. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon, which also has a Core i7-7600 CPU, earned a slightly lower score of 8,571. That beats the 6,933 average for ultraportable notebooks and the 7,238 from the AsusPro B9440 (Core i5-7200U, 8GB). The 256GB M.2 SATA SSD in the Latitude 5280 copied 4.97GB of multimedia files in 41 seconds, for a speed of 124.1MBps. That's behind the speeds from the SSD in the AsusPro B9440 (196MBps) and the PCIe SSD in the ThinkPad X1 (242MBps), as well as the 184.8MBps category average. The Latitude 5280 gave a  speedy performance on our OpenOffice productivity test, finishing in 3 minutes and 16 seconds. That's shorter than the times from the AsusPro B9440 (4:02) and ThinkPad X1 Carbon (3:22), as well as the 5:54 category average. The integrated Intel HD Graphics 620 chip in the Latitude earned a solid 68,949 on the Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test, beating the 54,231 category average. Similar scores came from the AsusPro B9440 (69,585) and ThinkPad X1 (68,082), both of which use Intel HD Graphics 620 cups. The Latitude 5280 can play moderately demanding games, running Dirt 3 (at Medium settings) at a silky smooth 61 frames per second. That's faster than 34-fps category average, as well as the frame rates from the AsusPro B9440 (27 fps) and ThinkPad X1 (28 fps). Battery Life The Latitude 5280 can burn the midnight oil and then some. The system clocked 12 hours and 21 minutes on the Laptop Mag battery test (continuous web browsing). That's better than the 8:26 time from the AsusPro B9440 and the 8:19 category average. The ThinkPad X1 (12:21) lasted just as long as the Latitude. Our test unit features a four-cell, 68-watt-hour battery that comes standard for Core i7 models but is an optional upgrade for the Core i3 ($49) and Core i5 ($28) models. Those come with three-cell batteries. MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life Webcam The 0.9-megapixel webcam is passable but unimpressive. In a photo of my torso, my skin tone and a green fern in the background looked pretty accurate, while digital noise obscured details such as my facial stubble and a diagonal pattern in my shirt. Heat This notebook can get plenty hot. After I streamed 15 minutes of HD video on the Latitude, its G and H keys spiked to a temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, and its underside got as hot as 107 degrees, issues I also noticed during general usage. Both measurements exceed our 95-degree comfort threshold, though the 89-degree reading from Latitude's touchpad stayed below the threshold. Software Dell bequeathed the Latitude 5280 with the company's standard pack of preloaded utilities. Those include Command Power Manager (for optimizing battery life), SupportAssist (for reaching Dell tech support agents) and Touchpad Options (for enabling/disabling click, tap and gesture settings). Configuration Options The $1,505 model we tested features a Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB M.2 SATA SSD, an IR webcam and a 1366 x 768-pixel display. You'll have to choose between the 1080p display ($70) and an IR camera ($35). Dell Latitude 5280 from $849.00 Visit Site from Dell Home The entry-level Latitude 5280 costs $849 and includes a Core i3-7100U CPU, 4GB of RAM and a 500GB, 7,200rpm hard drive. For $100 you can upgrade that notebook to a Core i5-7200U CPU. You can add LTE connectivity (with support for AT&T, Sprint or Verizon) for $139. Bottom Line The Latitude 5280 is a great machine for taking care of business, thanks to its speedy CPU, comfy keyboard and fantastic battery life. But while the Latitude has solid power, its mediocre display makes it hard to enjoy all that brawn. You can get a more colorful display with the thin, lightweight $2,122 ThinkPad X1 Carbon, but getting similar performance on that machine will cost an extra $617. Business travelers looking for a port-rich powerhouse notebook have a lot to like in the Latitude 5280, provided that they can take the heat and pay for the 1080p display.

Joseph Votel said Thursday he is responsible for the raid that killed a Navy SEAL and left a lot of questions. 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Transcript: General: 'I Am Responsible' for Deadly Yemen Raid A high-ranking general is taking responsibility for the raid in Yemen that killed a Navy SEAL and left at least four civilians dead last month. During a hearing  with the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Gen. Joseph Votel said he's the person who should take the fall for the raid that's been mired in controversy since it happened.  "I am responsible for this mission. ... We lost a lot on this operation. We lost a valued operator; we had wounded; we caused civilian casualties, lost an expensive aircraft."  The mission also failed to capture  Qassim al-Rimi , the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen and the reported target of the raid. But Votel said the military did gain valuable intelligence that will help the U.S. combat terror groups in the Middle East.  That was enough for President Donald Trump and his administration to deem the raid a success, as White House press secretary Sean Spicer called it early last month.  "It is a successful operation by all standards. ... It is tough to ever use the word success when you know that somebody has lost their life," Spicer said.  But that reconciliation isn't good enough for people like Arizona Sen. John McCain, who recently reiterated his opposition on calling the mission successful. SEE MORE: US Officials Disagree On Whether Yemen Raid Yielded Intel Or Not "When you have women and children killed — as you pointed out — loss of a $70 million aircraft, you do not capture anyone as was part of the mission, that mission is not a success. ... When heavy fire was encountered, why the decision was made to continue the mission, I still don't think this committee has an answer to that question," McCain said. Whether or not McCain will get answers to that question is up in the air. Votel said he decided there was no need for an additional investigation into the operation.  "I am looking for indicators of incompetence or poor decision-making or bad judgment. ... I was satisfied that none of those indicators that I identified to you were present," Votel said.   Investigations into what happened to the helicopter that crashed during the raid are still ongoing.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Disruption and the Value of Digital Transformation in Manufacturing; Learn More at SEMICON Southeast Asia 2017 KUALA LUMPUR, Apr 17, 2017 – (ACN Newswire) – At SEMICON Southeast Asia 2017, Dr. Chen Fusen, CEO of Kulicke & Soffa Pte Ltd, Singapore, will give a keynote on the digital transformation in the manufacturing sector. Chen believes that Smart Manufacturing, or Industry 4.0, is no longer hype, but real and Asia needs to get on board sooner rather than later. SEMICON Southeast Asia (SEA) 2017, held at the SPICE arena in Penang on 25-27 April, is Asia’s premier showcase for electronics manufacturing innovation. „Digital transformation has proven to provide solutions for addressing challenges in the manufacturing industry but there is still the issue of acceptance as well as lack of skills and knowledge that needs to be addressed,” said Chen. „With disruptive technology changing our world, I expect that more companies will see the value of their investments realised as this technology accelerates the creation of more individualised products and services.” Dr. Hai Wang from NXP Semiconductors Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore agreed that more consumer-related innovations would stem from digital transformation as demand for solutions that provide efficiency and security increases. „At NXP, we look at developing advanced cyber security solutions for the automotive industry, such as tracking and analysing intelligence around connected and automated vehicles, which will help to counter any adverse threats in real time. These innovations are real and will soon mark a shift in the future of automation and manufacturing. It is vital that we embrace the change and adapt accordingly,” he said. Other speakers at SEMICON SEA also feel strongly about the importance of Smart Manufacturing and digital transformation. David Chang of HTC Corporation, Taiwan, sees a dramatic shift in the value of being a „smart” manufacturer to address to the rising demand in consumer products and services innovation. „We have seen virtual reality technology offered by products such as HTC VIVE(TM) really shaping the future of the world. Transformative innovations such as this will pave the way for disruptive technology to be coupled into business models to benefit consumers in the long term,” he said. These three speakers will join a long list of thought leaders from the electronics manufacturing sector – including Jamie Metcalfe from Mentor Graphics U.S., Chiang Gai Kit from Omron Asia Pacific Singapore, Ranjan Chatterjee from Cimetrix U.S. and Duncan Lee from Intel Products Malaysia – to speak at SEMICON SEA 2017. Topics discussed will cover issues relevant to the transformation of the manufacturing industry ranging from next-generation manufacturing to system-level integration, including exhibitions that will highlight the market and technology trends that are driving investment and growth in all sectors across the region. The conference also aims to champion regional collaboration through new business opportunities for customers and foster stronger cross-regional engagement through reaching buyers, engineers and key decision-makers in the Southeast Asia microelectronics industry, including buyers from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

We expect the company to release some information about the purported Surface Phone at the event. Rumors have suggested that Microsoft is preparing a new smartphone phone under its popular Surface brand. The tech titan remains completely silent about the Surface Phone. It neither confirmed nor declined any of the rumors regarding the handset. Last year, CEO Satya Nadella hinted that Microsoft is planning to build “the ultimate mobile device.” Though he did not mention the name, tech pundits believe that it would be the Surface Phone. This is the only official information currently available about the Surface Phone. Nadella told the company’s shareholders in the fourth quarter that Microsoft is not stepping away from its focus on mobile. The company is looking at different forms and functions for mobile devices instead, the CEO said. Based on Nadella’s statement and rumors, we think the Surface Phone is the pipeline. Microsoft is only waiting for the right time to announce the Phone. Fans and tech world expect that the Surface Phone that may replace iPhone as a smartphone superstar. We expect that Microsoft would share information about the Surface Phone at the New York City’s event. Take a look rumors swirling about the Surface Phone.   To see a list of high yielding CDs go here.   Surface Phone Microsoft is said to be building three models of the Surface Phone. We might see a consumer model, a business model, and an enthusiast edition. The consumer model is likely to feature 4GB of RAM with 64 GB of storage. The business model is expected to have 6GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. All of the three models might sport a 20-megapixel rear camera with a Carl Zeiss lens. According to the rumors, the Windows 10-powered Phone will have a radical design and unique features. As we reported previously, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is imagining a phone that could be folded into a tablet. The company filed a new patent showing a mobile device with multiple flexible hinges. The filing suggests a mobile device that could work as both a smartphone and a tablet. The company also filed another patent that includes a mobile device functioning as a book and as a laptop. The Surface Phone will target business and corporate users. It is expected to be the most secure and productivity-focused handset, featuring a stylish pen and a removable keyboard. Rumors suggest that the Surface Phone will have Intel’s Kaby Lake processor. But some reports claim that Microsoft will use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors in the Phone. According to the rumors mill, the Surface Phone will support Win32 apps. That means users would be able to run Windows apps on the Surface Phone. Experts believe that the availability of Win32 apps would encourage many Android and iOS users to switch to a Windows phone. This feature could give the Surface Phone an edge over iPhone and Android devices if it comes with Win32 apps support, according to tech pundits. Microsoft Event in New York City A report from The Verge suggests that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will unveil “at least one piece of new hardware,” but it won’t be a successor to the Surface Book. The company could unveil a successor to the Surface 3 or the hardware design of its upcoming Xbox Project Scorpio at the event, according to the report. Screen Shot | Tech Times Microsoft is using the hashtag “MicrosoftEDU” for the event. Reports suggest that the company will reveal products and software focused mainly on education. It could introduce Windows 10 Cloud operating system, a competitor of Google’s Chrome OS aimed at low-cost computers. The event will begin at 9:30 AM ET on May 2. The company has started sending invites to the media. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement HP is building Rockchip & Android laptop (or maybe a Chromebook) 04/14/2017 at 5:00 PM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Most of HP’s current laptops, tablets, and even smartphones run Windows software. But the company also has a few Chromebooks, and soon HP may also launch a laptop that runs Android… or rather, Remix OS, which is a version of Android designed to look at home on a laptop. Notebook Italia got a look at a pre-production version of HP’s Remix OS notebook at the Hong Kong Global Sources Fair this week, and it looks like Remix OS may be just one of the possibilities. The notebook was on display at the Rockchip booth, where the chip maker is showing off a number of new products sporting its ARM-based processors. The laptop has HP EliteBook branding and it’s a thin and light notebook that’s currently running Remix OS, although a product description card suggests it could also be equipped with Phoenix OS (which is similar to Remix OS) or Chrome OS (which would make this a Chromebook). Features include: 12.5 inch, 1920 x 1080 pixel display Rockchip RK3399 hexa-core CPU (2 ARM Cortex-A72 cores, 4 Cortex-A53 cores) with Mali-T864 graphics 4GB RAM 64GB storage It’s probably worth noting that Rockchip isn’t using the name “HP” when describing the notebook, but it sure looks like an HP laptop, and a Rockchip representative does call it an “EliteBook” in the video below. The laptop’s design seems similar to that of the $1000 HP EliteBook Folio, but it’s likely that a model with a Rockchip processor and Android or Chrome operating system would be substantially cheaper since there’s no need to pay for a Windows license and Rockchip processors tend to be much more affordable than Intel chips. Rockchip says the new laptop should be available soon with “a big brand’s name on it.” It’s not clear if the Rockchip-powered EliteBook will be available globally or just in select markets. HP recently launched a YunOS Book with the Android-based Aliyun operating system, but that model is only available in China.

Then time passed. A lot of stuff happened. Now those guys pretty much rule the world. Their kingdom is Silicon Valley, the coin of the realm is the latest app and the number of Teslas per block averages 25. (Number of 2007 Honda Civics with faded roof paint: 1, at least when I’m in town.) Here are eight real-life sites – some famed, some obscure — for geek groupies who want to see where big brains have banged out the next big thing. It’s too bad those brains haven’t yet come out with “Star Trek” transporters (Elon Musk probably has one, but won’t share. Darn you, Musk!). So you’ll have to take some sort of vehicular conveyance to the Peninsula – a self-driving electric car that brews lattes and irons your shirts along the way would be best, but do what you can. Buck’s Restaurant Every good geek knows you need to start the day with a hearty breakfast. And the best place for tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to do that is, for some reason, Buck’s. It’s a fun diner in the little village of Woodside with decidedly analog and delicious pancakes and wacky décor — biplanes, blimps, stuffed beasts, a cosmonaut suit, a Statue of Liberty that sometimes wears a sombrero, sometimes a politically pink knit hat. During the past two decades, companies like PayPal, Hotmail, Netscape and Tesla were born here, yet Buck’s longtime owner, Jamis MacNiven, admits he doesn’t know why it’s such a draw for the tech elite. “We’re just people feeders here, and we happen to have been anointed with this international reputation,” he says. “I’m just the guy who holds open the door. Oh, and we have food, too.” Details: 3062 Woodside Road, Woodside, www.buckswoodside.com.

You can’t go into the garage. You can’t even get within an integrated-circuit’s throw of the garage, because it’s behind a gate. But you can look at it and feel the vibes of innovation. As stated in the plaque out front, it’s an official historic site: “The Birthplace of ‘Silicon Valley.’” It’s where, in 1938, David Packard and William Hewlett – definitely geeks — began tinkering away on an audio oscillator. People stop and take pics all the time. Details: 367 Addison Ave., Palo Alto. Computer History Museum Since viewing the HP garage will only take about five minutes, you can devote lots of time to the Computer History Museum. Its exhibits go back 2,000 years, starting with the abacus, moving up to slide rules, then punch-card machines, room-size computers with whirling tape reels, Univacs (I thought those only existed on “The Jetsons”) and on up through robots, software advances and a “World of Warcraft” exhibit with a life-size Thrall statue. There’s even a self-driving Google car. Sadly, you can’t drive it, and it doesn’t make lattes. The gift shop offers robot ice cube trays and “Star Trek” mugs (add hot water and it “beams” the crew to the planet’s surface). Details: Open Wednesday-Sunday at 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd, Mountain View. General admission is $17.50; Super Geek and Total Geek packages with entry plus T-shirts and more are $30-$46; www.computerhistory.org.

Inside, you’ll find a mock-up of the International Space Station, an exhibit on the Kepler Mission and a moon rock from Apollo 15. (Hint: It’s the thing that looks like a rock). The visitor center is not huge, but has some cool spacey stuff. And it’s free. Details: Moffett Blvd/NASA Parkway exit off Hwy. 101, Mountain View, www.nasa.gov/ames/visitorcenter.html. WeirdStuff Not far from NASA, you’ll pass some Google and Yahoo buildings on your way to a bland office/industrial area in Sunnyvale. There you’ll find the WeirdStuff warehouse. This is hard-wired geek territory for those who want to rummage around old electronics and rig up their own “Star Trek” transporter (so there, Musk!).

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Trinity is a 5 inch Android smartphone… and a Windows PC (crowdfunding) 04/11/2017 at 6:58 PM by Brad Linder 8 Comments Smartphones are generally designed to give you quick access to apps that you may want to use on the go, while desktop and notebook computers have bigger screens, faster processors, and are generally optimized to let you do things like edit documents, surf the web, get work done, or play graphically detailed games. But Shane Lewis has been working on a device that bridges that divide in an interesting way. When I met Lewis at CES last year he was calling his solution the Nitro Duo — because it’s both an Android smartphone and a Windows PC. Now he’s updated the platform and he’s getting ready to sell it to the public. The latest version is called the Trinity, and if Lewis can raise enough money through a crowdfunding campaign to fund production, it could begin shipping by the end of the year. Over the past few years we’ve seen a number of attempts to bring desktop-like features to smartphones. Microsoft’s Continuum for phone software lets you connect a phone like the HP Elite x3 to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse and use it like a computer… that runs Windows 10 Mobile software. Samsung’s new Galaxy S8 line of smartphones can work with a docking station called DeX that also lets you hook up a keyboard, mouse and display and get a desktop-style user interface. But you still end up running Android apps. The same can be said of Jide’s Singularity platform, which is designed to allow Android phones to work like desktop computers. Jide founder David Ko has argued that as more people get used to the idea of using Android as a desktop OS, we’ll see more developers offer desktop-class software for the platform. But we’re not exactly there yet. And Canonical recently gave up on its plans to bring “convergence” to Ubuntu Linux by offering a version that can run across phones, tablets, and PCs. So here’s what makes Trinity different from all of those: it’s a full-fledged Android phone. And it’s a full-fledged handheld Windows PC. I don’t mean it’s a dual-boot system. I mean there’s hardware for two completely different computers under the hood, but they share ports, a display, and networking features, among other things. The upshot is that you can use a Trinity device as a phone when you want a phone experience, or as a Windows computer when you want a Windows machine. You can turn off whichever system’s not in use. But you can also keep both running simultaneously and switch the display to show whichever you need at any given moment. Unlike the prototype I saw at CES 2016, the Trinity also doesn’t require a docking station to work as a desktop. It has full-sized USB and HDMI ports which you can use to plug in a display, keyboard, or other accessories. In fact, you can even plug in two displays at once: one for Android and one for Windows. The Windows experience is powered by an Intel processor, at least 4GB of RAM, and at least 128GB of mSATA solid state storage. Android is powered by an ARM-based processor, 2GB of RAM, and a microSD card. Here are a few things you might want to know before pulling out your wallet though: Prices start at $699 for an entry-level model… and that’s just for early backers. Since there are basically two computers stuffed into one case and full-sized ports, a Trinity is a lot thicker than a typical phone. It measures 19mm (about 0.74 inches) thick. The hardware isn’t particularly state-of-the-art. Battery life kind of stinks at the moment. While there’s still some work being done to improve things, right now the Trinity only gets about 4 hours of continuous use under Android… or an hour of battery life while both Windows and Android are running simultaneously. Lewis is using components he’s been able to source and work with, but some of those components are a bit on the older side. So while there are some features the Trinity has that you won’t find on most phone-sized devices, it also has a low-resolution display and previous-gen processors. Here’s what you get with the entry-level Trinity One: 5 inch, 800 x 480 pixel capacitive touchscreen display Intel Atom E8000 processor/4GB DDR3L RAM/128GB storage for Windows Freescale i.MX6 processor/2GBDDR3 RAM/32GB microSD card for Android 802.11b/g/n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.1 13MP rear camera Stereo speakers USB 3.0 port (Windows only) USB 2.0 port (Windows or Android) 2 HDMI ports (one is Windows-only, the other is Windows or Android) 4G LTE (CDMA and GSM support) GPS There are also higher-priced options with beefier specs. Each model has the same Freescale i.MX6 quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor and 2GB of RAM dedicated to Android. But some of the other features are upgraded: Trinity Turbo: Pentium N3710/4GB/128GB (for Windows) for a pledge of $869 Trinity Ultimate: Pentium N3710/8GB/256GB (for Windows), 64GB microSD card (for Android) for a pledge of $959 Lewis hopes to begin shipping Trinity devices in December, 2017… but only if he can raise $767,000 through an Indiegogo campaign. That’s a pretty steep goal for a niche product like this. But the good news is that it’s a fixed funding campaign. That means if you make a pledge and the campaign fails to meet its goal, you won’t have to pay for a device that’s unlikely to ever arrive.

Docks are not all they wonderful. They have never really taken off. Sure they’re neat at first but in our busy lives you don’t generally see people lugging them around in the real world sense. Even for music and expanded listening experiences, they’re used for awhile and discarded. People want portability and tether free. The product is sure to ruffle some feathers by competitors. Because they’d rather sell you individual systems at a premium. Those that have tried dumb down the system to run in the newer portable ecosystem. Why settle? Like any new product, if and when it ever gets launched and into the hands of the consumers, it will go through upgrades like anything else.

Recent Posts: 3 Trades on Massive Dips in 3 Industrial Stocks How to Wrangle Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock for Profits Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD): Bull, Bear or Beware? View All Posts Is recent stock weakness in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) offering investors an early warning to make an exit? Or is this a bullish opportunity to buy? Today, we’ll look at the current setup in AMD stock, then present a strategy that will provide profits without piling on the risk. Source: Shutterstock It has been just more than a month since I last penned a mostly optimistic take and strategy on AMD. Shares of Advanced Micro are mostly unchanged for the period, but beneath the surface, there has been a good deal of price volatility to ponder. The most striking catalyst during this period was a surprising initiation from Goldman Sachs. Last week, the firm slapped AMD stock with a “sell” rating and $11 price target roughly 20% below the prior night’s close. The bearish coverage was good enough to send shares more than 6% lower in a single session. Analyst Toshiya Hari did note many improvements at AMD under the stewardship of CEO Lisa Su. In his view, product launches, cost management and deleveraging of the company’s balance sheet have all been well-executed. However, given 2016’s substantial 300%-plus gain and relatively steep multiple, Hari warned strongly that Advanced Micro Devices was also “priced for perfection.” Also, analysts expect that an unfavorable price war with both Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) would occur at Advanced Micro’s expense. Is it time to listen to Goldman? One could use it as a starting point. However, Goldman’s calls — beyond their short-term influence — aren’t exactly the gold standard. I’d prefer to look at what others have to say and maintain an open mind. AMD Stock Chart   Click to Enlarge Advanced Micro Devices is far from a momentum play right now — at least in the bullish direction. Stochastics are oversold, and an uptrend line of around six months in duration has been broken. Shares could always snap back aggressively with a bullish earnings reaction. But for now, Goldman’s knockdown of AMD stock essentially pulled the rug out from what had been a nicely-developing momentum situation. Maybe Goldman is, as alum and CNBC personality James Cramer suggests, merely “taking away the punchbowl” for AMD — but a company that remains on track to grow its business and capture market share?

Ace Computers CEO John Samborski said, “Many public sector and enterprise users are migrating from desktops/PCs to workstations now. For any demanding application such as product simulation and digital forensics the difference in performance is remarkable.” Samborski added that Ace Computers continues to recommend and provide desktops for some applications such as K-12 schools and small to mid-sized enterprises. Ace Computers’ clients generally opt for workstations over PCs because of high performance and increased durability—two areas that are especially important for sensitive/intensive applications where technology tends to be pushed hard 24x7x365 such as product simulation, digital forensics, and deep learning projects, “A workstation opens up new capabilities that can help increase productivity, improve reliability, and limit downtime,” Samborski said. “The options for workstations are constantly evolving. Part of the reason we have been so successful is that we stay on top of and evaluate these options even before they enter the marketplace. We are always on the leading edge of proven technology, but never the bleeding edge. So our clients—whether public or public sector always get an expertly designed workstation that performs to their exacting specifications and is capable of expanding along with the organization.” While workstations cost more than desktops, the cost is recouped through faster productivity and streamlined operations. Speed gains are often significant; greater than 500%. The motherboard, internal drive, RAM, etc. are usually more robust than desktop components and are optimized for peak performance. Even an entry-level workstation can be configured with about twice the memory of a desktop. A workstation can also be configured with a larger number of more powerful processors than a PC. Because Ace Computers designs workstations from the ground up it is easy to add hard drives and graphics cards and increase RAM. It is also possible to later create multiple workstations with the same configuration as the organization grows. Leading custom computer builder and HPC cluster specialist, Ace Computers currently holds the following contracts: SEWP V, CCS-2, GSA, WSIPC, PEPPM, State of Wis., State of Ga. The company is a Woman-Owned Small Business custom technology systems manufacturer and reseller for the public sector as well as the commercial sector. Channel partners include Intel, Supermicro, NVIDIA, Mellanox and Samsung among others. Ace Computers is an authorized Microsoft Surface Partner. An industry leader since 1983, the company is a 2016 HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award finalist. In addition to some of the finest academic institutions in the U.S., long-term clients include the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of Defense. In addition to our Greater Chicago headquarters, Ace Computers has locations in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Nevada.

The first commercial flight of the ERJ 145 occurred on April 6, 1997, with U.S. airline Continental Express. “The ERJ 145 marked Embraer’s commercial renaissance, paving the way for the development of new programs, such as the E-Jets, which moved the Company into the lead of the commercial jet market for up to 130-seat aircraft,” said Paulo Cesar de Souza e Silva, Embraer President & CEO. “Personally, I have a great affection for the program, which brought me to Embraer. I participated in practically all the jet’s sales campaigns as Vice President of Customer Financing.” The ERJ 145 family of jets consists of the ERJ 145 (50 seats), the ERJ 135 (37 seats), the ERJ 140 (44 seats) and the ERJ 145 XR (long-range 145 version). Since its entry into operation, the ERJ 145 family has accumulated more than 27 million flight hours and almost 730 million passengers transported, being used by more than 120 operators. Over the last seven years, the ERJ’s global customer base has almost doubled, from 39 operators, in 2010, to 70, today. During the same period, the application and use of ERJ models has been growing in emerging markets, such as Africa, where the ERJ fleet has increased from 16 units in 2010 to almost 60 jets in 2017. Robust and with excellent operating history, the ERJ platform is a success in commercial aviation, with almost 900 units delivered, having applications in the business aviation market, with the Legacy 600 and Legacy 650 jets, as well as in defense, such as the AEW&C, Multi-Intel and maritime patrol for the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) segment. In total, more than 1,200 aircraft based on the ERJ 145 platform have already been delivered worldwide, making the ERJ program one of the most successful in the aircraft industry.

Special prayers will be organised at churches across the country for the progress, prosperity, and security of Pakistan. Law enforcing agencies have taken special measures to ensure fool-proof security on the occasion. The Ministry of Interior has announced an optional holiday for the Christian community on April 17. Shehbaz greets Christians on Easter Chief Minister Punjab Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the Christian community on the occasion and said the nation shares the Christian community’s happiness. “Easter is an occasion to share happiness and joy with deserving people. Sharing the joys of others multiplies happiness,” CM Punjab said. Stressing on the need to promote inter-religious harmony, Sharif said, “We need to promote the message of love and harmony everywhere today.” In his message on the eve of Easter, the chief minister said that the Christian community was playing its role in the development of the country. He said that brotherhood, harmony, peace, love, and affection were the gist of the teachings of Jesus Christ. Pope Francis’ message at Easter Vigil Pope Francis, leading the world’s Roman Catholics into Easter, urged them on Saturday not to ignore the plight of immigrants, the poor, and other vulnerable people. Read more: Feel the pain of the poor and immigrants, pope says at Easter Vigil In his homily at an Easter Vigil Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, Francis recounted the Biblical account of Jesus Christ’s mother Mary and Mary Magdalene, filled with grief, as they went to visit his tomb. Their grief, he said during the solemn ceremony, could be seen on the faces of many women today. “In their faces we can see reflected all those who, walking the streets of our cities, feel the pain of dire poverty, the sorrow born of exploitation and human trafficking,” he said. “We can also see the faces of those who are greeted with contempt because they are immigrants, deprived of country, house and family. We see faces whose eyes bespeak loneliness and abandonment, because their hands are creased with wrinkles.” Security arrangements Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh AD Khawaja on Saturday directed the police to make tight security arrangements across the province for Easter. He instructed zonal and district police officers to coordinate with the managements of all churches in the province to ensure proper security arrangements such as walkthrough gates and metal detectors were in place.
