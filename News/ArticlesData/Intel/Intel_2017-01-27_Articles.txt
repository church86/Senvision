Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Pioneer Ultra HD Blu-ray burners pack 4K playback, but good luck meeting the PC requirements Pioneer Ultra HD Blu-ray burners pack 4K playback, but good luck meeting the PC requirements By Joel Hruska on January 26, 2017 at 4:19 pm Comment Pioneer announced a brace of new UHD Blu-ray burners today, the first we’ve seen debut for the PC market. Currently, if you want UHD playback, you need to pick up either a dedicated player or an Xbox One S — Sony’s PlayStation 4 Pro lacks UHD Blu-ray support, even though the Japanese company was instrumental to the development of Blu-ray itself. The new BDR-S11J-BK and the BDR-S11J-X are both 5.25-inch drives that support nearly every optical read/write standard ever devised, including: CD-R, CD-RW, DVD±R, DVD±R DL, DVD±RW, DVD-RAM, BD-R SL/DL/TL/QL, BD-RE SL/DL/TL, BD-R LTH). They also read CDs, DVDs, BDs, and UHD Blu-ray films. Both drives feature a 4MB buffer for underrun protection and support 16x burning speeds on standard Blu-ray media. Pioneer claims that the BDR-S11J-X contains some additional hardware for ensuring high-quality audio playback, but both drives support Pioneer’s PureRead 4+ and real Time PureRead software. Exact specifications on either standard are hard to come by since the native language is Japanese, but Pioneer claims both technologies are specifically useful when reading damaged audio discs. 4K UHD Blu-ray playback… if you meet the requirements If you’ve followed our coverage of Netflix streaming requirements for 4K video and the significant hardware upgrades most systems would require, you know that content creators have gone out of their way to make 4K streaming as difficult as possible. Only seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake hardware is 4K streaming capable, and it looks like a similar set of requirements are in place for UHD Blu-ray support. In order to play UHD Blu-rays, your system must support AACS 2.0 and Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX). You’ll need software to play the disc itself (CyberLink has an updated software solution set to ship in the near future), and a GPU with HDMI 2.0a and HDCP 2.2 support. AACS 2.0 also has to be implemented within the GPU driver, and no current stand-alone GPU drivers have this functionality. Finally, you need a 4K TV with both HDMI 2.0a and HDCP 2.2 support as well. This is a tall order. No Intel chips before Skylake support SGX, and just owning a Skylake board isn’t enough — many desktop boards never implemented the feature and don’t support it in UEFI. The HDCP 2.2 support requirement is also dodgy, since not every Intel board supports that standard, either. In theory, the UHD Blu-ray playback situation should be better than the 4K streaming situation, since at least 6th and 7th-generation Core chips are both supported. In practice, it seems to be every bit as much of a muddle and a problem. Support is limited to specific SKUs and motherboards with particular features, and the dependence on integrated graphics for decode support means that you can’t use UHD Blu-ray with any Intel HEDT system (HEDT refers to Intel’s E-class chips — Sandy Bridge-E, Ivy Bridge-E, Haswell-E, etc). For years, there’s been a push-pull between content pirates and the content production industry, with law-abiding fans generally caught in the middle. For years, the content consumption side of the business has warned that if technology became too draconian, people simply wouldn’t use it. That seems to be the point at which we’ve arrived. Given the snail-like speed of PC refresh cycles these days, 4K streaming support will take 3-5 years to establish itself in the market, while UHD Blu-ray playback may never happen at all, thanks to ridiculously strict requirements that block out entire swathes of the hardware market. The BDR-SJ11-BK is expected to be priced at $193, while the BDR-S11J-X will be a $307 part. Both drives will be available in Japan in late February, and will likely make their way to the US thereafter.

Intel's fourth-quarter earnings close 2016 on a high note by Jeff Kampman  4:07 PM on January 26, 2017 Intel closed out its 2016 books today, and the results are rosy. The company posted $16.4 billion in revenue for the last quarter of 2016, up 10% from a year ago, and operating income of $4.5 billion, up 5% from a year ago. For its fiscal 2016, the blue team took in total revenue of $59.4 billion, up 7% from its fiscal 2015, and $12.9 billion in operating income, down slightly from the $14 billion in operating profit it generated in 2015. Gross margin for the year fell to 60.9% from 62.6%.   Q4 2016 Q4 2015 Change Revenue $16.4 billion $14.9 billion up 10% Operating income $4.5 billion $4.3 billion up 5% Net income $3.6 billion $3.6 billion down 1% Gross margin 61.7% 64.3% down 2.6% Intel's Client Computing group took in $9.1 billion, up 4% year-on-year, despite a 7% decline in platform sales (the combination of processors and chipsets). That's thanks in part to a 7% increase in the average selling price of those platforms. Drilling down into those numbers, the company says desktop platform volumes shrank by 9% compared to a year ago, while the average selling price for those platforms increased 2%. Notebook platform sales were unchanged from a year ago, but average selling prices increased by 3%. The Data Center group generated $4.7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-on-year. Server platform volumes grew by 3%, and average selling prices increased by 4%. Intel's thrust into the nascent Internet of Things space appears to be paying off with continuing rapid growth. Though it's still a relatively small portion of the company's overall revenue pie, the IoT group took in $726 million in revenue, up 16% from a year ago. The Non-Volatile Memory Solutions group is also enjoying healthy growth. The $816 million revenue figure for that division is up 25% year-on-year.  Meanwhile, the Programmable Solutions group formed from Intel's Altera acquisition took in $420 million in revenue, and the Intel Security group grew its revenue by 2% year-on-year. For the whole of its fiscal 2017, Intel expects revenue to be flat compared to the year past, and the company expects its gross margin to increase slightly.   Tags: CPUs Miscellaneous User name:  Password:  Remember me Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube In the past technology would typically be associated with “boring” looking devices, like huge chunk computers and monitors that come in dull colors like black or beige. However these days we’re starting to see how tech can be fashionable or artsy, especially with artists now collaborating with tech companies to make that a reality. Recently this concept was demonstrated during China’s CCTV Spring Festival Gala where a group of 162 dancers donned Intel and 360Fashion Network’s smart gloves and synchronized a dance together that created a human light pattern in the process. The glove itself is powered by Intel’s Curie and the pattern is generated using gestures thanks to the sensors embedded into the gloves, such as a 6-axis combo sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope. The end result is a pretty stunning performance which you can check out for yourself in the video above. This seems to be a great demonstration of how technology, art, and fashion can be combined together and that they don’t necessarily have to exist separate from one another. It’s also a good demonstration of Intel’s Curie platform and the smart glove, as well as its accompanying app that allows users to change the color pixel by pixel, choose from preset lighting animations, and more. Based on this it is possible that maybe in the future, more musical acts could incorporate the technology into their performances, but in the meantime you can enjoy the Spring Festival Gala’s performance in the video above.

ByStephanie Condon for Between the Lines | January 26, 2017 -- 21:43 GMT (13:43 PST) | Topic: Processors Intel on Thursday reported its fourth quarter results, posting record quarterly revenue as well as record annual revenue for 2016. The revenue growth reflected strength across all of its business segments, Intel said, including its client computing (PC sales), data center and Internet of Things groups. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 79 cents a share for Q4, on revenue of $16.37 billion. Wall Street was looking for earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $15.75 billion. Intel's full-year, non-GAAP 2016 revenue came to $59.5 billion, with an EPS of $2.72. The company also reported non-GAAP operating income of $16.5 billion and net income of $13.2 billion. Intel also generated a record of $21.8 billion in cash from operations. CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement that 2016 was a "transformative" year for Intel. "In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities," he said. "I'm pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future." For the full year, Intel's client computing group brought in revenue of $32.9 billion, up 2 percent from 2015. While its growth was marginal, it reflected the overall market: Global shipments of PCs fell for the fifth straight year in 2016, according to Gartner estimates, though there have been signs the market is at least stabilizing. As the market changes, Intel has made a concerted effort to focus more on its data center and IoT groups. The data center group posted $17.2 billion in revenue for 2016, up 8 percent from 2015. Intel had initially hoped for double-digit growth in this category. Its IoT revenue came in at $2.6 billion, up 15 percent from 2015. Revenue for the non-volatile memory solution group came in at $2.6 billion, down 1 percent from 2015, while Intel's security group posted revenue of $2.2 billion, up 9 percent. The programmable solutions group posted revenue of $1.7 billion. For Q4 2016, the client computing group revenue came in at $9.1 billion, up 4 percent year-over-year. Sequentially, client computing revenue was up 3 percent with platform volumes down 4 percent and platform average selling prices up 6 percent, Intel noted in its CFO commentary. Data center group revenue reached $4.7 billion for the quarter, up 8 percent year-over-year. The group grew 3 percent sequentially with platform volumes down 3 percent and platform average selling prices up 6 percent. Internet of Things Group revenue hit $726 million for Q4, up 16 percent year-over-year and up 5 percent sequentially. As for Q1 2017, Intel is expecting a non-GAAP EPS of 65 cents (plus or minus 5 cents) on revenue of $14.8 billion (plus or minus $500 million). Wall Street is looking for earnings of 61 cents per share on sales of $14.5 billion. For the full fiscal year 2017, the company is expecting earnings per share of $2.80 on flat revenue.

Optane tech is a new class of non-volatile memory and storage based on 3D Xpoint, which was developed jointly by Micron and the chip making giant, according to PC World. Intel by Roebot, Flickr Both Optane products based on 3D Xpoint Intel’s first Optane products, which were announced at CES this month, are low-capacity SSDs that fit into PCs’ storage slots. The Optane memory DIMMs is not the same. They are intended to replace DRAM in PCs and servers. The DIMMs will fit into DDR4 slots. Intel has begun shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing and is hoping to launch the final products next year. Optane SSDs performed ten times faster than traditional SSDs in the demonstration. PC makers said that bootup, applications and game play are all quicker with Optane SSDs, notes PC World. Not much is known about the Optane memory DIMMs, but Intel has shipped the units for testing out to enterprise hardware makers. The chip maker said the Optane memory can be 10 times denser than DRAM. Also it has floated the notion that Optane could unite memory and storage. For instance, a single Optane unit could serve as both DRAM and storage, notes PC World. On Thursday during the earnings call, CEO Brain Krzanich said that 3D Xpoint is the base technology of both types of Optane products and is a bridge between storage and memory. Krzanich said Optane is a “differential technology” that could change server and PC architectures. Intel hires Cisco veteran as new VP of channel sales In other Intel news, the company has hired Ricardo Moreno as a new vice president of channel sales. Moreno, a 16-year Cisco channel veteran, will be the new VP of Intel’s sales and marketing group and general manager of Intel’s Partner Program Organization. According to the company, Moreno will not only be in charge of strengthening the focus on investments across Intel’s go-to-market strategy but also channel resources and training strategies from a global perspective. Todd Garrigues, director of reseller channels and North American marketing, said, “It’s a strong statement from Intel to add another executive on that level to focus on the partner infrastructure, tools and resources that we bring to market to support our channels worldwide.” Tags: intel Optane SSDs Load Comments Send us your tips at tips(at)valuewalk.com Latest News From ValueWalk James Grant – A Different Investment World The Growing Clout Of Rural Consumers Emerson Electric (EMR): A Dividend King With 60 Consecutive Years Of Dividend Increases Despite Net Short Positioning, Sui Generis Investment Partners Up 5% In 2016 Copyright © 2016 ValueWalk - Privacy Policy Follow Us: Developed by ValueWalk Team Sponsored Content - Resource Center

Credit: Intel More like this With ARM server market fading, Qualcomm's new chip may be too late What boost will Intel's next chips deliver? Moore's Law lives on with speedy 7nm mobile chips coming in 2018 Video Mingis on Tech: 'Alexa, what's in the news?' Intel's next big Moore's Law advance will be a 7-nm pilot plant it is establishing this year to explore the upcoming manufacturing process. The chipmaker announced it was establishing the pilot plant during an earnings call on Thursday. For decades, Moore's Law has been the guiding light for Intel to make teenier, faster, and more power-efficient chips. The effort has helped PC makers continuously shrink laptops and mobile devices while adding longer battery life. Intel is trying to hang onto the long-standing observation as a way to push its chip technology forward. However, some experts argue Moore's Law is expiring as it becomes physically impossible to cram more features on smaller chips. The pilot plant will test and iron out kinks in manufacturing 7-nm chips. Intel hasn't said when it'll start shipping 7-nm chips in volume, but it won't be in the next two to three years. "The pilot line is about figuring out how to make billions of chips," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The pilot plant has limited production, but it sets the stage for Intel to invest billions in larger factories to make smaller 7-nm chips. "Once they have the process locked down, it's replicated in the other plants," McCarron said. Intel's latest chips, based on Kaby Lake, are made using the 14-nanometer process, and the company is now moving to 10-nm with its upcoming Cannonlake chip, which was shown in a PC at CES earlier this month. The 7-nm chips will come after the 10-nm process. Cannonlake chips will ship in small volumes by year-end, and their availability will expand next year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said during the earnings call. Moore's Law has also helped Intel roll out new chips on a yearly basis like clockwork. Intel first interpreted Moore's Law as a way to double the number of transistors in chips every 18 to 24 months, which doubles performance. But that interpretation didn't work on the 14-nm process, where it became a challenge to cram more transistors in smaller geometries. Intel dealt with embarrassing product delays and had to move away from its decades-old schedule of advancing the manufacturing process every two years. Intel also broke away from its history of making two new chip technologies with each manufacturing cycle. It made three new chip technologies -- Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake -- with the 14-nm process. The chipmaker now isn't worried about doubling the transistor count with every new chip generation. Instead, Intel is now interpreting Moore's Law more in line with the economics related to cost-per-transistor, which would drop with scaling. That's an important part of Moore's Law. Intel last year said it was trying to get back to a two-year manufacturing cycle with the 7-nm process, but with smarter chip designs. The 7-nm process could bring radical design changes to chips, which will be much smaller and power efficient. Intel's planning on using exotic III-V materials like gallium-nitride for faster chips that could bring laptops longer battery life. Intel is looking at the 7-nm process to alleviate some of the challenges it faces on the 14-nm and 10-nm processors. The company has hinted it would introduce EUV (extreme ultraviolet) tools in the manufacturing process. EUV will help etch finer features on chips, but its implementation has been delayed multiple times. The pilot factory will help validate all those features, and then allow Intel to order equipment for the new factories, McCarron said. Competitors like Globalfoundries and Samsung are getting a head-start on the 7-nm process. Globalfoundries has said it will start making 7-nm chips by 2018, and ARM has released tools for the design of 7-nm chips. It's not clear if Globalfoundries will do 7-nm test runs or start making chips in large volumes. Samsung and Globalfoundries have just started making 10-nm chips like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, which will appear in smartphones soon. Globalfoundries is a close partner with IBM, which produced the first 7-nm chips last year.

The chipmaker announced it was establishing the pilot plant during an earnings call on Thursday. For decades, Moore's Law has been the guiding light for Intel to make teenier, faster, and more power-efficient chips. The effort has helped PC makers continuously shrink laptops and mobile devices while adding longer battery life. Intel is trying to hang onto the long-standing observation as a way to push its chip technology forward. However, some experts argue Moore's Law is expiring as it becomes physically impossible to cram more features on smaller chips. The pilot plant will test and iron out kinks in manufacturing 7-nm chips. Intel hasn't said when it'll start shipping 7-nm chips in volume, but it won't be in the next two to three years. "The pilot line is about figuring out how to make billions of chips," said Dean McCarron, principal analyst at Mercury Research. The pilot plant has limited production, but it sets the stage for Intel to invest billions in larger factories to make smaller 7-nm chips. "Once they have the process locked down, it's replicated in the other plants," McCarron said. Intel's latest chips, based on Kaby Lake, are made using the 14-nanometer process, and the company is now moving to 10-nm with its upcoming Cannonlake chip, which was shown in a PC at CES earlier this month. The 7-nm chips will come after the 10-nm process. Cannonlake chips will ship in small volumes by year-end, and their availability will expand next year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said during the earnings call. Moore's Law has also helped Intel roll out new chips on a yearly basis like clockwork. Intel first interpreted Moore's Law as a way to double the number of transistors in chips every 18 to 24 months, which doubles performance. But that interpretation didn't work on the 14-nm process, where it became a challenge to cram more transistors in smaller geometries. Intel dealt with embarrassing product delays and had to move away from its decades-old schedule of advancing the manufacturing process every two years. Intel also broke away from its history of making two new chip technologies with each manufacturing cycle. It made three new chip technologies -- Broadwell, Skylake, and Kaby Lake -- with the 14-nm process. The chipmaker now isn't worried about doubling the transistor count with every new chip generation. Instead, Intel is now interpreting Moore's Law more in line with the economics related to cost-per-transistor, which would drop with scaling. That's an important part of Moore's Law. Intel last year said it was trying to get back to a two-year manufacturing cycle with the 7-nm process, but with smarter chip designs. The 7-nm process could bring radical design changes to chips, which will be much smaller and power efficient. Intel's planning on using exotic III-V materials like gallium-nitride for faster chips that could bring laptops longer battery life. Intel is looking at the 7-nm process to alleviate some of the challenges it faces on the 14-nm and 10-nm processors. The company has hinted it would introduce EUV (extreme ultraviolet) tools in the manufacturing process. EUV will help etch finer features on chips, but its implementation has been delayed multiple times. The pilot factory will help validate all those features, and then allow Intel to order equipment for the new factories, McCarron said. Competitors like Globalfoundries and Samsung are getting a head-start on the 7-nm process. Globalfoundries has said it will start making 7-nm chips by 2018, and ARM has released tools for the design of 7-nm chips. It's not clear if Globalfoundries will do 7-nm test runs or start making chips in large volumes. Samsung and Globalfoundries have just started making 10-nm chips like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, which will appear in smartphones soon. Globalfoundries is a close partner with IBM, which produced the first 7-nm chips last year. 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel NUC mini PC kits with Core i3 now available for $300 01/25/2017 at 3:00 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment Intel is refreshing its NUC line of tiny desktop computers with new models featuring Intel Apollo Lake and Kaby Lake chips. The new versions should offer better CPU and graphics performance than their predecessors, and Intel has also given them a slight makeover with a darker case and a power button that’s been moved from the top to the front. Earlier this month an Intel NUC with a Celeron J3455 Apollo Lake CPU went on sale for about $230. Now you can buy more powerful models with Core i3 Kaby Lake chips. Prices start at about $295. That’s how much Amazon is charging for either the BOXNUC7I3BNH NUC Kit or the BOXNUC7I3BNK NUC Kit. Both versions feature a 15 watt Intel Core i3-7100U dual core processor with Intel HD 620 graphics, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI and, four USB 3.0 ports, and a USB Type-C port (which can be used as a second display output, among other things, thanks to DisplayPort 1.2 support). The difference is that the BNH model has room for both an M.2 solid state drive and a 2.5 inch hard drive or SSD, while the BNK version is a shorter, more compact PC that only has the M.2 slot. Note that Amazon is showing the wrong images for the new mini computers, but Newegg has the right pictures (and is charging $315 for the short and tall versions of the new Core i3 NUC). Both ship without storage, memory, or an operating system and support up to 32GB of DDR4-2133 RAM. Later this year Intel will also launch models with Core i5 and Core i7 Kaby lake chips, Thunderbolt 3 ports, and Intel Iris Plus graphics. Some models will also support Intel Optane storage. via NUC Blog Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Latest News Windows 10 gets new gaming features with Insider Preview Build 15019 The latest preview of Windows 10 for members of the Windows Insider Preview … [Read More...] Reports: Samsung Galaxy S8 launching March 29th, featuring brand new design Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone may have been a bit of a disaster, but the … [Read More...] In a perfect world Satechi’s new USB Type-C Power Meter wouldn’t be necessary… ... but we don't live in a perfect world.

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers - the machines at the heart of cloud computing. Although profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft is paying off. Google's Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 per cent to US$3.4 billion (S$4.8 billion) in the fourth quarter. "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said on Thursday. "I definitely think we're going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for start-ups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own Web services. MICROSOFT NET INCOME $5.2b REVENUE $24.1b ALPHABET NET INCOME $5.33b REVENUE $26.06b INTEL NET INCOME $3.6b REVENUE $16.4b All figures for the fourth quarter in US dollars SOURCE: REUTERS More than US$1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud computing during the next five years, research firm Gartner estimated last July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," it added. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to buy Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company's productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales rose 47 per cent in the fiscal second quarter. "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy," said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Mark Moerdler, who rates Microsoft shares outperform. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief financial officer Amy Hood last July said gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. This is because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualised revenue of US$20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year ending June 2018. That metric stood at more than US$14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel's fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 per cent from a year earlier. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and RBC Capital Markets expects the company's AWS cloud business to generate US$3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 per cent from the year before. Mr Moerdler said: "Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack."

During Intel’s fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference on Thursday, CEO Brian Krzanich said the company provided samples of its 3D XPoint-based memory sticks to data centers during that quarter. These sticks fit into DDR4 slots in servers, promising better performance due to the “stacked” nature of 3D XPoint technology. This is the same technology Intel is using in its new Optane-labeled storage devices. “Our memory business finished the year with record quarterly revenue while full-year revenue was down by one percent. This was an investment year for the memory business,” he said. “We are now shipping 3D NAND from our FAB 68, and we just qualified our first 3D XPoint-based Optane SSDs, which are expected to ship for revenue in the first quarter. And our 3D XPoint memory DIMMs are sampled to data center customers.” More: MSI posted the specs of eight upcoming Xeon E3-1200 v6 Series CPUs from Intel 3D XPoint is a new class of non-volatile memory, meaning this type of memory holds onto data when devices are shut down whereas volatile memory doesn’t. Non-volatile memory is typically used in solid-state drives and USB sticks (NAND) whereas volatile memory is typically used in system memory sticks (DRAM). However, Intel is using its 3D XPoint technology in SSD and memory stick (DIMM) form factors. Intel’s 3D XPoint is supposedly faster than standard flash-based NAND technology but slower than DRAM. It’s not supposed to replace DDR4 system memory sticks, but speed up data access without compromising the system’s storage capacity. In other words, if a server has Optane-based sticks installed, it has the speed of an SSD and the capacity of a hard drive. The first Optane-based SSDs produced by Intel were shown during CES 2017 in early January. They were M.2-class products, meaning they are stick sized and slip into a special slot on the motherboard, or can be mounted onto a special PCI Express card and connected to the motherboard like a graphics card. The units on display had 16GB and 32GB capacities. These two units expand on the hybrid storage design. Currently, there are storage products on the market that cram NAND memory into hard drives to speed up the flow of data to and from the hybrid drive. However, Intel’s solution means customers aren’t required to rip out their current hard drive to get the benefits of a hybrid drive but to just install one of these Optane SSDs instead. The idea behind the hybrid storage setup is to place the most used files on the faster non-volatile storage memory and all other data on the slower, magnetic spinning discs (platters). This will increase the speed of the system from boot because the mechanical parts typically are not accessed to load the necessary data. Systems with Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake Core processors and its family of Xeon E3 v6 processors will be compatible with Intel’s Optane products. Optane will be installed in pre-built systems and sold as stand-alone products for motherboards and other products listed as “Optane ready” in the second quarter of 2017. Also watch: Share

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 11:43AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is preparing to launch its next generation high-end desktop (HEDT) personal computer chips and platform at the Gamescom trade show beginning on Aug. 22, per a report from the generally reliable website BenchLife.info. Intel's HEDT lineup makes up a relatively small portion of the company's overall desktop PC chip sales, but these chips tend to carry very high average selling prices and are much more lucrative per unit than the company's mainstream desktop personal computer chip lines. The report has some information about the new lineup, so let's take a closer look.  New chipset, broader line of chips Intel's previous HEDT platform, based on the X99 chipset, supported processors that the company code-named Broadwell-E. These are six-, eight-, and 10-core chips based on the company's Broadwell architecture, manufactured in the company's first-generation 14-nanometer technology. The chips list at around $434 and go all the way up to $1723. The upcoming HEDT platform, which is based on a newer chipset dubbed X299, is said to support a broader range of chips. The Broadwell-E chips will see direct successors in the form of a chip family called Skylake-X, which BenchLife says will come in six-, eight-, and 10-core variants. Image source: Intel.  The main improvements from Skylake-X, then, are expected to come from changes to the fundamental chip architecture (both the processor cores and all the "stuff" that surrounds the cores should be new) as well as to the manufacturing technology -- Skylake-X is said to be manufactured in Intel's enhanced 14-nanometer+ technology. New to this platform, though, will be a family of chips called Kaby Lake-X. These chips are believed to be the same fundamental chips as the Kaby Lake-S processors that Intel launched earlier this month for mainstream desktops, but they will be modified to fit into motherboards utilizing the X299 chipset. The integrated graphics processors on these chips are also believed to be disabled on the Kaby Lake-X chips -- a prudent move as the motherboard infrastructure required to support integrated graphics adds cost but is of minimal value to the target market (which will want to use stand-alone graphics processors).  The addition of the Kaby Lake-X parts to the lineup should allow Intel to offer a broader range of chips on the HEDT platform at potentially lower price points, which could help to boost the adoption of said platform. No "X" processors? A translation of the BenchLife report indicates that all the chips that will initially launch for the X299 platform will be designated with "K" suffixes in their model numbers, with no "X" models at launch. The current HEDT lineup on the X99 platform consists of four chips: Core i7-6800K, Core i7-6850K, Corei7-6900K, and Core i7-6950X. The six- and eight-core models are designated with "K" suffixes, while the top-end 10-core model has an "X" suffix. It doesn't make sense for Intel to completely abandon chips with the "X" suffix -- after all, the ultra-premium positioning/branding of the "X" chip probably helps to boost the perceived value of the chip. My inclination, then, is to think that Intel might be planning an even higher-end "X" part later down the line, with additional performance and/or features. Investor takeaway A new HEDT platform isn't going to be a game changer for Intel's financials or its stock price, but new products could allow the chipmaker to maintain or even slightly grow its average selling prices within this portion of its desktop PC chip shipments. Given that the personal computer market is expected to suffer unit declines for quite some time, any and all actions that Intel can take to improve its average revenue per PC with interesting new products (which can help to offset the unit declines) should be welcomed by stockholders.

The handset will also feature an improved camera and waterproofing, improving on a key weakness of the original. Google's Pixel is intended to rival the iPhone. Tightly coupled with Android, it's Google's first attempt to design its own smartphone hardware. The result has been generally very well received, although there's still room for improvement. This year's Pixel 2 is meant to fill in the gaps to create an even better device. Google is concentrating on improving camera and CPU performance, 9to5Google reported today. The company is said to be developing multiple test versions of the Pixel 2 using different processors. Some have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 inside, a typical choice for 2017's flagship phones. Others contain Intel silicon though, potentially making the Pixel 2 one of few Android phones with Intel Inside. Google could further distinguish the Pixel by choosing to use Intel's chips. Qualcomm's dominance in the smartphone sector has led to most high-end phones using the same processor each year. Intel's alternatives now offer similar performance, although the Snapdragon is generally more powerful overall. As well as Qualcomm and Intel options, Google is reportedly working on a version of the Pixel that uses a custom chipset it has designed. The role of this chipset is currently uncertain and it may not be used in the final product. In yet another alternative, Google was also collaborating with MediaTek on the Pixel 2. This agreement is now said to have ended.

Rather than increase the megapixels, Google is working to optimise other aspects of the imaging hardware. It will "compensate in extra features" for the lack of a high-megapixel sensor. These changes won't come cheap though. Google is expected to raise the price of the Pixel 2 over the original phone, adding "at least" $50 to all models. The Pixel has already faced criticism for its pricing so the increase isn’t likely to be received well. Google is said to be developing a solution for this too, a lower-cost Pixel that will cater for people reluctant to splash out on the main device. The Pixel "2B" will be a budget-level phone "significantly cheaper" than the Pixel 2. Google is reportedly testing prototypes of the device with various chipsets, optimising its hardware choices both for performance and for price. As ever, details may change before the public release. The launch of any new Pixel phone is likely to be months away and Google is still developing the new models. Last year, the company chose October for its Pixel unveil. Tech companies tend to release products on a regular schedule so the Pixel 2 should release around the same time this year.

TrustedReviews Facebook Twitter Googleplus TVs & Audio Cameras Computing Mobile Home appliances Gaming MWC 2017 Desktop PCs Internet Laptops Monitors PC Components Peripherals More Printers Software Trending: Nintendo Switch Apple Watch 2 iPhone 7 Galaxy S8 Google Pixel iPhone 8 Home / News / Desktop PC News / This gaming PC costs £24,000, and you can actually buy it This gaming PC costs £24,000, and you can actually buy it by Michael Passingham 21 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments What’s better than one insane gaming PC? Two insane gaming PCs, of course. Overclockers UK has unveiled what is quite possibly the most ridiculous two-in-one desktop you can buy in the UK, and it’ll set you back a cool £24,000. It's called the 8Pack OrionX. Why the hell does it cost so much? Let’s dive into the specs and understand what’s happening here. First, it’s worth pointing out that this is a PC built by overclocking champion Ian ‘8Pack’ Parry. Just look at his stats on the HWBot world rankings; this guy is legit. It’ll take Parry six weeks to build a single one of these systems (among his other 8Pack PC building responsibilities), so get your orders (and house remortgage applications) in early. Related: Best gaming PC specs to build yourself (up to £1,500, not £24,000) Yes, again, this is a PC with a second PC buried inside it. PC-ception, if you will. They’re both separate systems; their only relation is that they sit in the same chassis. You could network them together if you wanted, and you can also control overclocking options on the main PC with the secondary system. Primary PC specs Processor: Intel Core i7 6950X overclocked to at least 4.4GHz Motherboard: Asus Rampage V ED 10 Intel X99 Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum 64GB (8 x 8GB) at 2666MHz Graphics: 3 NVIDIA Titan X Pascals in Tri-SLI config with quad option available. Overclocked to 2000MHz+ Primary SSD: Intel 750 1.2TB PCI-E NVMe SSD (watercooled) Secondary SSDs: 2 Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SSDs in RAID 0 HDD Storage: Seagate Barracuda 10TB HDD Secondary PC specs Processor: Intel Core i7 7700K overclocked to at least 5.1GHz Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix Z270I Gaming Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum 16GB (2 x 8GB) at 3200MHz Graphics: NVIDIA Titan X Pascal Primary: SSDs 2 Samsung 960 Polaris 512GB NVME M.2 in RAID 0 HDD: Storage Seagate Barracuda 10TB HDD The highlights of the spec is of course the outer PC’s outrageous 10-core, 20-thread Broadwell-E Intel Core i7 6950X with a guaranteed overclock of at least 4.4GHz, attached to an Asus X99 Rampage 5 Extreme motherboard and 64GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum 2,666MHz DRR4 memory. Configured correctly with whatever software you’re planning on using, be it video rendering or calculating millions of Pi digits, it’ll know what it’s doing before you. You’ll have spotted those three Nvidia GeForce Titan X Pascal graphics cards. Each one is overclocked to over 2,000MHz, which is a significant boost over the 1,531MHz factory boost clock. This is made possible using a custom-built, dedicated liquid cooling loop. This differs from a regular liquid-cooled PC, which will usually only have a single loop shared between the processor and graphics card. Here, the two PC’s two processors get their own loops alongside a third loop for the three primary graphics card and the fourth secondary card in the second system. Related: Best Z170 motherboards to buy Primary storage comes from a 1.2TB, liquid-cooled Intel 750 1.2TB SSD over PCI-E, with secondary storage from a pair of Samsung 850 Pro SSDs in RAID 0 for double the speed. Tertiary storage comes from a 10TB Seagate Barracuda hard disk. Initial graphics benchmarks point to a 3DMark Firestrike score of nearly 41,000. For comparison, a single consumer-level GTX 1080 will manage a little over half that at best. There’s definitely a case of diminishing returns with the more GPUs you add to a system, so if you’re after the best bang-for-buck, you’ll be looking elsewhere. If we were looking at the secondary system in isolation, we’d call it a monster. But as a nested PC inside another, better PC, it becomes harder to remember just how powerful it is. Related: Best SSDs for your gaming rig The Intel Core i7-7700K is a highly-capable quad-core chip overclocked to 5.1GHz, paired with 16GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum 3,200MHz DDR4 memory. There’s a fourth Titan Pascal in here as well for even more 3D performance. It’s all running on a pair of high-end Samsung 960 Pro SSDs in a RAID 0 configuration. There’s a 10TB Seagate Barracuda hard disk in here as well. All of this is inside a Phanteks Enthoo Elite, and the whole thing is powered by a single 2000W power supply. Why? Great question. We suppose the answer is ‘why not?’, but as a buying guide site we pride ourselves on good buying advice. This is the sort of PC(s) you would buy if you have two heavy workloads running at once. For example, you’re a hardcore gamer but also want to run Bitcoin mining or 3D modelling on the side. You’d game on the secondary system and run your high-end applications on the primary PC. If we were to have one gripe, it’s that the two PCs aren’t more interconnected. Pre-installed remoote desktop software would have been extremely handy to keep an eye on each PC without having to switch between monitors, and the ability to perhaps route a single keyboard and mouse to both PCs would also have been nice as well. But these are gripes. Since you’re paying £24,000 for a PC, you’ll probably be able to request extra features from Overclockers. You’ve earned it. If you can afford one, you can buy an OrionX on Overclockers.co.uk. Related: Intel Core i Processors explained Watch: Acer Predator 21X So will you be buying one of these, or perhaps even two?

The international free software community KDE announced the launch of a KDE-branded laptop on Thursday called the KDE Slimbook. Built for KDE fans across the globe, the new Slimbook promises a highly stable computing experience given that KDE developers are using an identical hardware and software configuration when testing their apps. That means apps and hardware issues are resolved before a new version of KDE’s software is distributed to end users. The new Slimbook is based on the KDE Neon platform and the Plasma Desktop interface. Neon is a software repository based on Ubuntu LTS (which is based on Linux) that provides rapid updates of Qt and KDE software while the rest of the Ubuntu-based components installed on the notebook are updated at a normal pace. KDE Plasma is the visual desktop environment built to enhance the Linux computing experience. More: Lenovo issues a new Yoga 2-in-1 BIOS enabling Linux following conspiracy accusations “Spanish laptop retailer Slimbook approached KDE with the idea to offer KDE-branded laptops that come pre-installed with Plasma and KDE Applications,” said KDE’s Thomas Pfeiffer in an update. “We were excited about the idea, and put our designers and developers to the task of creating a branding for such a device and making sure that KDE neon runs without any hardware-related issues on it.” There are two versions of the KDE Slimbook: one with an Intel Core i5-6200U processor and one with an Intel Core i7-6500U, both of which are sixth-generation Skylake chips. Here is a brief rundown of each: Core i5-6200U Core i7-6500U Release date: Q3 of 2015 Q3 of 2015 Cores: 2 2 Threads: 4 4 Base speed: 2.30GHz 2.50GHz Boost speed: 2.80GHz 3.10GHz Cache: 3MB 4MB Maximum power draw: 15 watts 15 watts Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 520 Intel HD Graphics 520 Graphics speed (base): 300MHz 300MHz Graphics speed (max): 1,000MHz 1,050MHz Outside the two processor differences, the KDE Slimbooks are identical in their hardware specifications and options. Here they are: Screen size: 13.3 inches Resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 System memory: 4GB DDR3 @ 1,600MHz 8GB DDR3 @ 1,600MHz 16GB DDR3 @ 1,600MHz Storage (Samsung or Crucial): 120GB mSATA SSD 250GB mSATA SSD 500GB mSATA SSD Connectivity: Wireless N Wireless AC Bluetooth 4.0 Ports: 2x USB 3.0 1x Ethernet 1x Mini HDMI1x SD card reader Keyboard: LED-backlit Webcam: Yes Battery: 6,800mAh Size: 13 x 8.66 x 0.70 inches Weight: 3 pounds Outer material: Aluminum Color: Silver According to the specs, the operating system is marked as KDE Neon “for now.” Pfeiffer said that the KDE community is open other to distributions that can be pre-installed with Plasma, offering customers a choice of multiple operating systems. He also pointed out that the KDE Slimbook was created for those who love KDE software, and was not built primarily for those who are active contributors in the KDE community. “We were not content with the quality of laptops available on the market,” explains KDE. “The majority shipped with proprietary and locked-in software solutions, filled with not-uninstallable bloat where the user was left at the mercy of whatever the company selling them a laptop saw fit for them to work with. As creators and makers we knew what it meant to be locked into a set of solutions defined by others.” To purchase the KDE Slimbook, head here. The Intel Core i5 version has a starting price of $779 and the Core i7 model has a starting price of $908. Customers can only configure the amount of system memory, the amount of storage, the wireless connectivity component, and the keyboard layout. Also watch: Share

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around cloud services.  (Richard Drew / The Associated Press file photo)   By Alistair Barr Jillian WardBloomberg Fri., Jan. 27, 2017 Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp., which all posted quarterly results Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 per cent to $3.4 billion (U.S.) in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own web services. Article Continued Below More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner Inc. estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. In early trading Friday, Microsoft was up 1.6 per cent, Google was down 1.1 per cent and Intel gained less than 1 per cent. Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 per cent in the fiscal second quarter.  “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. chief financial officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 per cent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 per cent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.  Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 per cent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Read more about: Apple, Microsoft Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

Sleek yet sturdy build. Long battery life. USB-C and Thunderbolt ports. Comfortable keyboard. Thin bezels maximize screen real estate. Fanless processor keeps things quiet and cool. Cons Limited connectivity options. May require additional dongles and accessories. Awkward webcam angle when used in Laptop mode. Bottom Line With the XPS 13 2-in-1, Dell marries the strengths of its ultraportables with the flexibility of a convertible laptop. You'll probably need dongles, but strong performance and ultimate portability make it a worthy contender. By Victoria Song Looking at the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (9365) (starts at $999.99; $1,299.99 as tested), you'd be forgiven for feeling a sense of déjà vu. Thanks to a new fanless Intel Kaby Lake Y-series processor, this 2-in-1 is thinner and quieter than the Dell XPS 13 Touch while retaining all of its strengths. But you may have to borrow a bit of courage from Apple lovers as there are only two ports: USB-C and Thunderbolt 3. This, along with slightly stronger overall performance and battery life from the HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx, means the XPS 13 2-in-1 falls just shy of nabbing our Editors' Choice for high-end convertibles. But if dongles don't scare you and you have cash to splash, you'd be remiss if you didn't put this versatile 2-in-1 on your short list. //Compare Similar Products Compare HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Yoga 910   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Aspire R 14   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Aspire Switch 11 V (SW5-173-632W)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Asus Transformer Mini (T102HA-D4-GR)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Yoga 710 (11")   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Book (2016, Intel Core i7)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Microsoft Surface Pro 4   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Samsung Notebook 7 Spin   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Lenovo Yoga 900S   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Apple MacBook Pro 13-Inch (2016)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Acer Spin 7 (SP714-51-M4YD)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Thinner, Quieter... Both the original XPS 13 and this 2-in-1 variation feature the same machined aluminum lids, carbon fiber palm rests, and super-thin 5.2mm InfinityEdge bezels around the display. Visually, the main differences on the 2-in-1 are the steel-wrapped aluminum hinges (of course), the Windows Hello–compliant fingerprint reader next to the touchpad, and the 720p webcam centered underneath the Dell logo. The 2-in-1 is also just a skosh thinner, measuring 0.54 inch at the hinge and tapering down to 0.32 inch at its thinnest point. It also has a width of 11.98 inches and a depth of 7.8 inches. That's more compact than both the Spectre x360 (0.5 by 12 by 8.6 inches, HWD) and the Lenovo Yoga 910 (0.56 by 12.72 by 8.84 inches), our Editors' Choice pick for midrange convertibles. This makes it easy to slip into any bag, and at 2.7 pounds, it won't break your back if you can't find a seat on your daily commute. View All 9 Photos in Gallery The nifty thing about the XPS 13 2-in-1 is that it fits a 13.3-inch display onto an 11-inch chassis. This configuration features a full HD 1,920-by-1,080-resolution touch screen, which is par for the course for the category. While a QHD+ (3,200-by-1,800) screen is a configuration option, full HD is perfectly fine if you primarily stream videos from YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix. And as is the case with other convertible-hybrids, you can use this one in four different modes: Laptop, Tablet, Stand, and Tent. Each is comfortable, though the placement of the webcam makes Stand and Laptop modes less than ideal for video conferencing. Unless you don't mind the person you're talking to looking up at your chin or up your nostrils, you're better off using Tent mode—though that could be frustrating, too, if you like to type and send notes while Skyping. Like the Lenovo Yoga 900S, the XPS 2-in-1 features a fanless Intel processor, which means it's super quiet and there's less heat. A quieter computer is always nice, but the cool factor is particularly good if you're using the XPS in Tablet mode on your lap for long periods of time. When it comes to work, the XPS 2-in-1 is more than capable of handling your average office tasks. The keyboard is comfortable for long typing sessions, you get extra screen space thanks to the thin bezels, and the touchpad is responsive. But I/O port options are limited. Like the 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro and the Acer Spin 7, there are no USB Type-A ports. On the left side, you get a Thunderbolt 3 port, a headset jack, a battery gauge indicator, and one speaker. The right side houses a Noble lock slot, a USB-C port, a microSD card slot, the power button, and another speaker. Both the Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C ports feature PowerShare capabilities and can double as DisplayPort connectors. Dell includes a USB-C–to–USB-Type-A adapter, though that's not quite enough on its own if you want to use an existing thumb drive, simultaneously charge your phone and laptop, and hook up the 2-in-1 to another monitor. So you can either get creative with the accessories you already have, work around the inconveniences, or shell out for a small arsenal of dongles and adapters. Dell sent us a special power brick that features a USB Type-A port for charging, which is a helpful option but will cost you an extra $40. This won't really be an issue once USB-C becomes more prevalent, but it is an annoyance for the time being. Rounding out features, the XPS 2-in-1 has dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 for wireless connectivity, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB PCl Express (PCIe)–based solid-state drive (SSD). This is a decent setup if you're committed to cutting the cord and mostly stream videos, as opposed to storing them locally. The XPS 13 2-in-1 is covered by a one-year limited warranty. Under the Hood Inside, the XPS 13 2-in-1 packs a 1.3GHz Intel Core i7-7Y75 processor with integrated HD Graphics 615, plus 8GB of RAM. That's a combination that results in strong productivity performance at this price. During testing, the 2-in-1 was able to deftly handle multi-tab browsing, streaming, and light productivity tasks. You can see that in its respectable PCMark 8 Work Conventional test score of 3,003 points. It doesn't quite beat out Editors' Choice picks like the Lenovo Yoga 910 (3,197) or the Spectre x360 (3,286), but it's not far off, either. It did, however, outperform the XPS 13 Touch Rose Gold Edition (2,769) and the Lenovo Yoga 900S (2,636), which is powered by the Intel Core m5-6Y54, another fanless processor. See How We Test Laptops It also turned in decent 3D performance, scoring 5,412 points on 3DMark Cloud Gate and 341 points on the more intensive Fire Strike Extreme. That's an improvement over the Lenovo 900S (4,134 on Cloud Gate, 254 on Fire Strike Extreme), but it falls short of the Spectre x360, the Yoga 910, and the XPS 13 Touch. But like its competitors, on our Heaven and Valley gaming tests the XPS 13 2-in-1 wasn't able to reach the 30 frames per second (fps) needed to be smoothly playable, even at midrange graphics settings. If games are a must, you're better off looking at a real gaming laptop. Multimedia scores were also serviceable, though not particularly stellar. The XPS 13 2-in-1 completed our HandBrake encoding test in 3 minutes, 13 seconds, and lagged behind most other comparable systems on Photoshop (3:58). If you spend a lot of time editing photos and videos, or designing graphics, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Spectre x360, and the Yoga 910 are better options. As for staying power, the XPS 13 2-in-1 features a 46Wh battery that lasted an impressive 11 hours, 46 minutes, on our rundown test. That's long enough to get most of the way through a season of Game of Thrones, a transpacific flight to Japan, or an all-day writing session at a cafe (where open power outlets are a scarce commodity). But some rival systems have really upped the competition in this category. The Yoga 910 leads with a ridiculous 21:28, and the Spectre x360 lasts a neat 14 hours. Others hover around the 12-hour mark, like the MacBook Pro (11:53) and the Yoga 900S (12:06). Portable Productivity The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (9365) occupies an interesting spot in the world of convertible laptops, straddling the line between what we consider midrange and high-end. And while its performance and features are good for its price point, it falls just short in testing against our high-end Editors' Choice pick, the HP Spectre x360 13-w023dx—which is roughly the same price. The same holds true when you compare it with the slightly less expensive Lenovo Yoga 910, our Editors' Choice for midrange 2-in-1s. So why would you opt for the XPS 13 2-in-1? There are plenty of reasons, ranging from its sleek look and excellent build quality to its quiet and cool performance and that little bit of extra screen space. While the lack of USB Type-A ports is irksome now, including Thunderbolt and USB-C does future-proof the XPS 2-in-1 for years to come. Ultimately, if you value a compact form factor and solid productivity performance, the XPS 13 2-in-1 should definitely be on your radar.

We've shown you what Kaby Lake can do for enthusiast and gamer desktop platforms. We've even recently explored optimizing its price/performance ratio through overclocking, and of course, Kaby Lake notebooks led Intel's charge starting in the summer of last year. What we haven't gotten a chance to look at yet is Intel's lowest powered Kaby Lake variant, known as Kaby Lake-Y. Kaby Lake-Y is the the 4.5 - 7 Watt family of processors intended for thin and light, fanless 2-in-1 devices. Fortunately, since this little fella just showed up, we now can offer you a view of performance with the complete Kaby Lake family lineage, at least as it currently exists today...  Dell's XPS 13 2-in-1 - Review In Progress - A Super-Svelte Beauty That's the XPS 13 2-in-1, a 2.7 pound, thinner and lighter version of Dell's venerable 13-inch premium notebook, now with a 360-degree hinge. It also has a smaller 45 Whr battery versus the standard XPS 13's 60 Whr power plant. However, it shares lots of common design features, like the same gorgeous 400-nits 13.3" Infinity Edge display, a PCI Express Solid State Drive, and tasty carbon fiber composite and machined aluminum construction.  However, in what some might consider a bold move for an "XPS" branded product, Dell elected to go with Intel's low power Kaby Lake-Y series of processors, versus the traditional U series commonly found in premium thin notebook designs. Dell did work significant optimizations into the design though, taking advantage of Kaby Lake's TDP-up feature that allow the 4.5 Watt processor to boost higher in Dynamic Power Mode to a 7 Watt power envelope. In addition, Dell took that capability a step further and engineered the XPS 13 2-In-1 to be able to boost to a 9 Watt TDP for short bursts, with a healthy 3.6GHz top end clock speed. Above is a shot of the full Intel Kaby Lake lineage, though what you don't see here is what Intel typically introduces a year or so down the road from initial launch, which are the big iron E-series chips, as the company rolled out fairly recently with Broadwell-E and eventually will for Skylake-E. What we're looking at today is what Kaby Lake can do in its most power-optimized incarnation in the Y-Series family, which is designed for 2-in-1 convertible machines, which are often fanless designs, like Dell's new XPS 13 2-in-1. What Dell sent us was a carefully selected setup with the following specs: XPS 13 2-In-1 Model 9365 Core i7-7Y75 with 4MB Cache, Up To 3.6GHz 8GB LPDDR3-1866MHz 256GB PCIe SSD 1920x1080 FHD Touch Display MSRP $1299 (As tested, starting at $999) That Core i7-7Y75 is the top-end Kaby Lake-Y CPU Intel has to offer currently and Dell pushes it even further in the XPS 13 2-In-1's design to a 9 Watt peak power envelope. We would be remiss if we didn't point out that, yes, Intel has done away almost completely with the "Core m" moniker with Kaby Lake, choosing instead to denote the series in the root of the model number, like it does with the U series (as in Core i7-7Y75). However, the company does list lower-end Core m3 variants of Kaby Lake as such, while i5 and i7 higher-end SKUs are only distinguishable with the Y in the root of the model number. Clear as mud right?  Regardless, here's a quick peek, ahead of our soon-to-be-published full review, of what this new machine can do and what the fastest Kaby Lake-Y setup you can likely buy today can offer in terms of comparable performance.  In these two tests, we see the Dell XPS 13 2-In-1, along with its goosed-up Kaby Lake Core i7-7Y75 chip, take on the likes of full fledged Kaby Lake U series chips like the Core i7-7500U in the standard Dell XPS 13 and ASUS ZenBook 3. As you can see, this new Dell machine hangs with its U-series counterparts just fine, in a virtual dead-heat in SunSpider and a respectable top 3 showing in PCMark 8. In PCMark, the Core i7-7Y75 does line up more akin to last generation Haswell-U 6th generation processors, like the Core i7-6500U and Core i5-6200U, but it's not far behind Kaby Lake U in this test.

Microsoft rose 1.9 percent to $65.50 in premarket trading, while Intel gained 0.4 percent to $37.71 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time and giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks. All three major indexes were on track to post weekly gains. "The market has had a strong, solid rally and there's a pause to evaluate and react to the next set of data and other catalysts that could move the market," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. "Actions speak louder than words and the fact that Trump has signed numerous executive orders since his inauguration continues to heighten hopes of the proposed fiscal stimulus measures materializing," said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Dow e-minis were down 11 points, or 0.05 percent, with 16,071 contracts changing hands at 8:35 a.m. ET (1335 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, with 85,805 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7.25 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 17,615 contracts. Early fourth-quarter earnings have also boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 146 companies that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 69.2 percent have topped expectations. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter with gross domestic product increasing at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists. Another set of data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in December, with non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rising 0.8 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5 percent rise. Starbucks fell 4.2 percent to $56 in premarket trading after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. Google parent Alphabet was down 1 percent at $848.51 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive fell 4.5 percent to $65.15 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates.

Image: MeskPhotography/Shutterstock As the world focuses on science wars in the US, internet of things developments continue unabated across the globe. While the scientific community tears itself apart following the inauguration of US president Donald Trump, within the world of the internet of things (IoT), there was some rather positive news. The European Space Agency had a busy week funding tech companies in Ireland, following up its deal to bring OCE Technology’s software into space with a €633,000 Taoglas deal to commercialise its IoT tech. The people behind Taoglas, provider of antenna products and radio frequency solutions within the IoT ecosystem, have previously been described as the ‘Irish high kings of IoT’. Elsewhere in the world of academia, there was a long-term collaboration between Intel and Dublin City University announced to foster talent and develop advanced technologies for both parties. Some of the key areas of research activity will include IoT and data analytics for application in areas such as connected health, water quality management and STEM education innovations. Across the pond, Intel have IoT to thank for its healthy returns in its latest quarterly earnings report, as it revealed earnings of $16.4bn, compared with $14.9bn at the same time last year. This was largely down to Intel’s IoT division showing a 16pc year-on-year growth margin. Here are some of the other global IoT stories you might have missed during the week. Ericsson out east Ericsson is trailing new cellular IoT technologies in China, after striking up a deal with China Mobile Group Shanghai Company and Mobike, a bike-sharing service. Operating on a live network, the trial utilises Ericsson’s tech to allow Mobike’s IoT-enabled bikes to be located more accurately, as well as extending the coverage beyond current barriers. Moving forward, the new technologies will also significantly reduce the time taken to unlock the bikes and users will enjoy ‘open upon scanning’ without waiting. Saying his group is excited by the partnership, Gang Huang, deputy GM of China Mobile Group Shanghai Company, wants to build a new suite of technologies. “Ericsson is determined to drive the development and commercialisation of the cellular IoT ecosystem and, in doing so, unleash the full potential of the networked society,” said Ericsson’s Chris Houghton. Threats are mounting AdaptiveMobile has released new research into the biggest mobile threats of 2016, and how 2017’s mobile security landscape will take shape. The security company expects to see a large-scale signalling attack on an operator network in 2017, a sophistication of messaging threats and a rise in phishing attacks as well as IoT attacks running behind the public firewall. The research identifies five vectors through which cyber-criminals made their attacks in 2016, from SMS to OTT carriers. Infographic: AdaptiveMobile Alexa on the road Amazon’s AI Alexa is making inroads into an increasing number of homes through the Echo device, but it’s focusing on roads for now. Hyundai and Volkswagen (VW) cars are the latest to embrace the technology (Ford and BMW have already made moves). VW is the first to actually install Alexa directly into the vehicle’s infotainment system, with drivers able to control lights, heating or entertainment functions through connected devices. One clever tweak allows users to ask Alexa how much petrol is in the car, from the comfort of their home. It’s not a whole lot different for Hyundai, with the manufacturer ‘bringing the car to Alexa’, rather than the other way around, whatever that means. This can be upgraded in old Hyundai vehicles. “We are first and foremost trying to give customers what they want,” said Cason Grover, who manages Hyundai Motor America’s connected car programme. “We know that customers have oriented and invited certain experiences into their life via their phones and via the devices in the home.” Google fancies some Raspberry Pi Earlier this week, Google provided a market research survey to the makers’ industry, sounding out what people want, when and how. Following that, news of a Raspberry Pi project emerged, with Google deciding between bringing IoT devices to its Pi 3 platform, or Intel’s Edison platform. “We don’t have any specifics to announce right now, but we’re excited to keep sharing open-source machine learning tools with the community – stay tuned for more this year,” a Google spokesman told CIO. Raspberry Pi seems enthusiastic, blogging the significance of this project’s potential. Noting the huge range of tools developed by Google (Home, Maps, Google Now etc), Raspberry Pi is banging the tech giant’s drum. “The survey will help them get a feel for the Raspberry Pi community, but it’ll also help us get the kinds of services we need,” it reads.

Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) Jan 27, 2017 at 9:31AM After the closing bell on Thursday, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year of 2016. Here's what you need to know. Intel's fourth-quarter results: The raw numbers Metric Q4 2016 Q4 2015 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $16.4 billion $14.9 billion 10% Net income $3.6 billion $3.6 billion Flat GAAP EPS $0.73 $0.74 (1%) Data source: Intel (PDF). What happened with Intel this quarter? The fourth quarter continued the business trends Intel established in the last few reports, with data center and Internet of Things products rising in prominence. The lumpy non-volatile memory segment led the way in the fourth quarter with a 25% year-over-year sales increase. For the full year, the memory division's sales actually declined by 1%. Among the more predictable business segments, the Internet of Things group saw sales rising 16% in the fourth quarter, while data-center revenues increased by 8%. Client-computing sales grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 2% in fiscal year 2016. Within the data-center and client-computing segments, unit volumes fell year over year, but increasing average sale prices more than made up for that trend. Desktop volumes are declining faster than notebooks, and Intel is selling fewer products designed for x86 tablets these days. The client-computing group also boosted its operating income by 30%, accounting for 62% of Intel's total segment profits. That ratio stood at 53% in the year-ago quarter. Intel's management provided detailed guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year of 2017, as follows: In the first quarter, revenues are seen rising 7% year over year, to $14.8 billion. GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings should stop at $0.56 per share For the full year, total sales should hold steady at roughly $59.4 billion. GAAP earnings are expected to rise 19%, landing near $2.53 per share. Capital expenses should approach $12 billion, up from $9.6 billion in 2016.  Image source: Intel. What management had to say Intel CEO Brian Krzanich saw 2016 playing out as a period of transformation, integrating the $16.7 billion Altera acquisition and investing to exploit future growth opportunities. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," Krzanich said in a prepared statement. "I'm pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future." Looking ahead Intel will flesh out its current strategy in more detail on February 9 when the company holds its annual investor conference. As an Intel shareholder, I can't wait to hear more about that drastic increase in capital spending, and in what direction this investment will move Intel. Anders Bylund owns shares of Intel.

Inclusion of a key feature in future cellular modems could help Apple rely less on Qualcomm, a company it just launched litigation against. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 8:21AM With the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has ever enjoyed. Image source: Apple.  Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA. Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety of Apple's cellular modem needs. Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that "Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and chipset supply terms," the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read. I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and today there is an observation I would like to share regarding Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones. Apple's component costs could come down if Intel succeeds in implementing CDMA Based on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain features enabled, compared with variants without those features enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work. Image source: Qualcomm.  What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a "monopolistic premium." The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the opportunity for Intel. If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open the door to a couple of possibilities: Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It could be a true "second source" for all the iPhones that Apple ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment). Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular modem. Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems. This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and, ultimately, net profit. To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20 for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7, Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips; the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel. If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year. That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are significant. Intel needs to execute The key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper modems. The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume -- whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate. In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip business probably isn't going to sting Qualcomm that much. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on the right track. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

During the BETT 2017 convention in London, Lenovo revealed its latest products for the educational market that included updated ThinkPad 11e and ThinkPad 11e Yoga laptops. Both are part of Microsoft’s new “Intune for Education” program aimed to push Windows 10 into the educational system and seemingly target the low-priced Chromebook market. However, Lenovo knows many of its customers love Chrome OS, and plans to ship Chromebook versions of these two models as well. But that’s not all. Lenovo also plans to introduce the Lenovo N23 Chromebook next month followed by the Lenovo N23 Yoga Chromebook in April, and then the Lenovo N24 laptop later this year. However, as shown in the table below, Lenovo’s new Chromebooks targeting the educational sector will still be a cheaper option than the Windows 10 units on the pricing front. Whether or not that rumored Windows 10 licensing fee reduction applied to these laptops is unknown for now. Windows 10 Chrome OS ThinkPad 11e: February Starting @ $519 ($419 for Shape the Future) May Starting @ $369 ThinkPad 11e Yoga: February Starting @ $599 ($499 for Shape the Future) May Starting @ $449 Lenovo N24: Mid 2017 Pricing unknown N/A Lenovo N23: N/A February Starting @ $199 Lenovo N23 Yoga: N/A April Starting @ $279 Despite the announcement, Lenovo didn’t provide any hardware details regarding the upcoming laptops, nor have the units appeared on the company’s website. All we currently have to go on is a general list of features for each until the products show up online. More: Lenovo’s Legion Y720 is a laptop designed specifically for virtual reality For starters, the following table shows the ThinkPad 11e laptops with Windows and Chrome OS that Lenovo plans to replace next month. There’s really no difference between the “vanilla” clamshell models and the convertible “Yoga” units save for the obvious screen flexibility with the Yoga models, and the added Windows 7 Pro option for the clamshell models. ThinkPad 11e Windows ThinkPad 11e Chrome OS Form factor: Clamshell Convertible (Yoga only) Clamshell Convertible (Yoga only) Operating system: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Pro Windows 7 Pro Chrome OS Screen size: 11.6 inches 11.6 inches Resolution: 1,366 x 768 1,366 x 768 Processor: Intel Core i3-6100U Intel Celeron N3150 Intel Pentium 4405U Intel Celeron N3150 Graphics: Up to Intel HD 520 Integrated Intel graphics Memory: Up to 8GB DDR3L @ 1,600MHz Up to 4GB DDR3L @ 1,600MHz Storage: 128GB SSD 192GB SSD 256GB SSD 16GB eMMC Connectivity: Wireless N Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless N Bluetooth 4.0 Battery: 42 Watt hour 42 Watt hour Webcam: 720p 720p Ports: 1x HDMI 1.4 2x USB 3.0 1x SD card reader 1x Ethernet port 1x HDMI 1.4 2x USB 3.0 1x SD card reader Size: 11.81 x 8.27 x 0.88 inches 11.81 x 8.27 x 0.88 inches Weight: Starting at 3.3 pounds Starting at 3.3 pounds As for what the new ThinkPad 11e and ThinkPad Yoga 11e models will provide, here is what Lenovo offers in the details department: The latest Intel processors. Brighter screens. Gorilla glass protection. A water-resistant keyboard. New and improved mechanically anchored keys. Up to 10 hours of battery life. Yoga 11e comes with a pen supporting Windows Ink. Next, we have the upcoming N23 Chromebooks that will be served up in traditional clamshell and convertible “Yoga” flavors. Lenovo said the N23 Yoga Chromebook will be the company’s very first Chromebook with an ARM-based processor. That means the device will be optimized for Android apps sold in the Google Play Store even though all Chromebooks launching in 2017 and thereafter will work just fine with Android apps. “Simple to set-up and manage, both N23 Chromebooks offer students a personalized user experience simply by signing in with their Google Chrome ID while teachers and IT administrators have peace of mind and ultimate flexibility with a web-based management console,” Lenovo said. Here are the N23 Chromebook highlights: Traditional clamshell and Yoga flavors. Reinforced ports and hinges. Mechanically anchored keys. Water-resistant keyboard. 10 hours of battery life. Finally, we have the Lenovo N24 convertible notebook based on Windows 10. Given it won’t be made available until sometime around this summer, the company revealed very little about its details. However, what we know is that it will sport an 11.6-inch IPS screen that can rotate a full 360 degrees. This screen will support 10-point touch input and Lenovo’s Active Pen when the Lenovo N24 arrives later this year. Also watch: Share

These are its first Optane storage solutions. Intel will also be releasing Optane memory DIMMs to fit DDR4 slots in servers, PCs and so on. In an earnings call a few hours ago, in the wake of its latest financials, Intel's CEO said Optane memory DIMMs had started to ship to partners for testing. While we have seen impressive demonstrations of Optane storage solutions, less is known about the impact that 3D XPoint technology will have when used in place of RAM DIMMs. Intel gave us some insight into its future plans for 3D XPoint memory solutions a couple of years back when we first heard about this new non-volatile memory tech. As alluded to in the video above, Optane is expected to "completely rewrite the rules of the hot-warm-cold storage pyramid" which determines data server performance, due to its nature of being nearly as fast as DRAM but with similar costs to SSD NAND storage. With Optane memory DIMMs available it is thought servers will be able to "greatly expand" the high performance hot storage capacity available. Ahead of this Optane tech SSDs are already arriving to perk up the 'warm storage' performance available - without breaking the bank. It is evident that the above is the reasoning behind Brian Krzanich's statement in the earnings call last night, saying that the "differential technology," provided by Optane products could change PC and server architectures. Data Centre is a very successful segment for Intel and hopefully any architectural revolution in that industry thanks to Optane will trickle down to the PCs of tomorrow. Already, for example, new Lenovo, Dell, Intel and HP PCs and SuperO motherboards have been announced with Optane storage options.

Miller January 26, 2017 10 Comments The PC has a lot of life left, as proven by the latest announcements at CES. Every year people seem surprised that there's a lot of activity at CES when it comes to PCs and notebooks. I guess it's just that the PC category has been slowly shrinking over the past few years, though the gaming and corporate segments of the market continue to do well. In any case, this year's show demonstrated a number of advances that indicate the PC still has a lot of life left in it. To begin with, Intel announced some new versions of its Kaby Lake processors—the seventh generation of its Core i family and the third iteration using a 14nm FinFET process—including the high-end Corei7-7700K. (ExtremeTech has some benchmarks here.) Overall, the 7000 series looks to be a nice but not huge upgrade over the Skylake versions, offering a bit higher clock speed and a bit better power envelope. Still, it's good to have a full line of new chips out there—it will spur a lot of new upgrades. Of course, Intel is pointing to much larger leaps in performance compared to three-year-old machines, claiming 25 percent better performance on productivity applications and 35 percent faster performance creating, stitching, and sharing 4K 360° videos. Some of the more interesting new features include support for the upcoming Intel Optane memory (based on 3D XPoint technology), decode and encode for HEVC 10-bit and VP9 formats, and Intel Authenticate for hardened security and 2-factor authentication. Intel also showed off a running 2-in-1 design with its 10nm Cannon Lake chips, which are expected to ship toward the end of 2017. (In yesterday's post, I talked a bit about plans for making 10nm chips from the other major foundries.) Meanwhile, competitor AMD is getting closer to the release of its first Ryzen processors, which introduce the new Zen architecture, and look to make AMD much more of a player in the mid- and high-end parts of the PC market. AMD says that the Zen architecture has a number of new features, including what it is calling "SenseMI" technology. That includes new features to better manage energy and increase frequency at the same power, as well as a "neural net" to improve branch predictions, and a smart prefetch, both designed to improve the efficiency of the processors. At the show, AMD announced a series of motherboards that support the processors' AM4 socket from ASRock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, and MSI, designed to support the upcoming X300 and X370 chipsets as part of its "Summit Ridge" series of processors. The company also showed off a variety of sample systems, mostly from smaller vendors. It is still promising that such systems will launch later this quarter. A lot of us are waiting to see how well such systems perform in the real world. AMD has said its "Raven Ridge" series of notebook processors based on the Zen architecture will be out later this year. In addition, AMD also disclosed preliminary details for its next generation graphics architecture, called Vega. This will use a new high-bandwidth memory cache and controller using HBM2 rather than the more common GDDR5 memory. It will also have a new programmable geometry pipeline, a new rasterizer designed to be more power efficient, and flexible compute units that can natively work on 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit operations. Products using this architecture are due in the first half of the year. Competitor Nvidia showed off a new service called GeForce Now, which lets any Windows or Mac user get access to games via a cloud service that runs on the company's GeForce graphics boards, with pricing set at $25 for 20 hours on a GTX 1060 or 10 hours on a GTX 1080. This is slated to be available in early access form in March. In one interesting departure from the norm, Qualcomm showed off a laptop running a test version of Windows using its Snapdragon 835 processor. This should be able to run 32-bit legacy X86 applications through emulation, as well as modern Windows Store applications. It will be interesting to see both pricing and performance when such machines come to market. Business Notebooks On the PC front, I'm most interested in the improvements in corporate notebooks, which seem to be getting thinner and lighter, as well as offering the newest generation of Intel processors. Lenovo showed off a new version of its Carbon X1 that is notably lighter and smaller than the previous model, at just 2.5 pounds (compared to 2.75 for the previous version), and also boasts better battery life (at a claimed 15.5 hours compared with 11 hours; although as usual I almost never get the claimed battery performance from any vendor in the real world) and USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 support. It should be available in February. The touchscreen-based 2-in-1 version, the X1 Yoga, was also updated and should also include similar battery improvement and USB-C/Thunderbolt support. It also offers a new keyboard design. The X1 tablet has also been updated. HP's newest entry is the EliteBook x360, which brings the convertible kinds of features found in the company's 13.3-inch Spectre x360 2-in-1 to the enterprise line. HP is claiming 16 hours and 30 minutes of battery life–which would be longer than any of its competitors—an optional 4K display, and a self-healing BIOS. The company also announced a new 15.6-inch version of its Spectre x360, with a 4K display and GeForce 940MX graphics. Both should be available this month. Dell introduced magnetic resonance charging with its new Latitude 7285 2-in-1, using technology from WiTricity including WiGig docking. This should be out later in the year. The company also introduced upgrades to its Latitude 700 series of "Ultrabooks", which are available now, as well as a new Latitude 5285 2-in-1, due out at the end of next month. Among other vendors, Asus introduced its new Asus Pro, with a 14-inch full HD display at just 2.3 pounds, while LG showed off three new models in its Gram family, with 13.3, 14, and 15.6-inch full HD displays. These are extremely light, but with two different sizes of battery available, so you could get a 13.3 inch version at just 2.07 pounds, with a 60 Wh battery and claimed battery life of 24 hours (with the usual caveats), or a version with a 34 Wh battery that weighs just 1.83 pounds. It was also interesting to see Samsung's newest take on Chromebooks, with the Chromebook Pro using a Core m3 Skylake processor, and the Chromebook Plus, using an undisclosed ARM processor. Both include 12.3-inch quad-HD touch screens, a stylus, and weigh 2.38 pounds. Gaming Notebooks There were also a number of new gaming laptops. Lenovo offered a new name for its gaming systems, calling it Legion, with the Y520 and Y720, both with Core i7 processors, but the first including a 4K display and GeForce GTX1080 graphics card. Dell showed off a number of new systems, including new versions of its Alienware 13, 15, and 17 laptops, with new processors and Nvidia graphics. In addition, the company showed its Inspiron 15 7000 series, which can include the latest processors, GeForce 1050 or 1050 Ti graphics, and full HD or 4K displays, starting at $799. Samsung stepped into the market with its new Odyssey gaming notebook, which will come in 15.6 and 17.3-inch sizes. Desktop Innovations A number of companies showed new desktop ideas, but the most interesting was probably the Dell Canvas. This is a 27-inch QHD (2560-by-1440) display that can connect to any other PC and be used at an angle or flat on a desk for drawing or other work that involves a pen. It looked a bit like Microsoft's larger Surface Studio, and will require the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Edition. Even higher end is a new UltraSharp 32 Ultra 8k monitor. And both LG and Samsung showed great looking curved monitors as well. I also liked the look of the HP Envy Curved All-in-One 34, with a widescreen WQHD display. Meanwhile, Dell showed off new versions of its XPS and Precision all-in-ones. Finally, I was a bit intrigued by a company called Endless, which makes tiny computers with its own operating system (Endless OS), effectively a stripped-down Linux distribution with all the tools and documentation, including articles and video designed to help people learn how to program. The company has been pushing the concept for a while, but is now entering the U.S. market, offering ARM-based configurations as well as a new model in a wood case, including ARM and Celeron versions. It's a neat idea, particularly if you have a child who wants to learn to code on a real machine. Back to top Previous : The Technology That May Drive The Next Generation of Phones ... By Michael J.

Inclusion of a key feature in future cellular modems could help Apple rely less on Qualcomm, a company it just launched litigation against. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 8:21AM With the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win that Intel has ever enjoyed. Image source: Apple.  Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA. Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets from a company called VIA Telecom,  presumably in a bid to allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety of Apple's cellular modem needs. Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm alleging, among other things, that "Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and chipset supply terms," the complaint filed on Jan. 20 read. I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and today there is an observation I would like to share regarding Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones. Apple's component costs could come down if Intel succeeds in implementing CDMA Based on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain features enabled, compared with variants without those features enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work. Image source: Qualcomm.  What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a "monopolistic premium." The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the opportunity for Intel. If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open the door to a couple of possibilities: Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It could be a true "second source" for all the iPhones that Apple ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment). Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular modem. Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems. This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and, ultimately, net profit. To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20 for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7, Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips; the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel. If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year. That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are significant. Intel needs to execute The key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper modems. The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume -- whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate. In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip business probably isn't going to sting Qualcomm that much. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on the right track. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

News Week In Review: Dow Hits 20K On Trump Rally; Boeing Hot, Google Iced The Dow industrials hit 20,000 as the Trump rally fueled infrastructure and financial stocks. (Adobe) IBD STAFF 1/27/2017 Reprints The Dow Jones industrial average hit 20,000 as the major averages rallied to fresh record highs on President Trump's early policy moves. Earnings reports generally were positive, but Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Starbucks (SBUX) were among those with disappointing results. M&A deals, buzz and rejections were rife. Dow Industrials Hit Milestone As Banks, Infrastructure Stocks Lead The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3% for the week, topping 20,000 for the first time. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 also hit record highs, up 1.9% and 1%, respectively, amid a slew of earnings, including Intel (INTC), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA) and Boeing (BA). President Trump authorized a border wall and two key oil pipelines, lifting a wide variety of construction and materials related firms such as Caterpillar (CAT) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), but not steel makers. Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) broke out, joining other FANG+ stocks. The 10-year Treasury yield rose, lifting bank stocks. Alphabet Earnings Fall Short Google parent Alphabet said Q4 earnings per share minus items rose 8% to $9.36, below views for $9.64. Total revenue rose 22% to $26.1 billion, topping forecasts for 25.26 billion. Revenue growth slowed from 28% in the prior-year period. The internet search and advertising giant faced tough comparisons with the prior-year quarter, when it launched new advertising products. Capital spending soared 46% to $3.1 billion, which much of that related to its cloud computing efforts. Marketing costs for Google's new Pixel smartphones also were heavy. Alphabet shares fell 1.4% on Friday after hitting record highs earlier in the week. RELATED: Alphabet Q4 EPS Misses Expectations Microsoft Expands As Cloud Business Booms Fiscal Q2 earnings rose 9% to 83 cents a share while revenue climbed 2% to $26.07 billion, beating views for 79 cents and $25.30 billion. Credit a booming cloud computing business, including Azure. Microsoft guided Q3 revenue forecasts higher. Microsoft shares rose nearly 5% for the week, hitting record highs. RELATED: Microsoft Beats Q2 Targets On Cloud Computing Strength Intel, Other Chip Earnings Strong The chipmaker's EPS rose 4%, topping views, while its 10% sales growth was the best in four years. Intel also gave bullish guidance. Intel shares rose 1.1% Friday after breaking out of a base earlier in the week ahead of earnings. Texas Instruments (TXN) also reported strong earnings, while Samsung Electronics credit memory chip gains for its overall Q4 profit revival. Microsemi (MSCC) also had good results, along with chip gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC). But mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), facing FTC charges and Apple lawsuits over its licensing practices, reported mixed results. RELATED: Intel Q4 Earnings, Sales Top Expectations, Revenue Guidance Also Beats U.S. Economic Malaise Hits 11 Years The economy expanded at a 1.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, below views for 2.2% and not much more than half of Q3's 3.5% gain. For 2016, U.S. GDP grew just 1.6%, the 11th straight year below 3%. Meanwhile, durable goods orders unexpectedly fell for a second straight month in December. New-home sales tumbled to a 10-month low, though several homebuilders remained bullish after reporting solid earnings. Starbucks, McDonald's Revivals Doubted Starbucks (SBUX) reported its weakest earnings growth in five years, though that met views. Sales missed forecasts with customer traffic down 2%. The coffee shop giant, which also cut its revenue outlook, said its mobile order and pay was so popular that it created bottlenecks at order pick up, turning off some patrons. Starbucks shares fell 4% on Friday. Meanwhile, McDonald's (MCD) topped EPS and sales targets but U.S. comps fell as investors questioned if the momentum from the all-day breakfast menu has run out. McDonald's tested key support levels initially but closed the week up 0.5%. RELATED: Too Much Of A Good Thing? This Weighed On Starbucks' U.S. Performance McDonald's Stock Tests Key Support Amid Turnaround Doubts Judge Blocks Aetna-Humana Deal A federal judge ruled that the $37 billion Aetna (AET)-Humana (HUM) merger would violate antitrust laws by unduly reducing competition among health insurers. Aetna, which owes Humana a $1 billion breakup fee, may appeal. The deal also throws into doubt the proposed $48 billion Anthem (ANTM)-Cigna (CI) merger deal, which the Justice Department also opposes.

AK Steel (AKS) topped views Tuesday, but shares reversed sharply lower on a weak pricing outlook. Steel Dynamics (STLD), which had decent earnings late Tuesday, tumbled Wednesday. Larger peers U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE), which both report on Jan. 31, also sold off. But many of the steel makers rebounded Thursday and Friday. On the upside, specialty steel firm Allegheny Steel (ATI) delivered stellar earnings Tuesday, sending shares up 31% that day.

Boeing reported Q4 EPS and revenue above analyst views. Its guidance was cautious, but its 787 Dreamliner is now cash flow positive,which bodes well for future stock buybacks and dividend increases. Boeing shares broke out of a base, hitting record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported Q4 earnings and revenue above analyst views with aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, soaring 23% to $5.41 billion. It expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year. But Lockheed gave weak guidance amid continued concerns about F-35 costs, sending shares lower. Northrop Grumman (NOC) beat on Q4 views while Raytheon (RTN) fell short. Like Boeing and Lockheed, they gave weak guidance. General Dynamics (GD) reported strong earnings and gave bullish long-term guidance.

Verizon reported a mixed Q4, with revenue falling 5.4% but beating estimates while EPS was light. Wireless margins missed. Management pushed back its goal of returning to wireless service growth to 2018. The close of Verizon's purchase of Yahoo (YHOO) will be delayed until Q2 as regulators look into its data breaches. AT&T (T) reported in-line Q4 EPS, with revenue and EBITDA slightly below consensus. AT&T again lost wireless postpaid phone subscribers. AT&T remained upbeat on regulatory approval of its Time Warner (TWX) acquisition. Comcast (CMCSA) Q4 earnings topped views amid solid subscriber gains. The cable TV firm plans to buy back $5 billion in shares in 2017, hiked its dividend and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Comcast plans to launch its wireless service buy midyear.

Along with bullish guidance, the results suggested a multiyear slump disk-drive shipments may have bottomed.

Pic: Shutterstock 27 Jan 2017 at 13:26, Gareth Corfield Intel's profits dipped slightly in the last quarter of 2016, with income for the entire year down by 9 per cent. Following the 5 per cent hit its share price took when the quarter's forward guidance was published in October last year, Intel hasn't failed to disappoint investors. Although revenues were up year-on-year, from $14.9bn in the fourth quarter last year to $16.3bn in Q416, profits shrank by $50m – dipping to $3.56bn from $3.61bn. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," Brian Krzanich, Intel's chief exec, said in a canned statement. That transformative year includes decimating the company workforce by firing 12,000 as its response to the ongoing collapse of the desktop PC market. Delving into the business segments, Intel's IoT group revenues were $2.6bn, up 15 per cent year-on-year for Q4, with its security group posting revenues of $2.2bn for the same period, up 9 per cent year-on-year. The data centre group posted $4.67bn in revenue for the quarter, up by 8 per cent on the group's 2015 Q4 revenues. Revenues for the full year grew from £34.7bn in 2015 to $36.2bn last year. Profits, however, were down by a full billion over the 12-month period, from 2015's $11.4bn to $10.3bn. "I'm pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future," chipped in Krzanich, who didn't find space in his canned quotes to note that Intel's forward guidance for financial year 2017 states that Chipzilla's revenues will be "flat". The firm's share price dropped from $37.70 at the close of play on the NASDAQ last night to $37.60 at the time of writing. ® Sponsored: DevOps and continuous delivery Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Regular or premium?

Credit: Intel More like this Intel's Optane: What users can expect in PCs and when it will ship Intel's silence on Optane SSDs raises questions about launch and focus Lenovo's ThinkPad T570 will have Intel's superfast Optane storage Video SanDisk crams 200GB onto MicroSD Intel's Optane technology is already shipping in the form of storage, but you'll have to wait until next year to buy Optane memory modules. Optane is a new class of nonvolatile memory and storage based on 3D Xpoint, which was developed jointly by Intel and Micron. Intel's first Optane products, announced this month at CES, are low-capacity SSDs that fit into the storage slots of PCs. Optane memory DIMMs are different. They're intended to replace DRAM in servers and PCs. The DIMMs will fit into DDR4 slots. Intel has started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing and hopes to release final products next year. In demonstrations by Intel, Optane SSDs have performed 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. PC makers have said that game play, PC bootup and applications are all faster with Optane SSDs. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Less is known about Optane memory DIMMs, but Intel has shipped the units out to enterprise hardware makers for testing. Intel has said Optane memory can be 10 times denser than DRAM. The base technology of both types of Optane products, 3D Xpoint, is a bridge between memory and storage, said Brian Krzanich, Intel's CEO, during an earnings call on Thursday. Optane is "differential technology" that could change PC and server architectures, Krzanich said. Intel has also floated the idea that Optane could unite storage and memory. For example, one Optane unit could serve as both storage and DRAM. Optane's ability to move large amounts of data faster inside computers and data centers could help speed up machine-learning tasks, Krzanich said. Optane also aligns with Intel's goal to focus more on data-center technologies, Krzanich said. In April, Intel made data-center products a centerpiece of its future strategy as it tried to break a longtime reliance on PCs. But PC chips took in more than half of Intel's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $16.4 billion, growing by $1.5 billion from the same quarter last year. Net income was $3.6 billion, down about 1 percent. Revenue for the Client Computing Group, which deals in PC chips, was up $9.1 billion, growing by 4 percent compared with the same quarter of the previous year. PC chip revenue got a boost from higher average selling prices of laptops and desktops. Desktop product shipments went down 9 percent, but prices went up 2 percent. Laptop product shipments were flat, but average selling prices were up 3 percent. Sales of PCs with higher-end chips like Core i7 were strong during the holiday season, Krzanich said. In particular, gaming PCs did really well. The Data Center Group, which deals in server chips and data-center equipment, recorded revenue of $4.7 billion, growing by 8 percent. Intel's Internet of Things Group had revenue of $726 million, growing 16 percent.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 27 January 2017 | MYT 6:09 PM Data centre growth drives Intel's fourth-quarter revenue, profit beat Better than expected: Intel CEO Brian Krzanich speaking during a press conference at CES in Las Vegas, Jan 4. Revenue from the company's data centre business rose 8.4% in the fourth quarter. — Reuters Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilising PC market and growth in its data centre business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data centre business rose 8.4% to US$4.67bil (RM20.7bil) in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3% to US$9.13bil (RM40.46bil). Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments – which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations – fell by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9% decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilising demand. "In the data centre group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centres, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data centre, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8% to US$16.37bil (RM72.54bil), beating the average analysts' estimate of US$15.75bil (RM69.8bil), according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned US$0.79 (RM3.50) per share, beating estimates of US$0.74 (RM3.28) per share. However, the company said its net income fell to US$3.56bil (RM15.78bil), or US$0.73 (RM3.23) per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, from US$3.61bil (RM16bil), or US$0.74 per share, a year earlier.  The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat which, according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of US$14.8bil (RM65.59bil), plus or minus US$500mil (RM2.22bil). Analysts on average were expecting US$14.53bil (RM64.39bil). Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Jan 26. Up to Jan 26's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5% in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60% rise in the broader semiconductor index. — Reuters You May Be Interested STMicro to supply iPhone 8 parts?

Image: justyle/Shutterstock Chip giant Intel has reported fourth quarter revenues of $16.4bn, up from $14.9bn last year. Revenues from IoT are starting to kick in, with 16pc growth in revenues from the new category. The technology giant, which employs more than 4,000 people in Ireland, is finding that its bet on internet of things (IoT) is starting to pay dividends. The company’s IoT division has reported 16pc year-on-year growth. ‘The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel’ – BRIAN KRZANICH Intel’s revenues from non-volatile memory also were up by 25pc year-on-year, to $816m. Intel’s Client Computing Group saw revenues up by 4pc, to $9.1bn, while its Data Center Group reported an 8pc surge in revenues to $4.7bn. Intel Security Group reported revenues of $500m, up 9pc, while its Programmable Solutions Group reported revenues of $1.7bn for the fourth quarter. Restructure and refocus pays dividends for Intel “The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel,” said Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO. “In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources, while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera and investing in growth opportunities. “I’m pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future.” The strong results signal something of a turnaround for Intel, which last year began a major restructure that resulted in the reduction of staff by 12,000. The company said it was shifting its focus from PCs to chips for data centres and IoT. Intel dolls at a trade show booth.

Usually, funds flow the other way: from Apple to Qualcomm. Apple spends billions of dollars to buy Qualcomm’s chips and license its patented technologies, and Qualcomm is thought to have promised Apple rebates in exchange for Apple’s promise to use only Qualcomm modems in its smartphones. Now Apple is using Intel modems in some of its phones, and apparently Qualcomm has not remitted rebate payments to Apple. The “sweetheart deal” Apple and Qualcomm are thought to have struck has been souring for some time now. First, Apple decided to use Intel’s modems in the iPhone 7 devices designed for the AT&T Mobility and T-Mobile US networks. (Verizon Wireless and Sprint iPhone 7s still use Qualcomm modems.) Late last year, several reports claimed Apple was intentionally throttling the Qualcomm modems to make sure the Sprint and Verizon Wireless phones were not faster than the phones that use Intel modems. Next, Apple agreed to cooperate with South Korean authorities in a lawsuit targeting Qualcomm. The regulators think Qualcomm is charging too much for its patented technologies and getting away with it because the companies that need this technology also need Qualcomm’s chips for their smartphones. Qualcomm has two businesses: making wireless chips and licensing wireless technologies that it has developed and patented. When it comes to smartphones, the company dominates both the chip business and the licensing business. Its patented technologies are “standards essential,” meaning smartphones cannot meet industry standards without them. Qualcomm is required by law to license these technologies at “fair and reasonable terms,” but regulators want to know if Samsung, Apple and other manufacturers are paying inflated prices in order to get access to Qualcomm’s chips. “No license, no chips,” is the accusation U.S. regulators hurled at Qualcomm last week, when they too brought a lawsuit against the company. The Federal Trade Commission, with only three active members during the last week of the Obama Administration, filed a lawsuit in San Jose, California. Qualcomm denied the “no license, no chips charge,” and has also dismissed Apple’s claim it owes the company $1 billion. Qualcomm said it welcomed the opportunity to meet the iPhone maker in court, and also chided Apple for failing to acknowledge Qualcomm’s enormous contribution to smartphone technology. The FTC lawsuit did not trigger a selloff of Qualcomm shares, but the Apple lawsuit has had a clear impact on investors. Qualcomm’s stock was trading down 12% on Monday after the news broke.

As the supply chains of multinational companies become more complex, so does the potential for increased carbon emissions as more products incorporate more parts and materials from across the globe. And as companies become more desperate to shave costs, more goods are produced in countries where environmental regulations tend to be weaker than in wealthier nations. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that a more sustainable and efficient supply chain can mitigate a company’s impact on the environment, while scoring the buy-in of the chief financial officer. As CDP noted in a recent report, the efforts of its 89 supply chain members reduced carbon emissions by at least 434 million tons last year. But this metric will really attract the CFO’s attention: In 2016 alone, emissions cuts netted a combined $12.4 billion in cost savings for those firms, which include the likes of Unilever, Microsoft, Ford and Walmart. Only half of the companies surveyed for this report revealed cost savings – but those that did claimed huge gains. And while it may at first appear cliché, a large part of these savings come from engagement, engagement, engagement. For example, the global semiconductor giant Intel took a carrot-and-stick approach to gaining disclosures from its suppliers. First, CDP reporting expectations were integrated into the company’s supplier scorecards. Next, participation in Intel’s surveys was required for vendors to be eligible for the company’s supplier awards. Finally, Intel provided its suppliers with training and regular communications updates so these smaller firms would know what to do and how to go about making the necessary changes. Not that such a feat is easy. The automaker BMW Group, for example, has at least 13,000 suppliers spread across 70 nations. So BMW began by incorporating CDP disclosures into annual supplier performance reviews for its 100 largest vendors. The company first set annual internal targets, then key performance indicators (KPIs) that include transparency goals as well as carbon emissions targets. Sixty-nine percent of the company’s annual spend is now accounted for by CDP-related disclosures. According to CDP, 83 percent of its supply chain members’ cost savings can be attributed to four general types of programs. Over a third of these companies’ total cost savings comes from better product design. Waste diversion and recovery accounts for 28 percent of these total savings. Efficient transportation and energy efficiency processes round out the largest money savers for these companies. The diverse industries represented in this report shows that for any company with a large global presence, designing better products and using resources more efficiently can only add to the bottom line. And at a time when many governments indicate they may back off from pledges made at the COP21 climate talks in Paris, the private sector can show that it can step up and lead the way toward a low-carbon economy. More improvement on this front is needed, however. As Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), wrote in the report’s forward: “Only 22 percent of supplier organizations that responded to the 2016 CDP Supply Chain information request actively engage with their suppliers. It is not enough.” Image credit: Kentaro Iemoto/Flickr Corporate Responsibility Recent headlines from the 6321 articles in this category: Emissions Cuts Helped Business Leaders Save $12.4 Billion Last Year NGOs Urge Palm Oil Industry to Standardize and Improve Disclosures The Corporate Shift to Cage-Free Eggs Continues Based in Fresno, California, Leon Kaye is a business writer and strategic communications specialist.

Things look pretty good for Intel within these financial snapshots, as it reports record revenue for both the FY2016 and Q4 2016 periods. You can see the actual numbers tabulated below, but summing up in prose Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, said "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel. In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities." Krzanich added that he was confident in the future of Intel. The 'Client Computing' business, which is likely of most interest to HEXUS readers, as it includes Intel CPUs for PCs, enjoyed revenue increases both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. Our favourite segment really is a cash cow for Intel bringing in nearly $33 billion during 2016. However, in terms of growth it is very much in the shade compared to Intel business operations concerned with Data Centres, IoT, and Non-Volatile memory. Microsoft and Google As VentureBeat reports, it's interesting to compare the recently published results of Microsoft and Google (Alphabet). For the last three consecutive quarters Google has managed to stay a little ahead of Microsoft in terms of headline revenue - VB reckons the relative positioning is now a trend rather than an aberration. Microsoft's FY17 Q2 financials can be read through on its Investor Relations site. Highlights in the most recent quarter were revenue was $24.1 billion and a net income of $5.2 billion. CEO Satya Nadella said "Accelerating advancements in AI across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud." So yes, he banged on about the cloud again. The Microsoft operations HEXUS readers are most interested in, namely the 'More Personal Computing' business, was impacted badly by phone, foreign currency movements, and Xbox consoles. Check the highlights slide above for further details. Google's headline results for the quarter ending 31st Dec 2016 showed revenue of $26 billion, and a net income of $6.6 billion. Both the figures are over 20 per cent better than figures from a year ago. Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, explained that the revenue performance "was led by mobile search and YouTube." Porat added that looking forward Google has good momentum in newer investment areas and "ongoing strong progress in Other Bets" (like self-driving cars). Among the sea of positive numbers in the Google results it was hard to find a negative. However, as noted by The Independent, shares in Alphabet fell in afterhours trading as the results simply weren't as good as investors had expected. The root cause of the upset was a one-off, but significant, extra tax payment. Related Reading 9 Windows device shipments to be outpaced by Apple this year?

Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose 2.2 percent to $38.38 in extended trading on Thursday. Intel's net revenue rose to $16.37 billion from $14.91 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from the data centre business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Intel has been building its data centre, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. Intel, which will use New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to showcase its 360-degree video technology during the 2017 Super Bowl, is also driving deeper into the automotive market. The company said earlier this month that it would acquire a stake in German digital mapping firm HERE. "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel," Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said in a statement. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share beating estimates of 74 cents per share. Worldwide PC shipments fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand.

Optane is the name under which Intel is branding products based on 3D XPoint – a non-volatile memory technology. The technology was announced in 2015 and is being developed by Intel and Micron. Micron’s 3D XPoint-based brand is QuantX. Intel has already shipped its first Optane products in the form of SSDs, but has not started selling 3D XPoint-based RAM products.

By Alistair Barr and Jillian Ward. Added by Agency Staff on 27 January 2017. Saved under Top, World Tags: Alphabet, Amy Hood, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai Tweet Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel, which all posted quarterly results on Thursday, reinforced what’s become a truism in technology: the biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-centre servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signalled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s “other revenue” line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62% to US$3,4bn in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on Thursday during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for start-ups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centres to support their own Web services. More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. Google CEO Sundar Pichai Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25m consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47% in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein & Co, who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Microsoft’s effort Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centres and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief financial officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would “materially improve” in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centres support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualised revenue of $20bn in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14bn at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30% from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7% less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3,6bn in fourth quarter revenue, up 50% from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.”  — (c) 2017 Bloomberg LP Reported with assistance from Dina Bass, Ian King and Mark Bergen Share this article Tweet Connect with TechCentral Follow TechCentral on Twitter Connect with TechCentral on Facebook Connect with TechCentral on Google+ Subscribe to our newsletter Articles by comments (7 days) 55Digital migration has ‘failed’ 9Dear Telkom, we need to talk 9Muthambi ‘ignoring’ DA on TV box report 7ICT white paper ‘not constitutional’ 7The future of radio in South Africa [podcast] Home About Advertise Newsletter Contact RSS ↑ TechCentral TechCentral Log in - (c) 2009 - 2015 NewsCentral Media
Home Budget 2017 Experts cafe 2017 Budget 2017: Extension of concessional Excise & Customs Duty benefits should be extended to all ITA goods, says Debjani Ghosh, Intel Budget 2017: Extension of concessional Excise & Customs Duty benefits should be extended to all ITA goods, says Debjani Ghosh, Intel Debjani Ghosh, Vice President, Sales and Marketing Group and Managing Director for South Asia at Intel on Friday listed out her expectations from the upcoming Budget 2017. By: FE Online | Published: January 27, 2017 12:21 PM “The extension of concessional Excise and Customs Duty benefits should be extended to all ITA goods, including locally manufactured devices such as laptops and PCs.” Budget 2017 is just around the corner and expectations from every sector is pouring in. Debjani Ghosh, Vice President, Sales and Marketing Group and Managing Director for South Asia at Intel on Friday listed out her expectations from the upcoming Budget 2017. “The extension of concessional Excise and Customs Duty benefits should be extended to all ITA goods, including locally manufactured devices such as laptops and PCs. This will not only trigger innovations in design and manufacturing to address local needs, but also enable citizens to create productive content,” she said. She also said that there has been a significant focus on ease of starting a new venture and related support, the areas where significant hurdles still remain for startups and established companies are the regulations around latest technologies such as 5G, autonomous driving and drone deployment.” “While manufacturing is encouraged under Make in India, we should also look at encouraging Electronics Design through incentives, driven by public-private partnerships,” she added. “Over the last two years, the government has implemented several policy reforms aimed at improving the overall ease of doing business, increasing the adoption of technology in the startup and innovation ecosystem, and delivering government services to non-urban India. While these are right steps in the direction of accomplishing a knowledge economy, the expected benefits of government programs have not been effective because there is a gap between the initiatives and the actual intended outcome,” she quipped. Narendra Modi government will be presenting Budget 2017 on February 1. Yesterday, Supreme Court dismissed the plea to change the Budget date from February 1. The Budget is special not only for the fact that it has been preponed but more importantly because it comes within months after Modi government’s massive demonetisation drive. Most analysts and economists expect Budget 2017 to be tax-payer friendly, especially given the pain that common man has faced after old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes ceased to be legal tender money. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs (CCPA) recommended holding of the Budget Session from January 31. The first part of the Budget Session will run until February 9. The 92-year-old practice of presenting a separate Rail Budget is going to end from this fiscal, with the Finance Ministry accepting Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu’s proposal to merge it with the General Budget. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has indicated that railway travel may become pricier for passengers come the next financial year. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. "I definitely think we’re going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. ‘Disruptive Forces’ More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week. Microsoft gained 2.2 percent, Google was down about 1 percent and Intel rose 1.5 percent at 1:57 p.m. Friday in New York. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter.  "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier." Microsoft’s Effort Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.  Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. "Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud," Moerdler said. "Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Optane is a new class of nonvolatile memory and storage based on 3D Xpoint, which was developed jointly by Intel and Micron. Intel's first Optane products, announced this month at CES, are low-capacity SSDs that fit into the storage slots of PCs. Optane memory DIMMs are different. They're intended to replace DRAM in servers and PCs. The DIMMs will fit into DDR4 slots. Intel has started shipping the first Optane DIMMs for testing and hopes to release final products next year. In demonstrations by Intel, Optane SSDs have performed 10 times faster than conventional SSDs. PC makers have said that game play, PC bootup and applications are all faster with Optane SSDs. Less is known about Optane memory DIMMs, but Intel has shipped the units out to enterprise hardware makers for testing. Intel has said Optane memory can be 10 times denser than DRAM. The base technology of both types of Optane products, 3D Xpoint, is a bridge between memory and storage, said Brian Krzanich, Intel's CEO, during an earnings call on Thursday. Optane is "differential technology" that could change PC and server architectures, Krzanich said. Intel has also floated the idea that Optane could unite storage and memory. For example, one Optane unit could serve as both storage and DRAM. Optane's ability to move large amounts of data faster inside computers and data centers could help speed up machine-learning tasks, Krzanich said. Optane also aligns with Intel's goal to focus more on data-center technologies, Krzanich said. In April, Intel made data-center products a centerpiece of its future strategy as it tried to break a longtime reliance on PCs. But PC chips took in more than half of Intel's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $16.4 billion, growing by $1.5 billion from the same quarter last year. Net income was $3.6 billion, down about 1 percent. Revenue for the Client Computing Group, which deals in PC chips, was up $9.1 billion, growing by 4 percent compared with the same quarter of the previous year. PC chip revenue got a boost from higher average selling prices of laptops and desktops. Desktop product shipments went down 9 percent, but prices went up 2 percent. Laptop product shipments were flat, but average selling prices were up 3 percent. Sales of PCs with higher-end chips like Core i7 were strong during the holiday season, Krzanich said. In particular, gaming PCs did really well. The Data Center Group, which deals in server chips and data-center equipment, recorded revenue of $4.7 billion, growing by 8 percent. Intel's Internet of Things Group had revenue of $726 million, growing 16 percent. Boost Sales With Brother’s Partner Program More from Brother Follow Us Twitter LinkedIn Join the ARN newsletter!

Intel set a new record for revenue for this quarter, coming in at $16.4 billion. This is up 10% from a year ago. For the year, Intel brought in $59.4 billion, up 7% from their 2015 results. Intel’s gross margin fell 1.7 points to 60.9%, and they had an operating income of $12.9 billion, which is down 8% from a year ago. Net income was down 10% to $10.3 billion, and earnings per share fell 9% to $2.12. Intel also reports Non-GAAP results, which exclude several expenditures, such as acquisition-related adjustments, write-downs, and the like. On a Non-GAAP basis, Intel had a gross margin of 63.1%, down 1.7 points, an operating income up 11% to $4.9 billion, and a net income up 4% to $3.9 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share were up 4% to $0.79. Intel Q4 2016 Financial Results (GAAP)   Q4'2016 Q3'2016 Q4'2015 Revenue $16.4B $15.8B $14.9B Operating Income $4.5B $4.5B $4.3B Net Income $3.6B $3.4B $3.6B Gross Margin 60.9% 63.3% 62.6% Client Computing Group Revenue $9.1B +2.2% +3% Data Center Group Revenue $4.7B +4.4% +3% Internet of Things Revenue $726M +5.3% +5% Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group $816M +26% +26% Intel Security Group $550M +2.4% +2% Programmable Solutions Group $420M -9.7% -1% All Other Revenue $65M +47.7% +10% The gross margin impact is being attributed to a few things. Warranty and IP charges increased, as did spending on factory start-ups, due to the move to 10 nm coming this year, Client Computer Group non-platform costs, and the Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group margins. Intel very much likes to keep their margins up above 60%, and for the moment they are still there even with these extra costs. Intel breaks the company down into several groups. The main group is the Client Computing Group, which as the name implies, provides CPUs, SoCs, and wireless and wired connectivity products destined for PCs. Although the PC market is still down, this group had revenue for the year of $32.9 billion, which is up 2%, but platform volume is down 10%. Platform selling prices were up 11%, which makes up the difference. For just the last quarter, Client Computing Group had revenues of $9.1 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Platform volumes were down 7%, offset by selling prices up 7%. Desktop platform volume was down 9%, while notebook volumes were flat. Desktop average selling price (ASP) was up 2%, and notebook ASP was up 3%. Considering the down market, Intel continues to drive revenue here. While good for them, it means prices are high, and some competition in this space might help out the consumer. The Data Center Group also had a strong quarter, and year. For the year, they had revenue of $17.2 billion, up from $16.0 billion a year ago. For the year, Intel saw volumes up 3% and ASP up 4%. For the most recent quarter, the Data Center Group had revenues of $4.7 billion, which was up 3%. Platform volumes were down 3%, with ASP up 6%. Intel is slowly building it’s Internet of Things group, which had revenues for the year at $2.6 billion, up from $2.3 a year ago. Revenue for this quarter was up 5% to $726 million. The Non-Volatile Memory Solutions group had revenues for the quarter of $816 million, up 26% from a year ago, and a full-year revenue of $2.58 billion, down slightly from the $2.6 billion a year ago. Programmable Solutions is new for Intel this year, with the purchase of Altera, and this segment had revenue of $420 million for this quarter, and $1.7 billion for the year. All other revenue was $65 million for the quarter, up from $59 million a year ago. 2016 was a strong year for Intel, although it was not without its challenges. Earlier this year, Intel decided to get out of the mobile SoC space completely, abandoning it’s Atom architecture for this segment. Atom does live on for low power PCs, but any of the tablets that used the Cherry Trail Atom have found themselves without a new CPU to move to. The death of Tick-Tock also had its first new entrant in Kaby Lake, although you could easily argue Devil’s Canyon was a similar situation. But they have several new exciting technologies coming to market as well, such as 3D X-Point, and of course the expected launch of their 10 nm CPUs later this year. Looking forward to Q1 2017, Intel is forecasting a midpoint revenue range of $14.8 billion, with margin estimates at 62%.

POST A COMMENT 19 Comments View All Comments mdriftmeyer - Thursday, January 26, 2017 - link Intel is a dividend only stock. Cash out and buy AMD if you have a brain. Reply Samus - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link Even when AMD was competitive with Intel over a decade ago, they weren't a good buy, and haven't been since. I have never met a single person who made money on AMD stock. Some people turned out well who owned ATi stock because as we all now know, they were overvalued and AMD overpaid. Of all a-list tech companies, I couldn't think of a worst buy than AMD. I hope, someday, this changes. Reply Haawser - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link Worst buy ?? It was $1.79 last March, and is now $10+ Your 'worst buy' would have made people over 5 x their money had they invested at the right time. I only *wish* I'd bought some at that price. Reply Michael Bay - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link You`d be outright crazy buying amd a year or two ago, and not much better now. As zen hype settles, it will return to the bottom just as quickly. Reply yannigr2 - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link I can understand your agony. With AMD becoming competitive in the consumer and enterprise market, Nvidia eating from the Datacenter market, Qualcomm announcing multicore ARM base server SoCs and Microsoft demostrating a Windows emulator for the ARM platform, you are probably very nervous about your Intel stock valuation. Do you sleep well at nights? Reply Michael Bay - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link >amd becoming competitive >muh arm servers >201X will be a year of loonix on a desktop I thought even the most hopeless cultist would get tired of repeating this well worn mantra set, but you guys somehow always manage to surprise. Reply Nagorak - Saturday, January 28, 2017 - link AMD was priced like it was going out of business last year and it Manchester to pull through, thus the outsized gains. However this outcome was far from certain, which meant no one could really interest more than a small amount in the stock anyway. It was just too risky. Maybe some did put a substantial amount of their network in AMD, and they were handsomely rewarded, but it was pretty much a gamble and not a prudent investment decision. Reply Nagorak - Saturday, January 28, 2017 - link Damn auto correct... Reply Gothmoth - Friday, January 27, 2017 - link and you know many people who have a clue about stock. don´t kid yourself you are probably a 20 year old gamer or a IT guy that thinks he has a clue about the stock market. such people are always the loser on the stock market in the end. that´s why it exists.. somebody has to lose money. there are plenty of people who know what they are doing.... and they even make money when AMD drops. Reply Nagorak - Saturday, January 28, 2017 - link Yeah... most people involved in the stock market really don't know what they're doing. Some make some big bets and do well for a while but they end up flaming out. Most just end up following the herd and buying when things are expensive and selling when they are cheap. I'm certainly not impressed with the majority involved in the financial markets--including the "pros".

Some helpful tips on getting your new Intel Kaby Lake CPU working on your Z170-based motherboard By: Sergio Andrés Echart Kuc | Motherboards News | Posted: 1 day, 6 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA So, you have a Z170 motherboard, and Intel Kaby Lake is the CPU you want? OK, first of all, you must know that even though Kaby Lake is compatible with Intel's Z170 Skylake chipset, the CPU is designed for Intel's Z270 Kaby Lake chipset to use its new features.   As an overclocker, tester, and reviewer, I always move to the latest chipset if I decide to upgrade my CPU, and of course not an H/B or something chipset, I go to the root chipset - that means Z170/Z270. But, if you still want to stay on Z170, here's a comparison of the two designs and a must-do List to make your shiny new Kaby Lake CPU work on it.   Intel Z170 Chipset     It's clear you have more things on Z270 - 2x M.2 SSD, more USB, more SATA ports, etc.   Intel Z270 Chipset     A lot of people kept their Z170 board, sold their Intel Skylake CPU, and bought the new Kaby Lake CPU. Then all you have to do is install the new CPU and be done with it, right? Well, sorry to say it, but no. Infinite loop? Starts and turns off? Error codes? So, should I RMA? No. You should have upgraded your BIOS/UEFI first using your Skylake CPU as most motherboard manufacturers support Intel Kaby Lake on their latest BIOS released early in January. So, most of you I know, you didn't upgrade it. But, there's nothing wrong, I will help you with this.   Common Scenarios   You own a Z170 board, you don't have a Skylake CPU, and you have a Kaby Lake CPU installed. You turn on your rig, and it won't work. Reboot loops, won't start, and you get error codes. Get your hands-on any Skylake CPU, install it, go to the motherboard manufacturer page, download the latest BIOS file, put it on a flash drive, and update it from BIOS. Check if it's all ok then reinstall the Kaby Lake CPU and it should work correctly.   You have an ASUS ROG Z170 board with USB BIOS Flashback feature, you don't have a Skylake CPU, and you have a Kaby Lake CPU installed. Download the latest BIOS file from ASUS website for your motherboard model, grab a flash drive, format it FAT32, and rename the file as follows:   Here are the examples I know. The pattern is easy, just read the board name, as below:   ASUS Maximus VIII Ranger: Rename BIOS file to M8R.CAP ASUS Maximus VIII Formula: Rename BIOS file to M8F.CAP ASUS Maximus VIII Extreme: Rename BIOS file to M8E.CAP   Copy the file you downloaded to the flash drive and insert it on the board. Then press the button on the picture for six seconds (button will vary from board to board). You will see the LED on it flashes as it reads the flash drive, then it will stop. After a while, it's all set, and you are ready to go.     ASUS USB BIOS Flashback Procedure: https://rog.asus.com/technology/rog-motherboard-innovations/USB-BIOS-flashback/   ASUS Z170 Motherboards with USB BIOS Flashback feature: http://www.asus.com/us/site/motherboards/Z170/compare/   Enjoy Kaby Lake Power! - Sergio Andrés Echart Kuc, Spanish Senior Editor for TweakTown.

Benchmark Awards Reports Blogs Topics CXO Challenge Whitepapers What's On ANU poaches Intel's Dr Genevieve Bell By Staff Writer on Jan 27, 2017 12:50PM Dr Genevieve Bell Will retain senior fellow title with chipmaker. High-profile Intel researcher and anthropologist Dr Genevieve Bell has revealed she will leave the chipmaker to take up a role at the Australian National University from next month. The university said in a statement that it had appointed Bell as a Professor in its college of engineering and computer science. Dr Bell joined Intel in 1998 and led the company’s first user experience research and development lab. She has also served as a vice president of the chipmaker and was the first woman in the company's history to be appointed an Intel senior fellow. Bell said via Twitter that she would continue to hold her title as a senior fellow with the company. Her new professorship will involve collaboration with CSIRO’s digital wing Data61. “Genevieve has been tasked by ANU with exploring how to bring together data science, design thinking and ethnography to drive new approaches in engineering; and in partnership with Data61, exploring the questions of what it means to be human in a data-driven economy and world,” Data61 CEO Adrian Turner said in a statement. The Oregonian reported that Dr Bell’s departure from Intel is “one of a number of notable exits” of senior staff from the chip giant so far in 2017. Copyright © iTnews.com.au . All rights reserved.

Dr Bell joins ANU in February from global innovation company Intel as part of the University’s commitment to drive innovation in Australia. Dr Bell has served as a Vice President of Intel where she became the first woman in the company's history to be appointed an Intel Senior Fellow. "As a little kid, I remember thinking the ANU was the most remarkable place. It was full of big thinkers, and great story-tellers and such a lot of history," Dr Bell said. "That I get to return to it as an adult and a member of the faculty is a genuine privilege. I am also excited to be afforded the opportunity to collaborate with CSIRO’s Data61." Dean of the ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science, Professor Elanor Huntington said she was thrilled to appoint Dr Bell to the College. "I’m thrilled that Genevieve has chosen to join us," Professor Huntington said. "She is a distinguished technologist and public intellectual, and a leading figure in diversity and inclusion globally in the technology sector. "Her potential to transform the relationship between people and technology cannot be understated, and I look forward to her achieving great things from her new base here. It’s been a pleasure to build on our long-standing partnership with CSIRO Data61 and join forces to make this a reality." Acting ANU Vice-Chancellor Professor Margaret Harding said Professor Bell was an exciting appointment. "The enduring mission of ANU is to develop new capability on behalf of the nation, and the fields of computing and engineering are central to delivering on that mission," Professor Harding said. CSIRO’s Data61 CEO Adrian Turner said it was wonderful to have Dr Bell return to Canberra. "Genevieve has been tasked by ANU with exploring how to bring together data science, design thinking and ethnography to drive new approaches in engineering; and in partnership with Data61, exploring the questions of what it means to be human in a data-driven economy and world," Mr Turner said. After completing a PhD in cultural anthropology at Stanford University, Dr Bell joined Intel in 1998. At Intel, she led the company’s first user experience research and development lab. She is recognised as a world leader in the ethnographic approach to developing technology. Tweet All articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.

Posted 27 Jan 2017 05:11 Updated 27 Jan 2017 07:35 Gameplayers demonstrate vitual reality headsets during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to US$4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to US$9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to US$16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of US$15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to US$3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from US$3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of US$14.8 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. Analysts on average were expecting US$14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index.

Intel reported earnings of 79 cents per share, beating the 74 cents expected by Wall Street. Revenue came in at $16.37 billion, beating estimates of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters consensus. Shares of Intel moved 2 percent higher in after-hours trading before paring those gains. "This company is doing everything they're supposed to do," Trader Tim Seymour said, noting that his only issue is that the chipmaker's stock valuation hovers around $38. Seymour owns Intel and recommended interested investors buy it for the long term. The semiconductor giant's move into the autonomous-car space intrigued trader Brian Kelly. Still, he's waiting for the stock to break out above a $39 stock price. Trader Guy Adami prefers Microsoft over Intel. He was discouraged by Intel's weak guidance for the first quarter of 2017. Microsoft beat its earnings estimates and moved up 1 percent in after-hours trading. Trader Dan Nathan said he would be more interested in buying Intel in the mid-$30s. show chapters Trading tech earnings: 5 moves to make    Thursday, 26 Jan 2017 | 5:00 PM ET | 02:27 Disclosures: GUY ADAMI Guy Adami is long CELG, EXAS, GDX, INTC.

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google's Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. "I definitely think we're going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," the research firm said at the time. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company's productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter. "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy," said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. That's because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel's fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.

Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers -- the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. "Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. "I definitely think we’re going to have a great year." What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run websites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own web services. ‘DISRUPTIVE FORCES’ More than $1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner estimated in July. "This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age," the research firm said at the time. Stock prices reflect this optimism. Microsoft and Alphabet shares hit a record this week, and Intel stock recently came close to an all-time high set in October. In early trading Friday, Microsoft was up 1.6 percent, Google was down 1.1 percent and Intel gained less than 1 percent. Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter.  "As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates Microsoft shares outperform. “If margins are growing, people are even happier." MICROSOFT'S EFFORT Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in July that gross margins, a measure of profitability, for the commercial cloud business would "materially improve" in the current year. That’s because previous years of investment are starting to pay off as those data centers support more customers. Microsoft has pledged to reach annualized revenue of $20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June 2018. That metric stood at more than $14 billion at the end of the second quarter. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter in 2016 on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call.  Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier.

IPhone sales will be one of the main areas of focus when Apple reports its fiscal first-quarter results on Tuesday. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: January 27, 2017 at 4:28 pm | UPDATED: January 27, 2017 at 4:57 pm Top of the Order:   An Apple a Day: Earnings reporting season has been in full swing for a couple of weeks. And we’ve seen some of the usual suspects report mostly decent results. Among big-name Bay Area companies, Netflix, Alphabet (Google), eBay, Chevron and Intel have all given us a look at how things went during their most-recent quarters, and how they expect business to shape up over the next three months. But, there remains one company that gets as much attention as just about all the others put together: Apple. And on Tuesday, when Apple delivers its fiscal first-quarter results, it will do so during a period of auspicious anniversaries and anticipation over where the world’s most-valuable company is headed. Those anniversaries include the iPhone turning 10 years old in early January, and marking one year since Apple delivered an earnings forecast in which it foresaw iPhone sales, and overall revenue, starting to decline. Related Articles Elon Musk says his “boring” tunnel plans could start soon Why Apple wants to power ahead with making products in India Biz Break: GoPro shares go ga-ga on hopes of holiday sales gains Biz Break: IBM said to be cutting jobs amid CEO’s big hiring plans Biz Break: Trump Era begins with stock markets getting back on track Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters estimate that Apple will report a profit of $3.22 a share, on revenue of $77.4 billion, for the three months that ended in December. The company itself has estimated sales for its biggest business period of the year would be between $76 billion and $78 billion. During the year-ago period, Apple earned $3.28 a share on $75.9 billion in sales. Among all the things that Apple does, investors and consumers will likely give their attention to two items above all others: iPhone sales and Apple’s services business. The iPhone should come as no surprise. Even as those sales have declined on a year-over-year basis for a few quarters, the iPhone remains Apple’s biggest source of earnings and revenue. Michael Olson, who covers Apple for Piper Jaffray said he thinks concerns about the iPhone’s performance over the last three months, and the first quarter of this year, may be a bit overblown. “Many investors fear iPhone units may be weak in the December and March quarters due to potential iPhone 7 buyers waiting for iPhone ‘X,'” Olson said. “We believe most consumers are not aware of the potential for a more significant upgrade coming in the fall, due to the 10th anniversary of the device and will, therefore, not hold back on upgrading now.” Services, which include sales of apps, Apple Music subscriptions, revenue from Apple Pay and other items, are seen as Apple’s next big growth engine. For the last two quarters, services have been Apple’s second-largest source of revenue. And during the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter, which ended in September 2016, services was the only one of Apple’s main business lines that saw sales grow from the prior year. “We see double-digit growth persisting and expect it to contribute to 10 percent of overall revenue,” said analyst Angelo Zino, of CFRA Research. “We see a greater percentage of higher-margin services revenue acting as a tailwind to margins over time.” And on Tuesday, we’ll get a look into how well services, and the rest of Apple’s businesses, are set up for what’s to come. Middle Innings: Welcome (Back) to the Club: Remember the year 2000? A two-term president was about to leave office. We had a close, and contentious election to choose his successor. And Microsoft had a market capitalization of $500 billion. By the end of that year, all of that had passed. And Microsoft wouldn’t reach that lofty valuation again until … Friday. After a strong earnings report Thursday, investors put more muscle behind Microsoft stock on Friday. By the time the market closed, Microsoft shares had risen by 2.4 percent to end the day at $65.78. That was good enough for Microsoft to end the week with a market capitalization of $511.5 billion. Sure, Microsoft still trails the valuation of Apple ($641.2 billion) and Alphabet ($574.5 billion), but a market cap of $511.5 billion is nothing to sneeze at, especially as it shows investors have plenty of faith in the new cloud-based efforts of Chief Executive Satya Nadella. Since Nadella became Microsoft’s CEO in February 2014, the company’s valuation has climbed by almost $200 billion. Bottom of the Lineup: Here’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday. Movin’ on Up: Gains came from Maxim Integrated Products, Accuray, RingCentral, Abaxis and KLA-Tencor. In the Red: Decliners included Synaptics, Super Micro Computer, Proofpoint, Aviat Networks and ShoreTel. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.1 percent to end the day at 5,660.78. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down by 0.04 percent to 20,093.78. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped by 0.1 percent to finish the week at 2,294.69. Quote of the Day: “I found out changing a diaper. That was my drama. It wasn’t a good diaper either. Highlight of my day.” — Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, describing how on Thursday night he found out he had been selected to play in the NBA All-Star Game. Green will join fellow Warriors Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant on the Western Conference All-Stars. Sign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com.

Early Benchmarks Of The Intel Core i7 7700K On Linux Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 27 January 2017 at 02:05 PM EST. 15 Comments For those curious how Intel's flagship Core i7 7700K "Kabylake" processor is performing under Linux, my sample arrived yesterday and I've begun putting the CPU through its paces. The Core i7 7700K has four physical cores plus Hyper Threading, 4.2GHz base frequency, 4.5GHz turbo frequency, and 8MB smart cache. This CPU has HD Graphics 630 that clock up to 1.15GHz. The Core i7 7700K retails for about $350 USD. I'll have up a proper Core i7 7700K Linux review in the days ahead compared to various other CPUs. For this comparison I am using Intel's Clear Linux distribution as the base. So far today though I do have some fresh Kabylake comparisons from Clear Linux using the Core i3 7100, Core i5 7600K, and Core i7 7700K. So while waiting on the complete results, you can check out these early numbers: Find more of these fresh Intel Kabylake Linux benchmarks via this OpenBenchmarking.org result file. If you wish to compare your own system's performance to these early Core i7 7700K results, simply install the Phoronix Test Suite and run phoronix-test-suite benchmark 1701270-RI-CLEARLINU19. Given the recent Beignet 1.3 release with OpenCL 2.0 support, I'm also working on a fresh Intel HD/Iris Graphics OpenCL GPU compute comparison: More of that early data via this result file.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: ENTREPRENEUR 1 week in, Trump’s Silicon Valley buddy list is short Harrison Weber@harrisonweber January 27, 2017 10:15 AM Tags: Elon Musk, politics, Tech and Trump, Trump News hit this morning that Trump’s “Manufacturing Jobs Initiative” will feature two tech CEOs: Intel’s Brian Krzanich, who nearly hosted a Trump event during the primaries, and Tesla’s Elon Musk, who appears to be pragmatically — and, I assume, reluctantly — steering the president on issues like climate change. The list of Silicon Valley somebodies willing to work with the president now tops out around five, a rather low number, counting Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who’s on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum with Musk; Oracle CEO Safra Catz, who joined Trump’s transition team; and contrarian investor Peter Thiel, who spoke at the RNC. All this underscores a problem for Trump: Hardly anyone in Silicon Valley will work with him. Yet, in Tech Land, the list of executives willing to disparage him publicly at this point is almost as short. One exception there is Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who said yesterday that Trump’s anti-abortion policy “could have terrible consequences for women and families around the world.” Beyond Sandberg, I ask: How is an industry so hell-bent on “making the world a better place” so quickly silenced by Trump and the threat of controversy? What’s going on? Here’s one explanation, from Musk in an impromptu interview with Gizmodo.: The more voices of reason that the President hears, the better. Simply attacking him will achieve nothing. Are you aware of a single case where Trump bowed to protests or media attacks? Better that there are open channels of communication. Translation: The CEOs working with Trump all want something from him. Those who won’t collaborate probably haven’t figured out what to ask for yet. For Thiel, his $20 billion data company, Palantir, depends on government contracts. For Catz, she’s after tax reform. Musk has made clear what he wants: a carbon tax. And he wants former ExxonMobil CEO (and likely next Secretary of State) Rex Tillerson to make it happen. For the few big-company CEOs willing to collaborate with the current administration, we’ll see if this brand of pragmatism works. Without it, Trump doesn’t stand a chance of making friends in idealistic Silicon Valley. If Musk’s strategy works, the controversy may indeed hit tech companies right at the bottom line — already protesters are lashing out at Uber for Kalanick’s willingness to work with Trump, and at Twitter for its refusal to silence his stupid tweets. Peter Thiel, on the other hand, has little to worry about. If things go south, there’s always the “backup country: New Zealand.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

Intel reported first-quarter profits today that were down more than 60 percent from last year. Texas Instruments also reported, and earnings at the leading maker of computer chips for mobile phones were off 17 percent from the same period a year ago. And layoffs were announced today. More jobs were eliminated at Eastman Kodak, where profits declined by 48 percent. But Topic No. 1 today on Wall Street was an unusually dire profit warning from technology giant Cisco Systems. The company that stood as a symbol of the Internet's rapid growth and stock market riches is now a symbol of its stunning decline. "From 1997 to mid-2000, it was the stock that could do no wrong and it put up quarter after quarter of ever-improving revenue growth," said Paul Sagawa, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "So when the inevitable down cycle comes, it's all the more wrenching." Locomotives That Carry Internet's Freight For a time, Cisco was the world's most valuable company. It became a titan by making the equipment that carries e-mail, video files and other data over the Internet. Its routers and switchers are essentially the locomotives that carry freight around the Internet's railways. Last year, Cisco couldn't make these routers and switchers fast enough. Now, as companies have slashed their spending on the Internet, Cisco finds itself with $2.5 billion worth of inventory it expects to become outdated before it ever can be sold. "This may be the fastest any industry our size has ever decelerated," Cisco CEO John Chambers said in a written statement. In an understatement, Cisco Vice President Ron Ricci told ABCNEWS that "the speed bumps in the investments that companies are making in the Internet are a little bit larger than we thought." Cisco's stock is down about 80 percent from its high. The San Jose, Calif., company plans to lay off 8,500 workers. Its new corporate campus outside Dallas is on hold. And the company expects sales and profits next quarter to be even worse. Investors who believed Cisco was different from other New Economy companies have lost $400 billion learning it is not. "There was a feeling if there was ever going to be a shakeout in technology, Cisco would weather the storm much better than any of the other stocks," said Jeremy Siegel, a professor at the Wharton School of Finance. The good news today is that this bad news did not send the market into a tailspin. Perhaps that's because it was largely expected. 0 Shares Email Star Comments More Bad News From Cisco " Trump Orders Suspension of All Refugees, Immigrants From Some Muslim Nations " Trump Called National Park Service Upset Over Inauguration Crowd Retweet " Vice President Mike Pence Tells March for Life: 'Life Is Winning Again in America' " Seasonal Flu Reaches Epidemic Levels in US " Trump Says He'll Let Defense Secretary 'Override' Him on Torture After New Rape Lawsuit, Baylor Says Made 'Great Progress' " Trump, Mexico's President Speak by Phone " Putin Consults His Security Council Before Talking to Trump " Mumps Outbreak Worsens in Washington State " Army Veteran, Double-Amputee Finds New Battlefield in DC " Georgia Town Leaders Apologize for 1940 Lynching " In Iowa, Trump Voters Cheer Changes, Dismiss Petty Fights " Ivanka Trump's Son Crawls for First Time in White House " Holocaust Site Spurs Questions on Young Germans' Changing Views " How Trump's Memorandum Could Boost Military Readiness " Philadelphia Mayor: Trump's Remarks an 'Insult' to Police " New Trump Agency Memo Gags Staff Communications, Democrats Say " Little Girl Befriends Baby Cow Who Lost Its Mom " NASA Opens Exhibit on 50th Anniversary of Apollo 1 Fire " FBI Offers Up to $10K Reward for Information in Murder of ABC Chicago Producer in Belize " 'Hamilton' Actors to Sing 'America the Beautiful' at Super Bowl LI " Inside Taylor Swift's $25 Million Beverly Hills Mansion " 'Bear' the Dog Hoping to Find a New Forever Home

You find a great deal on a 2-in-1 you can't easily return and discover it's a piece of junk. Or you spend a lot of money on a new laptop and, just a few weeks later, a new model makes yours obsolete. Fortunately, you don't have to waste a lot of money buying devices that are either underperforming or on their way out. Here's a list of laptops you'd be a fool to buy right now. 1 of 11 Lenovo ThinkPad T460 The ThinkPad T460 is our favorite business laptop of 2016, because of its 17+ hours of battery life, best-in-class keyboard and durable chassis. However, in February/March, Lenovo will be shipping its successor, the ThinkPad T470.  The ThinkPad T470 will have a more-powerful Intel 7th Gen "Kaby Lake" processor and it will be 0.25 pounds lighter. The new model adds a Thunderbolt 3 port you can use for charging, exchanging data with high-speed peripherals and outputting to dual 4K monitors over a single connection. There's also an optional PCIe SSD, which should double or triple app open, boot and file copy times. MORE: Which Laptop CPU is Right for You? PREVIOUS 1 of 11 NEXT 2 of 11 Apple MacBook (12-inch) Apple doesn't give advance notice of its product refreshes so we can't say for certain when it plans to refresh its 12-inch MacBook. However, the company has delivered new MacBooks (and Airs) in the spring each of the past two years.  If you've got your eye on a new MacBook, we recommend waiting for the next refresh, which we expect to come by May or June. The new model will likely have a Kaby Lake Y Series CPU, which promises better performance than the 6th Gen Core m processor in the current one. Considering the middling speeds we got out of the 2016 model, even a little bit of extra horsepower would go a long way. PREVIOUS 2 of 11 NEXT 3 of 11 Dell Chromebook 11 or 13 The Dell Chromebook 13 is one of the best laptops with Google's OS, because of its attractive, magnesium chassis, snappy keyboard and 13-hour battery life. However, the current model is extremely long in the tooth, no having had a major update in over a year.  Due out in early February, refreshed versions of the Chromebook 13 and its smaller sibling, the Chromebook 11, will feature more durable designs and faster processors. Built for education, the laptops will be available with 6th Gen Celeron or Core i3 CPUs and feature sealed keyboards that can withstand huge spills for even student tampering. If you want a 2-in-1, Dell will also be offering a Chromebook 11 2-in-1 that has a bendback display. MORE: Best Chromebooks Available Now PREVIOUS 3 of 11 NEXT 4 of 11 Lenovo ThinkPad 13 Our favorite student laptop is getting a faster, Kaby Lake processor and some new, high-end options. Due out within the next few weeks, the refreshed ThinkPad 13 will offer an optional touch screen and PCIe SSD, neither of which was available on the original. Even better, you can now get this laptop with a backlit keyboard, a feature that was conspicuously missing from the 2016 model. MORE: Best Laptops for College Students PREVIOUS 4 of 11 NEXT 5 of 11 Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon The 2016 ThinkPad X1 Carbon offered the best combination of lightweight chassis and heavy-duty productivity, but its successor promises to kick it up another notch when it arrives in February. With a new Kaby Lake processor and a slightly-larger battery, the 2017 X1 Carbon should last even longer than the prior gen's strong 9-hour endurance.  Despite its higher-capacity battery, the new model is also about 0.1 pounds lighter. Even better, the X1 Carbon will have a Thunderbolt 3 port for charging, sharing data with high-speed peripherals and outputting to 4K monitors. MORE: Best Ultrabooks PREVIOUS 5 of 11 NEXT 6 of 11 Razer Blade / Blade Pro While most gaming laptops already have quad-core, Intel 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors, Razer's Blade and Blade Pro are behind the curve. Considering that performance is extremely important on expensive rigs like this, we strongly recommend waiting for these to get a CPU refresh or purchasing a competitor that already has the new chip inside.  MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops PREVIOUS 6 of 11 NEXT 7 of 11 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 The Surface Pro 4 sets the gold-standard for detachable 2-in-1s, but it came out all the way back in October 2015. Inside, the Surface has an Intel 6th Gen processor and it lasts just 6 hours on a charge, far less than the average ultraportable laptop.  We expect Microsoft to finally release the Surface Pro 5 sometime later this year. While the company hasn't hinted at a launch date, we expect a new model to come out sooner rather than later. There's no doubt that the Surface Pro 5 will have an Intel Kaby Lake processor, but hopefully it will also include a USB Type-C or Thunderbolt 3 port and longer battery life. MORE: Best 2-in-1s PREVIOUS 7 of 11 NEXT 8 of 11 HP Elitebook Folio G1 One of the lightest and thinnest business laptops of 2016, the EliteBook Folio impressed us with its snappy keyboard, great looks and colorful screen. However, the low-power laptop uses a mediocre Intel 6th Gen Core m processor that's not very speedy and provides only modest battery life.  Now that Intel has refreshed its low-power processors with 7th Gen "Kaby Lake" architecture and turned them into the Core i5 / i7 Y Series, they should provide better performance and longer endurance. HP hasn't announced plans to refresh the Folio, but we expect the company to offer an improved model in the near future. MORE: Best HP Laptops PREVIOUS 8 of 11 NEXT 9 of 11 HP Elite X2 and Other Business Laptops The EliteBook Folio G1 isn't the only HP laptop using a 2015 processor in 2017. At present, you can't buy any of the company's business-oriented EliteBooks or ProBooks with an Intel 7th Generation Core Series CPU inside. The outdated laptops include the powerful Elite X2 detachable 2-in-1 and the super-light EliteBook 1030, both of which we like a lot. However, if you can put off your purchase, we recommend waiting to see when HP starts shipping models with the newest processors on board. You're likely to own your notebook for at least three years so you should get the latest and best processor.

Pascal GPUs all carry model numbers that begin with 10 and include the GTX 1050, 1050TI, 1060, 1070 and 1080.  When you're laptop shopping, you will still find gaming laptops with GTX 900 series chips (ex: GTX 960), but if you do, run away screaming. Forget about the appealing sale prices. Getting outdated graphics is a bad deal at any price.

Carriers like Verizon and T-Mobile are eager to sell you tablets that have LTE service. In theory, a 4G-connected tablet could be a huge convenience as it doesn't require a Wi-Fi hotspot to get online from anywhere.  However, you'll end up paying an extra $10 per month for each slate, even as it shares the same bucket of shared data as your phone. You're better off using the hotspot feature on your handset to send Internet to  your tablet.

It is a great idea to periodically do an article like that to help customers plan their purchase. I would add the Macbook Pros, as I find Apple didn't do anything compelling to buy at that price, unless you really need one now. Let's teach them a lesson you can't sell old tech at that price. They need at least Kaby Lake if they want to charge that amount of money. Hopefully, they would offer more models without touch bar for less too, but that might not be in their best interest.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jan 27, 2017 at 11:43AM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is preparing to launch its next generation high-end desktop (HEDT) personal computer chips and platform at the Gamescom trade show beginning on Aug. 22, per a report from the generally reliable website BenchLife.info. Intel's HEDT lineup makes up a relatively small portion of the company's overall desktop PC chip sales, but these chips tend to carry very high average selling prices and are much more lucrative per unit than the company's mainstream desktop personal computer chip lines. The report has some information about the new lineup, so let's take a closer look.  New chipset, broader line of chips Intel's previous HEDT platform, based on the X99 chipset, supported processors that the company code-named Broadwell-E. These are six-, eight-, and 10-core chips based on the company's Broadwell architecture, manufactured in the company's first-generation 14-nanometer technology. The chips list at around $434 and go all the way up to $1723. The upcoming HEDT platform, which is based on a newer chipset dubbed X299, is said to support a broader range of chips. The Broadwell-E chips will see direct successors in the form of a chip family called Skylake-X, which BenchLife says will come in six-, eight-, and 10-core variants. Image source: Intel.  The main improvements from Skylake-X, then, are expected to come from changes to the fundamental chip architecture (both the processor cores and all the "stuff" that surrounds the cores should be new) as well as to the manufacturing technology -- Skylake-X is said to be manufactured in Intel's enhanced 14-nanometer+ technology. New to this platform, though, will be a family of chips called Kaby Lake-X. These chips are believed to be the same fundamental chips as the Kaby Lake-S processors that Intel launched earlier this month for mainstream desktops, but they will be modified to fit into motherboards utilizing the X299 chipset. The integrated graphics processors on these chips are also believed to be disabled on the Kaby Lake-X chips -- a prudent move as the motherboard infrastructure required to support integrated graphics adds cost but is of minimal value to the target market (which will want to use stand-alone graphics processors).  The addition of the Kaby Lake-X parts to the lineup should allow Intel to offer a broader range of chips on the HEDT platform at potentially lower price points, which could help to boost the adoption of said platform. No "X" processors? A translation of the BenchLife report indicates that all the chips that will initially launch for the X299 platform will be designated with "K" suffixes in their model numbers, with no "X" models at launch. The current HEDT lineup on the X99 platform consists of four chips: Core i7-6800K, Core i7-6850K, Corei7-6900K, and Core i7-6950X. The six- and eight-core models are designated with "K" suffixes, while the top-end 10-core model has an "X" suffix. It doesn't make sense for Intel to completely abandon chips with the "X" suffix -- after all, the ultra-premium positioning/branding of the "X" chip probably helps to boost the perceived value of the chip. My inclination, then, is to think that Intel might be planning an even higher-end "X" part later down the line, with additional performance and/or features. Investor takeaway A new HEDT platform isn't going to be a game changer for Intel's financials or its stock price, but new products could allow the chipmaker to maintain or even slightly grow its average selling prices within this portion of its desktop PC chip shipments. Given that the personal computer market is expected to suffer unit declines for quite some time, any and all actions that Intel can take to improve its average revenue per PC with interesting new products (which can help to offset the unit declines) should be welcomed by stockholders.

(NASDAQ: INTC) reported its fourth-quarter financial results on Thursday, the reaction so far has been fairly positive. The results handily beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Analysts and investors appear to be in agreement and sent the stock higher in Friday’s session. 24/7 Wall St. has included some brief highlights from the earnings report, as well as what a few analysts are saying after the fact. The company posted $0.79 in earnings per share (EPS) and $16.37 billion in revenue, compared with consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters that called for $0.75 in EPS and revenue of $15.76 billion. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $0.76 and $14.9 billion in revenue. Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating and raised its price target to $45 from $40, implying an upside of % from Thursday’s close ($37.56). This also represents a P/E of roughly 15-times 2018 estimated earnings of $2.98 per share. The firm further detailed in its recent report: We will continue to challenge management to scrutinize investments, to drive more leverage, and to generate higher levels of free cash flow – but the narrative of “spending scared” is not fully supported by the facts. With low investor expectations, “manageable” guidance and a Feb 9 Analyst Day, we see positive risk/reward. A few other analysts recently weighed in on Intel: Merrill Lynch reiterated a Buy rating with a $42 price target. Jefferies cut its price target to $45 from $46. Morgan Stanley upgraded it to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $38. Bernstein has a Market Perform rating and raised its price target to $36 from $33. Deutsche Bank has a Buy rating and raised its price target from $42 to $43. Goldman Sachs has a Neutral rating and raised the price target to $41 from $39. Needham raised its price target to $43 from $42. Shares of Intel were last seen up 2% at $38.34, with a consensus analyst price target of $40.09 and a 52-week trading range of $27.68 to $38.45.

Start conversations early: If you start talking about online safety early, it will make your job that much easier when your children get older. If your kids are young, start with simple rules like: 'don't open emails from people you don't know.' You want online safety to be part of normal behaviour. Set a good example: Set a positive example by limiting your time on social networks when at home and putting your phone away during dinner and family time. Keep strangers out: Most children have been using devices from an early age, desensitising them to the potentials risks of online behavior.  A false sense of security can set in for children and they could be unknowingly interacting with a social predator or dangerous person posing as a teen. This isn't just on social media networks; it applies to common services such as Uber, Lyft and Craigslist.  Remind kids that anyone can create a profile and to decline friend requests from strangers. Take control of your home network: The home network is the hub for all of your connected devices. New solutions, such as McAfee Secure Home Platform, help you easily manage and protect devices connected to this network while providing parental controls with permissions that can be tailored to the entire household. The first involves setting a positive example by limiting your time on social networks, as well as putting phones away during dinner and family time. Parents are also encouraged to have more conversations with their children on the topic of online safety as early as possible, pointing out rules such as 'don't open emails from people you don't know'. Warning children about fake profiles on social media, and urging them to decline friend requests from strangers as a rule is also important. Taking control of your home network - by installing software which allows parents to manage devices in the home - is another good way of boosting safety. The four tips have been released after researchers at Intel Security carried out a study of 1,000 parents in the UK that made up part of the research. More than 40 per cent said they were completely unaware of their children's activity online. 'Technology has revolutionised our home lives, with many parents relying on devices to help their children with learning and entertainment' said Nick Viney, VP of Consumer at Intel Security. 'However, we need to empower parents to actively manage how their families interact with those devices, to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the potential risks. 'When the correct security and privacy measures are taken, everyone in the family will feel more protected enabling them to fully enjoy all the benefits of living in a smart home.' Other findings in the study include that 29 per cent of parents are not concerned about their children interacting with a social predator or cyber criminal online. But a third of parents said they would monitor their children's online activity if there was an easier way to do it.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Can YOU solve this McDonald's maths puzzle?

Share this article Share 74 shares Intel is urging parents to follow their series of tips if they are worried about what their kids might be up to on the internet. Their tips include starting conversations early, setting a good example, and taking control of your home network (stock image) Further discoveries in the study were that 42 per cent of parents would choose to pause the internet in their household during bedtime if they could to stop their children from being distracted. And only 28 per cent of parents keep their children's devices in their possession when their children shouldn't be using them, and allow their children to use the devices when the correct security measures are in place. The results of the survey follow a forecast by Gartner that 'there will be more than 10.5 billion 'things' in homes by 2020'. It also comes after it was revealed the EdTech market is set to reach over £200 billion ($252 billion) in investment globally by 2020.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 74 shares Most watched News videos Graphic: NZ Breakers player's eye dislodged in horrific injury Pizza Hut customer finds workers in the back of empty restaurant in Bristol 'There goes that relationship' Trump's quip to BBC question Shocking CCTV shows car speed into Humber Bridge barrier Heartwarming scene as Grayce shares her puppies with owner Florida couple passed out in their car with two children in the backseat A close look at the huge crack formed across Arizona desert Enraged man punches laptop and quits job during 'meltdown' at airport Bizarre footage of multiple UFOs hovering near Mexican border Alarming moment guy violently pushes man onto tube tracks CCTV shows brave man fighting nunchuck-wielding robbers Inauguration etiquette 101: Escort First Lady up White House steps First ladies first?

January is typically a time of year that’s filled with a bit of gloom. Gone are the colourful Christmas decorations, replaced by grey, drab weather and a lengthy gap between pay days. Although London, and the country as a whole, may be faced with a gloomy month of train strikes, grey skies, rain  and non-stop Brexit discussions, it has proved to be a happy month for those tech companies that are banking on cloud computing technology. That’s right, it’s financial reporting season and while overall revenues can be a mixed bag, particularly for some of the older tech giants, there is one constant note of optimism – cloud. A quick glance across the coverage of the financial results from the likes of SAP, IBM, Microsoft, Alphabet, VMware, SAS, Intel, all show a finger being pointed at cloud as either saving or boosting financials. First off you can see the old guard, companies like IBM, SAP, and SAS. IBM for example reported that IBM Cloud revenue growth went up 35% year-to-year up to $13.7bn, while its cloud as-as-service run rate was $8.6bn, up 63% year-to-year. Although it’s overall financial results point to there still being significant struggles, the silver lining is IBM Cloud. SAP reported 2016 cloud subscription and support revenue up 31% to €2.99bn and forecast its cloud business to reach €29 Billion total revenue in 2020. Then you have SAS, not strictly a cloud company, but the company posted $3.2bn in total revenue, up 4% over 2015 and driven in part by cloud. The company points to associated revenue rising nearly 9% due to a growing demand for cost-effective, convenient and secure methods for accessing SAS solutions. Microsoft reported revenue for its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure as well as Windows Server products, with revenue up 8% to $6.9bn for the second quarter. The company said Azure revenue increased 93%. Intel, while aiming at a different area of the cloud industry – chips, reported an 8% year-over-year revenue increase for the quarter bringing in $4.7bn. What this all points to is the old guard seeing success to differing standards thanks to a shifting reliance upon the cloud industry. On the new breed front you have the likes of Alphabet, with the cloud unit of Google a part of a 62% growth to $3.4bn in the fourth quarter. Giving a precise figure for Google Cloud growth is impossible due to the unit’s results being combined with various other revenue figures. Google’s main revenue source of advertising remains the dominant force, growing 17.4% to $22.4bn in the quarter, but clearly cloud is among one of its strongest growth areas. VMware meanwhile has quashed rumours of the demise of vSphere and troubles caused by the Dell acquisition of EMC by reporting an extremely successful year. Q4 for the company saw revenue of $2.03bn, up 9% year on year and the company even surpassed the $7bn mark for the year with revenue of $7.09bn, up 8% on 2015. The company spent a lot of 2016 pushing more significantly in the cloud area with its Cross-Cloud and significant partnerships with the likes of Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud bolstered its already existing support for Microsoft Azure. VMware’s cloud journey is one that predicts private cloud to remain an important factor as businesses continue to see it as an important element of their cloud strategies. So, what does this tell us? Well it tells us that the cloud continues to provide a significant opportunity for growth among tech companies that are both young and old. The success isn’t just a public cloud one, private remains a significant area of growth and that all bodes well for the likes of Intel and it providing the chips for the servers that run in the data centres. Tech companies that are looking at providing hybrid cloud options, such as IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure & VMware, will all clearly benefit from growth across all segments. Expect to see these growth figures continue to rise at a significant rate throughout the year as more and more businesses see the value of cloud and either begin to adopt it or significantly increase their reliance upon it. It shouldn’t be forgotten that the cloud market is still effectively in its infancy and has a way to go till it surpasses the traditional enterprise IT market. Gartner projected that the public cloud services market alone would total $208.6bn, while IDC predict that worldwide IT spending will surpass $2.8 trillion in 2019. There’s a lot of market for cloud to eat in to and it doesn’t look like slowing down.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Jan 28, 2017 - Page 5　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Cloud lifts Microsoft, Intel, Alphabet results Bloomberg Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp, which all posted quarterly results on Thursday, reinforced what has become a truism in technology: The biggest growth is in businesses that deliver computing over the Internet. Microsoft topped projections on the strength of rising customer sign-ups for its cloud offerings like Azure, which saw revenue almost double. Intel sales rose more than expected, helped by orders for processors that power data-center servers — the machines at the heart of cloud computing. While profit at Google parent Alphabet disappointed, the numbers also signaled that heavy spending to catch cloud leaders Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft is paying off. Google’s Other Revenue line, which includes cloud computing, jumped 62 percent to US$3.4 billion in the fourth quarter. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google chief executive officer Sundar Pichai said during a conference call with analysts. “I definitely think we’re going to have a great year.” What started a decade ago as an easy way for startups to run Web sites has turned into an increasingly popular way for companies of all sizes to access the software needed to run their operations. Many big technology companies are in a strong position to provide this because they already have huge data centers to support their own Web services. More than US$1 trillion in IT spending will be directly or indirectly affected by the shift to cloud during the next five years, Gartner Inc estimated in July last year. “This will make cloud computing one of the most disruptive forces of IT spending since the early days of the digital age,” the research firm said at the time. Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella has been working to reposition the company around such Internet services. In addition to robust demand for Azure, consumers and corporations continue to purchase Office 365, a cloud-based version of the company’s productivity software that includes Word and Excel. Almost 25 million consumers are now subscribed to Office 365, Microsoft said, and sales increased 47 percent in the fiscal second quarter. “As long as cloud is growing, people are happy,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Mark Moerdler said. “If margins are growing, people are even happier.” Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has been spending on data centers and adding products to win new cloud customers. The company has pledged to reach annualized revenue of US$20 billion in its corporate cloud business by the fiscal year that ends in June next year. Intel’s fourth-quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers jumped 30 percent from a year earlier. Offsetting that, companies and government agencies spent 7 percent less than they had in the same quarter last year on equipping their in-house computer rooms, the company said. “It’s moving to the public cloud, it’s moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected,” Intel chief executive officer Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Amazon reports earnings next week and analysts at RBC Capital Markets expect the company’s AWS cloud business to generate US$3.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, up 50 percent from a year earlier. “Microsoft is the plumbing in the cloud,” Moerdler said. “Amazon is much bigger, but still Amazon and Microsoft are pulling away from the pack.” This story has been viewed 1746 times.

Morgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore upgraded the rating on the company from Underweight to Equal Weight, while raising the price target from $35 to $38. Q4 Results Intel reported its revenue for Q4 at $16.4 billion, beating the consensus and the estimate, driven by improved performance in client computing, which more than offset the slower than anticipated growth at the datacenter segment. The non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.79, marginally ahead of consensus. Client computing grew 3 percent quarter on quarter and 4.3 percent year-on-year during Q4 to $9.1 billion. 2017 Guidance The analyst believes, however, that Intel’s guidance is based on a more realistic outlook for the datacenter segment, following the 35 percent underperformance to semiconductor group over the last two years. Although management is expected to drive growth back to 10 percent over time, the current guidance of high-single-digit growth for 2017 appears much more realistic. Moore believes the PC guidance is also achievable, “some nice cushion from y/y average selling price increases early in the year following 2016's 6 percent increase.” However, Intel’s 2017 revenue and operating income guidance was below the consensus forecasts but in line with the estimate, while the EPS guidance was in line with expectations, reflecting lower taxes and higher investment income. Free cash flow is expected to decline due to an expected increase in capital spending. At last check, shares of Intel were up 1.85 percent at $38.26.

Microsoft reported revenue of $24.1bn and profit of $5.2bn for the quarter ending 31 December 2016, an increase of 2% and 4% respectively compared with the same period a year ago. Cloud-delivered software and services made significant contributions to the reportedly better-than-expected revenue and profit growth for the quarter. The company’s intelligent cloud segment revenue grew 8% to $6.9bn, with server products and cloud services revenue up 12% and Azure revenue up 93%, while Azure compute usage more than doubled year-over-year. Although the personal computing segment fell 5% to $11.8bn, mainly due to lower phone revenue, Microsoft reported that Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue was up 5%, while the productivity and business processes segment – which includes LinkedIn – grew 10% to $7.4bn.  Microsoft said since its acquisition on 8 December 2016, LinkedIn had contributed revenue of $228m for the quarter. Further underlining the value of Microsoft’s investment in datacentres and switch to cloud-based software, the company reported Microsoft Office 365 commercial revenue growth for the quarter of 47%. Gaming revenue fell by 3% on lower Xbox console revenue, but Microsoft said Xbox software and services revenue was higher and Xbox Live’s active users for the quarter grew 15% to 55 million. “Our customers are seeing greater value and opportunity as we partner with them through their digital transformation,” said Satya Nadella, CEO at Microsoft. “Accelerating advancements in AI [artificial intelligence] across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud.” Alphabet’s cloud business on ‘upswing’ At Google parent Alphabet, investors reportedly said profit for the quarter was disappointing despite an 8% increase to $5.3bn on revenue of $26bn, but overall results show that investments geared to providing cloud-based services are paying off. Although Google advertising revenue still accounts for 86% of Alphabet’s revenue, Google’s “other revenue” segment, which includes cloud computing, jumped to $3.4bn for the quarter, an increase of 62% compared with the same period a year ago. “Our cloud business is on a terrific upswing,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts on a conference call, with more than 3 million companies reportedly subscribing to Google’s GSuite cloud services. “We’re going to have a great year.” The growth in cloud and other areas is important for Alphabet as web and mobile ads drop in value, as shown by the 15% fall in Google’s earnings-per-click compared with the same period the year before. While Alphabet’s “other bets” are still losing money, revenue from segment increased by 75% year-over-year, climbing to $262m for the quarter. The segment posted losses of nearly $1.1bn. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said the company’s 22% increase in revenue for the quarter year-on-year was led by mobile search and YouTube. “We’re seeing great momentum in Google’s newer investment areas and ongoing strong progress in Other Bets,” she said. Intel boosted by cloud Intel reported better-than-expected record revenue of $16.4bn, an increase of 10% compared with the previous year, but profit of $3.6bn, which was down 1%. Revenue was boosted by orders for processors that power datacentre servers responsible for cloud computing services. Intel’s fourth quarter sales of server chips to cloud service providers increased 30% from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg. Intel said its datacentre group revenue was up 3% year-over-year and up 4.4% compared with the previous quarter to $4.7bn. “It’s [because of] moving to the public cloud and moving to those areas at a faster rate than we expected,” Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said on a conference call. Although the PC market is still down, Intel’s main Client Computing Group reported revenue of $9.1bn for the quarter, an increase of 4% compared with the same period a year ago. Intel is slowly building its internet of things (IoT) group, which reported quarterly revenue of $726m, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Leading the cloud In July 2016, Gartner predicted more than $1tn in IT spending will be directly or indirectly targeted away from traditional IT delivery models and to the cloud between now and the year 2020. Share prices reflect this optimism, with Microsoft and Alphabet shares recently hitting record levels and Intel’s share price coming close to an all-time high set in October 2016, according to Bloomberg. Amazon is soon due to report earnings and Bloomberg reports that analysts expect the company’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business to report a 50% year-on-year increase in quarterly revenue to $3.6bn. Analysts said while Amazon’s cloud business is much bigger than Microsoft’s, both companies are beginning to emerge as the market leaders.

All you can do is make the cut. And the one after that and the one after that. Nobody has really claimed Oklahoma has a legitimate shot at Houston Bellaire Episcopal defensive tackle Marvin Wilson, but the Sooners are still standing. They made the top 10 in the summer. They made the final five at Under Armour week. And they’ve hit all the right notes in this final month heading into Wilson’s decision 3:30 p.m. CST on Feb. 1 on ESPN. http://www.scout.com/player/192587-marvin-wilson?s=73 Wilson, a five-star prospect ranked No. 1 at defensive tackle, is down to OU, Florida State, LSU, Ohio State and South Florida. OU wasn’t even in the picture this time last year. However, the hiring of Calvin Thibodeaux as defensive line coach proved to be a difference maker. Not only for his built-in ties to Houston, but also because of the way he has developed relationships with everybody during his first year in Norman. It started with Tulsa (Okla.) Memorial’s Isaiah Thomas and Thomas’ coaches knew things were going to be different. “The day Thibs got the job – if it was the same day, it was the next day – I talked to him and knew from the 30-minute phone call that he was different,” Memorial defensive line coach Darnell Whitaker said. “My opinion, and I don’t use this word a lot, I think Thibs is ‘big time.’” After three months of recruiting Thomas, Thibodeaux was able to get the Scout 300 prospect to commit in late May. That’s half the battle. Everybody knows in recruiting it’s great to get someone, but it’s a different story to hold onto somebody. Thibodeaux has done that and then some with Thomas. “When it came to Coach Thibs, he explained every reason why I would be a good fit,” Thomas said. “He really has a plan. This is the guy I want to play for. “Before, we were talking on a professional level. Now it’s more like a family. We’re more comfortable and can communicate about anything.” Thibodeaux has hit the ground running in the last couple of months. When you viewed OU’s highly touted SoonerSquad17 class, there were a lot of big names but something missing when it came to defensive line. Thibodeaux never threw in the towel with Wilson. Kept coming. Kept showing the interest. Kept showing the attention and respect. It wasn’t a surprise to Whitaker. “Even after Isaiah committed, Thibs never stopped recruiting and that means a lot,” Whitaker said. “When getting recruited, one thing you look for is a coach that really cares about you. Thibs really does, and it shows.” Relationships can only go so far, though. The one thing tough to acknowledge for OU was scheme. How did Wilson fit in OU’s 3-4 defensive front? The truth of the matter is he doesn’t or at least he didn’t. But if you listen to recruits in the last month, the Sooners are making the move from a 3-4 to a 4-3, which is tailormade for someone as talented and destructive as Wilson. Then it came time for the final push. OU did just that Monday evening sending six coaches. Bob Stoops, Mike Stoops, Thibodeaux, Tim Kish, Lincoln Riley and Dennis Simmons. Four of them (Mike Stoops, Thibodeaux, Riley, Simmons) wore OU No. 99 jerseys, the number Wilson would wear in Norman. Six coaches. It made an impression. “It was like nothing I have ever seen before,” Wilson told Sooners Illustrated. A source said it was the best recruiting pitch OU has ever delivered in quite some time. They were ready. They had a plan. If Wilson was wondering how OU could develop a talent like him, they had the answer. One cohesive unit with six coaches making the final stand. OU had some more help later in the week with former five-star defensive linemen Gerald McCoy and Tommie Harris both tweet to Wilson about why OU should be the choice. https://twitter.com/Geraldini93/status/823947148773486594 https://twitter.com/Tommieharris90/status/823960551655165953 The Sooners pushed all the right buttons at the right time. No guarantee OU is the name chosen next Wednesday. No guarantee that fax is coming to Norman, but Thibodeaux and the staff did everything they could. Now? It’s just a waiting game.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Przybylo podcast: Final visit weekend for OU OU's persistence wins over Tyreece Lott Scout 2017 Rankings Directory Sooner Intel: Isaiah Thomas Scout's Senior All-Americans For 2016 Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Sooner Intel: Isaiah Thomas Intel returns with an update on OU commit Isaiah Thomas. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 8:17 AM Breaking News OU's persistence wins over Tyreece LottOU wouldn't take no for an answer and earned a yes from Tyreece Lott. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 8:05 AM Sooner Intel: Tre Norwood Intel returns with an update on OU commit Tre Norwood. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 6:15 AM Sooner Intel: OU news and nuggets Intel returns with a look at the visitors for the final weekend before signing day for OU. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 6:08 AM SoonerSquad17 profile: Levi Draper Eleven members of SoonerSquad17 have arrived in Norman.

Alphabet PT Cut; Microsoft, Southwest PTs Hiked; Ford Upgraded (Investor's Business Daily) Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) reported overall strong results for Q4, with upside being driven by the client and memory segments, although datacenter was weaker. Bernstein’s Stacy A. Rasgon maintains a Market-Perform rating on the company, while raising the price target from $33 to $36. Disappointing Guidance The analyst mentioned that the revenue and gross margin guidance for Q1 was also above the consensus expectations, although the opex guidance was also higher than expected. For 2017, the revenue guidance was roughly in line with the consensus forecast, after adjusting for McAfee. However, the opex guidance was again well ahead of consensus, with capex at a record $12 billion, “as Intel builds out for their memory ramp and 10nm.” “While 2017 guidance incorporates some caution on PCs and (for the first time) a cut to datacenter to start out the year, some investors are likely to approve of a revenue outlook that could be somewhat conservative,” Rasgon stated. FCF Declining The analyst noted, however, that both Intel's margins and datacenter results were disappointing, with opex control appearing to slip. The EPS guidance was also of “somewhat” low quality, while free cash flow has been declining due to record capex. “Additionally, it seems memory is no longer just a memory for Intel. Indeed, while we do believe revenues for the year could come in higher than guidance, memory is likely to be the major swing factor,” Rasgon went on to say. At last check, shares of Intel were up 1.78 percent at $38.23.

Microsoft rose 1.9 percent to $65.50 in premarket trading, while Intel gained 0.4 percent to $37.71 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time and giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks. All three major indexes were on track to post weekly gains. "The market has had a strong, solid rally and there's a pause to evaluate and react to the next set of data and other catalysts that could move the market," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. "Actions speak louder than words and the fact that Trump has signed numerous executive orders since his inauguration continues to heighten hopes of the proposed fiscal stimulus measures materializing," said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM.

Corporate sector optimism has gained further support from stronger consumer confidence and moderate growth in the energy sector, while anticipations of protectionist customs tariffs, lower taxes and greater infrastructure spending from the US budget have all brightened the outlook for this year. However, the still-high corporate taxes somewhat hindered the private sector sentiment. The Q4 earnings of Alphabet Inc., the owner of Google, surpassed previous estimates due to a rapid expansion of the company's cloud-computing services and a surge in YouTube advertising. High taxation rates, on the other hand, impaired the investors' cheer. © Flickr/ Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung Germany Follows US Fact-Checking Institute Sponsored by Soros on War Path Against 'Fake News'Google advertising advanced 17.4pc to $22.4 bln in 4Q16, and the expansion in Android app sales, hardware, such as Google phones, and cloud services has been buoyant and is poised to gain further momentum. Alphabet's revenue from other sources rose 62pc to $3.4 bln. Overall, Alphabet's revenue rose 23pc, by $21.2 bln year-on-year, compared to earlier market predictions of a $20.6-billion growth. Profit-per-equity, however, fell short of estimates at $9.36 compared to $9.63 expected earlier because of prohibitively high corporate taxes, at 22pc now compared to 5pc one year earlier. On Wall Street, Alphabet's stock dropped 2.2pc as lower profitability weighed on investor sentiment, stirring concern regarding excessive governmental interference and hindering the effects of an actual business expansion. "It was a good quarter revenue-wise, but margins were a little light because some of the strongest revenue growth came from licensing and other business that are less profitable," Ken Sena of Evercore ISI said. Another tech major, Microsoft, also beat earlier predictions, mainly due to the rapid expansion in its cloud services, where revenue almost doubled for certain products. Orders for hardware, such as data-center processors, also posted gains. "As long as the cloud is growing, people are happy," Mark Moerdler of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said. "If margins are growing, people are even happier." © Flickr/ Truthout.org Microsoft Workers Sue Over PTSD Caused by Porn - LawsuitOne of Microsoft's most popular products, cloud-powered Office 365, saw a greater demand from both individual and corporate clients, with sales having increased by 47pc. About 25 mln users have purchased a subscription to Office 365 at this point. Microsoft is aiming to increase its revenues to $20 bln per year in their cloud business alone. Currently, the figure stands at $14 bln. Meanwhile, Intel saw a 30-percent annualized increase in sales of cloud server chips. However, orders from private and governmental entities dropped 7pc year-on-year. "It's moving to the public cloud, it's moving to those areas at a faster rate than I think we expected," Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, said. In other sectors, further gains in oil prices supported investor confidence in energy stocks, and overall, US corporate profits are poised to gain some 7pc for the fourth quarter, their largest gain in two years. "If all the economic data is good, if the earnings are good and the market doesn't really seem to think anything (President Trump) says or does is negative, I don't see any downside," Randy Frederick of Austin, TX-based Charles Schwab said. © AP Photo/ Richard Drew Wall Street Traders 'Should Have Been Jailed' For 2008 Financial CrisisThe US fourth quarter GDP report is expected early on Friday, and is likely to show a 2.2-percent expansion, typical for the weak Obama-era recovery, and insufficient to further boost the financial markets' sentiment. For this year, investors are expecting a 10-percent gain in their revenues, based off their expectations of the Trump administration's plan to invest $1 trln in infrastructure. However, as the current 10-year economic cycle draws to a close, the anticipated economic and financial market expansion might be damaged to profit-taking closer to the decade's end. "We think there is going to be a cost to this growth in the form of a downturn in 2019 — if we get the full Trump plan, there is a bigger boom in 2017 and 2018, then a bigger bust in 2019," Tim Drayson of Legal & General Investment Management said. ...

Honeywell did reaffirm its prior 2017 earnings outlook. General Dynamics — The defense contractor beat estimates by 10 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $2.62 per share, though revenue fell below forecasts. The company calls the quarter "solid" and notes an increase in profit margins. Comcast — The NBCUniversal parent was downgraded to "sector weight" from "overweight" at Pacific Crest, saying the current valuation fails to reflect increased competitive risk. American Airlines — The airline matched estimates, earning an adjusted 92 cents per share, while revenue beat estimates. The company also approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. Ford — The automaker's stock was upgraded to "outperform" from "sector form" at RBC Capital following Thursday's earnings report and subsequent stock price drop. RBC said expectations surrounding Ford are low and that the next earnings revision is likely to be higher. Colgate-Palmolive — The consumer products maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 75 cents per share, in line with estimates, but revenue fell below forecasts. Colgate's overall pricing came in higher, but total sales were lower compared to a year earlier. Intel — The chipmaker beat estimates by 5 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 79 cents per share. Revenue also beat forecasts as the PC market stabilized and demand increased for Intel's data center services. Starbucks — Starbucks matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 52 cents per share, but the coffee chain's revenue came in below forecasts, as did the 3 percent increase in both global and U.S. comparable store sales. Alphabet — Alphabet reported adjusted quarterly profit of $9.36 per share for its latest quarter, missing estimates of $9.64, though the Google parent's revenue did beat forecasts. Profit did increase by 8.3 percent over a year earlier, with more mobile usage, but analysts have noted that advertisers are not willing to pay as much for mobile searches as they are for their desktop equivalents. Microsoft — Microsoft came in 4 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 83 cents per share, with the software giant's revenue also beating Street forecasts. Microsoft is seeing growing demand for its newer cloud services, as it continues to shift emphasis away from the traditional software business. PayPal — PayPal earned an adjusted 42 cents per share for its latest quarter, with both the top and bottom lines matching Street forecasts. The payment service company's total payment volume did miss estimates, however. TransCanada — TransCanada submitted its permit application to the State Department for the now-revived Keystone XL pipeline project. Juniper Networks — Juniper earned an adjusted 63 cents per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents above estimates, while the networking services company's revenue also beat forecasts. However, Juniper's shares came under pressure after the company predicted lower than expected current quarter results. VMWare — VMWare beat estimates by 4 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.43 per share, while revenue beat forecasts as well. The cloud services company also announced a $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan. Wynn Resorts — Wynn missed estimates by 35 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 50 cents per share, although the casino operator did see revenue come in above forecasts. Investors, however, are encouraged by upbeat results at the company's Wynn Palace resort in Macau.

Revenue will be $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million, the Santa Clara, California-based company said Thursday in a statement.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said he’s making progress in trying to generate revenue from more diverse sources such as cars and mobile phones while lessening the chipmaker’s reliance on a shrinking PC business. The results reported Thursday showed that Intel has carved out more sales in some areas, but profit is still tied to demand for processors running server computers in giant data centers. Intel reported 8 percent revenue growth to $4.67 billion in its data center unit, a slower increase than the company’s long-term target. Server sales were hurt by the shift of corporate computing to outsourcing with cloud service providers, the company said. Intel isn’t backing off its belief that it can return to double-digit percentage growth in server chips, Krzanich said, helped by increasing demand in networking and communications. “This thing will go back to double digits,” he told analysts on a conference call. He declined to predict when that might be. “This is an anomaly right now.” Shrinking PCs The company’s client computing group, which sells PC chips, gained 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion in the fourth quarter. For the year, the company is predicting that PC shipments will decline in the mid-single-digit percent range. That’s better than prior years, but worse than market forecasters are projecting. “We enter the year with a bit of a cautious view” on the total market for PCs in 2017, Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said in a phone interview. In the short term, demand for personal computers isn’t shrinking as fast as it was and Intel and other companies that depend on the market are enjoying a respite, according to Tristan Gerra, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. “PC trends have continued to surprise a little bit on the upside,” he said. December computer sales were higher than predicted and Intel’s orders from Apple Inc. for the iPhone are helping reduce its mobile division’s losses, he said. Shipments of personal computers fell 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, a narrower decline than the preceding quarter, researcher IDC said earlier this month. For the full year, shipments declined 5.7 percent -- following an 11 percent drop in 2015 when they dipped below 300 million for the first time since 2008. Intel shares were little changed in extended trading following the announcement. The stock gained 5.3 percent last year, compared with a 37 percent surge by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. Fourth Quarter Fourth-quarter net income was $3.6 billion, or 73 cents a share, compared with $3.6 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent to $16.4 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was 79 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had predicted a profit of 75 cents a share on sales of $15.8 billion. Adjusted gross margin, or the percentage of sales left after subtracting production costs, narrowed to 63.1 percent from 64.8 percent a year earlier, Intel said. That measure of profitability will be 63 percent, plus or minus “a couple of percentage points,” in the current quarter, Intel said. Intel predicted that 2017 annual revenue will be unchanged from 2016. The forecast includes the divestiture of its Intel Security Group announced last year. Analysts had estimated a revenue increase of 4 percent for the year. The company plans to boost spending in 2017 on new plants and equipment to about $12 billion, an increase of about $2 billion from last year. The company is expanding its production of new memory chip technology. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

He reported that data centre growth was good, Cloud service provider revenue was up 24 percent, and communications service provider revenue grew 19 percent. Internet of Things revenue was also strong. Krzanich claimed that data growth would continue to skyrocket, creating demand for Intel’s processors. He said that a connected car could generate 4,000 gigabytes of data per day. He noted that the company has good design wins in connected cars with BMW, Baidu, and Delphi. In artificial intelligence, Krzanich said Intel processors are used in more than 90 percent of machine learning applications. Client computing sales, which include processors for desktops and laptops, had strong execution and higher average selling prices (up seven percent from a year ago) as customers opted for more gaming computers and high-end PCs, Krzanich said. During the quarter, Intel saw that the worldwide PC supply chain remained healthy and had inventory get used during the three months, said chief financial officer Bob Swan. However, over all the figures appear to be mixed. Intel misted its target on earnings per share but beating estimates for revenues. The results were driven by revenues from desktop and laptop computer chips, data centre chips, and the Internet of Things. The latter was up 15 percent for the full year. The cocaine nose jobs of Wall Street had expected Intel to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $15.8 billion for the fourth quarter. For the full year, they were expected earnings per share of $2.67 on revenue of $58.9 billion. Fourth quater earnings came in at $3.6 billion, or 73 a share, on revenue of $16.4 billion. A year ago, earnings per share were 74 cents, with revenue at $14.9 billion. Next year though things might change for Chipzilla. AMD is expecting to be more competitive against Intel in 2017 as it readies its new Zen processors for PCs, laptops, and servers and Qualcomm is expecting to put more of its ARM based chips into PCs. Net income for the year was $10.3 billion, while overall revenue for the year was $59.4 billion. A year ago, net income was $11.3 billion on revenue of $55.4 billion. Intel cut about 12,000 jobs during the year as it restructured to get behind the company’s focused priorities. This includes spinning off McAfee, formerly Intel Security, as a separate business. Intel expects 2017 to be flat in terms of revenue. Krzanich said the company is taking a conservative view of 2017 PC unit sales than other analysts, but he noted there was record demand for Intel PC chips in Q4. Unit sales for 2017 could decline in the mid-single digit percentages, Krzanich said. Intel is positioning itself to lower its costs during the coming year.

In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.

Revenue from the data centre business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data centre group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centres, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data centre, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index <.SOX>.

In the annual report for his trust, the manager said he also believes that "in the future, all companies will be internet companies", repeating the words of the late Andy Grove, CEO of semiconductor manufacturer Intel. Train (pictured) said: "This is an exciting but scary proposition. But the companies doing interesting things with digital - whether they are tech companies or far removed - are the ones making progress."

He added: "It really matters to us that visits to Hargreaves Lansdown's website are up 19% year-on-year, or that Burberry's digital customer contacts rose over 30% in the last financial year to £40m. "The point is, there is nowhere to hide. It is so important to ensure you are invested in companies where technology can be their friend." Train pointed out that in July 2000, the top five global companies by market cap bar one (General Electric) were technology businesses such as Microsoft and Intel. By July 2006, banks and oil companies joined the top five. But in July 2016 - for the first time ever - the top five consisted exclusively of tech companies: Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Train: Why I have highest ever equity allocation in my investment trust The trust manager, who is also co-founder of asset management house Lindsell Train, said: "This emphasises just how important technology has become in driving economies and stock markets. In fact, we do not think much else really matters." Commenting on the outlook for global and UK equities, Train said he is "more excited" than he has ever been. "Almost every company we meet can see an opportunity for unprecedented growth or efficiency gains or both," he said. Over three years to 24 January, the trust has returned 35%, outperforming both its FTSE All-Share benchmark (19%) and its AIC UK Equity Income sector average (12.5%), according to FE. It is currently trading on a 0.3% premium.

Is Apple’s attack on Qualcomm’s licensing practices a red flag investors shouldn't ignore? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 26, 2017 at 8:52PM Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The lawsuit is related to the FTC's separate lawsuit against Qualcomm, which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out of the market. Let's take a closer look at this tangled mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their shares. Image source: Apple. Why is Apple suing Qualcomm? Back in 2008, Sprint deployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn't heavily dependent on Qualcomm's patent portfolio. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard -- which it could generate more licensing fees from. At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions, Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple "rebates" for sticking with its baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things --  exclusively using Qualcomm's chips (from 2011 to 2016), and not instigating any litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially "bribed" Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to competing chipsets.   Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975 million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments -- which it's now suing to recover. The outcome is anyone's guess... The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty one, since it's dependent on many shifting variables. First, the FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement; but if it isn't, the rebates could be invalidated as "bribes" -- which may hurt both companies.  Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple needs to prove that it didn't violate the two main conditions of its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn't deny aiding the KFTC at all -- it recently told CNN that it was merely "responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies" instead of "instigating" litigation against Qualcomm. Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device's entire value, instead of just the chips in the device -- a practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don't use any of its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless technologies -- although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm's licensed patents don't actually cover those core technologies. This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past), and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of rebates. Understanding the risks to Qualcomm If Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business' margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business generates the lion's share of its profits. It could also jeopardize Qualcomm's planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI), which would make it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If Qualcomm doesn't close that deal this year, its top line will remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing business. But should you sell Qualcomm? Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout ratio of 53%. As a Qualcomm shareholder, I'm certainly disappointed with recent developments. But I don't plan to sell my shares unless the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I'll still consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with solid growth prospects in adjacent markets like connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets.

And while parents are clearly concerned about what their kids may find online, research shows that many don't keep track of their kids' browsing habits. Security experts at Intel Security studied 13,000 people worldwide and concluded that while 79% of parents are worried about online safety, only 60% actually keep track of online behaviour. What's more, 40% of the 1,000 British parents that made up part of the research said they were totally unaware of their children's online activity. Interestingly, a third of parents (29%) said they would monitor their children’s online activity if there was an easier way to do it.

"When the correct security and privacy measures are taken, everyone in the family will feel more protected enabling them to fully enjoy all the benefits of living in a smart home.” Read More Why one in five kids are losing sleep - and how it is impacting their learning Children are now spending an average of 15 hours a week online (Photo: Peter Byrne/PA Wire) Intel has laid out a series of tips for parents to follow if they're concerned about what their kids might be doing online: Start conversations early. If you start talking about online safety early, it will make your job that much easier when your children get older. If your kids are young, start with simple rules like: “don’t open emails from people you don’t know.” You want online safety to be part of normal behavior. Set a good example. It’s easy to get caught up spending a lot of time on our devices, and kids pick up our habits – both good and bad. Set a positive example by limiting your time on social networks when at home and putting your phone away during dinner and family time. Keep strangers out. Most children have been using devices from an early age, desensitising them to the potentials risks of online behavior. A false sense of security can set in for children and they could be unknowingly interacting with a social predator or dangerous person posing as a teen (catfish). Remind kids that anyone can create a profile and to decline friend requests from strangers. Take control of your home network. The home network is the hub for all of your connected devices. New solutions, such as McAfee Secure Home Platform, help you easily manage and protect devices connected to this network while providing parental controls with permissions that can be tailored to the entire household. poll loading Do YOU monitor your children's internet activity? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @MirrorTech Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Parenting Technology all Most Read Most Recent HeadphonesForget the AirPods, Motorola answers Apple with new VerveOne wireless headphones The totally wireless new plugs are touted to have an 8-hour battery life and will work with iOS and Android gadgets CopyrightKodi warning issued for people who are using the boxes to stream shows illegally The emergence of Kodi or certainly those who use it illegally is now seemingly the top priority for rightsholders iPhone 8iPhone 8: Release date, price, rumours and news about Apple's 2017 iPhone Apple only just launched its iPhone 7 a few months ago, but many eyes are already turning to next year's model, the iPhone 8, which is expected to be Apple's biggest launch in years Eastman Kodak CompanyKodak u-turn as it announces it WILL bring back old-fashioned film almost five years after axing it for good Ektachrome - dubbed the gold standard by photographers - will return to shelves this year Samsung GalaxySamsung Galaxy S8 release date and final design revealed with latest leaked pictures The upcoming flagship smartphone from Samsung sports a radically different design from last year's Samsung Galaxy S7 Eastman Kodak CompanyKodak u-turn as it announces it WILL bring back old-fashioned film almost five years after axing it for good Ektachrome - dubbed the gold standard by photographers - will return to shelves this year HeadphonesForget the AirPods, Motorola answers Apple with new VerveOne wireless headphones The totally wireless new plugs are touted to have an 8-hour battery life and will work with iOS and Android gadgets Buzz AldrinBuzz Aldrin gives touching tribute on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 1 fire "We didn't only lose fellow astronauts.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 27, 2017January 27, 2017 by Press Release Should You Sell Qualcomm After Apple's $1 Billion Lawsuit? Shares of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) plunged 13% on Jan. 23 after the chipmaker was sued for $1 billion by one of its biggest customers, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) . The lawsuit is related to the FTC’s separate lawsuit against Qualcomm , which alleges that the chipmaker leveraged its portfolio of critical wireless patents to force its baseband competitors out of the market. Let’s take a closer look at this tangled mess, and see if Qualcomm shareholders should sell their shares. Image source: Apple. Why is Apple suing Qualcomm? Back in 2008, Sprint deployed its first WiMax network, a 4G standard which wasn’t heavily dependent on Qualcomm’s patent portfolio. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) championed the use of WiMax chips, but Qualcomm opposed WiMax in favor of its upcoming LTE standard — which it could generate more licensing fees from. At the time, Apple considered launching an iPhone for WiMax networks. Realizing that the move could hurt its LTE ambitions, Qualcomm agreed to pay Apple “rebates” for sticking with its baseband modems and waiting for its LTE standard instead. Those rebate payments were dependent on Apple doing two things — exclusively  using Qualcomm’s chips (from 2011 to 2016), and not instigating  any litigation which accused the chipmaker of unfair licensing practices. The FTC claims that Qualcomm essentially “bribed” Apple with those rebates to prevent it from switching to competing chipsets. Over the past two years, Qualcomm was hit with antitrust probes worldwide, which all allege that it charges unfair licensing fees for its 3G/4G technologies. It was fined $975 million in China, another $854 million in South Korea, and could face up to $3 billion in additional fines in Europe and Taiwan. Apple claims that because it cooperated with authorities in Korea during the investigation, Qualcomm retaliated by withholding $1 billion in rebate payments — which it’s now suing to recover. The outcome is anyone’s guess… The battle between Qualcomm and Apple will be a long and nasty one, since it’s dependent on many shifting variables. First, the FTC lawsuit could be dropped if commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen, a Republican who voted against charging Qualcomm that was just appointed the acting chairwoman by the Trump Administration, chooses not to follow through. If the case is dropped, the rebates should remain a valid business arrangement; but if it isn’t, the rebates could be invalidated as “bribes” — which may hurt both companies.  Regardless of what happens with the FTC case, Apple needs to prove that it didn’t violate the two main conditions of its rebate agreement by using Intel modems or aiding the Korean FTC during its investigation. Apple doesn’t deny aiding the KFTC at all — it recently told CNN that it was merely “responding truthfully to law enforcement agencies” instead of “instigating” litigation against Qualcomm. Meanwhile, Qualcomm must justify many of its opaque licensing practices. Qualcomm charges royalties based on a device’s entire value, instead of just the chips in the device — a practice that was already blocked by Chinese regulators. It also charges licensing fees on 3G/4G handsets which don’t use any of its chips, since  those devices still rely on its wireless technologies — although Apple argues that some of Qualcomm’s licensed patents don’t actually cover those core technologies. This means that Apple still pays Qualcomm fees on iPhones using Intel modems (and also the Infineon modems it used in the past), and that those fees are likely higher due to the lack of rebates. Understanding the risks to Qualcomm If Qualcomm loses its cases against Apple and other regulators, it could be forced to change its entire licensing model. That move would cause the QTL (licensing) business’ margins to wither and crush its earnings since the business generates the lion’s share of its profits. It could also jeopardize Qualcomm’s planned acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) , which would make it the largest automotive chipmaker in the world while expanding its patent portfolio. If Qualcomm doesn’t close that deal this year, its top line will remain heavily exposed to the commoditization of the smartphone market and seemingly endless challenges against its licensing business. But should you sell Qualcomm? Qualcomm faces plenty of legal headwinds, but I believe that the sell-off is a knee jerk reaction that has knocked the stock down to irrational levels. Qualcomm now trades at 14 times earnings, as opposed to the industry average of 22. It also pays a forward yield of 3.4%, which is easily supported by a payout ratio of 53%. As a Qualcomm shareholder, I’m certainly disappointed with recent developments. But I don’t plan to sell my shares unless the litigation either derails the NXP deal or forces Qualcomm to dramatically reduce its licensing fees. Until then, I’ll still consider Qualcomm a cheap (albeit riskier) dividend play with solid growth prospects in adjacent markets like connected cars, drones, and Internet of Things gadgets. 10 stocks we like better than Apple When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Candlesticks A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened). During the past 10 bars, there have been 5 white candles and 5 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 28 white candles and 22 black candles for a net of 6 white candles. Momentum Indicators Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators. Stochastic Oscillator One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 81.7746. This is an overbought reading. However, a signal is not generated until the Oscillator crosses below 80 The last signal was a buy 16 period(s) ago. Relative Strength Index (RSI) The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 62.52. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a buy 54 period(s) ago. Commodity Channel Index (CCI) The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 164.This is an overbought reading. However, a signal isn’t generated until the indicator crosses below 100. The last signal was a sell 23 period(s) ago. MACD The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 2 period(s) ago.

By TheresePoletti Columnist Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. saw better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter thanks in part to a boost from PC sales during the holidays, but both companies know that help won’t last. Intel’s INTC, +1.12%  PC revenue rose 4% and beat analyst estimates by more than $500 million, thanks to record sales of its Core i7, with a better mix of higher end chips being sold. Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, though, told analysts on a conference call to discuss the company’s earnings results that the chip maker has a slightly more conservative view on the PC market in 2017 than market-research firms. “As we look at Q1 and we look at 2017, we factored a little bit of caution in that as well,” Krzanich said, adding that Intel is looking for units to decline in the mid single-digit range. “That’s better than if you went back a year or so ago, we were in the high single-digits, depending on how you looked at it…So it is starting to get better, but I don’t think we’re back at a zero unit or positive unit [growth].” Microsoft MSFT, +2.35%  CEO Satya Nadella told analysts that the company saw growth across Windows broadly in the holiday quarter and that the consumer PC market was stabilizing, as Microsoft’s PC-focused business brought in $11.8 billion in the quarter. Nadella noted gamers increasingly “turning to Windows 10 premium PCs,” providing a boost for Microsoft’s Xbox Live service for online gaming despite a drop in Xbox console revenue during a typically strong holiday quarter for that business. Both CEOs enjoyed after-hours boosts to their stock prices thanks to holiday PC sales, but they pointed elsewhere for optimism for the future: the cloud. For Microsoft’s part, it is placing more emphasis on Azure, which competes with Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN, -0.40%  Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division, which saw revenue jump 93% year-over-year. The software giant’s cloud-based versions of its Office productivity suite, Office 365, saw revenue grow 49%, while the PC business shrunk 5%. Intel didn’t show that same level of growth from its cloud business, which sells chips to data centers that power remote computing and has recently disappointed investors. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue grew 8%, and Intel’s outlook calls again for “high single digit growth,” but it is worth noting that Intel is in the midst of launching a new server platform called Purley that could boost results later in the year. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multi-billion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas. “Data center got back on track and while it wasn’t double-digit growth, many customers are waiting for the latest Purley server chips to their big upgrades, so I think there’s pent-up demand,” Patrick Moorehead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, said in an email. Intel and Microsoft are fortunate that PC sales rebounded a bit in the fourth quarter to help their results, but the promise of bigger cloud revenues in 2017 need to come true if these companies want to keep pleasing investors. Intel shares were up 1.1% in premarket trade Friday, while Microsoft was up 2%. Intel shares have gained 26% in the last 12 months, while Microsoft has gained 25%.

Thursday (Jan. 26) reported fourth quarter 2016 revenue and profit that beat analysts’ expectations on sales growth in computing, data center chips and Internet of Things (IoT) chips. The company also delivered a forecast for the first quarter that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations and announced it would increase its capital spending outlay for 2017. Despite its surprising success with PC processors in the fourth quarter, Intel also tempered its upbeat first quarter forecast with caution. The company said it has a more cautious view of PC consumption trends than third-party market watchers, especially in emerging markets like Russia, China and Latin America. While Intel said it expects high single digit growth in sales to data centers, it is not expecting a sales uptick in the enterprise server or microprocessor segment Brian Krzanich, Intel’s CEO, said in a conference call with analysts following the company’s quarterly report that Intel has a slightly more pessimistic view for the PC market than many industry observers. He said Intel expects PC unit shipments to decline by a mid-single digit percentage in the first quarter following a strong fourth quarter in which the company enjoyed strong sales for its core i7 microprocessors. Brian Krzanich, Intel “It’s starting to get better,” Krzanich said of the PC market. “But I don’t think we are back into zero unit or positive unit growth.” Some analysts have said the PC market is starting to show signs of stabilizing after five consecutive years of annual declines. Intel has historically relied on the PC market as its primary engine of growth. As the PC market has declined in recent years, Intel has sought to diversify outside of its core business with mixed results. On the earnings call, Krzanich frequently referred to Intel as a company in transition and highlighted growth and opportunities in IoT, networking, autonomous driving and others. Intel (Santa Clara, Calif.) reported sales of $16.4 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. The company reported a net income for the quarter of $3.9 billion, up 4 percent from the same period of 2015. Intel reported year-over-year quarterly sales growth across its Client Computing Group, Data Center, IoT, Non-Volatile Memory and Security groups. Intel’s Client Computing Group, the company’s largest business unit which products for PCs, servers and mobile devices, had sales of $9.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2015. Intel reported record sales of $59.4 billion for 2016, an increase of 7 percent from 2016. The company reported a net income of $10.3 billion based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), down 10% from 2015. For the first quarter of 2017, Intel said it expects sales of between $14.3 billion and $15.3 billion. The company expects 2017 sales to be roughly flat with 2016, and said it expects to allocate between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion for capital spending during the year, up from $9.5 billion last year. —Dylan McGrath covers the semiconductor industry and business news for EE Times.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 27 January 2017 | MYT 8:23 AM Data center growth drives Intel Q4 revenue NEW YORK: Intel Corp reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit driven by a stabilizing PC market and growth in its data center business, which offers cloud-based software services. Revenue from the data center business rose 8.4 percent to $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter, while revenue from its traditional PC business rose 4.3 percent to $9.13 billion. Intel continues to expect a similar growth rate in the cloud segment, but does not expect an improvement in its enterprise unit, the company said on a call with analysts. The PC unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Worldwide PC shipments — which consist of laptops, desktops and workstations — fell by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent decline in the preceding quarter, according to research firm IDC, continuing the recent trend of stabilizing demand. "In the data center group, it seems that cloud is still an area of strength, offsetting the weakness in enterprise," Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said. Cassidy added that at some point in the future, the enterprise clients would upgrade their data centers, leading to further growth in the business. Intel has been building its data center, Internet of Things and automotive businesses, to reduce dependence on the PC market, which has been roiled by users' shift to mobile phones for their computing needs. The Santa Clara, California-based company's net revenue rose 9.8 percent to $16.37 billion, beating the average analysts' estimate of $15.75 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 79 cents per share, beating estimates of 74 cents per share. However, the company said its net income fell to $3.56 billion, or 73 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.61 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2k8Eon7) The company's revenue forecast for the year 2017 was flat, which according to Cassidy, pleased investors as they would rather have conservative estimates for the year, and then have it go up, rather than give aggressive estimates. Intel said it expects first-quarter revenue of $14.8 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Analysts on average were expecting $14.53 billion. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker were little changed in extended trading on Thursday. Up to Thursday's close, Intel's shares had risen 25.5 percent in the last 12 months, falling short of the 60 percent rise in the broader semiconductor index. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News You May Be Interested Abdul Jalil named NSTP’s new CEO Azman’s journey with AMMB Joey Yap: Good time to invest as assets are cheap Bring cheer to the underprivileged this festive season Go purple this CNY if you want to get lucky in love Six simple steps to feng shui your home Others Also Read Ponkan oranges choice of the season Interracial marriage makes Chinese New Year celebration unique for some Contract worker found dead after falling from apartment Property Related advertisement Latest News Shell set to sell US$3b North Sea assets to Chrysaor Resurgent Tesco surprises with US$4.6b swoop for wholesaler Booker US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises Tycoon Slim says Trump not 'Terminator,' sees opportunities for Mexico In double whammy for Turkey, Fitch cuts to junk after S&P slashes outlook Most Viewed in Business Making money from money Joey Yap: Good time to invest as assets are cheap Giving banks a run for their money What Dow hitting 20,000 points means to Malaysia Unlocking value in MMC Shell set to sell US$3b North Sea assets to Chrysaor Azman’s journey with AMMB Resurgent Tesco surprises with US$4.6b swoop for wholesaler Booker How to make smart investment choice US economy slows on wider trade gap; business spending rises advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Intel, the world's largest computer processor-maker and a foundational hardware provider for all of IT, was founded on July 18, 1968. In none of the subsequent 49 years has the chipmaker been more successful businesswise than 2016. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based corporation reported Q4 and full-year 2016 revenue on Jan. 26, and there were new records to be entered into the books. The company reported an all-time-high yearly revenue of $59.4 billion and record quarterly revenue of $16.4 billion, up 10 percent from $14.9 billion a year ago. Profitwise, Intel said it earned $10.3 billion in FY 2016 and $3.6 billion, or 73 cents a share, in the quarter—flat from the year-ago total. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on sales of $15.75 billion, so Intel easily beat the estimate. Intel said revenue from its client computing group rose 4 percent to $9.1 billion, whereas the FactSet analysts had forecast $8.6 billion. 'Terrific Finish to a Transformative Year' "The fourth quarter was a terrific finish to a record-setting and transformative year for Intel. In 2016, we took important steps to accelerate our strategy and refocus our resources while also launching exciting new products, successfully integrating Altera, and investing in growth opportunities," CEO Brian Krzanich said in the report statement. "I’m pleased with our 2016 performance and confident in our future." Full-year 2016 business unit trends were noted by the company as follows: --Client Computing Group revenue of $32.9 billion, up 2 percent from 2015 --Data Center Group revenue of $17.2 billion, up 8 percent from 2015 --Internet of Things Group revenue of $2.6 billion, up 15 percent from 2015 --Non-Volatile Memory Solution Group revenue of $2.6 billion, down 1 percent from 2015 --Intel Security Group revenue of $2.2 billion, up 9 percent from 2015 --Programmable Solutions Group revenue of $1.7 billion Premium PC Sales Lead the Way "Intel had a pretty good quarter. Client-computing revenue has not only flattened but actually saw some slight increases, even though units declined," Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights told eWEEK. "I attribute this to customers embracing more premium PCs driven by commercial upgrades, gaming and VR. "Datacenter got back on track, and while it wasn’t double-digit growth, many customers are waiting for the latest Purley server chips to their big upgrades, so I think there's pent-up demand. Memory hit a home run, driven by 3D NAND. "It was a good end to solid 2016 where I saw Intel making big moves and investments for the next five years."

The White House released a list of nearly 30 business leaders, some of whom met with Trump on Monday, who it says will help advise a new manufacturing initiative on “how to best promote job growth.” The tech-industry names on the list are Musk, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Dell Technologies founder CEO Michael Dell. Is Musk, the clean energy evangelist, really all in with an administration whose leader has dismissed climate change? Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX and a member of the PayPal Mafia, is a popular figure in tech and in business. But he is getting some flack for cooperating with Trump, whose other views and policies are controversial. One Twitter exchange went like this: “dude, what are you doing? You are losing #credibility by the minute. Come back to the #light !,” commented suzieofficial. To which Musk replied: “Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people & it’s getting me down. I’m just trying to make a positive contribution & hope good comes of it.” That’s on top of what happened earlier this week, when Musk got blowback for his tweeted support of Donald Trump’s nomination of Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. Musk defended himself by saying that Tillerson, a longtime Exxon executive, is competent, has admitted that climate change is real, and has voiced support for a carbon tax — which is something that Musk has championed. Before the presidential election in November, Musk had said he didn’t think Trump would be right for the job. But in December, he was named to the newly elected president’s business advisory team, representing Silicon Valley along with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Musk getting on board with Trump may be a bit unexpected, but the two have interests that align. Tesla (along with SolarCity) and SpaceX need government incentives and contracts; Trump can hold up Musk’s businesses as examples of U.S. job creation. Palo Alto-based Tesla has 30,000 workers, 25,000 of whom are in the United States. A Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded Tesla stock last week based on what he sees as Musk’s blossoming relationship with the Trump administration. “To the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that,” the analyst, Adam Jonas, told the New York Times. As for Intel, a spokesman sent SiliconBeat the following statement: “As the world’s largest semiconductor company and a leading American high-technology manufacturer and exporter, we are pleased to participate in the Initiative and help shape policies to ensure that America leads in the advanced and knowledge-intensive manufacturing industries of the future.” Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

A few dozen members of the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) who gathered at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters to celebrate Data Privacy Day on Thursday were guardedly optimistic, perhaps foolishly so. They were meeting less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could threaten the existence of the EU-US data privacy shield, and many were aware of a new survey this week that suggests most Americans have directly experienced some form of data theft or fraud. But the NCSA is a rare breed: an amicable partnership between the federal government and Silicon Valley, funded not only by the Department of Homeland of Security, but also by companies like Twitter, Intel, and Cisco, whose executives all seemed to agree that even though the Internet faces severe threats from hackers and thieves, its users are increasingly positioned to take their online safety and privacy into their own hands. Take the automobile industry, for instance. Every car built today captures data about its performance and the habits of its driver, and its systems are increasingly connected to the Internet, whether it's a Tesla Model S sending data back to Elon Musk's crack team of engineers or a Honda Fit queuing up a Spotify playlist. For Tony Aquila, CEO of automotive data company Solera, this combination of infotainment and diagnostics is at once fraught with risks and full of potential. On the one hand, a car can self-diagnose its problems, but on the other hand, it also knows a ton about you, the driver. "You should be responsible enough to know you've got to wipe your car when you sell it," Aquila said at the NCSA event. He envisions a future where drivers will carry around their own on-board diagnostic (OBD) device, which will set up every car they drive to their exact specifications, but also extract all their personally identifiable information when they unplug it. "I can do everything through the ODB port," he said. "In the future you'll carry an ODB device that will know your driving preferences, your seat position, even how to tune the car." Whether or not such a device will ever exist is an open question, of course, since the automotive industry doesn't enjoy the breakneck pace of innovation that sustains most of Silicon Valley. But similar devices for non-automotive privacy protection are already on the market—keys that can encrypt and store consumers' website login information, for example. The problem is that they're still largely niche products. Much of the blame for that, according to Mozilla's Chief Legal Officer Denelle Dixon, lies not with ignorant consumers, but with the companies. "Our job as technology companies is that we need to make it easy for people, and I don't know that we've done our part," Dixon said on Thursday. "The more we innovate on privacy issues, the better it is from the standpoint of users' trust." It is Dixon's job to be a privacy evangelist, of course, and the Mozilla engineering and product teams who are racing to stem the flow of Firefox users to Google Chrome may have other things on their minds besides privacy innovations. Still, her mea culpa and pledge to do better are refreshing, especially since they are echoed by counterparts at other companies like networking giant Cisco. "We need to notice when information is used, shared, and deleted, and build in some controls of when, how and by whom it's done," Cisco's Chief Privacy Officer Michelle Dennedy said. After all, tech companies already see their own intellectual property threatened by leaks and hacks, so why can't they view their users' data the same way? In the US, "it is a given that stealing other people's intellectual property is wrong," she said, "but when you go to China, you see that Corn Flakes is no longer a General Mills product." Related The Trump Administration's Cyber Hubris The Trump Administration's Cyber Hubris As it does among many Americans these days, talk of China, privacy, and hacking invariably leads to discussion and speculation about the Trump administration. There was no sign on Thursday of anyone from the Department of Homeland Security, which provides about half of the NCSA's budget. Nor was there much admiration for the nation's 45th president, who this week signed an executive order to "exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information." There was, however, a sense of optimism among the mostly female crowd, perhaps encouraged by the massive women's rights marches that took place after Trump's inauguration last week. Women currently outnumber men as chief privacy officers of American tech companies, according to the Association of Privacy Professionals—one of the only realms in Silicon Valley where that's the case. And many NCSA members want to keep it that way. "We're living more of our lives on line, and with girls and children growing up now, I think privacy is a life skill," said Laura Pirri, Twitter's legal director for privacy. "In acquiring that life skill you'll figure out if it's a passion for your career as well."

Business & Technology Business Insider Gizmodo Kotaku Lifehacker Lifestyle & Shopping POPSUGAR Celebrity POPSUGAR Fashion POPSUGAR Beauty POPSUGAR Health & Fitness ShopStyle Toggle navigation Join Log In Tech Insider Money & Markets Briefing Ideas Executive Life Video Tech Insider Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phones could make the future of headphones messier Jeff Dunn Jan 28, 2017, 4:29 AM facebook twitter reddit linkedin Email After a slew of leaks this week, it appears as if we know just about everything there is to know about Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S8 phones. Citing “several well-placed sources,” The Guardian dropped a batch of details on Tuesday. That was largely corroborated by VentureBeat’s Evan Blass on Thursday. Blass, who has a long history of accurately leaking phones, also included the first purported photos of the new devices. They show two phones with curved screens, thin chassis, fingerprint scanners on the back — and, lo and behold, 3.5mm headphone jacks. That last bit is significant. For the past several months, the common wisdom in the tech world has been that the traditional headphone jack is living on borrowed time. Apple famously ditched it with the iPhone 7 in an effort push people toward wireless pairs. The move upset a lot of people, and it hasn’t magically fixed Bluetooth’s issues, but Apple devices live in their own world. If the break had to happen, at least it was relatively clean. If you’re a headphone manufacturer, you can make wireless cans or Lightning cans, and you know you’ll have all iPhone users covered from now on. With Android, though, the situation is sloppier. Intel and others have been pushing USB-C, the do-everything port that’s replacing all older USB ports on more and more devices, as the 3.5mm jack’s replacement for the past several months. USB-C is a digital connection, so it could bring the same enhancements as Lightning, but it’s also an open standard, so nobody has to pay Apple a cut to use it. Over the past few months, the likes of Motorola, LeEco, and HTC have jumped on the bandwagon. Flickr/Răzvan BăltărețuThe Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Being open, though, means a higher chance of fragmentation. And if the flagship phones from the world’s most popular smartphone maker are sticking with the 3.5mm jack, that’s going to stunt USB-C’s chances of being a replacement for a little while longer. While the Galaxy S series doesn’t outsell the iPhone on its own — Samsung’s market share is high because it sells many phones at many price points — it’s still Android’s biggest high-end device. Without it, and with the bulk of Android’s affordable phones keeping the jack as well, there’s simply less incentive for headphone companies to make USB-C pairs. Motorola and HTC aren’t setting the world on fire sales-wise. Yes, the Galaxy S8 is expected to have a USB-C port for charging, so it could still technically support USB-C headphones. But if the headphone jack is still there, it’s hard to see people choosing something that’s generally pricier and makes it so you can’t charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. Hollis JohnsonThe LeEco LePro 3 is one of a handful of Android phones that have ditched the headphone jack entirely. Ultimately, if Samsung sticks with the jack, it will probably be a good thing. Nobody enjoys using a dongle. And again, to truly hear the benefits of a USB-C connection, you’ll likely need to pay a bit more than you would for a simple, good-enough analogue pair. The move would also give Samsung a very easy selling point in its ongoing war with the iPhone. On a higher level, the headphone world is still moving toward wireless pairs and so-called “hearables.” The Galaxy S8 keeping the jack may not expedite that process, but it won’t stop it. And by 2018, it may ditch the jack regardless. But for now, giving people the option to adapt USB-C without banning the alternative is a friendly move. Just don’t expect to see many more headphone makers go all-in on USB-C because of it.

The major averages spent much of the day lingering near the unchanged line. The major averages eventually closed mixed. While the Nasdaq inched up 5.61 points or 0.1 percent to a new record closing high of 5,660.68, the Dow edged down 7.13 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 20,093.78 and the S&P 500 dipped 1.99 points or 0.1 percent to 2,294.69. Despite the roughly sideways movement over the past two days, the major averages moved notably higher for the week. The Nasdaq surged up by 1.9 percent, the Dow jumped by 1.3 percent and the S&P 500 advanced by 1 percent. The choppy trading on Wall Street came as traders remained reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets following recent strength. Traders were also digesting the mixed batch of earnings news released by several big-name technology companies after the close of trading on Thursday. While Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported better than expected quarterly results. In economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016. The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent. Economists noted that the slowdown was largely due to the impact of fluctuations in trade and said the third and fourth quarters together indicate a strong second half. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed durable goods orders unexpectedly declined in December amid a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment. The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in December after tumbling by a revised 4.8 percent in November. Economists had expected durable goods orders to jump by 2.6 percent. However, excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in December after jumping by 1.0 percent in November. The increase matched estimates. The University of Michigan also released a report showing that consumer sentiment unexpectedly improved to its highest level in thirteen years in January. Sector News After moving notably higher over the past few sessions, airline stocks gave back ground on the day. Reflecting the weakness in the sector, the NYSE Arca Airline Index tumbled by 2.1 percent. American Airlines (AAL) posted a notable loss after reporting fourth quarter earnings that fell year-over-year but matched analyst estimates. The airline also announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. Considerable weakness was also visible among energy stocks, which came as pressure as the price of crude oil for March delivery fell $0.61 to $53.17 a barrel. On the other hand, software and semiconductor stocks saw significant strength on the heels of the upbeat earnings news from Microsoft and Intel. Biotechnology stocks also showed a strong move to the upside, resulting in a 1.3 percent advance by the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The Chinese markets were closed on the day. Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index increased by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index dipped by 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.6 percent. In the bond market, treasuries saw further upside after turning higher over the course of the previous session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.7 basis points to 2.481 percent. Looking Ahead The Federal Reserve is likely to be back in the spotlight next week, with the central bank due to announce its latest monetary policy decision on Wednesday. While the Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, traders are likely to pay close attention to the accompanying statement. The monthly jobs report is also likely to be in focus next week along with reports on personal income and spending, manufacturing and service sector activity, and labor productivity. On the earnings front, ExxonMobil (XOM), MasterCard (MA), Pfizer (PFE), UPS (UPS), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), and Visa (V) are among a slew of companies due to report their quarterly results next week. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February Next Story More Commentary -Global Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower On Bank Weakness Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Turn In Another Lackluster Performance - U.S. Commentary Wall Street May Open Broadly Higher Sensex, Nifty Extend Gains For Fourth Day European Shares Drift Lower Amid Mixed Earnings Reports Asian Shares Mostly Higher In Thin Holiday Trade European Stocks Set To Open Mixed Amid Lack Of Triggers Sensex Up 170 Points In Early Trade; Nifty At 8649 Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Mixed Global Cues Thai Market Likely To See Resistance At 1600 Little Movement Expected For Indonesia Shares Hong Kong Market Due For Profit Taking <<Previous        46 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

Mr. Pruitt has the right experience for the job and will make an excellent administrator of the EPA.” ADVERTISEMENT Pruitt is likely to pass the committee vote along party lines.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Elon Musk gets on another Trump team, admits reaction getting him ‘down’ By Levi Sumagaysay / January 27, 2017 at 10:38 AM Elon Musk, who is one of only a few tech executives on Donald Trump’s business advisory team, is also now part of a manufacturing jobs initiative announced Friday by the White House. The White House released a list of nearly 30 business leaders, some of whom met with Trump on Monday, who it says will help advise a new manufacturing initiative on “how to best promote job growth.” The tech-industry names on the list are Musk, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Dell Technologies founder CEO Michael Dell. Is Musk, the clean energy evangelist, really all in with an administration whose leader has dismissed climate change? Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX and a member of the PayPal Mafia, is a popular figure in tech and in business. But he is getting some flack for cooperating with Trump, whose other views and policies are controversial. Here’s a Twitter exchange Friday morning. @suzie_official Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people & it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution & hope good comes of it. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 27, 2017 That’s on top of what happened earlier this week, when Musk got blowback for his tweeted support of Donald Trump’s nomination of Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. As we wrote, Musk defended himself by saying that Tillerson, a longtime Exxon executive, is competent, has admitted that climate change is real, and has voiced support for a carbon tax — which is something that Musk has championed. Before the presidential election in November, Musk had said he didn’t think Trump would be right for the job. But in December, he was named to the newly elected president’s business advisory team, representing Silicon Valley along with Uber CEO Travis Kalanick. Musk getting on board with Trump may be a bit unexpected, but the two have interests that align. Tesla (along with SolarCity) and SpaceX need government incentives and contracts; Trump can hold up Musk’s businesses as examples of U.S. job creation. Palo Alto-based Tesla has 30,000 workers, 25,000 of whom are in the United States. A Morgan Stanley analyst upgraded Tesla stock last week based on what he sees as Musk’s blossoming relationship with the Trump administration. “To the extent the new administration prioritizes the creation of valuable, innovative high tech and manufacturing jobs, Tesla stands at the epicenter of that,” the analyst, Adam Jonas, told the New York Times. As for Intel, a spokesman sent SiliconBeat the following statement: “As the world’s largest semiconductor company and a leading American high-technology manufacturer and exporter, we are pleased to participate in the Initiative and help shape policies to ensure that America leads in the advanced and knowledge-intensive manufacturing industries of the future.” Tesla has not yet responded to a request for comment.   Photo: Tesla CEO Elon Musk listens as President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with technology industry leaders at Trump Tower in New York on Dec. 14, 2016.

Chris What values have been destroyed? How has this changed him? How would rejecting Trump help anyone? aar_nr didn’t DESTROY anything. THE best thing, and sadly they fail to see it yet, is that the Left needs to approach Trump like an adult who makes the damn rules. Speak to him in his language (prestige, jobs, and money), and then sell their vision for the nation. Green Jobs, Electric Cars, and Rooftop Solar. its significantly better than helping Canada ship its tar sands through a pipe to the international oil ports in the Gulf of Mexico, where its then sold across the oceans. Green energy, tech, and infrastructure are an American win-win. Jobs, Economy, Energy Independence Jones Greed? He’s one of the few exec’s using his fortune to at least try to improve the world, dufus. Anthony C Haven’t heard much about a backlash against him, I think most people still see him as a force for change. Hopefully it’s not a tea party of the left starting up that thinks no compromises and not even associating with the other side of an issue are the best way to get what you want. Chris Exactly. What do they think rejecting President Trump entirely will do? How will it benefit anyone? aar_nr Musk playing his hands like a Master. You accept all opportunities as presented, PARTICULARLY when they include the office of the White House Carbonicus Musk is a govt rent-seeker, his entire path to profitability depends on rent seeking (tax incentives and ZEV credits, etc.), and rent-seekers don’t change their stripes just because the political party of the resident of 1600 Penn Ave. changes. Chris His entire path is not dependent on rent seeking. Try educating yourself. Where were the subsidies for PayPal? Where are the subsidies for SpaceX? Lots of large companies receive government incentives. Check out the list in this article: https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/03/17/the-united-states-of-subsidies-the-biggest-corporate-winners-in-each-state/?utm_term=.76200cbd5305 aar_nr awww did the poor baby Tesla short get roasted? Raffi256 Tesla’s competitors gain more from incentives and CARB credits than Tesla does. If they all went to 0, Tesla would be ahead vs their competition. It’s not what they gain absolutely that matters, its what’s relative to the competition that you have to look for. JLawsButtHole Musk is the rational ointment in the jar of flies. BirdEye_view I guess Ellon Musk is probably against CalExit. The Cleaner Your an idiot moreally than 2 million illegals voted there dumb mf Bulldozer Musk’s work has longer term implications than Trump’s 4 year term. Jesse Smelser Trump will probably be in for 8 years and then he will likely create the largest family legacy in US Presidential history with his daughter, sons, and son-in-law all becoming President. Phil Remember the TV series ‘Dynasty’? I am already looking forward to it… the TV series about the Trumps. Could be a reality show… Hm, it already is, in a twisted ‘alternative facts’ sort of way. Doreen Gaydoon Musk will publicly support every cabinet member and every bit of legislation trump advocates. Musk is way past bankruptcy. All he has to do is cross trump once and he is dead. Alec Sevins Maybe Trump will convince Musk (and others) that landscape & bird/bat killing wind turbines are not green. That appears to be one of Trump’s few bright spots on the environment. In general, all he cares about is money and doesn’t grasp nature’s role in our very existence. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/99e166ce9014be447ed69fc119a97a3ae40d11784918d8a7d0c0037f6dda821b.jpg Jesse Smelser Yep, we should replace all the wind turbines with coal plants.     About SiliconBeat Sign up for the Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter GMSV     Tweets from @siliconbeat/siliconbeat   Popular Posts Elon Musk gets on another Trump team, admits reaction… Google cozies up to Republicans in bid to shed left-loving… PayPal threatened by dangerous competition amid currency… Top 10 hottest real estate markets: San Francisco, San… Tesla sues ex-Autopilot director and former head of…     Archives Archives Select Month January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005   Related Feeds 60-Second Business Break Green Energy News Opinion Personal Tech Venture Capital                       Education WordPress Theme by Copyright © 2017 Bay Area News Group.

 Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phones could make the future of headphones messier Jeff Dunn Jan. 27, 2017, 12:29 PM 23,703 facebook linkedin twitter email print After a slew of leaks this week, it appears as if we know just about everything there is to know about Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S8 phones. Citing "several well-placed sources," The Guardian dropped a batch of details on Tuesday. That was largely corroborated by VentureBeat's Evan Blass on Thursday. Blass, who has a long history of accurately leaking information about phones, also included the first purported photos of the new devices. They show two phones with curved screens, thin chassis, fingerprint scanners on the back — and, lo and behold, 3.5 mm headphone jacks. This is the Samsung Galaxy S8, launching March 29 https://t.co/lQZ0K0q2MA pic.twitter.com/dlusRMX4YH — Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 26, 2017 That last bit is significant. For the past several months, the common wisdom in the tech world has been that the traditional headphone jack is living on borrowed time. Apple famously ditched it with the iPhone 7 in an effort push people toward wireless pairs. The move upset a lot of people, and it hasn't magically fixed Bluetooth's issues, but Apple devices live in their own world. If the break had to happen, at least it was relatively clean. If you're a headphone manufacturer, you can make wireless cans or Lightning cans and know you'll have all iPhone users covered from now on. With Android, though, the situation is sloppier. Intel and others have for the past several months been pushing USB-C, the do-everything port that's replacing older USB ports on more and more devices, as the 3.5 mm jack's replacement for the past several months. USB-C is a digital connection, so it could bring the same enhancements as Lightning, but it's also an open standard, so nobody has to pay Apple a cut to use it. Over the past few months, the likes of Motorola, LeEco, and HTC have jumped on the bandwagon. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Flickr/Răzvan Băltărețu Being open, though, means a higher chance of fragmentation. And if the flagship phones from the world's most popular smartphone-maker are sticking with the 3.5 mm jack, that's going to stunt USB-C's chances of being a replacement for a little while longer. While the Galaxy S series on its own doesn't outsell the iPhone — Samsung's market share is high because it sells many phones at many price points — it's still Android's biggest high-end device. Without it onboard, and with the bulk of Android's affordable phones keeping the jack as well, there's simply less incentive for headphone companies to make USB-C pairs. Motorola and HTC aren't setting the world on fire saleswise. Yes, the Galaxy S8 is expected to have a USB-C port for charging, so it could still technically support USB-C headphones. But if the headphone jack is still there, it's hard to see people choosing something that's generally pricier and doesn't allow you to charge your phone and listen to music at the same time. The LeEco LePro 3 is one of a handful of Android phones that have ditched the headphone jack entirely. Hollis Johnson Ultimately, if Samsung sticks with the jack, it'll probably be a good thing. Nobody enjoys using a dongle. And again, to truly hear the benefits of a USB-C connection, you'll likely need to pay a bit more than you would for a simple, good-enough analog pair. The move would also give Samsung a very easy selling point in its ongoing war with the iPhone, for whatever that's worth. On a higher level, the headphone world is still moving toward wireless pairs and so-called hearables. The Galaxy S8 keeping the jack may not expedite that process, but it won't stop it. And by 2018, it may ditch the jack regardless. But for now, giving people the option to adapt USB-C without banning the alternative is a friendly move. Just don't expect to see many more headphone makers go all-in on USB-C because of it.

The major averages have spent much of the day lingering near the unchanged line. Currently, the major averages are posting modest losses on the day. The Dow is down 13.68 points or 0.1 percent at 20,087.23, the Nasdaq is down 4.59 points or 0.1 percent at 5,650.58 and the S&P 500 is down 3.35 points or 0.2 percent at 2,293.33. Wall Street continues to experience choppy trading as traders remain reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets following recent strength. The Dow ended the previous session at a new record closing high, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 remained close to the record highs set on Wednesday. The markets are also digesting the mixed batch of earnings news released by several big-name technology companies after the close of trading on Thursday. While Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported better than expected quarterly results. In economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016. The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent. Economists noted that the slowdown was largely due to the impact of fluctuations in trade and said the third and fourth quarters together indicate a strong second half. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed durable goods orders unexpectedly declined in December amid a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment. The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in December after tumbling by a revised 4.8 percent in November. Economists had expected durable goods orders to jump by 2.6 percent. However, excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in December after jumping by 1.0 percent in November. The increase matched estimates. The University of Michigan also released a report showing that consumer sentiment unexpectedly improved to its highest level in thirteen years in January. Sector News Oil service stocks have come under pressure on the day, extending the pullback seen in the previous session. Reflecting the weakness in the sector, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index has fallen by 1.7 percent. The weakness among oil service stocks comes amid a steep drop by the price of crude oil, with crude for March delivery slumping $1.04 to $52.74 a barrel. Significant weakness also remains visible among airline stocks, as reflected by the 1.6 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Airline Index. The index is giving back ground after moving notably higher over the three previous sessions. American Airlines (AAL) is posting a notable loss after reporting fourth quarter earnings that fell year-over-year but matched analyst estimates. The airline also announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. On the other hand, gold stocks have shown a strong move to the upside, driving the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index up by 1.1 percent. The strength in the sector comes despite a drop by the price of gold. Software and semiconductor stocks are also seeing some strength on the day following the upbeat earnings news from Microsoft and Intel. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The Chinese markets were closed on the day. Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index increased by 0.3 percent, the German DAX Index dipped by 0.3 percent and the French CAC 40 Index fell by 0.6 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are seeing modest strength but have pulled back off their best levels. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.3 basis points at 2.495 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower On Bank Weakness Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Turn In Another Lackluster Performance - U.S. Commentary Wall Street May Open Broadly Higher Sensex, Nifty Extend Gains For Fourth Day European Shares Drift Lower Amid Mixed Earnings Reports Asian Shares Mostly Higher In Thin Holiday Trade European Stocks Set To Open Mixed Amid Lack Of Triggers Sensex Up 170 Points In Early Trade; Nifty At 8649 Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Mixed Global Cues Thai Market Likely To See Resistance At 1600 Little Movement Expected For Indonesia Shares Hong Kong Market Due For Profit Taking <<Previous        46 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

The workstation offers an immersive way to create on the thinnest LCD monitor ever built. The Surface Studio works with pen, touch and Surface Dial- a new input device that lets you use two hands on the screen to compose and create in all new ways. Portable and Powerful Upgraded Surface Book Pro One of the most-anticipated product showcase at the event was new Surface Book Pro. Microsoft showcased three new Surface Book models that feature 6th Generation Intel CoreTM i7 processors and pack more than twice the graphics processing power as the original Surface Book. The new Surface Book claims to have 16 hours of battery life and offers the same sleek design As far as pricing goes, the new model is priced at $2399 (approximately Rs. 1,60,345) and will be available for preorders in the US now. There is no word about global availability of the product.

The free update will roll out in Spring 2017 and will enable Windows 10 users to create, share and experience in 3-D and mixed reality and will empower every gamer to be a broadcaster. The Creators Update will also make Microsoft Edge the first browser to fully embrace 3-D. Surface Dial- a new tool way to interact with Displays One of the most unique product that Microsoft showcased was- Surface Dial. It is a new peripheral designed for the creative process. The device works with Windows 10 and offers a more intuitive way to scroll, zoom and navigate. It brings a set of digital tools specific to the app open on Surface Studio, for example, Surface Dial allows artists to change the color or the size of their brush tip as they paint without ever moving the pen away from the screen. Windows 10 VR headset Last but not least, Microsoft has also unveiled the next generation Virtual Reality headset. The new headset will include inside-out tracking sensors, obviating the need for external cameras or laser systems like those on the current Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. This is once again a next step in Virtual reality technology. The new range of software and hardware products shown above, is Microsoft's bold attempt to change the way we interact with touch screen devices. In the words of Microsoft, the combination of Surface Dial, pen and touch creates a more immersive and tactile way for people to create in digital environments. Now all eyes are on Apple's upcoming MacBook, which is expected to launch soon and will be the right competitor for Microsoft's innovative products.

(AMAT) Stock: The Big and Small Of It This semiconductor equipment maker is off to the races. By Louis Navellier, Editor, Blue Chip Growth  |  Jan 27, 2017, 10:23 am EST     Popular Posts: 7 Straight-A Stocks to Build Your Portfolio Around 4 Top Stocks to Buy Under the Trump Administration 7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right Away Recent Posts: 7 Awful Stocks You Need To Ditch Right Away Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT) Stock: The Big and Small Of It Here’s Why Vantiv Inc (VNTV) Stock Could Skyrocket Next Week View All Posts Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is the world’s leading semiconductor equipment maker. That means it’s the biggest company making equipment to manufacture ever smaller, faster and more reliable chip sets. Source: Mattia Accornero via Flickr It sells the chipmaking equipment that keeps companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE:TSM), Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) going. This business tends to be a feast-or-famine type affair, with a lot of range between those two positions. When chip sales are soft or there is a glut in the market, Applied Materials’ business dries up and its growth story — as well as the stock’s momentum — go right out the window. Good Times for AMAT Stock However, when demand is high, like it is right now, AMAT stock is a powerhouse. Demand is coming in from all sides as the computer industry is starting to flow out into all aspects of devices, even clothing. The Internet of Things means that our houses, cars and watches are becoming not smart, but interconnected. The new wave in virtual reality and augmented reality is creating even more demand for better visual computing. Throw in the expanding cloud computing demand and Big Data growth, and you have yourselves a strong upside argument for AMAT stock for at least the next couple years. One of the best aspects of Applied Materials is the fact that it is not dependent on any one sector of the semiconductor market. It provides products to firms that specialize in all manner of chip sets. This diverse base is also helpful when the sector growth slackens. But that’s not an issue now. Now, it’s about how much can AMAT stock grow. And the answer to that for 2017 is, plenty. In its Q4 filing in late November, earnings were up 39% year over year and AMAT raised guidance for Q1 2017. Part of its earnings bump was a $1.9 billion in share buybacks that happened during the fiscal year, but there was relatively little of that in Q4. Q4 also saw new orders rise 25% – 23% for the year — backlog was up 46% and net sales were up 39%. And Applied Materials also guided higher for Q1, which it will report on Feb. 15. The simple reality beyond the impressive numbers is, AMAT stock is in a significant growth cycle now. As long as the global economy continues to chug along, it is going to do very well. It’s up over 100% in the past 12 months, but it has yet to really hit its stride. It also has a 1.1% dividend, to reinforce that the management is shareholder friendly. IT research firm Gartner notes that while 2016 was a slow year for semiconductor growth, 2017 is expected to see a 7.4% increase in demand, and a chip undersupply through 2018. That is music to AMAT’s bottom — and top — line. Louis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.

How an all-in-one computer looks and feels is almost as important as its raw specs and the quality of the screen. After all, these types of computer sit out on display, so they need to look as good as they perform. It's good to see PC manufacturers acknowledge this, with a spate of good-looking all-in-one computers hitting the market. The latest is the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 910, which combines an attractive case and speedy components with a smart stand that lets you lay the screen parallel with your desk, making the touchscreen easier to use. Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 910 – Design and Build Lenovo continues its impressive run with another great-looking all-in-one. The case is of a metal-effect plastic, but the quality is high, and you'll be hard-pushed to distinguish the finish from true metal using sight alone. Rather than building the components into the main unit, Lenovo has fitted them into a stylish base. It means that the screen is impressively slim and the ports easy to reach; you don't have to spin the entire computer around to get to them, as you do with an iMac. The minor downside is that the PC takes up a little more space on your desk, measuring 238 x 616 x 490mm At the rear of the computer you'll find the power connection, Gigabit Ethernet (802.11ac Wi-Fi is also available), 3.5mm headset jack, and a single USB 3.0 port. This USB port is taken up by the wireless keyboard and mouse's dongle. This is frustrating; I'd have preferred Lenovo to have used a Bluetooth set instead. On the side of the case are an HDMI input, three USB 3.0 ports and a card reader. Although Lenovo's website states that this is an SD card reader, it isn't: the small slot is for microSD cards only. Digital camera owners will be disappointed; a full-size SD card slot would have been better. It's the smart stand that will really grab your attention, since it lets you move the screen from an angle of -5 to 90 degrees. It's rare to find an all-in-one with this level of adjustment, making it easy to line up the 910 comfortably, whether you're using it normally or just with the touchscreen. Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 910 – Keyboard and Mouse Lenovo has bundled its standard wireless keyboard and mouse, first seen with the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 510S. The keyboard remains one of the best bundled models I've used. While the keys are a little softer than on the best of Lenovo's laptop models, they're responsive and offer decent travel. Its half-width Return key is a little annoying, and I'd often hit PgUp by mistake. Still, once I got used to the keyboard, I found that I could type quickly and accurately. I don't like the mouse very much, since its high arch isn't comfortable to hold. To compensate, I ended up holding the mouse further down the body, which made reaching the slightly unresponsive buttons hard. Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 910 – Screen and Speakers The glossy display is the highlight of the computer. This 27-inch, Ultra HD screen (3,840 x 2,160 pixels) has plenty of room for displaying multiple applications at once. Image quality is superb, too. I measured the screen as able to produce 99.4% of the sRGB colour gamut. A black point of 0.295 nits gives you dark blacks, but 265 nits brightness is touch on the dim side. This results in a contrast ratio of 909:1, which is a touch low. In real-world terms, what you see on-screen is accurate, but you lose a little punch and vibrancy. With the HDMI input, you can even plug in other devices. I was told by Lenovo that HDMI 2.0 (HDCP 2.2) is used, but plugging in a Sky Q box running at Ultra HD didn't work; plugging in a regular Full HD Blu-ray player worked properly, however. It's a minor shame that 4K devices didn't work with the display, although this probably isn't a huge issue for a lot of people. Lenovo has fitted a full touchscreen display. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of them in an all-in-one, since it's a pain having to reach across the desk. With the 910's smart stand, however, it's easier to get the screen closer, making the touchscreen handy for swiping through photos and the like. Lenovo's Dolby Home Theatre-tuned speakers are excellent. Loud and powerful in both music and films, the 910 can provide room-filling audio. Bass is a little lacking, but that's a minor complaint; ultimately, I'd see very little need to hook up a pair of external speakers to this computer. Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 910 – Webcam and Microphone An Intel RealSense 3D camera is mounted into the top of the 910's screen. It works in a similar way to the Xbox Kinect, allowing you to control compatible apps using gestures. It's more of a gimmick, and the range of supported apps isn't particularly good. There is one useful feature, however: it supports Windows Hello, enabling you to unlock your computer with your face. If you want to make video calls then the webcam shoots pretty good video, while the integrated microphone picked up my voice clearly. Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 910 – Performance Lenovo has used a quad-core Intel Core i5-6500T processor. It has a base clock of 2.2GHz and a Turbo frequency of 2.8GHz. The "T" designates this as a low-power chip, which has a thermal design power (TDP) of just 35W. As a comparison, the regular Core i5-6400, found in larger desktops, has a TDP of 65W, a base clock of 2.7GHz and Turbo frequency of 3.3GHz. Combined with 16GB of RAM, the Lenovo Ideacentre 910 managed a Geekbench Multi-core score of 7,940 and a PCMark 8 Home score of 2,879. This processor makes this all-in-one slightly faster than similar computers that use ultra-low-power CPUs; but, it's around 28% slower than PCs with a full Core i5-6400 CPU. General day-to-day tasks and photo editing are easy on this computer, but if you want a more powerful workhorse – for video 4K editing, for example – you probably want to look elsewhere. Lenovo has used an Nvidia GeForce 950A discrete graphics chip fitted with 2GB of GDDR5 memory. It's largely the same as the more common 950M chip found in laptops, featuring a 915MHz clock speed and 640 CUDA cores. While it can't handle games at the screen's full 4K resolution, Full HD gaming is more than possible. Dirt Rally managed an average frame rate of 28.64fps running at Ultra detail, but dropping detail down to Medium upped the frame rate to a smoother 53.5fps. Shadow of Mordor ran at a smooth 34fps, while GTA V ran at 42.2fps. That's good news if you want an all-in-one that can handle games as well as work. Lenovo has fitted a 128GB SSD and 1TB mechanical hard disk. The SSD is best used for Windows and general applications, but I recommend using the 1TB hard disk for games and file storage. Although the SSD isn't one of the fastest I've seen (I measured read speeds of 512.8MB/sec and write speeds of 158.1MB/sec), it's faster than a mechanical hard disk and makes Windows 10 feel responsive. Cooling isn't too intrusive, but even when idle, the Ideacentre AIO 910 makes a low-level hum from its constantly spinning fans. I'd prefer a silent computer when idle, but without ultra low-power components, this would have been a long shot with the AIO 910. Note that the model on review here is one of the higher-end Ideacentre AIO 910s (F0C2000TUK), which has a 4K touchscreen and a quad-core Core i5 processor. The same spec is available with a Core i7 processor, too. A cheaper, Full HD non-touchscreen model is an option, too, featuring a choice of Core i5 and Core i7 processors, and graphics options vary by region and retailer, with some getting Nvidia 940M instead of 950A GPUs. The model on test here is most closely matched by this specification sold on Amazon at the time of writing. Should I buy the Lenovo Ideacentre AIO 910? It's hard to find an all-in-one that can do everything, but the Lenovo IdeaCcentre AIO 910 fits the bill. It's excellent 4K display, smart stand and dedicated graphics all make it a desirable and practical choice. A low-power processor, noise when idle, and slightly slow SSD detract a little – but the AIO 910 will prove fast enough for most people's needs.

Apple has been involved and collaborating with the Partnership on AI since before it was first announced last year and is “thrilled” to formalize its membership, the organization said Friday. According to Bloomberg, joining the non-profit is the latest sign that Apple is opening up more and becoming less secretive when it comes to artificial intelligence. Partnership on AI also announced the inaugural Board of Trustees: Dario Amodei (OpenAI) Subbarao Kambhampati (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence & ASU) Deirdre Mulligan (UC Berkeley) Carol Rose (American Civil Liberties Union) Eric Sears (MacArthur Foundation) Jason Furman (Peterson Institute of International Economics) Greg Corrado (Google/DeepMind) Tom Gruber (Apple) Ralf Herbrich (Amazon) Eric Horvitz (Microsoft) Yann Lecun (Facebook) Francesca Rossi (IBM) All Board members will share equal voting rights. The first meeting of the Board of Trustees is taking place on Friday, February 3 in San Francisco. Companies like Twitter, Intel and China’s Baidu are yet to become members. Established last September, Partnership on AI says it aims to “conduct research, recommend best AI practices and publish research under an open license.” In December 2016, Apple published its first research paper covering a technique for improving the training of an algorithm’s ability to recognize objects on images using computer-generated images. The move followed Apple’s decision to permit its artificial intelligence and machine learning researchers to cover with colleagues and publicize some of their work and breakthroughs, something it frowned upon in the past. Industry watchers long insisted that Apple’s secretive culture was preventing its researchers from sharing their findings with other machine learning and artificial intelligence experts while hampering its ability to advance Siri and recruit the brightest minds in the field.

The major averages are once again showing only modest moves on the day. Currently, the major averages are just below the unchanged line. The Dow is down 6.58 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 20,094.33, the Nasdaq is down 0.33 points or less than a tenth of a percent at 5,654.84 and the S&P 500 is down 1.92 points or 0.1 percent at 2,294.76. The continued lack of direction on Wall Street comes as traders remain reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets following recent strength. The Dow ended the previous session at a new record closing high, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 remained close to the record highs set on Wednesday. The markets are also digesting the mixed batch of earnings news released by several big-name technology companies after the close of trading on Thursday. While Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported better than expected quarterly results. In economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016. The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent. However, economists noted that the slowdown was largely due to the impact of fluctuations in trade and said the third and fourth quarters together indicate a strong second half. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed durable goods orders unexpectedly declined in December amid a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment. The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in December after tumbling by a revised 4.8 percent in November. Economists had expected durable goods orders to jump by 2.6 percent. However, excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in December after jumping by 1.0 percent in November. The increase matched estimates. The University of Michigan also released a report showing that consumer sentiment unexpectedly improved to its highest level in thirteen years in January. After moving notably higher in the previous session, airline stocks are giving back some ground in morning trading. The NYSE Arca Airline Index is down by 1.4 percent after climbing by 1.3 percent on Thursday. American Airlines (AAL) is posting a notable loss after reporting fourth quarter earnings that fell year-over-year but matched analyst estimates. The airline also announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. Railroad and oil service stocks are also seeing notable weakness, while some strength is visible among software and semiconductor stocks. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The Chinese markets were closed on the day. Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.2 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.2 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.4 percent. In the bond market, treasuries are seeing further upside after turning higher over the course of the previous session. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 2.2 basis points at 2.486 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower On Bank Weakness Stocks May Turn In Another Lackluster Performance - U.S. Commentary Wall Street May Open Broadly Higher Sensex, Nifty Extend Gains For Fourth Day European Shares Drift Lower Amid Mixed Earnings Reports Asian Shares Mostly Higher In Thin Holiday Trade European Stocks Set To Open Mixed Amid Lack Of Triggers Sensex Up 170 Points In Early Trade; Nifty At 8649 Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Mixed Global Cues Thai Market Likely To See Resistance At 1600 Little Movement Expected For Indonesia Shares Hong Kong Market Due For Profit Taking <<Previous        46 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

Apple’s admission into the group could be announced as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the situation. Representatives at Apple and the Partnership on AI declined to comment. When the nonprofit organization was announced in September, it anticipated gaining additional members. Apple, Twitter Inc., Intel Corp. and China’s Baidu Inc. were among noticeable absentees at the time. While the introduction of the Siri virtual assistant in 2011 gave Apple an early presence in AI for consumers, it has since lost ground to rivals such as Google and Amazon. Apple’s penchant for secrecy limited its efforts to improve AI offerings and hire the best talent. That’s because researchers in the field like to publish their findings, something Apple frowned upon in the past. That approach began to change late last year with the hiring of Carnegie Mellon Professor Russ Salakhutdinov and the publishing of its first public AI paper. Joining the Partnership on AI is the latest sign that Apple is opening up more. The group says it aims to “conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license."

Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields Posted 17 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Satechi’s $30 Power Meter is designed to weed out bad USB-C cables Donald Trump’s White House administration has revealed the full membership of its manufacturing council (via Steve Kopack), which he assigned Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris to lead in December. The council includes Elon Musk, making this the second Trump administration advisory group that the Tesla CEO belongs to, including his Strategic and Policy Forum, which advises on economic matters. Musk isn’t the only tech executive on the manufacturing council, however. Other members include Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Dell CEO and founder Michael Dell, and Ford CEO Michael Fields. Dennis Muilenburg from Boeing, Wendell Weeks from Corning, Jeff Immelt from General Electric and Marillyn Hewson from Lockheed Martin are also council members. Of the tech industry people on this list, Musk has perhaps been the most vocal and visible in his involvement with Trump administration activities. Musk tweeted his optimism around Trump Secretary of State pick Rex Tillerson earlier this week, and spoke to Gizmodo about his support of the oil industry executive. Though Tillerson supported a carbon tax on record at ExxonMobil, a measure Musk also supports for encouraging development of renewables, a report this week revealed that the Secretary of State pick’s former company also actively lobbied against a carbon tax in Massachusetts. Musk also met with Trump on Monday, in a meeting where Ford’s Mark Fields was also present. Fields has been among the most enthusiastic and vocal with regards to Trump on the auto industry side. Following a meeting earlier this week which also included GM CEO Mary Barra and FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne, Fields said he was “excited” about working with Trump and his administration. At an interview at Davos this week, Michael Dell said that his company was encouraged by an administration talking about policies that are “pro-growth.” Here’s the full list of members on the new manufacturing council: Andrew Liveris, The Dow Chemical Company Bill Brown, Harris Corporation Michael Dell, Dell Technologies John Ferriola, Nucor Corporation Jeff Fettig, Whirlpool Corporation Mark Fields, Ford Motor Company Ken Frazier, Merck & Co., Inc. Alex Gorsky, Johnson & Johnson Greg Hayes, United Technologies Corp. Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin Corporation Jeff Immelt, General Electric Jim Kamsickas, Dana Inc.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 9:55AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 9:55AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index inched higher in early trade on Friday and was on track for a 0.6 percent gain on the week, as industrial, technology and telecom gains offset losses for energy stocks as oil prices fell. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 17.26 points, or 0.11 per cent, at 15,632.78 shortly after the open. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened little changed on Friday, while strong results from tech companies propped up the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.24 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 20,094.67. The S&P 500 gained 1.04 points, or 0.04 per cent, to 2,297.72. The Nasdaq Composite added 10.94 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 5,666.12. Microsoft rose 1.7 per cent to $65.34 in early trading, while Intel gained 2.3 per cent to $38.41 after the two companies reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over President Donald Trump’s pro-growth initiatives, catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time and giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks. All three major indexes were on track to post weekly gains. “The market has had a strong, solid rally and there’s a pause to evaluate and react to the next set of data and other catalysts that could move the market,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Mr. Trump’s business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. “Actions speak louder than words and the fact that Trump has signed numerous executive orders since his inauguration continues to heighten hopes of the proposed fiscal stimulus measures materializing,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Early fourth-quarter earnings have also boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 per cent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 146 companies that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 69.2 per cent have topped expectations. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter with gross domestic product increasing at a 1.9-per-cent annual rate, below the 2.2-per-cent rise expected by economists. Another set of data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in December, with non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rising 0.8 per cent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5-per-cent rise. Oil prices slipped on Friday, giving up gains from earlier in the day, as the market shifted its focus towards production increases in the United States from efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices by cutting supplies. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were trading at $55.80 per barrel, down 44 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.54 a barrel, down 24 cents. U.S. crude is poised to gain nearly 2 per cent on the week. “The market is really torn between a relatively healthy compliance from OPEC and non-OPEC countries on the one side, and an increase in the U.S. crude production on the other,” PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said. Prices had risen during Asian business hours, though activity was low due to the start of the Lunar New Year holiday in most countries of the region, including China and Singapore. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, agreed to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first half of 2017 to fight a two-year supply overhang. But U.S. oil production has been rising, with the International Energy Agency forecasting total U.S. production growth of 320,000 bpd in 2017 to an average of 12.8 million bpd. Analysts said investors who bet on rising prices were taking profit in advance of U.S. rig counts due later in the day from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes, which could signal further increases in U.S. production. Oil research firm PetroMatrix said the rig count data, “will be a weekend risk as another surge will negatively impact the start of next week.” There were fundamental factors that impacted prices this week, such as gains in Iran’s monthly oil exports in February and resilient production in Libya. A glitch in North Sea Buzzard crude production provided support. But market participants warned of more volatility ahead as speculators were reacting to even small developments in the physical markets. “Given that speculative net long positions in Brent and WTI are already at a record-high level, the correction potential is therefore growing all the time,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Budget 2017 Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Google Pixel 2 rumours: Improved camera, CPU and an affordable Pixel in the making New information on Pixel 2 reveals a lot more than we already know, and it's kind of exciting. Sami Khan   January 27, 2017 20:40 IST Google PixelScreenshot from Google Play Store Google is already working on the successors for its Pixel series and a lot is going into play to make them supreme. In a battle against players like Apple and Samsung, Google needs to have a solid performer combined with great looks. A hint of that was actually seen in Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, but there's more to deploy. According to a report by 9to5google, Google is improving its next Pixel smartphone with significant changes. The focus continues to be the camera, which is said to be improved exponentially on the low-light photography front. Don't forget Google had claimed that the Pixel phones have the best smartphone camera. The report suggests the Pixel 2 will not be large on the megapixel size, but the company will compensate with extra features. The Pixel series sports 12.3MP dual-pixel camera for the rear and an 8MP front snapper with series of features to deliver optimum results. The Pixel 2 is expected to outperform the Pixel, but it remains to be seen to what extent. Waterproofing is in the books, no excuses! Another important addition to the Pixel 2 is going to be the waterproofing, which was largely left out from the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones due to shortage of time. At least, that's not going to be an excuse this year. Qualcomm or Intel chips? According to 9to5google's source, Google is testing multiple Pixel 2 models with improved chipsets. The company is said to be working with Qualcomm and Intel on this one. Sadly, MediaTek is no longer a part of Google's collaboration for Pixel 2, the report adds. Is there going to be a Snapdragon 83X processor or Intel Kaby Lake powering the upcoming Pixel 2 this year? It's too early to predict and a lot could change by the time the product launches. Let's keep our options wide open for now. Improvements come with a price Don't get too excited about the significant improvements Pixel 2's camera, design and performance just yet. With all this happening, Google is expected to bring a higher price tag. It is not clear how much exactly the Pixel 2 is going to cost and quite frankly it is too soon to predict. But the report says that the new Pixels will cost higher than the first Pixels. If the report is to be believed, the Pixel 2 is going to cost at least $50 higher than the Pixel, which was launched at $649 for the entry-level variant and $749 for the 128GB model. You can do the math. Disappointed? Here's something more... You can either start saving or settle for a toned-down version of Pixel 2. According to the report, Google is also testing a few prototypes of a device dubbed as Pixel 2B, which is said to launch shortly after Pixel 2. The Pixel 2B is expected to have a less powerful hardware and be priced significantly lower than the Pixel 2.

BUSINESS Energy companies lead stocks mostly lower FILES-US-STOCKS-MARKETS-OPEN Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images The Wall Street sign near the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9, 2016. The Wall Street sign near the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9, 2016. (Bryan R. Smith / AFP/Getty Images) Associated Press Wall Street capped a week of milestones Friday with a day of listless trading that left U.S. stock indexes mostly lower. Energy companies declined the most as the price of crude oil fell. Healthcare stocks posted the biggest gain. Quarterly results from Microsoft, Starbucks and other big companies continued to be in focus. Bond yields fell after the government reported that the economy lost momentum in the last three months of 2016. More stocks fell than rose on the New York Stock Exchange. This week all three major indexes set all-time highs, including the Dow Jones industrial average, which stayed above the 20,000 mark after crossing that threshold for the first time Wednesday. “We've had an OK week,” said Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede. “Having a day when you just give back a little bit is not a bad thing.” The Dow edged down 7.13 points, or 0.04%, to 20,093.78. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 1.99 points, or 0.1%, to 2,294.69. The Nasdaq composite index inched up 5.61 points, or 0.1%, to 5,660.78. The tiny gain was enough to set another all-time high for the Nasdaq. Small-company stocks did worse than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 fell 4.89 points, or 0.4%, to 1,370.70. The market drifted between small gains and losses through much of the day as investors weighed company earnings and new data on the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.9% in the last three months of 2016, a slowdown from 3.5% in the previous quarter. For 2016, the economy grew 1.6%, the worst showing since 2011 and down from 2.6% in 2015. A separate government report showed that businesses spent more on industrial machinery, semiconductors and other big-ticket items last month, a sign that U.S. manufacturers seem to be doing better after a two-year slump. The economic snapshots sent bond prices higher. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.48% from Thursday's 2.51%. “The market right now is at sort of at a crossroads,” said Tom Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. “We hit that huge psychological barrier and busted through it when we hit [Dow] 20,000, but today's GDP number came in, for the most part, below expectations and brought everyone back down to earth.” Companies that posted disappointing quarterly results or outlooks for 2017 helped steer the market lower. Starbucks slid 4% to $56.12 a day after the coffee chain reported weak sales growth and cut its sales forecast for the year. Chevron also turned in weaker-than-expected results. The San Ramon, Calif., oil company was the biggest decliner in the Dow, falling 2.4% to $113.79. Colgate-Palmolive tumbled 5.2% to $64.68 after its fourth-quarter sales missed analysts' estimates. The company's 2017 forecast also disappointed investors. Juniper Networks fell 3.8% to $26.67 after the Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of computer networking equipment reported a strong fourth quarter but projected a smaller-than-expected profit for this quarter. Companies that served up better results got a boost. Microsoft rose 2.4% to $65.78, making it the biggest gainer in the Dow. The software giant reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results, largely due to its focus on online services and business software rather than its legacy Windows operating system. Wynn Resorts surged 8% to $103.08 after it reported revenue that beat Wall Street's forecasts. The stock led all the gainers in the S&P 500. So far, 33.8% of the companies in the S&P 500 index have reported quarterly results for the last three months of 2016, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. And 40% of those have posted results that beat financial analysts' forecasts, the firm said. Investors also remained focused on the latest moves by President Trump. His spokesman said the administration was considering slapping a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to help pay for his promised border wall, in an announcement that left markets uncertain about what it means for trade. “I don't know anyone who would think of a trade war as good thing, or tariffs,” Siomades said. “When you start going down that path, then the market all of a sudden retracts and says, ‘Wait a minute, we have 1.9% GDP growth, how are higher tariffs and restriction on trade going to make that better?’ ” Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 61 cents, or 1.1%, to $53.17 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slid 72 cents, or 1.3%, to $55.52 a barrel in London. Major stock indexes overseas were mixed. Germany's DAX fell 0.3%, while France's CAC 40 slid 0.6%. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3%. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.3%, helped by the dollar's surge against the Japanese yen, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1%. Many Asian countries have begun holidays of varying lengths, curtailing trading across much of the region. Markets in China, South Korea and Taiwan were closed, and Malaysia's was open only in the morning. In currency trading, the dollar strengthened to 115.09 yen from Thursday's 114.42 yen. The euro rose to $1.0698 from $1.0692. The price of gold slipped $1.40 to $1,188.40 an ounce. Silver rose 29 cents to $17.14 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.70 a pound. Wholesale gasoline dropped 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon, while heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.62 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 1 cent to $3.39 per 1,000 cubic feet.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss So-called sanctuary cities were once places of refuge. A surge in media mergers is expected under Trump’s pro-business agenda. Chinese New Year begins tomorrow. Grocery store tomatoes are often tasteless but researchers at the University of Florida have discovered a game-changer.

Ik gebruik de addon trakt wanneer ik dan mijn RPi 2 opnieuw installeer of update, dan is het addon installeren en syncen en klaar, ook versie verschillen maken niet meer uit. Reageer 0 Borromini @markwingens • 27 januari 2017 15:58 Omdat je meerdere Kodi clients hebt en je media wil delen Reageer +1 Zer0 @Borromini • 27 januari 2017 16:23 En sinds wanneer is SQL daar voor nodig? Het enige voordeel van SQL gebruik is het feit dat je maar een keer hoeft te scrapen, en dat de voortgang binnen video's bijgehouden wordt. Voor synchronisatie van de watched status kun je ook Trakt gebruiken. Reageer +1 Extace666 @Zer0 • 27 januari 2017 16:28 OMG je zou maar eens meerdere opties hebben om hetzelfde doel te bereiken. Wat is er zo nadelig aan SQL en maakt trakt zoveel beter? Reageer +1 markwingens @Extace666 • 27 januari 2017 16:32 Het is precies zoals je zegt er zijn meerder wegen naar het einddoel. Voor mij was het nadelig dat SQL vereist (voor zover ik weet) dat de Kodi clients allemaal dezelfde versie draaien. @Zer0 Trakt kan de voortgang ook bij houden, dit vind ik persoonlijk heerlijk werken. Zelfs op mijn Telefoon en tablet blijft alles gelijk. Reageer +1 Extace666 @markwingens • 27 januari 2017 16:39 moeten inderdaad zelfde versies zijn, kan begrijpen dat als je met verschillende installs bezig bent dit moeilijk wordt. Reageer +1 Zer0 @Extace666 • 27 januari 2017 16:40 Het nadeel van SQL: voor SQL heb je een extra SQL server nodig, wat lokale resources kost. Daarnaast brengt het extra complexiteit met zich mee, zoals database authorisaties, gekloot met advanced settings.xml aanpassen of user/pass/ip combinaties invullen met een simpele afstandsbediening. Als laatste de leuke effecten als je Kodi nieuwe content scraped terwijl de database offline is, of als je met verschillende Kodi versies werkt. Het voordeel van trakt: geen SQL server nodig, simpele installatie van addon en een inlog via qr-code en telefoon of pc Reageer +1 Pieeeeeee @Zer0 • 27 januari 2017 18:14 Ik heb anders bij een nieuwe installatie mijn sql-server sneller ingesteld dan dat ik Trakt toegevoegd en aangemeld heb, en gewacht tot de synchronisatie voltooid is. Voor SQL: xml-file kopiëren en klaar (die ik uiteraard als backup ergens heb staan). Bovendien doet trakt alleen films en series. Bij een nieuwe installatie met sql heb ik meteen alle muziek ter beschikking, wat anders een vrij lang scanproces zou zijn. Het argument dat de sql-server offline kan zijn vind ik ook matig. Als dat in mijn geval zo zou zijn, zijn films en muziek ook niet beschikbaar aangezien die op dezelfde server staan. Dan is er nog het probleem van fout gescrapete films omdat er bvb meerdere met dezelfde naam bestaan. Met SQL los je dat één keer op voor alle clients. Zonder SQL moet elke client voor zichzelf scannen en komen dezelfde fouten overal terug. Reageer +1 jozuf @Zer0 • 27 januari 2017 16:46 Als je SQL gebruikt zijn er ineens allerlei tools beschikbaar die de DB kunnen gebruiken zoals bv; http://htpc.io/ Ik gebruik zelf ook MySQL. Kan ik tenminste gemakkelijk data uit Kodi trekken vanuit websites enzo. Reageer +1 Zer0 @jozuf • 27 januari 2017 17:00 Leuk voorbeeld, maar afaik heb je helemaal geen Kodi - sql database nodig om HTPCManager te gebruiken... Maar goed, voor sommigen kan het een leuke hobby zijn Zelf ben ik blij dat ik alle MySQL databases kwijt ben, en ik dus weer een service een nekschot kon geven. Minder lokale resources in gebruik, minder data-verkeer. (als je ook sensor en radar-data logt loopt dat hard op) Al die leuke complexe systemen, daar speel ik op het werk wel mee, thuis is functionaliteit en eenvoud het motto. Reageer +1 CurlyMo Design en multimedia @Zer0 • 27 januari 2017 16:37 Het voornaamste voordeel is dat je niet nog een externe dienst nodig hebt als je het zelf kan regelen. Ik heb een NAS met meerdere VPS'en waarin het voor me makkelijker is om een database te gebruiken dan een externe dienst. Prima toch?! Reageer +1 Borromini @Zer0 • 27 januari 2017 18:29 Waarom zou je een account op een website aanmaken voor functionaliteit die dit programma zelf al aanbiedt, en je nog es perfect alles binnen je LAN kan afhandelen? Occam's razor Komt je privacy ten goede ook. [Reactie gewijzigd door Borromini op 27 januari 2017 18:30] Reageer +1 CH40S Design en multimedia @Borromini • 27 januari 2017 17:04 IMO is Kodi voor meerdere clients niet echt geschikt, dankzij plugins wel zo te maken natuurlijk, maar dat blijft niet echt super handig werken, vind ik. Ik gebruik daarom zelf downloads: Plex Media Server 1.3.3, die daar meer op geënt is. Reageer +1 sdk1985 @CH40S • 27 januari 2017 17:54 Prima geschikt voor meerdere clients, alleen niet om iets halverwege verder te kijken op een ander device. edit: Ik doelde dus op Kodi [Reactie gewijzigd door sdk1985 op 27 januari 2017 19:54] Reageer +1 CH40S Design en multimedia @sdk1985 • 27 januari 2017 20:14 Ik weet dat Kodi het kan, maar betekend dat nog niet dat Kodi ervoor gemaakt is, zoals Plex dat wel is. Reageer +1 sdk1985 @CH40S • 27 januari 2017 20:55 Ik bedoel dat je Kodi op meerdere clients kunt gebruiken. Dus standalone en dat gaat prima (daar is hij wel voor gemaakt). Zelf heb ik nooit de toegevoegde waarde gezien van het syncen van de databases. Ik weet dat er tweakers zijn die in de badkamer nog TV kijken en dan vervolgens in de keuken verder kijken maar tot die groep reken ik mijzelf niet. Ik ben meer van de immersion en niet van het kijken om het kijken. [Reactie gewijzigd door sdk1985 op 27 januari 2017 20:56] Reageer +1 Carn82 @sdk1985 • 27 januari 2017 19:34 Uh, met Plex kan je juist prima verder kijken op andere devices. Of doel je daar niet op? Reageer +1 marco.heykant @CH40S • 27 januari 2017 19:24 Nadeel van plex vind ik dan weer dat ie slecht om gaat met meerder videofiles in een mapje, veel renaming nodig en veel handholding. 1 vinkje in kodi en alles staat gewoon netjes genoemd op filename in plaats van library name en ik hoef me niet meer rot te scrollen. Streaming op afstand werkt dan inderdaad prima. Reageer +1 Carn82 @marco.heykant • 27 januari 2017 19:36 Ja, terecht punt, Plex is vrij strict als het gaat om hoe je je media importeert. Maar goed, daar heb ik zelf filebot voor draaien, werkt erg goed moet ik zeggen. Wat bedoel je met meerdere videofiles in een mapje? Reageer +1 CH40S Design en multimedia @marco.heykant • 27 januari 2017 20:15 Ik heb ook Sick Rage draaien, die doet de naming al en heb nergens last van, eigenlijk.

Bibliotheek bijwerken lijkt erg traag te gaan. Reageer +1 waspoeder @Borromini • 27 januari 2017 18:39 Dan ligt dat niet aan mij Was al bang dat het aan libreelec lag. Reageer +1 CH40S Design en multimedia @waspoeder • 27 januari 2017 15:57 Je kunt eens kijken naar downloads: Plex Media Server 1.3.3, die heeft voor dergelijke doeleinden een betere opzet. Reageer 0 waspoeder @CH40S • 27 januari 2017 18:09 Me server is niet snel genoeg voor plex helaas [Reactie gewijzigd door waspoeder op 27 januari 2017 18:11] Reageer 0 Carn82 @waspoeder • 27 januari 2017 19:32 Zolang je niets hoeft te transcoden maakt dat niet heel veel uit en Kodi speelt bijna alles, dus je kan het best proberen gok ik zo... Er is ook een officiële Plex for kodi plugin, maar deze zit nog in beta (en heb je Plex pass voor nodig) Reageer 0 _Alkaline 27 januari 2017 15:53 Hoe zit dit eigenlijk met de ondersteuning van hevc materiaal op televisies met android. Het is me opgevallen dat televisies met een multimediaspeler vaak veel moeite hebben met afspelen van hevc materiaal. Dit heb ik zelf getest op een tweetal Philips televisies. (55PUS8700 en de 65PUS6521). Reageer +1 sdk1985 @_Alkaline • 27 januari 2017 17:50 Op mijn Sony X830C Android TV kan ik prima x265 afspelen in combinatie met Kodi 16.1. Ik verwacht dat de Shield Box (Nvidia) het ook kan. [Reactie gewijzigd door sdk1985 op 27 januari 2017 17:51] Reageer +1 Klojum Design en multimedia @sdk1985 • 27 januari 2017 18:08 De Shield kon dat al. Ik moet nog kijken wat de hele Nougat 7.0 update voor Kodi/SPMC betekent, dat heb ik nog niet bekeken. Reageer 0 CH40S Design en multimedia @_Alkaline • 27 januari 2017 16:00 HEVC/x265 is nog geen vaste standaard, daar kunnen nog dingen in wijzigen. Daarnaast is het sterk afhankelijk van de content. 4K 10 bit content hebben oudere versies van Kodi wat moeite mee, ik geloof dat met deze versie die problemen opgelost zouden moeten zijn. Daarnaast is nog maar de vraag in hoeverre televisies de in de content gebruikte codecs ondersteunen. Reageer 0 twicejr @CH40S • 27 januari 2017 16:55 Ook afhankelijk van de ondersteuning / snelheid van je CPU / GPU. De Raspberry kan niet hardwarematig Full HD h265 decoderen, maar de Raspberry 3 zou het softwarematig moeten redden met een overclock. Reageer 0 Klojum Design en multimedia @twicejr • 27 januari 2017 18:06 Dan moet je wel 1080p videos met hele lage bitrates kijken. Met een beetje kwaliteit bij 720p kan een RPi3 het softwarematig allemaal net behappen. Goede FullHD hevc op een Rpi3 ga je zelfs met een (flinke) overklok niet redden.

New KDE Slimbook aims to make it simpler to drop Windows KDE developers have helped build a laptop designed to give users a headache-free Linux experience. ByLiam Tung | January 27, 2017 -- 11:28 GMT (03:28 PST) | Topic: Hardware The new KDE-branded Slimbook aspires to offer hardware that runs smoothly out of the box with Ubuntu-based KDE neon. Image: KDE/Slimbook KDE community developers and Spanish brand Slimbook have teamed up to launch the 13.3-inch display KDE Slimbook, running the Ubuntu-based KDE neon operating system. The new KDE-branded Slimbook aspires to give KDE fans hardware that runs smoothly out of the box with its software, which doesn't always happen after replacing a Windows desktop with a Linux distribution. KDE hopes the hardware will open up its software to new users outside its community of developers. The KDE Slimbook is available with a 2.3GHz Intel i5 processor, which starts at €729 ($779), while the 2.5GHz i7 variant starts at €849 ($907). The Slimbook's specs aren't cutting edge, but for some KDE fans, the key selling point may be that the hardware has been tested by KDE developers to ensure everything works. The notebook is available in a silver aluminum body, and features a backlit keyboard, 4GB RAM and 120GB SSD storage. It has two USB 3.0 ports, mini HDMI port, an SD and MMC card reader, and a 6,800mAh battery, while display is full HD at 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Both variants can be upgraded with 8GB or 16GB RAM, and either a 250GB or 500GB SSD. The keyboard is available in Spanish, English, French and German. Pre-orders are open now but they won't be fulfilled until after March 15. KDE contributor Thomas Pfeiffer explains that the Slimbook is the latest effort by KDE developers to ensure the open-source software just works. KDE users can run into any number of problems when using, for example, KDE's Plasma environment or its other software, which can usually be traced back to compatibility issues at the software, operating system, or hardware and driver layers. "Oftentimes it is difficult for us to pinpoint exactly where things are going wrong," he notes. To address the OS layer, the KDE community started working with the developers of KDE neon, which is built on Ubuntu LTS 16.04. As neon developers explain, neon is not a KDE distribution as such, but a KDE project that contains the latest KDE software on the Ubuntu base. "Last year, KDE neon joined the KDE community with the promise to give us control over the operating system layer. This does not mean we won't make our software available on other distributions or operating systems, of course, but it allows us to eliminate that layer as a possible source of a problem," Pfeiffer says. The KDE-branded Slimbook is the culmination of the community's efforts to address the hardware layer, which "we had zero control over", he notes. "Fast-forward to late last year, when the Spanish laptop retailer Slimbook approached KDE with the idea to offer KDE-branded laptops that come pre-installed with Plasma and KDE Applications. We were excited about the idea, and put our designers and developers to the task of creating a branding for such a device and making sure that KDE neon runs without any hardware-related issues on it." For now, says Pfeiffer, the Slimbook is only available with KDE neon, but they're open to offering another distribution that comes pre-installed with Plasma.

REUTERS/Andrew KellyMore By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower for a second consecutive session on Friday as some underwhelming corporate earnings and gross domestic product data offset recent enthusiasm over policy actions by President Donald Trump. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists and the 3.5 percent growth pace logged in the third quarter. Chevron fell 2.4 percent to $113.79 after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts' expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indexes. The S&P energy index <.SPNY>, down 0.9 percent, was the worst performing of the 11 major S&P sectors. Starbucks curbed gains on the Nasdaq. Its shares dropped 4.0 percent to $56.12 after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. "The market has rallied on expectations of good things to happen in the future but as we are getting the data that is factual of what is going on, it is not as good as people are hoping," said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago. "Which tells you, this earnings recovery that is expected in 2017, a good chunk of it is already baked into the market." Even with some disappointing corporate results, fourth-quarter earnings are expected to show growth of 6.8 percent, which would mark the biggest increase in two years and second straight quarter of growth, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow remained above 20,000 for the third straight day, after breaching the milestone for the first time on Wednesday as the post-election rally reignited. For the week, the Dow rose 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 1.9 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 7.13 points, or 0.04 percent, to 20,093.78, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 1.99 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,294.69 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 5.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,660.78. Microsoft rose 2.3 percent to $65.78, while Intel gained 1.1 percent to $37.98 after both reported quarterly results above Wall Street expectations. However, Google parent Alphabet lost 1.4 percent to $845.03 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive slumped 5.2 percent to $64.68 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 116 new highs and 26 new lows. About 5.81 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.56 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, catapulting the Dow above 20,000 for the first time and giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks. All three major indexes were on track to post weekly gains. "The market has had a strong, solid rally and there's a pause to evaluate and react to the next set of data and other catalysts that could move the market," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. "Actions speak louder than words and the fact that Trump has signed numerous executive orders since his inauguration continues to heighten hopes of the proposed fiscal stimulus measures materializing," said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. Dow e-minis were down 11 points, or 0.05 percent, with 16,071 contracts changing hands at 8:35 a.m. ET (1335 GMT). S&P 500 e-minis were down 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, with 85,805 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 7.25 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 17,615 contracts. Early fourth-quarter earnings have also boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 146 companies that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 69.2 percent have topped expectations. U.S. economic growth slowed more than expected in the fourth quarter with gross domestic product increasing at a 1.9 percent annual rate, below the 2.2 percent rise expected by economists. Another set of data showed new orders for U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in December, with non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rising 0.8 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.5 percent rise. Starbucks fell 4.2 percent to $56 in premarket trading after the world's biggest coffee seller trimmed its full-year revenue forecast. Google parent Alphabet was down 1 percent at $848.51 after it posted fourth-quarter profit below analysts' estimates. Colgate-Palmolive fell 4.5 percent to $65.15 after the personal products maker's fourth-quarter revenue missed estimates.

Apple joins Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft in AI initiative Posted 19 hours ago by Romain Dillet (@romaindillet) 0 SHARES Next Story Alibaba’s Ant Financial is buying MoneyGram for $880M to expand its global presence Following Bloomberg’s report, the Partnership on AI to Benefit People and Society (what a name) officially announced that Apple is joining other tech companies as a founding member of the AI initiative. Companies will work on research projects, AI best practices and more. The Partnership on AI was officially unveiled back in September 2016. At the time, Amazon, Facebook, Google, IBM and Microsoft were the only founding members. Apple, Twitter, Intel and Baidu didn’t participate in the initiative. But Apple was already enthusiastic about the project, so today’s news is more about formalizing the company’s involvement. Siri co-founder and CTO Tom Gruber is going to represent Apple. You can find the full board of trustees on the partnership’s website. In other news, six independent individuals are also joining the board based on their past achievements when it comes to AI. Dario Amodei (OpenAI), Subbarao Kambhampati (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence & ASU), Deirdre Mulligan (UC Berkeley), Carol Rose (American Civil Liberties Union), Eric Sears (MacArthur Foundation) and Jason Furman (Peterson Institute of International Economics) will participate in the discussions. While the Partnership on AI has yet to clarify its areas of work, you can expect to see research papers on AI. The companies could write about ethics, inclusivity and privacy as these are hot topics. The first meeting is taking place on February 3rd. Artificial intelligence is great, but it needs some ethical supervision in order to benefit everyone. The Partnership on AI could also be a great lobbying tool, proving that tech companies are acting responsibly. It’s a good way to win everyone’s trust. Finally, Apple couldn’t miss out on this opportunity if it wants to hire some of the best AI engineers. Apple shows that it has a seat at the AI table. That’s why engineers working for the company also published a research paper. Now that it’s getting more competitive to hire the best AI talent, these signs are becoming increasingly relevant. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Apple Founded 1976 Overview Apple is a multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a roughly flat open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by just 12 points. Traders may remain reluctant to make significant moves amid uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the markets following recent strength. The Dow ended the previous session at a new record closing high, while the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 remained close to the record highs set on Wednesday. The markets are also digesting the mixed batch of earnings news released by several big-name technology companies after the close of trading on Thursday. While Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings, Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) both reported better than expected quarterly results. In economic news, the Commerce Department released a report showing economic growth in the U.S. slowed by more than anticipated in the final three months of 2016. The report said gross domestic product increased by 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter following a 3.5 percent jump in the third quarter. Economists had expected GDP to climb by 2.2 percent. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed durable goods orders unexpectedly declined in December amid a continued decrease in orders for transportation equipment. The Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell by 0.4 percent in December after tumbling by a revised 4.8 percent in November. The dip came as a surprise to economists, who had expected durable goods orders to jump by 2.6 percent following the 4.5 percent slump that had been reported for the previous month. However, excluding the drop in orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders rose by 0.5 percent in December after jumping by 1.0 percent in November. The increase matched estimates. Shortly after the start of trading, the University of Michigan is scheduled to release its revised report on consumer sentiment in the month of January. The consumer sentiment index is expected to be unchanged from the preliminary reading of 98.1, which was down slightly from 98.2 in December. After moving notably higher over the two previous sessions, stocks showed a lack of direction throughout the trading day on Thursday. Despite the choppy trading on the day, the Dow still ended the session at a new record closing high. The major averages eventually ended the day mixed. While the Dow rose 32.40 points or 0.2 percent to 20,100.91, the Nasdaq edged down 1.16 points or less than a tenth of a percent to 5,655.18 and the S&P 500 dipped 1.69 points or 0.1 percent to 2,296.68. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher during trading on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Australia's All Ordinaries Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The Chinese markets were closed on the day. Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.2 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.2 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.4 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are slipping $0.18 to $53.60 a barrel after jumping $1.03 to $53.78 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,181.30 an ounce, down $8.50 from the previous session's close of $1,189.80 an ounce. On Thursday, gold fell $8. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 115.28 yen compared to the 114.50 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0695 compared to yesterday's $1.0682. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Meets First Time Under New Regime – Economic Preview for Week of Jan. 30 The World's 10 Most Productive Nations, Ranked Biotech Stocks Facing FDA Decision In February Previous Story Next Story More Commentary -Global Stocks Close Roughly Flat For Second Straight Day - U.S. Commentary Stocks Continue To Lack Direction In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower On Bank Weakness Stocks Continue To Experience Choppy Trading - U.S. Commentary Wall Street May Open Broadly Higher Sensex, Nifty Extend Gains For Fourth Day European Shares Drift Lower Amid Mixed Earnings Reports Asian Shares Mostly Higher In Thin Holiday Trade European Stocks Set To Open Mixed Amid Lack Of Triggers Sensex Up 170 Points In Early Trade; Nifty At 8649 Asian Markets Mostly Higher Sensex, Nifty Seen Lower On Mixed Global Cues Thai Market Likely To See Resistance At 1600 Little Movement Expected For Indonesia Shares Hong Kong Market Due For Profit Taking <<Previous        46 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed McDonald's Sells All Of Its Nordic Restaurants Tim Hortons Coming To Mexico Chevron Turns To Profit In Q4, But Results Miss Estimates Air Products Sees Q2, FY17 Adj.

What if there was a way you could make that easier? It’s a question that has no doubt crossed many minds: when a company is literally globe-spanning, how do all of the separate elements work together? How can a team be fully in sync when it’s spread across multiple cities, continents and time zones? Arguably the curse of all multinationals, this is perhaps of most concern in the ever-growing, ever-expanding, ever-on world of tech. When so many global companies – like Apple, Intel or Google – have a laser focus on innovation, it becomes more important than ever that there be no slackening off on work throughout any given day. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the collaboration gurus at Dropbox who may have cracked the solution of … well, collaboration. Speaking on a panel at a recent fireside chat held at Dropbox’s Dublin office, Adrienne Gormley – global head of customer experience at Dropbox – talked about how a widespread team can be of benefit to a company that is always trying to innovate. “I have started to try and inculcate this idea of, ‘Let’s work with time zones. Let’s turn it into a 24-hour clock’. So, when I go to bed at night, I hand stuff over to my team in the US and, when I get up in the morning, things have progressed,” said the Inspirefest 2016 speaker. “So instead of it being an inconvenience, we start to turn it into an advantage.” With teams across all areas of the business working in offices from Dublin and London to San Francisco and Tokyo, collaboration efforts like that can make the difference between a unified approach to the work and utter chaos.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / The 8Pack OrionX is a £24k monster of a rig The 8Pack OrionX is a £24k monster of a rig Matthew Wilson 18 hours ago Channel, Gaming PC Back at Computex 2016, we got our first look at 8Pack’s latest creation, the OrionX, a crazy upcoming build featuring two high-end systems in one chassis, cherry picked processors with guaranteed overclockers and a ton of water cooling, all hand-built by the champion overclocker himself. Now, this system ready for buyers to get their hands on. Here is what £23,999.99 will get you… Click images to enlarge. Firstly, the 8Pack OrionX only uses the fastest components around, regardless of cost. For the case, you will be getting the Phanteks Enthoo Elite, which has been customised specifically for this project. On the inside you will find not one but two desktop systems, one using the X99 enthusiast platform and another using Intel’s new Z270 Kaby Lake platform, so you can get the best of both worlds. In the case of the full sized ATX X99 setup, you will get a hand picked Intel Core i7 6950x with a 4.4GHz minimum overclock. On the Mini-ITX Z270 side you will get an Intel Core i7 7700K with a 5.1Ghz minimum overclock. On the graphics side, you get three Nvidia Titan X Pascal graphics card in SLI on the X99 rig and one Titan X Pascal GPU for the Z270 rig. From there, this system turns into the most complex cooling setup imaginable, with three full loops running through the system to deal with all of the heat. I’ll let the guys over at Overclockers explain to you exactly how it works: “To connect up these loops we knew we would have to do some pretty insane tubing. we would use pass-through plates made from polished acrylic to route the fluid around the walls and mid-plate of the case. Within these pass-through plates the fluid travels on several levels to create the ultimate look when illuminated. We have also added branding to the plates with the CPU loop travelling through an 8Pack logo in the IO side of the case and the ITX system fluid passing through an 8Pack logo which has been incorporated into the front of the case. The IO side of the case has never been used to carry fluid this way in any retail PC before. We have gone a step further, straight out of the gate by having a two layer pass-through allowing the GPU loop to run above the CPU loop. The GPU’s being fed from the side instead of the usual underneath and the liquid appearing to zigzag across them.” Here is the full specification for the OrionX: X99: Intel Core i7 6950X overclocked to at least 4.4GHz. Motherboard: Asus Rampage V ED 10 Intel X99. Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum 64GB (8 x 8GB) at 2666MHz. Graphics: 3 NVIDIA Titan X Pascal GPUs in Tri-SLI config with quad option available. Overclocked to 2000MHz+. Primary SSD: Intel 750 1.2TB PCI-E NVMe SSD (watercooled). Secondary SSDs: 2 Samsung 850 Pro 1TB SSDs in RAID 0 (2TB & double the speed). HDD Storage: Seagate Barracuda 10TB HDD. Z270: Processor: Intel Core i7 7700K overclocked to at least 5.1GHz. Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix Z270I Gaming. Memory: Corsair Dominator Platinum 16GB (2 x 8GB) at 3200MHz. Graphics: NVIDIA Titan X Pascal GPU. Primary SSDs: 2 Samsung 960 Polaris 512GB NVME M.2 in RAID 0 (1TB & double the speed). HDD Storage: Seagate Barracuda 10TB HDD. Just to reiterate, this is a £23,999.99 rig, with two high-end gaming systems placed inside, with three water cooling loops running through it all. You are also paying for the cherry picked CPUs with guaranteed overclocks and of course, the hours of time and testing it would take to put a system like this together and ensure it is stable. If you want to take a closer look at the OrionX and its configuration options, then you can do so, HERE. KitGuru Says: Regardless of the cost involved, this is definitely one of the most impressive and complex builds I have seen, especially from a retailer. What do you guys think of 8Pack’s OrionX?

Valve Developer Plumbs VK_KHR_maintenance1 For RADV Driver Written by Michael Larabel in Vulkan on 27 January 2017 at 05:54 AM EST. 3 Comments VK_KHR_maintenance1 is one of the new extensions added to the big Vulkan 1.0.39 update. A Valve developer has fired off a series of patches for making the necessary changes for supporting it with the RADV Radeon Vulkan Mesa driver. Andres Rodriguez, the former AMD developer who joined Valve last year and has begun contributing to the Mesa stack, provided the patches last night for letting RADV advertise VK_KHR_maintenance1. Intel's ANV Vulkan driver wired up this extension in Mesa Git just a few days ago. VK_KHR_maintenance1 marks the presence of various "maintenance" alterations that didn't make it for the original Vulkan 1.0 specific. VK_KHR_maintenance1 refines various features like allowing 2D and 2D array image views to be created from 3D images, let drivers to do transfers/clears of image formats they don't otherwise support, a new command to release any unused command pool memory back to the system, and other minor changes. With these 7 patches, there is enough to flip on the extension but there are some patches it depends upon that haven't yet merged to Mesa Git. It's great to see the open-source Vulkan drivers staying so close behind in the upstream developments of the Vulkan graphics API, especially considering how long OpenGL was trailing for the free software drivers. 3 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

By Richard Saintvilus, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Jan 24, 2017, 10:30 am EST     Popular Posts: Here’s Why Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Will Gain 25% Here’s Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75 Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Still Marching Toward $150 Recent Posts: Why Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock Could Rebound 40% Here’s Why Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Will Hit $75 Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is Looking Pretty Grim … As Usual View All Posts Wall Street loves Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the stock’s almost 300% rally in the past year suggests long investors have made the right bet. But it’s worth asking how much more runway does NVDA stock have left? While I’m not ready to proclaim the downfall in Nvidia stock, I do wonder to what extent NVDA can live up to the already-high expectations it has created for itself. Source: via Nvidia Indeed, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based semiconductor company has executed to perfection. Nvidia’s entry into the realm of virtual and augmented reality, data centers and self-driving cars, among other growth markets, were well-timed moves, pushing it ahead of the likes of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM). But that’s now also an attractive short thesis in Nvidia stock. Part of the reason had to do with a bearish call by Citron Research — the same firm which correctly predicted the decline of Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE:VRX). “Citron readers know we have long been fans of $NVDA, but now the mkt is disregarding headwinds. In 2017 we will see $NVDA head back to $90,” read the research note posted on Twitter. Citron noted that there are six risks that the market is currently ignoring. These include growth and market share, data center competition, intellectual property, Intel licensing revenue, gross margin sustainability and increased competition from custom silicon and GPU workarounds. Nvidia stock closed Friday at $104.01, down 1.09%. Not only has the stock stumbled out of the gate in 2017, down about 1% year to date, the shares have fallen almost 12% from their 52-week high of $119.60 reached on Dec. 28. Assuming the NVDA stock does reach $90 that implies potential declines of near 15%. Indeed, a 15% decline after almost 300% one-year returns is not a disaster. But Nvidia’s status as a momentum stock would hardly limit the decline to 15%. And here’s the thing: From current levels, NVDA stock has more of a realistic shot to reach Citron’s $90 target than climbing to another 52-week high. Why? Again, after almost 300% returns over the past year, who’s left to buy the stock that have not already done so? There are — arguably — more sellers in Nvidia stock now than there are buyers. And with Nvidia needing to “crush” 2017 estimates just to “meet” expectations, there is too much pressure on the stock to go higher. It would seem the short sellers picked up on this, as short interest in Nvidia stock grew from 44 million or so in late July to more than 71 million in mid-December. However, some of that short interest eased in late December, after NVDA peaked and lost some froth heading into the end of 2016. Short interest now sits at 55 million — still an uncomfortable 10% of the float. The ride upward has been fun, but with short sellers now piling in — including professional short Citron — long investors should cash in their Nvidia chips and live to play again. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The details Who is playing: New England Patriots vs. Atlanta Falcons Kick-off time: 6:30 p.m. EST Where they’re playing: NRG Stadium, Houston, Texas Where to watch: FOX And what about the Puppy Bowl? That will air at 3 p.m. ET/PT on Animal Planet Keep reading to find out what you should know about the Super Bowl and be sure to check back at PEOPLE.com for more coverage. And then there were two.#NFLPlayoffs #SB51 pic.twitter.com/YGSWKsC3ig — NFL (@NFL) January 23, 2017 Ticket prices are HIGH  With an average listing price of $6,000 per ticket on the secondary market, Super Bowl LI could be the most expensive to date, according to USA TODAY Sports. ESPN reports the lowest ticket currently offered for sale on StubHub is $3,499, before fees, and the median price of tickets sold on the site is $4,450. The biggest sale, so far, was a person who paid $83,521 for six front-row seats on the 30-yard line (talk about dedication!). “At these supply levels, a Cowboys, Steelers and Packers appearance could have shot the market to a $10K average asking price. Historically, supply increases about 100 percent from Championship Sunday to peak supply, and it will be interesting to see how this year compares,” Ticket IQ spokesperson Jesse Lawrence told USA TODAY Sports. According to the publication, the Falcons-Patriots matchup is “the least compelling combination of teams” from a secondary ticket market standpoint, but that doesn’t make the tickets any cheaper.  Houston. 14 days from now… LET'S GO! #SB51 #Patriots #RiseUp https://t.co/2si8A8IJ6b — Super Bowl (@SuperBowl) January 23, 2017 But watching from home just got better Not to worry, if that $6,000-a-pop ticket price deters you (seems absurdly high, is ridiculous, etc.), watching from home could be the coolest television viewing experience of a Super Bowl yet. This year, courtesy of Intel, a new feature called “Be the Player” will provide as many as two-dozen eye view clips from the game. The idea is that through 360 Replay technology, you see what the player sees. “Now you are able to do something that fans have always wanted to do,” Jeff Hopper, general manager of strategy and marketing for the Intel Sports Group, tells Sports Illustrated. For more on the technology, check out this piece by SI. If Intel 360° Replay Technology can make THIS look epic, imagine what’ll look like in the big game. Watch below. #ExperienceMore #SB51 pic.twitter.com/ugq3TFbZZV — Intel (@intel) January 12, 2017 There’s a great entertainment lineup   A little bit country, a little bit rock-n-roll — is what you can expect from the entertainment at Super Bowl LI. Georgia native and “Drunk on You” singer Luke Bryan will kick off the game with what we’re sure will be a super soulful, swoon-worthy rendition of the national anthem in his signature country twang. “I never served in the military — that’s something I wish I had had the opportunity to do, but I feel like this is my way of honoring my country. It’s a little chance to serve,” Bryan tells PEOPLE. As for the half-time performance, expect crazy, fun and exciting from Lady Gaga. Rumors are even swirling that Gaga is trying to perform on the stadium’s roof. “I want every guy’s girlfriend in his arms … I want every husband and wife kissing … every kid laughing,” she told Radio Disney. “In my mind they’re having this really powerful family experience watching the Super Bowl.” Did we mention there’s a good chance she’ll perform “Bad Romance?” Hold on to your hats!

The only other time both championship games were won by 19 points or more was in 1978, according to Fox Sports. To compare: With 6-1 odds, New England was the preseason favorite to win the Super Bowl, but Atalanta (with the fifth-worst odds) got 80-1. And, the Falcons are the top-ranked scoring offense and the Pats are the top-ranked scoring defense, according to Fox Sports. Guess we’ll see if defense really does win championships!

At 39, he’ll match Peyton Manning as the oldest quarterback to start a Super Bowl. But, Matt Ryan, 31, of the Falcons has a good chance to win his first true title. According to ESPN, he has thrown for more passing yards in his career (37, 701) than any other quarterback making his first start in the title game.

The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low as investor demand improved with higher global bond yields and stable stock markets. The return of risk appetite in the financial market boosted oil prices. MSCI's world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was little changed and just 2 percent off its record high hit in April 2015. The index found support from rallying stocks in Asia and Europe. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held well above the 20,000 level after breaching the milestone on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives and solid earnings. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit record levels immediately after the open, before easing off their highs to trade little changed on the day. "Today is about earnings and part of the Dow reaching the 20,000 milestone is because of strong earnings," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Of the 104 S&P 500 companies that had reported results through Wednesday morning, nearly 70 percent beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tech giants Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft and coffee chain Starbucks are scheduled to report results after market close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.78 points, or 0.23 percent, to 20,115.29, the S&P 500 gained 0.09 points, or 0.00 percent, to 2,298.46 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.42 points, or 0.03 percent, to 5,657.76. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism, with Johnson & Johnson's $30 billion deal to buy Actelion lifting shares in the Swiss biotech firm. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.17. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks. "The impression ... is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track," said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.67 percent to 100.7. The firmer dollar pushed gold to a two-week low but expectations that the greenback's climb may be running out of steam helped limit losses. Spot gold was down 1.16 percent to $1,186.27 an ounce. Ahead of a $28-billion auction of seven-year notes, U.S. Treasury debt yields turned higher with European yields and 10-year yields rose to a 4-week high. Benchmark 10-year notes were down 6/32 in price to yield 2.542 percent, up from 2.523 percent late on Wednesday. The recent strength in stock markets boosted oil prices although gains were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories in spite of efforts by producers to cut output. Brent crude was up 2.4 percent at $56.4 a barrel, while U.S. crude was up 2.2 percent at $53.91.

NEWS CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE PEOPLE CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE Wikibon TheCUBE ABOUT US SIGN IN Home » NEWS A strong quarter sets up VMware to double down on networking and the cloud by MIKE WHEATLEY UPDATED 23:44 EST . 27 January 2017 4 MIN READ Virtualization software company VMware Inc. pulled off another strong quarterly showing Thursday, beating Wall Street estimates for both profits and revenues and forecasting slightly better-than-expected revenues in the current quarter. On top of that, the company, whose software allows companies to use their data center computers more efficiently by allowing multiple operating software and applications to run on the same computer, said it would buy back $1.2 billion in stock, potentially bolstering the share price. On a day when other tech giants, such as Google Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. issued earnings that didn’t thrill investors, investors liked what they saw in VMware’s results. Its shares rose nearly 4 percent, to $87.47, in late trading. Update: In midday trading Friday, investors were even a bit more enthusiastic, as shares rose 5.4 percent. VMware reported fourth-quarter earnings of $441 million, or $1.04 per share, on revenues of $2.03 billion, up 9 percent from a year ago and above Wall Street analysts’ forecast of $1.99 billion. Earnings excluding certain items such as stock compensation were $1.43 per share, four cents above consensus. VMware’s strong growth in the quarter can be attributed in part to its increased software license revenues, a vital metric for the company, which topped $887 million for the quarter, an 8 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2015. In an industry where software license revenues are generally on the decline due to the shift to cloud subscription services, that’s relatively impressive growth. “It was a good quarter by VMware. The company is now a leader in hyper-converged infrastructure and its integration strategy is working,” said longtime industry analyst Dave Vellante, co-chief executive of SiliconANGLE Media Inc. “If VMware is the new legacy, this is a hell of a testament to decades of dominance in the data center.” Higher guidance The company also issued guidance for the following quarter, forecasting first-quarter revenues of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion and earnings per share of 93 to 96 cents. That compares with Wall Street’s consensus of $1.69 billion in revenues, or 96 cents per share. VMware has been forced to diversify itself in recent years in response to fears that its failure to define a strong public cloud position could affect its on-premises license revenues, and the looming threat of open-source application containers that could displace virtual machines. That diversification looks to be paying off, as the company reported a 150 percent jump in vSAN license bookings, and a 50 percent rise in NSX license bookings. VMware has big hopes for NSX in particular. The product, which pools networking hardware such as routers and switches and allows them to be reconfigured and managed via software, is on track to bring in $1 billion this fiscal year, VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger (pictured) said during the earnings conference call. He also revealed that VMware had closed a $10 million NSX deal – the company’s largest ever, he said. “Q4 closed out a strong fiscal 2016 and was one of the most balanced quarters for VMware in years,” Gelsinger said. “We’re very pleased with our strong product momentum and customer enthusiasm for our Cloud strategy.” AWS partnership key The company’s performance in the quarter was all the more remarkable considering it has yet to enjoy the fruits of its recently announced cloud partnership with Amazon Web Services, said Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst at Constellation Research Inc. The partnership will allow VMware customers to migrate computing jobs run on VMware software to AWS’s cloud to take advantage of its more flexible and lower-cost storage and computing services, and will be crucial if the company is to sustain its growth in 2017. But Mueller warned that with the AWS partnership only hitting the books from the third quarter onward, the company could face a tough couple of quarters ahead. “VMWare has delivered another strong quarter, quite remarkable considering that some of its offerings and the AWS partnership hasn’t yet taken off,” Mueller said. “[But] traditional on-premises revenue path is slowly shutting down, and it will need to show it can grow revenue from new offerings and partnerships while offsetting the decline in traditional revenue segments.” Vellante agreed on the importance of the AWS deal, pointing out that it’s unclear how long VMware can sustain its growth in license revenue in the face of such strong cloud and open-source momentum. “At some point you’d think the lack of cloud will hurt, but the AWS deal buys them time. I would expect VMware to increasingly live off of its maintenance business,” he said. “But license growth in the near term in encouraging.” VMware also revealed it plans to buy back $1.2 billion of its stock through the end of fiscal 2018. That’s on top of the company’s existing $500 million plan announced in December.

Show More While Google’s Pixels might still have that new phone smell, there are already signs that Google is hard at work on the follow-up to its first officially branded Android phone. Google made a huge and somewhat surprising splash with the launch of the Pixel last fall, and all eyes will be on whether the next version of its handset can start to chip away at Samsung’s dominance. The details are extremely sparse so far, with the only real juicy tidbits coming out of a report from 9to5Google and a few tweets. However, stay glued to this article, as we’ll keep updating it with the latest solid information. Water, water nowhere Google’s first crack at a premium handset checked off a lot of boxes, but one of the major ones it missed was waterproofing. Already a feature in premium handsets like the Galaxy S7, it was surprising that Google opted to skip it, but it appears it is working to rectify that in its next handset. As 9to5Google’s Stephen Hall explains, the feature is “on the table” for the Pixel 2, although sources had previously informed him that it was a priority for the next release. Focus on the camera The Pixel already has one of the best cameras in an Android phone, but that’s not stopping Google from making it even better. Like the iPhone, 9to5Google reports that Google won’t be focusing on megapixels with the Pixel 2, but rather will “compensate in extra features.” It’s unclear exactly what that means, but Hall says the camera will be a “major focus” in the development of the Pixel 2 as Google looks to retain its position atop the smartphone camera rankings. Chips ahoy! It’s pretty much a no-brainer that the Pixel will launch with whatever the latest version of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processor will be, and 9to5Google reports that Google is indeed testing the Pixel with the new 835 chipset. But it’s also exploring other options. According to Hall’s sources, Google is also trying out Intel chips, though it’s not clear whether that refers to modems or full processors. If Google does opt to use an Intel SoC for its new Pixels, it would be quite a coup for Intel, which has struggled to make much headway in the smartphone world. Cheaper and more expensive When the Pixel launched, it commanded a price commensurate with its premium features, and it doesn’t look the Pixel 2 is going to be any different. In fact, in might cost more. 9to5Google reports that Google’s next handset will be “at least” $50 higher than this year’s model, meaning it could start at $699 for the 5-inch model and top $800 for the Pixel XL. However, there may be some relief for users who don’t want to spend quite so much on a phone. 9to5Google reports that Google is also testing a “Pixel 2B” handset, which would serve as a budget version of the flagship phone. As Hall writes, the phone would bring less-powerful specs along with its cheaper price, with a goal of bringing the “Google experience and the Google phone to emerging markets.” It was recently reported that Google was eyeing a U.S. launch for its Android One program, so a budget Pixel would certainly fit with those plans.

The election is Feb. 7. Below this news story are the brief bios for each candidate followed by their answers to a Journal questionnaire. The race for Albuquerque Public School District 7 includes the youngest candidate in the field, a 27-year-old math instructor and game developer, who is up against incumbent Dave Peercy and two other candidates. Ian Burch completed his master’s and bachelor’s degrees in math at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and now teaches at University of New Mexico — Valencia County Branch. In is free time, he developed an action-adventure video game called Moonstrider. Burch is the only candidate under age 30 among the 19 fighting for four APS board seats. Advertisement Continue reading “My first priorities would be to improve student engagement with modern teaching methods, support community schools, and work to end the overuse of standardized testing,” Burch said. Peercy, the current board president, is seeking his third term representing District 7, the far Northeast Heights. Now retired, Peercy, 72, was a distinguished senior scientist at Sandia National Laboratories for almost 25 years. He completed his Ph.D. in math at New Mexico State University in 1971. Peercy’s goals are diverse: “Implementation of the Academic Master Plan: early learning, experiential-based curriculum, socio-emotional learning for education excellence; expanded community schools to build educational capacity with communities; art and music every year in K-5.” William Steinberg, 63, retired after working in sales at a variety of New Mexico businesses, including Concrete Systems Inc. and Highfiber Network. If elected, he hopes to boost graduation rates, help address the tight budget and “clear a path to allow teachers being able to do their jobs in a manner for which they were educated.” The final District 7 candidate, Brian Tierney, 45, earned his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and now works at Sandia National Laboratories. The 45-year-old Massachusetts native is also a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve’s Military Intelligence Corps. Tierney is pushing for an independent audit of APS finances, greater parent collaboration with the board and more autonomy for teachers in the classroom. Advertisement Continue reading He has also taken a strong stand against the district’s transgender directive, which allows kids to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities. For instance, a student who was born male but is transitioning to female can access the girls facilities. “The directive is a disgusting violation of every child’s safety,” Tierney said. “It indicates that the current board, as led by my opponent, Mr. Peercy, is devoid of a basic understanding of human nature.” Steinberg is also against the APS policy, calling it “a safety issue.” Peercy and Burch are both supporters. “Transgender students are all too often the victim of bullying and harassment, and need both the backing of the administration and teachers and the right to be treated as their gender to succeed,” Burch said. Peercy noted that the directive includes proper staff training and ensure privacy for all students. The candidates also divide on Common Core, controversial math and English standards adopted by 42 states and the District of Columbia. “Many states that instituted Common Core have since repealed it,” Steinberg said. “It is too costly and has not produced its promised results.” Advertisement Continue reading Tierney would also like to abandon the “‘one-size-fits-all’ curriculum designed to politically indoctrinate children.” To Burch, Common Core provides a “solid foundation,” while Peercy has mixed feelings. “Indications are that Common Core may not survive, but it is useful to have educational standards if those standards are reliable and valid for intended use,” Peercy said. “Common Core needs to have an improvement feedback mechanism.” CANDIDATE BIOS Ian Burch Place of residence: Albuquerque Age: 27 Education: Master of Science, Mathematics, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 2014; Bachelor of Science, Mathematics, minor, Biology, NMT, 2011.

Advertisement Continue reading APS District 7 Candidate Questionnaire 1. Do you support legislation that would require retention of third-graders who can’t read at grade level, coupled with intense early literacy intervention? Why or why not? Burch: Third-grade retention should be handled on a case-by-case basis, with intensive summer programs and specialized classes being the primary approach and holding students back used only as a last resort. Peercy: No. Retainment should be under local school/district control with School Assistance Team, teacher, parent/student collaboration. Very much favor preventive early/continual literacy intervention. Research indicates retainment greatly increases the likelihood a student will not graduate. Steinberg: No. If the system to teach reading in the first and second grades is failing, then we need to find a working solution. Failure is not an option. Tierney: Yes, but only as a last resort. I support aggressive, earlier intervention. It worked for me after failing kindergarten. After intensive summer reading, I entered first grade at an above-average reading level. 2. What percentage, if any, of a teacher’s evaluation should be based on student test scores and why? Burch: Almost none. Heavily tying teacher evaluations to standardized test scores creates an incentive for them to “teach to the test,” causing classes to become about memorization instead of learning. Advertisement Continue reading Peercy: No more than 25 percent. The American Statistical Association research analysis (supported by American Education Research Association) of the value-added model part of the teacher evaluation concludes the percentage should be no more than 1-14 percent. Steinberg: The teachers have been evaluated since public schools were instituted. What we are doing now is not working, and we need to look at what had worked the best in the past. Tierney: Evaluations should not be based on standardized tests, which can never reflect the reality of an individual teacher’s classroom. I support evaluations customized for each school, with input from teaching peers, parents, and the principal. 3. Should APS be divided into more than one district? Why or why not? Burch: No. Dividing APS into multiple districts reduces its ability to help struggling schools and would increase administrative costs. Peercy: No – this would create significant inequity in education and capital debt, and increase administrative cost. Some divided districts would have to max out capital mill levy/tax and still would not meet their assumed capital debt. Steinberg: With budget shortfalls looming for the next few years, I cannot see the value in wasting time on that idea. Tierney: The idea deserves serious consideration. Greater local control by parents, teachers, and principals could be the result. However, I would not advocate a hasty breakup resulting in the proliferation of several inefficient bureaucracies. Advertisement Continue reading 4. Do you agree with state competency exams for a student to graduate? Why or why not? Burch: Yes. At least some degree of reading, writing, and critical thinking ability should be expected of all high-school graduates. Peercy: Not as such exams are being used. Exams have not been shown to be reliable and valid for use per state statute. Local district alternate demonstration of competency after one exam failure should be allowed. Steinberg: There always has to be a standard of competency in education at a level that proves the student can be employable. Tierney: They should be used temporarily and not be the only graduation standard. My concern is that the content and standards of such exams can become politicized. Intervention must occur much earlier in a child’s education. 5. Do you agree with Common Core? Why or why not? Burch: Yes. While Common Core is not perfect and we should always try to improve curricula, it gives a solid foundation and allows students and their families to move across the country without falling behind. Peercy: Indications are that Common Core may not survive, but it is useful to have educational standards if those standards are reliable and valid for intended use. Common Core needs to have an improvement feedback mechanism. Advertisement Continue reading Steinberg: No. Many states that instituted Common Core have since repealed it. It is too costly and has not produced its promised results. I also oppose all the data mining of students/parents that goes out of state. Tierney: No! The Common Core curriculum destroys the ability of teachers to have autonomy in their classrooms. Furthermore, as is evident from assignments, it is a “one-size-fits-all” curriculum designed to politically indoctrinate children. 6. Should APS try to work more closely with the New Mexico Public Education Department? Why or why not? Burch: APS should work closely with the NMPED to try to reduce the reliance on standardized testing and fix faulty evaluation methods for schools and teachers. Peercy: Yes. APS does work closely with the NMPED on most topics but more collaboration is needed. Through constructive discussions about differences, improvement in educational policies and implementations can be achieved. Both sides must be collaborative. Steinberg: No. The PED should be a help and an asset for each local school board, not a dictator. Torrance and Bernalillo counties are world’s apart, and their school boards face very different problems. Tierney: Yes! Collaboration is always beneficial. APS would be well served by seeking a better relationship with the New Mexico Public Education Department. 7. Do you believe APS should have the ability to move teachers to different schools to meet APS needs? Why or why not? Advertisement Continue reading Burch: No. While APS may request or incentivize teachers to move between schools, giving teachers autonomy and choice will help the teacher retention issues APS has. Peercy: I support the current process. APS can already move teachers to meet needs, but it requires collaboration with district/school administration and the teacher to ensure the move is an appropriate fit for all stakeholders. Steinberg: If a situation needed immediate attention, yes. I am not in favor of moving teachers because of management problems. Also the teacher must teach what they are certified to teach. Tierney: Any district must have ultimate authority to move its employees as needed. However, teachers, being an integral part of a school community, should be contractually afforded measures of protection against frequent, during-the-school-year, or punitive moves. 8. Do you support the APS directive allowing transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities? Why or why not? Burch: Absolutely. Transgender students are all too often the victim of bullying and harassment, and need both the backing of the administration and teachers and the right to be treated as their gender to succeed. Peercy: Yes, because the New Mexico Human Rights Act (Statute Chapter 28, Article 1) identifies gender identity as a protected class/category. APS procedural directive codifies nondiscrimination processes that ensure safety/privacy for all students, accommodation plans, and staff training. Steinberg: No. I believe this is a safety issue. Advertisement Continue reading Tierney: No! The directive is a disgusting violation of every child’s safety; it indicates that the current board, as led by my opponent, Mr. Peercy, is devoid of a basic understanding of human nature. 9. If elected, what would be your top priorities? Burch: My first priorities would be to improve student engagement with modern teaching methods, support community schools, and work to end the overuse of standardized testing. Peercy: Implementation of the Academic Master Plan: early learning, experiential-based curriculum, socio-emotional learning for education excellence; expanded community schools to build educational capacity with communities; art and music every year in K-5. Steinberg: My top priorities would be the APS budget; clearing a path to allow teachers being able to do their jobs in a manner for which they were educated; and achieving better graduation rates. Tierney: Keep the boys out of the girls’ bathroom!; end Common Core!; independent audit of APS finances; restore public trust in the board. Design board meetings that welcome parent and citizen discussion. 10. Have you ever been involved in a personal or business bankruptcy hearing? Burch: No. Advertisement Continue reading Peercy: No. Steinberg: No. Tierney: No. 11. Have you ever been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of drunken driving, any misdemeanor or any felony in New Mexico or any other state? If so, explain. Burch: No. Peercy: No. Steinberg: No. Tierney: No. Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print Subscribe MORE INFO: APS District 3 candidates APS District 5 candidates APS District 6 candidates ABQnews Seeker Albuquerque News News Suggested Stories: Voting today for APS, CNM boards – Feb 3, 2015 APS board election attracts 24 candidates – Dec 20, 2016 Two candidate forums planned ahead of APS Board elections – Jan 10, 2017 Transgender rights divide APS candidates – Jan 12, 2017 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

 US STOCKS-Wall St little changed after two-day run; Dow holds 20K Reuters Jan. 26, 2017, 2:27 PM 14 facebook linkedin twitter email print * Qualcomm falls after revenue falls below expectations * Alphabet, Intel and Microsoft to report after bell * Dow up 0.14 pct, S&P 500 down 0.07 pct, Nasdaq up 0.02 pct (Updates to mid-afternoon, changes byline) By Chuck Mikolajczak Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Thursday in the wake of a two-day rally that pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average above the 20,000 mark, as investors grappled with the latest round of earnings. Qualcomm weighed on both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq as the chipmaker fell 5.7 percent to $53.82 after posting a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. The post-election rally reignited this week following a solid start to earnings season and optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-growth initiatives, giving the benchmark S&P 500 its best two-day performance in seven weeks and catapulting the Dow above the historic level. Trump's business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. Early fourth-quarter earnings have also boosted sentiment and are now expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Of the 146 companies that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 69.2 percent have topped expectations, compared with the 63.6 percent average since 1994. "It is going to be so important to see these earnings come in at or above expectations," said Tim Dreiling, senior Portfolio Manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank in Kansas City. "In 2017, certainly in these first couple of quarters, so much more than Fed-driven liquidity or multiple expansion, we really do look for the growth in earnings to be what fuels any continued increase in U.S. equities." The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 27.16 points, or 0.14 percent, to 20,095.67, the S&P 500 lost 1.7 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,296.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.04 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,657.38. Consumer discretionary stocks, up 0.4 percent, were the best performing of the 11 major S&P sectors. The group was lifted by a 2.5-percent gain in Comcast after the cable operator reported earnings. Charter Communications gained 6.3 percent on merger speculation. Royal Caribbean Cruises jumped 9.2 percent to $95.72 after it forecast higher-than-expected adjusted earnings for 2017. Whirlpool tumbled 8.6 to $173.91. The world's largest maker of home appliances posted a quarterly profit below expectations. Among companies scheduled to report after the closing bell are tech giants Intel, Alphabet and Microsoft , as well as coffee chain Starbucks. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.60-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 64 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 129 new highs and 13 new lows.
