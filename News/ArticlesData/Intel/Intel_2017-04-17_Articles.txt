Unfortunately, most of the advancement in performance only happen on a desktop level. Furthermore, for gaming fans who also like being portable and mobile, the choices are pretty limited. With the release of the latest Intel Kaby Lake processors, gaming has never been more exciting. Now, even gaming laptops are equipped with the latest processors from Intel to deliver the best portable gaming performance. In the spirit of mobility, these gaming laptops need to pack all the gaming performance in a small amount of space. The sad thing is, it comes with a price and a very big one indeed. Fortunately, not all gaming laptops will rob a typical gamer with all of his or her savings. There are still quite a few who can offer a pretty decent gaming experience while not trying to break the bank. That said, here is a list of Intel Kaby Lake gaming laptops that you can buy for under a thousand dollars. Before we dive even deeper, perhaps it is best to set some ground rules. First of all, as mentioned already, all gaming laptops would need to have any version of the Intel Kaby Lake line of processors. Next, for the sake of graphics performance uniformity, all laptops should have the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 or its Ti equivalent. Finally, the price should not go beyond $1,000. Dell Inspiron 15 7000 The first laptop on the list is the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. While one might think that this is not exactly marketed as a gaming laptop, it sure fits earlier requirements. This 15-incher sports an i5-7300HQ paired with an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti. The processor runs at 2.5GHz. Meanwhile, memory and storage are at 8GB and 256GB SSD, respectively. The 15.6-inch display has a resolution of 1920×1080. The Dell Inspiron 15 700 is priced at a decent $799. Dell Inspiron 15 7000 (via dell.com) Acer Aspire VX 15 The Acer Aspire VX 15, just like the Dell Inspiron is a 15-inch gaming laptop with a radically designed chassis. The combination of black, red, and silver gives it a very authoritative look when it comes to gaming. It has almost the same specifications as the Dell Inspiron apart from the graphics card installed. Instead of the Ti version, it has the standard NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics card. However, to compensate for the minor difference, the on-board graphics memory is twice as much, 4GB, than the Dell Inspiron. The Acer Aspire VX 15 has the same size and display resolution as the Dell Inspiron 15 7000. However, it is a bit more expensive at $918. Acer Aspire VX 15 (via acer.com) HP Omen 15t While the HP Omen 15t may look somewhat lacking when it comes to graphics, it compensates with CPU instead. This HP gaming laptop is equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 with 2GB of RAM. Fortunately, the processor is an i7-7700HQ running at 2.8GHz. It has the same amount of RAM, 8GB. However, storage wise, it has a standard 1TB platter running at 7,200 RPM. The HP Omen 15t is priced at $899. HP Omen 15t (via store.hp.com) Alienware 13 In all honesty, the Alienware 13 could be considered as the runt of the litter when it comes to the list so far. This 13-inch laptop has a display resolution of 1366×768, very much inferior from the ones listed earlier. What is worse, it is quite difficult to justify the $999 price tag when compared to the likes of Acer and HP. However, for those who are partial with the brand, perhaps the Alienware 13 is not such a bad gaming laptop. In terms of specs, the Alienware has an Intel i5-7300HQ and NVIDIA GTX 1050 with 2GB of RAM. RAM is set to 8GB while the SSD storage is only at 180GB. Alienware 13 (via dell.com) Origin EON15-S Origin is undoubtedly a newcomer when it comes to gaming laptops. However, since last year, it has made quite a headway when it comes to performance gaming. Its latest iteration, the Origin EON15-S boasts an Intel i7-7700HQ and an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB of RAM. Unfortunately, it would seem that the cheaper version will be equipped with an i5-7300HQ instead. On the other hand, the Origin EON15-S comes with a wide range of available upgrades. These upgrades include various types of RAM, storage, as well as a number of different processor SKUs. The base configuration is priced at $999. Origin EON15-S (via originpc.com) Asus Strix GL553VD One might argue that the Asus Strix GL553VD does not belong in the list of gaming laptops under $1,000. This is due to the fact that the original price for it is at $1,099, slight above the limit. However, Asus was kind enough to slash $100 off the original price thereby making it fit the bill on our list. The Asus Strix GL553VD is equipped with an i7-7700HQ and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 with 4GB of RAM. System memory is at a whopping 16GB, the biggest in the list so far. However, storage is a 1TB spinning platter rated at 7,200 RPM. As mentioned, the Asus Strix GL553VD is now priced at $999. Asus Strix GL553VD (via store.asus.com) Choosing between these gaming laptops can be one of the toughest decisions one can make. However, in terms of performance-to-cost ratio, the HP Omen 15t is a good bet. Meanwhile, the Acer Aspire VX 15 comes at a close second. For anyone looking for massive performance gains, the Asus Strix GL553VD is a good choice, but battery life is a bit of a pain. On the other hand, the newest gaming laptop is the Origin EON15-S. The design is quite good as well as the build quality. Performance is also top-notch, and if you are not satisfied with the base performance, it also comes with a number of upgrades. Finally, there’s the Alienware 13. While not really that spectacular in terms of specs, it still is pretty decent. For more tech updates, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

The IDF is a twice-a-year event from Intel, one hosted in China, and another in the US. Normally, Intel would use the event to showcase its up-and-coming technology and products. Now, its seems like the CPU maker is shaking things up in terms of its product announcements. Previously, Intel has used the Intel Developer Forum to introduce is newer line of products. From the Optane storage to the Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, the event has served a number of purposes. This is why it comes as a shock for anyone expecting to go the upcoming IDF 2017, as it will no longer happen. In addition to the San Francisco leg of the event, Intel has also announced that it will no longer host the IDF in China. Nevertheless, supporters and developers can still expect an event from Intel sometime this year. Image from IDF 2016 (via intel.com) In recent years, Intel’s product roadmap has been experiencing some serious delays. While the company still strives to push for new product releases, it still finds itself between a rock and a hard place when it comes to actual release dates. To those who are unaware, the current Kaby Lake processors were already delayed in launch as well as official release. This has affected device manufacturers like Apple and Microsoft in coming up with a new product. This is also the reason why the current MacBook Pro and Surface Book iterations are still on Skylake architecture. According to Intel’s website, It would seem that the yearly event is no longer suitable for its products. The delays on its new processor products did not help in carrying out consumer expectations at all. Furthermore, Intel has more things to worry about now that AMD is once again back in business.

Here’s why.  ( Justin Sullivan | Getty Images ) Advertisement Advertisement Intel is officially canceling its Intel Developer Forum, or IDF — an annual gathering of tech enthusiasts eager to hear what Intel is cooking up. IDF began in 1997 as a wee event, nothing too sophisticated and grand, in Palm Springs, California. Over the years, the show acquired a larger following, owing in part to the boom in the PC market. Its expansion eventually propelled it to move to San Francisco, with the event increasingly accruing more sophistication and significance over time. Why Is Intel Canceling Its Annual Developer Forum? The cancelation, though a bit of a gut-punch for developers looking forward to it every year, paves the way for a more targeted series of events that's more evolved and specific. Speaking to AnandTech, an Intel spokesperson said the move signals Intel's expansion into other markets, ventures: it's no longer exclusively a PC staple with its chips because it's also moving toward other technologies, such as virtual reality, for instance. "Intel has been transforming from a PC company and becoming much more diversified — we are in AI, 5G, autonomous driving," Agnes Kwan, an Intel spokesperson, told the Silicon Valley Business Journal. "The scope has really grown. As our business evolves, we need to reach new audiences and use different ways to reach them." A Focus On Targeted Messages To that end, big annual one-offs are no longer efficient for Intel in the efforts to spread its messages. Instead, as an attempt to communicate its technologies more effectively, it'll rely on more specific niche events that cater to specific audiences, such as those more keen on a particular category of devices or a specific Intel enterprise. "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward," reads the official announcement. This way, Intel can transition from compacting all the news it needs to share in one big event into parsing, dividing, and distributing its messages to the people who'll most likely listen. It also helps Intel introduce products at any point of the year of its choosing instead of collating a few announcements, which runs the risk of a relatively "thin" event. This is because Intel's announcements and unveilings are less frequent than, say, Apple's. So scattered events would be more fitting for its overall schedule, since often there's just nothing new to announce. It's worth noting that Intel's IDF is a major component of its ability to unveil developments in a grand way, so the impact of canceling it is hard to determine, especially if it has yet to share very detailed plans on how replacement events will be handled moving forward. Needless to say that you should expect to hear Intel news moving forward. Instead of an array of news hitting you all at once, Intel will more economically slice the bulk as it sees fit, or at least that's the concept Intel is implying with its statement. All told, the decision to nix IDF is not much of a shocker, since it closely mimics an increasing Silicon Valley trend where heavyweights such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft have steered away from one-off events toward divided affairs that involve unveilings and showcases of a particular product. IDF has been Intel's home for high-profile announcements, ranging from CPUs, storage products, and networking fabrics. Do you frequent Intel's annual IDF events? Troubled by its cancelation?

Supplier TI Computers www.ticomputers.com.au Price $2420 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel i7 7700K @ 4.8GHz • Asus Strix 8G Geforce GTX1070 • Asus Strix Z270H Gaming • Noctua D15 Cooler • 16GB 2400MHz DDR4 Kingston RAM • 250GB Samsung 960 EVO SSD • 2TB Seagate 7200rpm HDD • Cooler Master MasterBox5 Case • 750W Cooler Master Modular PSU • 22 x DVDRW Burner Tweet Email this Print this Feedback 5GHz and 700fps? Yes please! With Intel’s 7th generation CPUs and accompanying Z270 motherboard chipsets making their way onto the market, this new offering from TI Computers is indicative of the new standard for gaming PCs. Before we talk about the innards let’s briefly look at the outside. The chassis has a nice large side window for looking in at the glowing RGB-lit graphics card. Interestingly, three-quarters of the front facia acts as a dust filter and is easily removed with one hand without needing to tilt the chassis at all. Behind this filter is a single 120mm intake fan. Up top there’s a giant 170mm² vented area with screw holes for fans, although none are fitted due to the bulk of the HSF. Out the back there’s a 120mm exhaust fan, and down the bottom there’s a removable PSU dust filter. Heading inside, the system is based around Intel’s new Z270 platform, which for the first time gets a trick previously reserved for the X99 platform: dual M.2 slots! Only one is occupied here leaving room for expansion. The included M.2 SSD is one of the heroes of this build; Samsung’s latest TLC based 256GB 960 EVO, which - unlike the Pro models - is cheap enough to get you onto the luxurious NVMe bandwagon with thousands of MB/s transfer rates rather than just hundreds. And does it show! Booting is near instant, with programs and games loading at ludicrous speeds too. The other hero in this system is the CPU, Intel’s i7 7700K, which is effectively just the 6700K with a 200-300MHz speed boost providing 4.2GHz base and 4.5GHz turbo clocks at stock. But this wasn’t enough for the folks at TI Computers and each one of these PCs gets a custom overclock to suit what each individual 7700K can handle (as each CPU’s capabilities can vary). In our case, it came clocked at 4.9GHz (for two-core loads) or 4.8GHz (for four-core loads) using a little under 1.3 volts, which is respectable indeed. During the entire time we had this system the overclock was solid and the system remained very cool and quiet. The only issue detected was with a tool we use for stress testing called y-crunche,r which is very sensitive and can easily show CPU overclock instabilities, which it did in this case. Dropping the overclock 100MHz or upping the core voltage easily fixed this rather minor issue though. Speaking of upping voltages, to see just how far the CPU had been pushed from the shop we ramped up the voltage and started increasing the multiplier even further. It turns out the CPU was basically maxed out already as we could only squeeze a further 200-300MHz extra before becoming extremely unstable at 5.2GHz. So, given the extra juice required to get there the overclock from the shop was good, but 5GHz would’ve been nice to see and easily achievable. Sticking with the overclocking theme, the GTX 1070 graphics card comes with a 180MHz overclock from the factory. Using Asus’s overclocking utility and setting everything to maximum (+20% power, +91MHz core and +480MHz memory speeds) the card handled it like a champ and thanks to Nvidia’s Boost 3.0 technology pushed the clocks higher still to a surprising 2126MHz (266MHz above factory clocks) while remaining extremely quiet thanks to its custom triple fan cooler design, which never exceeded 70°C, boosting our fps in general by a further 5%. The graphics card also has a zero RPM ability, which stops its fans when idling, further reducing noise. The only problem with the card we found was some coil whine when pumping out more than 300fps (up to 700fps even) in the 3DMark Cloud Gate benchmark, but it was still quiet enough that that regular audio from games would easily drown it out. As we’re talking about benchmarks let’s talk about how this machine performs. We tested it in the pre-overclocked state it was given to us in, as well as with the CPU at 5.1GHz and the GPU at the maximum supported. Running PCMark 8’s Home conventional benchmark it scored 4825 points and 4850 with our custom overclock. In 3DMark Cloud Gate (DX11) it scored 37068 points and 38448 with our custom OC. In 3DMark Time Spy (DX12) it achieved 6169 points and 6473 with our custom OC. Some solid scores indicating this system would handle any 1440p gaming with ease. For a pre-overclocked system to be this quiet, is astounding, and is a testament to a well thought out build that delivers on all fronts.

Stewart Mitchell investigates whether this is indicative of a longer-term slump. When Intel released its seventh-generation Core processor range in January, many were left unimpressed by the performance of its top-end desktop processors. Kaby Lake, Intel’s codename for the range, provided a significant boost for mobile devices, but the desktop risks being left to fester, despite Intel’s assurances to the contrary and the re-emergence of AMD as a force in the CPU market.  “We know performance matters,” said Intel’s client computing vice president, Navin Shenoy, talking about the latest generation of chips. “It’s why we continue to focus on improved performance, delivering double-digit productivity performance increases – up to 20% for performance and gaming notebooks and 25% for desktops.” Yet most third-party benchmarks published to date have found that the high-end processors are not significantly faster than existing CPUs, especially if those sixth-generation parts were overclocked. While Intel has increased the clock frequency of processors with Kaby Lake, there are minimal architectural changes and many of the performance improvements on chips using the company’s 14nm technology rely on optimising specific tasks, such as video decoding and memory management. “Looking at the core CPU benchmarks, Kaby Lake doesn’t really provide much of a noticeable performance enhancement over [its predecessor] Skylake,” said Mark Hung, an Intel specialist at research firm Gartner. “Given the slowdown in Moore’s law, Intel decided to make a third generation [of 14nm chips] by making further architectural refinement. A lot of the improvements were made with Skylake, so there wasn’t much room to make further optimisation.”  When PC & Tech Authority queried the discrepancy between Intel’s 25% performance increase claim and external benchmarks, the company contested reports that performance improvements were minimal, but appeared to backtrack on the scale of the gains on offer. “Intel’s 7th Gen Core family is expected to provide high single-digit gains on productivity performance,” the company said in a statement, while pointing out that there were bigger improvements in specific areas such as 4K video.  “Seventh-gen Intel Core processor graphics deliver additional 3D graphics performance, driven by process and architecture improvements, when compared to sixth-gen Intel Core processor graphics. These improvements range into double-digit increases,” the company added. Holding fire? Has Intel lost interest in the niche desktop, or is it simply biding its time until it can perfect the Cannonlake 10nm process due at the end of the year? At least part of this bottleneck in desktop performance is due to the increasing difficulty of “obeying” Moore’s Law, and, according to analysts, Intel has tried to squeeze more from the 14nm production process and left itself little headroom for improvement.  Historically, the company has worked on a “tick-tock” cycle, where the firm moves to a new process one year and then refines that process the year after. For example, Ivy Bridge in 2012 saw chip production move to a 22nm process, which was the tick, and a year later the company improved the performance with the Haswell architecture, the tock. Then Intel moved on to the 14nm process.  “Haswell was a great desktop product in many respects, and then things started to change when Intel moved to 14nm,” said David Kanter, an analyst with the Linley Group research company. “The process was more geared to improving low power operation instead of maxing out peak performance. “The 14nm process that brought us Broadwell really did great things for mobile, and it was pretty good for servers, but the high-end desktop wasn’t super impressive.” Skylake followed in the traditional “tock” cycle, but the benefits were less pronounced than earlier revisions, and Kanter believes the company ran out of headroom when it needed to release another upgrade on the same production process. “It’s the third generation, and the problem is that Intel’s planning cycles are long and it didn’t have the option to redesign the CPU and make it faster because of the development cycles,” he said.  Diverted focus While technical issues have played a part in the arrested development of top-end desktop chips, there are good reasons why Intel has chosen to focus on other areas of its business.  Research figures for 2016 released by research companies IDC and Gartner both highlighted that PC sales had shrunk for the fifth year in a row, and within this dwindling market, laptops continue to far outsell desktops. That’s reflected in the improvements made to the processors. “If you look at client PCs, really the vast majority of them are laptops, and there the design considerations are very different,” said Hung. “Power efficiency and video-encoding performance are much more important than raw CPU performance.” Kanter agrees that Intel is merely following the money trail. “For consumers, the high-end desktop chip is still between $400 and $1,000 and that’s probably going to stay the same,” said Kanter. “Gamers will pay that, but the issue is how often do they upgrade and how much are they going to spend on their CPU? “Intel is a tech powerhouse, but it’s also focused on the bottom line. The data centre market is more lucrative than the high-end gaming market.” One-horse race Another reason Intel hasn’t been pushing the performance barriers is that it doesn’t have to: there’s no credible competitor forcing the company to up its game. Intel’s biggest rival, AMD, has lately switched its focus to GPUs – although it is set to challenge Intel on the desktop once more with its Ryzen chips later this year. Experts say that Intel has effectively been competing with itself for a number of years. “If Intel can produce something that’s really amazing and all of a sudden PC buyers want to upgrade every three years instead of every five, that moves the whole market, and that’s more important to Intel than what AMD is doing,” said Kanter. And despite promising early benchmark results from Ryzen, AMD is not expected to challenge Intel on high-end performance. “The world is waiting to see what frequencies the Ryzen gets, because if AMD can come in with a noticeably better frequency and better per-core performance that would be really surprising,” said Kanter.  “My expectation is that it will come in with something that looks roughly competitive with Ivy Bridge or Haswell, so maybe 20% behind, and at a competitive price – although AMD has been keeping its cards close to its chest.”  Either way, analysts believe that Intel will remain the dominant presence on the desktop for some time. “The desktop market is still significant and it’s important to Intel because it’s a very high-margin business and there will be some high-performance features,” said Hung. “I don’t see Intel stepping away from desktops in the near future.”  Related Articles MacOS Beta code points to new Kaby Lake models Review: Intel 600p SSD 512GB Intel's Optane aims to give hard drives the speed of SSDs Alien Covenant teaser reveals possible AMD Ryzen-powered Surface Pro 5 Intel announces first 3D XPoint-powered Octane SSD Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority, nextmedia Pty Ltd Copyright © Alphr, Dennis Publishing See more about:  david kanter  |  intel  |  kaby lake  |  performance  |  processors   Tweet Email this Print this Feedback   Readers of this article also read...   Linux Commands: The most useful ones you'll need     Get the Windows 10 Creators Update right now     Play retro games on your Android device with these excellent emulators     Review: Benq Zowie XL2540 e-Sports monitor     Samsung Galaxy S8 vs iPhone 7: Which phone should you opt for?   More in Atomic (1 of 10 articles) NEWS Palit's new GTX 1080 Ti GameRock video card goes quad-fan << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (2 of 10 articles) FEATURE Stop the clocks: has Intel run dry on the desktop? << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (3 of 10 articles) NEWS New Android OS blocks ransomware using system-type windows << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (4 of 10 articles) NEWS Ryzen 3 processor specs leak online << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (5 of 10 articles) NEWS AMD's Radeon 5-series cards pop up online << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (6 of 10 articles) NEWS New AMD Radeon drivers boost Oculus and SteamVR support << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (7 of 10 articles) NEWS MSI doubles down on RGB lighting with Mystic Light Sync << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (8 of 10 articles) REVIEW One Minute Review: Asus ROG Spatha gaming mouse << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (9 of 10 articles) NEWS The HTC Vive just got $US100 cheaper - and a lot better << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> More in Atomic (10 of 10 articles) REVIEW Review: ASRock Fatal1ty H270 Performance motherboard << Prev Next >> View all Atomic articles >> Most Read Most Discussed Powered by Disqus Latest Comments Powered by Disqus Latest Competitions   Win!!!

Introduction, value and design 2. Performance, battery life and verdict Our Verdict Between the screen that bounces with each touch and a housing that feels hollow, the price tag doesn’t match the build quality of the LG gram 13 despite its incredible battery life. For Fantastic battery life Fast fingerprint sensor Thin screen bezels Against Weird fingerprint sensor placement Awkward camera placement Build quality doesn’t match price With portable and powerful laptops priced below the psychological barrier of $1,000 now somewhat of a commodity, the premium segment is one where a device has to live up to its price tag. Typically, manufacturers set themselves apart from the pack with design, and unique features (fingerprint unlock, excellent battery life, etc.).  The LG gram 13 we reviewed costs much less than Apple’s 12-inch MacBook and comparably to Dell’s XPS 13. On the spec sheet, the gram 13 is more similar to Dell’s offering than Apple’s MacBook, having far fewer ports and a different class of processor (Intel Core i5 for LG vs. Intel Core m5 for Apple). That said, we find that the LG gram 13 struggles to live up to that four-digit price point, especially when stacked against comparably-priced Ultrabooks. Spec Sheet Here is the LG gram 13 configuration sent to TechRadar for review:  CPU: 2.5GHz Intel Core i5 -7200U (3MB cache, up to 3.1GHz) Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 620 RAM: 8GB DDR4 (2133MHz) Screen: 13.3-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) IPS LCD touchscreen Storage: 256GB SSD Ports: HDMI, 2 x USB 3.0, USB 3.0 Type-C, microSD reader, headphone/mic jack Connectivity: Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 8265; Bluetooth 4.1 Camera: 1.3 megapixel camera Weight: 2.07 pounds (921g) Size: 12.1 x 8.3 x 0.6 inches (307 x 211 x 15cm; W x D x H) Price, availability and value LG currently sells two variations of the LG gram 13. One version  – the version we received – has a touchscreen, while the other variant comes in white and lacks a touchscreen and fingerprint sensor. The touchscreen version costs $1,099 (about £885, AU$1,465), with the touch-free model discounted to $999 (about £804, AU$1331).  We were unable to find any models with improved specs or the option to personalize the LG gram 13’s internals.  Furthermore, out of the US, UK, and AU LG web stores, the LG gram 13 was only listed in the US store. The good news is that LG uses third-party sites, such as Amazon or B&H Photo to fulfill orders of the gram 13. In other words, if you live in a country where LG doesn’t expressly offer the gram 13, you can try to order through another seller.  As for whether you should, well, we’ve found comparably-priced laptops with far stronger build quality (but not better battery life) than what’s on display here – we’ll just say that for now. Design LG touts that the exterior of the gram 13 as made of a “nano carbon magnesium alloy;” a metal compound that feels more like plastic than the aluminum shell competing higher-end laptops typically use, but also tends to be lighter. With the lid closed, the gram 13 measures a mere 0.6 inches (15.24 mm) tall at its thickest point. On the right side of the laptop is where you find a microSD card reader, headphone/mic jack, and a USB 3.0 port.  The left side of the laptop is home to the charging port, another USB 3.0 port, a full HDMI port, and a USB 3.0 Type-C port. Additionally, this is where you can find two indicator lights – one a charging indicator, the other a hard drive activity light.  With the lid open, the first thing you’ll notice is a black rectangle in the upper-left corner of the trackpad. Admittedly, at first we thought the rectangle was yet another sticker – such as the “Powered by Intel” decal or Energy Star assurances – we would have to remove. After a few seconds, however, we quickly realized it was the fingerprint sensor. It’s an odd place for one, considering you’re not likely to scan your finger as often as you’ll use the tracking surface for everything else. It doesn’t get in the way, per se, but we found ourselves ignoring the upper left portion of the trackpad altogether.  Just above the keyboard, lodged into the laptop hinge, is a 1.3-megapixel webcam, relocated from the more traditional location of above the display. By moving the camera down, LG was able to use smaller bezels to on the sides and top of the screen. The same, unfortunately, can’t be said about the bezel below the screen.   In total, the gram 13 weighs 2.07 pounds – or 939 grams, if you were curious. It’s incredibly light and doesn’t bog down a backpack as you trek from meeting to meeting or class to class. In comparison, Apple’s MacBook weighs 2.03 pounds (921 grams), while Dell’s XPS 13 weighs 2.7 pounds (1,225 grams).   Fingerprint ID is a fine bonus Setup and use of the gram 13’s fingerprint sensor is similar to that of any modern smartphone with a similar feature – in fact, it closely resembles the process LG uses on its flagship smartphones.  After touching, lifting, and replacing your finger on the sensor, the gram 13 learns your fingerprint and uses Windows Hello to unlock your computer with a touch, instead of a password.  Windows Hello is a convenient way to streamline the login experience, either when switching user accounts or signing in after the gram 13 has been turned off.  We didn’t have any issues with the scanner recognizing a finger, with very little time elapsed between a touch of the fingerprint sensor and the computer unlocking. Muffled speaker placement One design choice we have to question is the location of the stereo speakers on the gram 13. Each speaker is located on either side of the device, with two nondescript ports barely noticeable.  During our testing, the speakers were often muffled or inadvertently covered up when using the gram 13 on a lap, or even by placing an arm next to the side of the unit.  Even when the speaker ports are left unblocked, the sound quality and volume is rather weak and quiet. Listening to music often required a volume setting of 70 or higher just to hear at a comfortable level. 1 2 Current page: Introduction, value and design Next Page Performance, battery life and verdict Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Intel posted the following on their webpage; “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” Intel announced earlier that they would not be sponsoring an IDF event in China this year. It was still expected in the US with a “new format.” Prior to today’s announcement, Intel’s IDF page stated; “We are making changes to the Intel Developer Forum. This fall the event in San Francisco will have a new format and we will not be hosting an event in China. More details to come soon.” It added to “keep checking this page in the middle of March for updates.” No update was made in the middle of March; in fact, “keep checking this page” disappeared with today’s announcement permanently cancelling IDF. IDF was nearly 20 years old and had its origins in the early 1990’s as a quarterly update as a service to their PC customers run by sales staff until 1995 when Intel Corporate decided to pick up the venue as an annual industry wide event. Intel’s business has grown into separate and distinct segments whose management felt that IDF no longer served them as a direct means of communicating their message. The rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, automotive, IoT, and wireless communications diminished the delivery of any direct message emanating from any one group. Intel is now deciding how to find new ways of disseminating information to their respective audiences (media, developers and customers). How the company works through this process is still to be determined. Techeye Take The fact that Intel’s Data Center Group was not happy over the amount of support they provided to other disparate groups at Intel has been an open secret for a least the last couple of years. It is somewhat a surprise that the separation did not occur sooner. Nevertheless, the fact remains that much of what made up IDF is considered to be necessary for the industry financial and strategic technology analysts to understand the company’s Data Center Group’s direction in the Enterprise and Cloud Market segments. But that’s Diane Bryant’s problem now. What is not clear is what Intel has planned to replace something that was working but not in all the right ways to satisfy certain marketing types in messaging their customers, their investors and the industry at large.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Bben unveils Apollo Lake-powered PC stick 04/14/2017 at 11:25 AM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Chinese device maker Bben unveiled a line of tiny computers with Intel Apollo Lake processors at CES in January. This week the company is going even smaller. Notebook Italia caught up with Bben at the Hong Kong Global Sources Exhibition and got an early look at a new PC stick featuring an Intel Celeron N3450 quad-core processor. The PC-on-a-stick has the same basic design as an Intel Compute Stick, with an HDMI connector built into one end of the miniature computer, allowing you to plug the whole thing straight into the HDMI input on a TV or monitor. This model does appear to be a bit on the chunky side for a PC stick, but it’s still a a fully functional computer in a pocket-sized package. It has two full-sized USB 3.0 ports, a microSD card slot, a headset jack, and a dedicated power jack (unlike some models, this PC stick doesn’t use a USB cable for power). There are also two vents on the back of the device to help keep the system from overheating, and there’s a small fan inside the case. Intel’s N3450 processor is a 1.1 GHz quad-core chip with support for burst speeds up to 2.2 GHz. It has a 6 watt TDP, but should use less power under most circumstances, making it compact, low-power option for turning just about any display into a media center or adding a web browser to your TV. I suppose you could also do some light gaming too, but the Apollo Lake platform is a low-cost, low-power solution, so don’t expect stellar performance on games with bleeding edge graphics. This sort of PC stick could also be useful in commercial environments, where it can be combined with a variety of displays to create digital signage, point-of-sales, or other commercial or enterprise solutions. Intel currently has no plans to offer a Compute Stick with an Apollo Lake chip. The company’s latest models either feature a lower-power Atom x5 Cherry Trail chip or a more powerful Core M Skylake processor. So it’s up to third-party companies like Bben to offer something in between, like this Celeron-powered model the company is showing off. It’s not available for purchase yet, but some of the company’s other Apollo Lake-powered products are available from the Bben store at AliExpress.

That makes it too expensive for the form factor because most people would go for a cheap i3 laptop or nuc/brix option.

Intel issued an announcement on the IDF website, stating "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers.

The company further elaborated when contacted by Anandtech, stating "With the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive, and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information."

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « A Federal Appeals Court Upheld a Jury Verdict for Apple in a case brought by Conversant | Main April 17, 2017 End of an Era: The Intel Developer Forum (IDF) is Officially Dead   Intel has officially announced the end of their IDF events that covered PC developments that were in the works at Intel. It was an event I rarely ever missed; though admittedly, the IDF events did seem to be a little lost over the last few years and I had stopped covering the event for a lack of real news. In January Patently Apple killed off the "Intel Events" category from our side bar. And yet, it still seems like a loss to officially hear Intel's announcement today. Just as PC's were about to be revived with Apple's modular Mac and Microsoft's new Surface Studio, the company at the epicenter of the PC revolution is admitting that it's no longer a priority.      Intel's announcement states that "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions."   Intel's IDF event that was scheduled for August 15-17 at the Moscone center is now cancelled.   Intel's product focus is moving toward Artificial Intelligence, Smart vehicles, Optane products, the Internet of Things (IoT), communications and so forth. New forms of events will be created and hopefully there will be at least one PC oriented event in the mix. But for now, Intel wants to drop the IDF events so that they can reinvent a new image for the company with emphasis beyond PCs.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

The full statement from Intel reads: Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. An IDF event planned for China was recently cancelled so it's not a huge shock that the main event, that was planned for San Francisco, has been canned as well. Apple pulled their participation in the annual Macworld Expo a few years ago, probably because the event forced them into having to make a product announcement on someone else's schedule. Perhaps Intel found themselves in a similar position, having to come up with something exciting for a conference schedule. While a website is a useful resource, I really like attending conferences as you get to meet a lot of people you otherwise would never bump into. And while online forums go some way to doing that, there's something about having to share a table with a total stranger where a conversation is struck that makes conference networking much more fun.

NEWS CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE PEOPLE CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH CLOUD BIG DATA APPS EMERGING TECH INFRASTRUCTURE Wikibon TheCUBE ABOUT US SIGN IN Home » NEWS Farewell to the Intel Developer Forum, and the primacy of the PC by KYT DOTSON UPDATED 14:51 EST . 17 APRIL 2017 In a final admission that the personal computer is no longer the center of its universe, Intel Corp. today announced the company will be discontinuing its Intel Developer Forum trade show, including the IDF17 planned for this summer. The announcement appeared on the IDF17 website this morning, replacing previous content with a thank-you to the community and links to community resources. “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward,” the announcement states. “Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum!” In recent years, Intel has held two annual developer forum events, one in San Francisco and one in China. The event in China had already been canceled and now the San Francisco event, and all events going forward, will also be no more. The Intel Developer Forum started in 1997, with China being added to the schedule in 2007. Each year, IDF has been used to showcase Intel’s products and designs, while giving developers and engineers a chance to preview and get hands-on knowledge of upcoming and current research. In 2015, Intel brought developer kits for products such as Razer’s OSVR headset, which uses Intel’s RealSense 3D camera; sensor-equipped BMX bikes; wireless gigabit charging technology; and even bionic arms. In 2016, Intel showcased Project Alloy, a wireless all-in-one virtual reality headset, amid other developments. In previous years, IDF was also the announcement platform for Intel’s big chip designs such as Skylake and Kaby Lake. But the upshot is that the traditionally computer- and processor-focused conference no longer serves to emphasize the new technologies and industries Intel is now focused on. Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said that while the move may come as a surprise to industry veterans and while it “may signal an issue,” he believes that there is no reason to be concerned about Intel. “Intel has diversified their business where it may make more sense for them to hit industry specific shows,” Moorhead told SiliconANGLE, “or hold their own shows covering automobile technology, IIoT, AI and of course, PCs and servers.” With Intel’s change in strategy and the ever-increasing developer interest across a tremendous variety of expanding services — from virtual reality, artificial intelligence and machine learning, Internet of Things, automotive, storage and so forth — focusing more on individual industries would give developers more breathing room. The loss of IDF as an annual event, however, certainly removes a major platform that Intel used in the past to announce products and focus attention from a central space. At the same time, it opens up the opportunity for more events that will provide deeper dives into Intel’s products, partners and services without needing to split up time among totally different industries.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Intel cancels entire Developer Forum program ahead of this summer’s IDF17 04/17/2017 at 11:42 AM by Brad Linder 1 Comment After nearly two decades, chip maker Intel has decided to scrap its annual Intel Developer Forum conference. The news was posted to the IDF17 website, despite the fact that the company had previously planned to hold an event in San Francisco from August 15th through August 17th. In recent years Intel had actually held two annual IDF events: one in San Francisco and one in China. This year’s Chinese event had already been canceled, but now it looks like the San Francisco event is off as well… forever. While it looks like IDF is done, Intel is directing developers to its Resource and Design Center website for more information about building hardware and software for use with Intel products. The company will also continue to make announcements at other tradeshows and hold it own smaller events throughout the year, focused on specific product categories. Intel says the move comes as the company is moving away from a focus primarily on PCs to one that is producing a wider range of products including automotive technologies, Internet of Things products, wireless communications, artificial intelligence, and storage, among other things. I guess the idea is that it’s hard to cover everything in a single event when attendees may only be interested in a subset of those things. IDF may have been aimed at developers, but Intel also had a habit of announcing new products including the company’s latest chip technologies, virtual reality technology like Project Alloy, or storage products like the recently-launched Intel Optane memory solution. But Intel doesn’t necessarily save all of its announcements for IDF: the company often holds big press events at CES, Computex, and other industry events throughout the year. via AnandTech Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 1 Comment on "Intel cancels entire Developer Forum program ahead of this summer’s IDF17" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Intel announce that it is ending the upcoming and all future IDF gatherings. This move comes after Intel announced earlier this year that it would cancel its IDF China expo. Intel broke the news on its official website for IDF 2017, writing: Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. The first IDF took place way back in 1997, with major events primarily held in San Francisco, along with locations around the globe over the years including Tokyo, Japan and Munich, Germany. Over the past decade, Beijing, China and Taipei, Taiwan have been lynchpins for Intel’s global IDF outreach. This is definitely sobering news, as we always enjoy visiting the Moscone Center in San Francisco to see all of Intel’s latest wares. Last year at IDF, Intel gave us a demo of [the then upcoming] Kaby Lake architecture; something that is rather “old hat” these days after countless product announcements. The company also trotted out its fully-contained Euclid RealSense PC for robots, and even debuted its 100Gbps Silicon Photonics transceiver module among other announcements from its various hardware partners. Of course, we as tech enthusiasts also enjoy the not-for-public-viewing, closed door sessions where we get one-on-one time with Intel engineers and unreleased products in the pipeline (along with AMD’s off-site antics that usually take place during IDF). There’s no doubt that one of the most anticipated products that many expected to see on full display at IDF 2017 was Intel’s upcoming Cannon Lake architecture. Earlier this year at CES, confirmed that the 10 nanometer processors would begin shipping later this year. Faster. Smaller. Better. Introducing Intel's Cannon Lake, the world's first 10nm product, shipping before end of 2017. #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/FgKA8w9PNI— Intel (@intel) January 5, 2017 Cannon Lake represents Intel’s first major die shrink for its mainstream processors since Broadwell came onto the scene in 2014. In February, Intel claimed that its 8th generation Cannon Lake architecture will offer roughly a 15 percent performance boost in SysMark over a comparable Kaby Lake SKU. More recently, however, the company stated that we can expect up to a 25 percent boost in performance over Kaby Lake with a 45 percent reduction in power consumption. Intel also claims that its 10nm technology is a full generation ahead of its competitors, while offering manufacturing costs the are 30 percent lower.

Shares Takuya Oikawa via Flickr. Click for original. (Image: © Takuya Oikawa via Flickr) Well, this is a bit of a surprise—Intel today announced that it has ended its Intel Developer Forum program, effective immediately. That includes the cancellation of IDF17, which was scheduled for mid-August in San Francisco. Intel made the announcement in a brief statement posted to its IDF website. "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward," the announcement reads. "Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions." There are no other details associated with Intel's decision to pull the plug on IDF. Though surprising after all these years—the first IDF took place in 1997—the move is not completely out of left field. Intel previously said it would not hold an IDF event in China this year, and that the fall event in San Francisco would have a new format. The company promised more details to come. Intel has been making announcements both big and small at its IDF events throughout the years. Sometimes Intel would talk about technologies it was working on, and other times it would use these events as launch pads for CPU products, such as Kaby Lake. Where Intel goes from here is anyone's guess. It seems unlikely that the company would not replace IDF with something else, perhaps an event that doesn't take place twice a year. But what that is and what organization will host it is something we'll have to wait and see.

Intel told Anandtech during a phone call that the main reason it cancelled the event was that it has been changing rapidly over the past three years or so, especially as they transition from a PC-centric to a data-centric company. Elaborating a bit more, the rep said that with the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, they felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information. As such, they’ve decided to communicate with the media, developers and other companies via targeted events. Such gatherings could include things like the recent AI Day or Manufacturing Day, be connected to partner events or even consist of separate geocentric events. Intel hosted its first developer forum way back in 1997. Since 2013, they’ve held one IDF event in China in the spring followed by another event in the summer / fall in San Francisco. As was the case with Comdex, it’s sad to see industry staples like this go. Speaking from experience with shows like CES, there’s simply no substitute for live events in which you get to bump shoulders with people you work with throughout the year (the networking opportunities are priceless as well). Hopefully Intel keeps its word and moves forward with targeted events to replace IDF.

Thus far, it's produced a lot of red ink. Cloudera set its preliminary IPO price on Monday at $12 to $14 a share, well below half of Intel's May 2014 purchase price of $30.92. All told, Intel invested $766.5 million in Cloudera, a stake that at the high end of the IPO range would be worth $348.2 million. Had the chipmaker just buried that cash in the S&P 500, it would now be worth about $925 million. Founded in 2008, Cloudera is one of several Silicon Valley companies that's commercializing an open source programming framework called Hadoop, which helps businesses process large amounts of disparate data. Intel invested in Cloudera as part of a strategic partnership at a time when private market valuations for hot start-ups were in the stratosphere. Hortonworks, Cloudera's top competitor, went public in December 2014, and has since gotten pummeled, dropping from $16 a share at its debut to $10.67 at Monday's close. Cloudera's pricing "is largely due to Hortonworks' discounted valuation levels and growing perceived risk from public cloud players, such as Amazon and Google," wrote Rohit Kulkarni, managing director and head of research at SharesPost. At $14 a share, Cloudera would be worth $1.79 billion, down from $4.1 billion when Intel invested. Cloudera is also burning cash as it ramps up spending to reach large prospective customers. While revenue in the fiscal year ended January climbed 57 percent to $261 million, the company spent over $200 million on sales and marketing, resulting in a net loss of $187.3 million. Intel could still make money on its Cloudera bet if it holds on to its shares and the stock rallies following the offering. And while a loss of a few hundred million dollars would sink many venture funds, Intel has a healthy $17.1 billion in cash on its balance sheet.

For nearly 20 years IDF has brought together developers, technologists, inventors and makers to shape future innovations. Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. The first IDF was in 1997 and for the first decade there was usually a Spring IDF and a Fall IDF. Then in 2007 the spring IDF that was traditionally hosted in San Francisco was moved to China to emphasize the importance of China in the technology market. Intel was supposed to be making a format change this year and the event in China was canceled, so we all knew something was up. Intel Ended The Tick-Tock Model in 2016 Intel used to use IDF to announced annual architecture changes and refreshes, but with the Intel tick-tock model dead and the product cycle including more and more optimizations the need for an IDF isn’t as strong as it once was. Intel Developer Forum 2013 It appears that Intel is one again moving away from being a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. Intel’s Chief Strategy Officer, Aicha Evans is responsible for Intel’s long-term strategy to transform the company and this decision was likely approved by her and of course Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. Aicha Evans – Credit: Intel Corporation It looks like Intel will be saving key announcements for CES, Computex, and other industry events throughout the year now that IDF is gone. We’ll certainly miss IDF as it was an exciting show to cover and something that we’ve attended annually for nearly 15 years straight.

On Monday, Intel said it would no longer hold the IDF gathering. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 17, 2017 at 3:06 pm | UPDATED: April 17, 2017 at 3:13 pm SANTA CLARA — The Intel faithful won’t be gathering together in the summer any more. Intel said Monday it was pulling the plug on the Intel Developer Forum, better known as IDF,  which has recently been held annually at San Francisco’s Moscone Center. Officially, Intel said in a statement on its website that it would “retire the IDF program moving forward.” Related Articles Biz Break: Intel says, ‘Goodbye’ to the annual IDF conference Intel security costs rose after CEO, other execs got threats over diversity push McAfee spins off from Intel In an effort to placate potential IDF attendees who may have been planning on going to this year’s gathering, Intel said that the company “has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers.” Agnes Kwan, an Intel spokeswoman, said IDF wasn’t canceled because of a drop in the conference’s popularity. Last year’s IDF had more than 6,000 attendees, but Kwan said putting IDF to rest comes as Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich has pushed the company into areas beyond its longtime core PC business. “Our CEO has been talking about Intel no longer being a PC-centric company, but a data-centric one,” Kwan said. “We are in areas like AI (artificial intelligence), VR (virtual reality) and IOT (intenet of things). Wherever there is data, you will see us there.” Intel’s canceling of IDF, while a surprise to many, comes as the company has pulled back from some of its traditional conference sponsorships. Since last year, Intel has said it wouldn’t hold its 2017 IDF event in China, and in February, the company dropped its support for the International Science and Engineering Fair. Intel also said it would no longer lend its name to the national Science Talent Search, one of the country’s biggest programs for encouraging high school students to get involved in science-based education. “We have a new audience that validates our portfolio,” Kwan said. “We are looking into more and different events to get our message across such as industry conferences.” Intel is the second big-name Bay Area tech company to turn the lights off on its annual San Francisco meeting of developers. In February, Apple said it was dumping the Moscone Center, which had been home to its yearly Worldwide Developers Conference since 2003, in favor of the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, which lasted hosted Apple’s developers gathering in 2002.   Tags:  Intel Rex Crum Rex Crum is the senior web editor for the business section for The Mercury News and Bay Area News Group.

On Monday, Intel said it would no longer hold the IDF gathering. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | PUBLISHED: April 17, 2017 at 3:06 pm | UPDATED: April 17, 2017 at 3:13 pm SANTA CLARA — The Intel faithful won’t be gathering together in the summer any more. Intel said Monday it was pulling the plug on the Intel Developer Forum, better known as IDF,  which has recently been held annually at San Francisco’s Moscone Center. Officially, Intel said in a statement on its website that it would “retire the IDF program moving forward.” Related Articles Biz Break: Intel says, ‘Goodbye’ to the annual IDF conference Intel security costs rose after CEO, other execs got threats over diversity push McAfee spins off from Intel In an effort to placate potential IDF attendees who may have been planning on going to this year’s gathering, Intel said that the company “has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers.” Agnes Kwan, an Intel spokeswoman, said IDF wasn’t canceled because of a drop in the conference’s popularity. Last year’s IDF had more than 6,000 attendees, but Kwan said putting IDF to rest comes as Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich has pushed the company into areas beyond its longtime core PC business. “Our CEO has been talking about Intel no longer being a PC-centric company, but a data-centric one,” Kwan said. “We are in areas like AI (artificial intelligence), VR (virtual reality) and IOT (intenet of things). Wherever there is data, you will see us there.” Intel’s canceling of IDF, while a surprise to many, comes as the company has pulled back from some of its traditional conference sponsorships. Since last year, Intel has said it wouldn’t hold its 2017 IDF event in China, and in February, the company dropped its support for the International Science and Engineering Fair. Intel also said it would no longer lend its name to the national Science Talent Search, one of the country’s biggest programs for encouraging high school students to get involved in science-based education. “We have a new audience that validates our portfolio,” Kwan said. “We are looking into more and different events to get our message across such as industry conferences.” Intel is the second big-name Bay Area tech company to turn the lights off on its annual San Francisco meeting of developers. In February, Apple said it was dumping the Moscone Center, which had been home to its yearly Worldwide Developers Conference since 2003, in favor of the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, which lasted hosted Apple’s developers gathering in 2002.   Tags:  Intel Rex Crum Rex Crum is the senior web editor for the business section for The Mercury News and Bay Area News Group.

"Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward.," said the company on its IDF website. "Intel has a number of resources available on Intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions." The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Intel also canceled its flagship Intel Developer Forum show in China. [Related: 20 Mind-Blowing Products At The Intel Developer Forum] Intel has typically launched new products, including Client Compute processors like Skylake and Kaby Lake, at the Intel Developer Forum. But the company in an interview with Anandtech said that the change is in part due to Intel is not as PC-centric as it used to be, and has a wider range of products – including IoT modules and microcontrollers, Optane storage and FPGAs. That was certainly true during last year's show, where the company introduced an array of products – from its Joule platform, which was a module built for IoT applications, to its Knowledge Builder Toolkit, which enables developers to create intelligent sensing applications that run directly on Intel’s low-power Curie module solution for wearables. Kent Tibbils, vice president of marketing at ASI, a Fremont, Calif.-based Intel system builder, said that the cancellation of Intel Developer Forum "is not completely surprising" given the changes overall at the company. "Using IDF, which had a set yearly time schedule for big product announcements, seems challenging as most new technologies like Kaby Lake and Optane were already well known long before IDF," he said. "Intel’s always used IDF to show how their technologies are powering other devices, other user experiences, and creating new markets so it may be more of a timing issue for the launch of new technologies as well as an audience reach consideration." Moving forward, Intel told Anandtech, the company will instead have a greater variety of smaller, "targeted" events, as opposed to one broad conference. Tibbils said the cancellation of the event might help solution providers tighten their focus in vertical markets, if Intel were to host specialized conferences for various vertical markets and specific products. For instance, said Tibbils, if Intel wants to highlight their technologies in the auto industry then it would make sense to focus on events that already target that market as opposed to trying to attract those different groups to IDF. "With Intel technologies being used as well as targeted at so many markets, new and traditional, I think it could be difficult to leverage IDF as a large scale product announcement event," said Tibbils. "I do think Intel needs events but not necessarily their own. They will obviously participate in events that have established audiences for the vertical they are working with."   Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article Slide Shows Tech 10: Cool Products To Transform The Modern Workplace Into A Mobile One This month's Tech 10 looks at the latest mobile devices that are carving big roles in the enterprise. 15 Cool IoT Security Startups That Are Keeping Connected Devices Safe Customers are increasingly concerned about the security of their Internet of Things devices.

 Intel cancels its biggest event of the year as the world moves past the PC Matt Weinberger Apr. 17, 2017, 5:05 PM 12,949 facebook linkedin twitter email print Intel CEO Brian Krzanich .David Becker/Getty Images Microprocessor supergiant Intel has discontinued the Intel Developers Forum (IDF), its annual mega-conference in San Francisco, citing the difficulties of getting across a unified message as it moves past just powering PCs into a bold new future. The cancellation of IDF was first reported by Anandtech and confirmed by a post on the event website. This year's IDF was originally supposed to be held from August 15th through the 17th. Earlier in 2017, Intel had announced that its annual IDF conference in China would not be held this year.  Historically, IDF is where the company makes new product announcements, including the unveiling of new processors. Now, Intel tells Anandtech, the idea is that the company is moving beyond just focusing on PCs and servers, and into new areas like self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, or the so-called "Internet of Things," and it's a lot to fit all of that into one event. And so, an Intel spokesperson tells Business Insider, the company will be looking to host smaller, more focused events, as well as increasing its presence at trade shows and other events.  And while the Intel Developers Forum was still on the events calendar for San Francisco's Moscone Conference Center, where the conference was historically held, at the time of publication, Intel says that this cancellation has been in the works for some time as the company revamps its events strategy.  So as much as anything, you can take the discontinuation of IDF as another victim of the PC market, which has been shrinking for five years straight now, and another sign of Intel trying to reinvent itself under those circumstances.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing It’s the end of an era as Intel cancels its Intel Developer Forum, effective immediately It’s the end of an era as Intel cancels its Intel Developer Forum, effective immediately By Joel Hruska on April 17, 2017 at 2:37 pm Comment Twenty years ago, Intel began holding an event it referred to as the Intel Developer Forum. The purpose of the conference was to showcase the future of the computer industry from Intel’s perspective, with information on topics ranging from future DRAM support and chipset features, to demos of new Intel CPUs or major product initiatives the company intended to debut. Technologies like Optane, Broadwell 14nm benchmarks, Intel’s Quark CPU, Thunderbolt, the Pentium 4 Northwood, and RDRAM all debuted at or were discussed heavily at various IDF meetings for the last two decades. Today, all of that comes to a close. A short message posted to the IDF 2017 board states: Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. We shall never again see Charlie Demerjian, of SemiAccurate, in a full bunny suit asking questions at an Intel event. Intel had previously announced that it would not hold an IDF this year in China, but had stated that the event would have a “new format” in San Francisco. Intel will probably hold some kind of press events and unveils in the future, but these conventions obviously no longer map cleanly to the company’s extended product introduction cycles. In the old days, Intel would move its products to new process nodes fairly quickly, and those chips would launch in fairly short order once the new nodes were ready. Now, we see a different pattern. New nodes are only introduced after several “+” iterations (14nm, 14nm+, 14nm++, etc). Intel recently released more information on their 10nm process; the slides below detail the improvements the company has made, but also show how 14nm++ is expected to offer higher performance than the initial run of 10nm, at least as far as desktops are concerned. This drawn out schedule may be part of why we’re seeing a shift to different timing and events. One possibility, therefore, is that Intel has decided IDF no longer fits its needs because it doesn’t really launch desktop or mobile parts the way it used to. With that said, the point of IDF was always the “Developers” in the Intel Developer Forum. Other companies used IDF to showcase technology they were developing, from next-gen platforms, to low-cost OLPC-like systems back in 2008 and 2009, to MIDs (remember those?), to Thunderbolt. Intel also used the conference to talk about new hardware features with associated instruction sets or capabilities (think SSE, AVX, and so on). This information will obviously still be disclosed, but in a different way or conference. Presumably Intel will announce some kind of replacement event at some point, but for now, IDF as we knew it is headed for the great bit bucket in the sky.

IDF started off in 1997 as a small event in Palm Springs, California. The show was later moved to San Francisco and vastly expanded during a boom in the PC market. [ Get the scoop on the internet of things at its most fundamental level and find out where it's headed, in InfoWorld's downloadable PDF and ePub. | Pick up the latest insight on the tech news that matters from InfoWorld's Tech Watch blog. ] But with the PC market slowing down, the attraction of IDF has also dwindled. Intel's future isn't tied to PCs but instead to areas like data centers, autonomous cars, modems, the internet of things, and manufacturing.  Last year, IDF events were held in San Francisco and Beijing, and neither will happen this year. An event was scheduled this year from Aug. 15 to 17 in San Francisco, according to a calendar for Moscone Convention Center, but it has been canceled. In lieu of IDF, Intel will instead hold small events, workshops, and participate in trade shows to highlight its technologies and connect with customers. Intel has a big presence every year at shows like CES, Computex, and Mobile World Congress. Apple iPhone launches in the past have upstaged IDF San Francisco. From 2012 to 2014, iPhone launches around the time of IDF became the main topic of conversation on the show floor. In 2011, IDF clashed with Microsoft's Build Conference being held in Anaheim, Calif., and Windows 8, Windows RT, and ARM chips were part of the conversation at Intel's show. To avoid a clash with Apple's iPhone launches and other shows like TechCrunch Disrupt, Intel eventually moved IDF to mid-August in 2015.  Major PC, chip, and datacenter announcements were a staple of the show, but such announcements have dwindled in the last few years.   Over the final years, IDF started losing its technical edge and became more of a marketing vehicle for the company as it expanded into wearables, drones, cool gadgets, and other devices. The company used the show to send a message that it was more than a technology company. Intel in 2013 scrapped a popular third-day opening keynote by former CTO Justin Rattner, who showed off future-looking technologies like a solar-powered PC. It was replaced by keynotes that didn't touch on deep technology. Privately, attendees grumbled that Intel was losing its core audience of engineers and technology specialists with its grand show of cool devices. Intel will be able to connect to developers via trade shows and workshops, which are more targeted, a company spokeswoman said.

Blog :  Chinese Tech Entrepreneur Shares Views on Internet Censorship, Software Piracy Article :  Cybersecurity Ventures Top 50 Security Companies to Watch Intel Kills IDF: Why Traditional Trade Shows and Developers’ Forums Will Eventually Die Rob Enderle |   Unfiltered Opinion   |   Posted 17 Apr, 2017          |         |     Share Intel just killed one of the biggest trade shows in tech, and I think this could be the beginning of a trend. The idea of trade shows predates the internet and, over time, has become something of an ironic tech industry anachronism. It is ironic because the technology that companies like Intel have pioneered, like on-demand web content, video conferencing, streaming, and virtual reality, should make the need to travel to these events unnecessary. But, apparently, even the industry driving the change has proven reticent in making that change itself. Well, Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich just called this out and pulled the plug on one of the biggest vendor-driven technology events in the industry, making me wonder how long it will be before other firms respond, and trade shows and developers’ conferences, at least for the tech segment, become a thing of the past. Let’s talk about the value and opportunity to take the leap away from trade shows and developers’ forums, and into something better. Trade Shows: Amazon vs. Pressing the Flesh One of the foundational elements to trade shows is the sales opportunities. Most of them are thinly disguised efforts to sell hardware, software, and services, and I expect these will be the types of shows that will be the slowest to die. This is because there remains a fundamental belief that to move a lot of products, you need face-to-face interaction. Amazon is the counterpoint to this and the supporting example. While Amazon and its service arm AWS have largely operated without direct contact, at scale Amazon’s AWS has its own customer conference, AWS Summit, and apparently, it is doing just fine. So, at least for the rest of this decade, conferences focused on connecting customers of large systems to vendors are likely to continue to flourish. Those focused on smaller products in volume will likely become harder to justify as online contact methods take their place. Smaller companies have generally found it better to use services like Indiegogo and Kickstarter (and Amazon itself) to get to customers en masse and, as Amazon has grown, often money spent promoting a product directly has a better chance of growing sales volume than an investment in a show like CES. Many of the larger firms have moved out of that show already and it remains the strongest in the consumer electronics segment. Developers’ Conferences IDF is more of a developers’ conference than a trade show, though there are sales elements. This is a category I’ve personally struggled with because developers tend to move to platforms where they are likely to find customers or where they have been given incentives. A show the size of IDF uses a lot of resources and if those resources were instead focused on target incentives, you might be able move critical developers to your platform more assuredly. More important, a show is an event tied in advance to a point in time and often both the information being provided and the needs of the developers aren’t tied to that same time period. This means that shows like this can be both premature and late. A far better way to engage them in a timely way would likely be to push them to online services and co-fund online and traditional educational services (colleges and universities) so the training is more timely and complete. The irony with developer events is that, typically, the platforms that most need them are those that are emerging, but the related companies normally have neither the funding nor the initial interest with developers to make them work. Once a platform is as well penetrated as Intel’s, the need drops, but the firm can afford the event, creating a weird cart-and-horse dilemma where, if you have both, you may no longer need either. Virtualization One other change needs to be pointed out that goes to why Intel is likely the trail blazer here. Virtualization technology that decouples the hardware and the software makes it hard to justify developing directly for the hardware anyway. A smart developer may simply decide to develop for the hypervisor, so justifying developing directly on Intel becomes far more difficult. Even Microsoft has announced it is moving to a hardware platform independent strategy. So, Intel’s money would likely be far better spent assuring it works best with the leading hypervisors because that, not having direct contact with developers, will provide it with the strongest sustained competitive advantage. Wrapping Up: Changes Tons of changes are coming to the technology market. An adage says that when faced with massive change, your choices are to lead, follow, get out of the way or die. Yes, I added that last. Apparently, Krzanich has decided to lead. It is a risky strategy, but leading generally is, and Intel has always been a poor follower. The other two choices should be unacceptable to any company of Intel’s size and scope. Finally, as Intel moves to more and more autonomous systems, there is a real opportunity to showcase interaction with developers using these systems. I expect we’ll see Intel blaze that trail shortly as well. That could be an ideal showcase for Project Alloy.  Just saying.

The conference took place at multiple locations around the world each year and focused on Intel’s products. Intel’s announcement today unfortunately ends a 20 year run for the show, which started way back in 1997. This seems to be one of those “effective immediately” type announcements, with Intel stating that IDF17 – which was originally scheduled for August in San Francisco – will no longer be happening. Intel’s IDF homepage has been replaced with the following statement on the matter: Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. That doesn’t really give us a clue into why Intel has decided to stop hosting IDF, but the company went more into depth with AnandTech. Noting that its focus has grown to include industries like IoT, AI, and automotive in recent years, Intel says that it no longer thinks one conference is enough to cover anything. Instead, Intel will look to discuss and announce its products at multiple events throughout the year. So, while it’s the end of IDF, it’s not necessarily the end of Intel-hosted conferences. Still, it’s a sad day for many who have attended IDF throughout the years, so here’s hoping that whatever Intel does to replace it is just as useful to the community.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Intel Shutterstock photo Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the June 2018 expiration for INTC. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $28 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.01. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.6% return against the $28 commitment, or a 3.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ). Selling a put does not give an investor access to INTC’s upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Intel Corp sees its shares decline 21.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $26.99 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.01 from $28), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.1% annualized rate of return. Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the June 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Intel Corp (Symbol: INTC) looking to boost their income beyond the stock’s 3.1% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $40 strike and collecting the premium based on the $1.18 bid, annualizes to an additional 2.9% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 5.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $40 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but INTC shares would have to climb 12.7% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 16% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called. The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Intel Corp, highlighting in green where the $28 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $40 strike in red: The chart above, and the stock’s historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Intel Corp (considering the last 251 trading day INTC historical stock prices using closing values, as well as today’s price of $35.51) to be 18%. In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 617,795 contracts, with call volume at 1.10M, for a put:call ratio of 0.56 so far for the day. Compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65, that represents high call volume relative to puts; in other words, buyers are showing a preference for calls in options trading so far today.

Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. In past years, IDF served as a rich conduit for new x86-related product announcements, architectural details, and more happenings around Intel, making it one of the can't-miss events of the PC hardware calendar. The Tech Report attended and reported on many an IDF over the years, but it appears that yours truly's experience with the show will begin and end with IDF 2016. In a statement to Anandtech, Intel says that as it broadens its non-PC businesses, a single event like IDF doesn't let it communicate with its various communities the way it wants to. Indeed, the Kaby Lake CPU briefing from last year's event wasn't even officially part of IDF. Instead, it sounds like we'll be getting narrower, more frequent briefings like that Kaby Lake side event and the recent Optane Tech Day so that each new innovation or product gets enough breathing room in the future. Fair enough, we suppose. Still, losing IDF means losing a great opportunity to socialize with Intel employees, partners, and members of the tech press from around the world in one spot, and whatever comes next almost certainly won't fill that hole. Adieu, IDF. Tags: CPUs Miscellaneous Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

It is supposed to be a technical conference for system programmers, application writers and hardware engineers. Well, not no more it ain't: Chipzilla has scrapped the event for good. IDF 2017, due to take place in August, isn't happening. Instead, nerds are invited to check out the documentation on intel.com while the x86 CPU giant focuses on trying to be something other than an x86 CPU giant. Intel held the first get-together in 1997 with a smallish Intel Developer Forum in San Jose, Silicon Valley, close to its headquarters in Santa Clara. As the event expanded it was moved up to the Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco. It also began holding mirror events in China and Taiwan a decade ago, however those were cancelled recently and now the US show is gone too. "Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum!" the chip factory said on its website today. "Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions." Intel can have all the webpages it likes, however IDF was an opportunity to grill Chipzilla's engineers during deep-dive sessions and Q&As – and network with likeminded techies during the event and in the bars and restaurants outside. You could ask for clarifications on instruction sets, performance stats, memory access timings; all the nerdy stuff Intel now finds too tedious, embarrassing or irritating to discuss in public – and would rather you poke it with a stick privately. As well as all that, don't forget: chip rival AMD used IDF to do a bit of guerrilla marketing of its own. One year AMD set up free coffee stalls for delegates at all four corners of the Moscone Center hosting IDF and handed out free t-shirts – a move that enraged Intel staff. AMD was also notorious for setting up briefings for members of the press Intel had flown in from around the world for the show. In recent years, IDF has suffered from Intel's slowing product cycle and a dearth of meaty news. The processor manufacturer is obsessed with restyling itself as anything other than a processor manufacturer in a weird bid to be hip and cool, as if it was ashamed to be a cutting-edge chip assembly line: previous shows have highlighted IoT gizmos, drones, wireless bracelets, and so on, with only quick mentions of its Core family. Too many tech goliaths are doing this today, trying to ditch apparently boring words like "software" and "hardware" and reinvent themselves as digital lifestyle transformation platforms. It's a pity. This hack has been to nearly a dozen IDFs, under three different CEOs, and the shows did still have value, as well as the odd funny moment when product demos failed on stage. And sadly there'll be no more IDF betting pools on how long the keynote speaker would talk before mentioning Moore's so-called law. ® PS: Yeah, we called it Frisco. Fight us.

Twitter Facebook Intel scraps annual IDF event as it looks beyond PCs Don't book your tickets or hotel for this year's Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco Agam Shah (IDG News Service) 18 April, 2017 05:12 - - - - print email Comments After 20 years, Intel is scrapping its marquee annual Intel Developer Forum event, where tech enthusiasts gathered to load up on the chipmaker's news and technologies. IDF started off in 1997 as a small event in Palm Springs, California. The show was later moved to San Francisco and vastly expanded during a boom in the PC market. But with the PC market slowing down, the attraction of IDF has also dwindled. Intel's future isn't tied to PCs but instead to areas like data centers, autonomous cars, modems, the internet of things, and manufacturing. Last year, IDF events were held in San Francisco and Beijing, and neither will happen this year. An event was scheduled this year from Aug. 15 to 17 in San Francisco, according to a calendar for Moscone Convention Center, but it has been canceled. In lieu of IDF, Intel will instead hold small events, workshops, and participate in trade shows to highlight its technologies and connect with customers. Intel has a big presence every year at shows like CES, Computex, and Mobile World Congress. Apple iPhone launches in the past have upstaged IDF San Francisco. From 2012 to 2014, iPhone launches around the time of IDF became the main topic of conversation on the show floor. In 2011, IDF clashed with Microsoft's Build Conference being held in Anaheim, California, and Windows 8, Windows RT, and ARM chips were part of the conversation at Intel's show. To avoid a clash with Apple's iPhone launches and other shows like TechCrunch Disrupt, Intel eventually moved IDF to mid-August in 2015. Major PC, chip, and data-center announcements were a staple of the show, but such announcements have dwindled in the last few years. Over the final years, IDF started losing its technical edge and became more of a marketing vehicle for the company as it expanded into wearables, drones, cool gadgets, and other devices. The company used the show to send a message that it was more than a technology company. Intel in 2013 scrapped a popular third-day opening keynote by former CTO Justin Rattner, who showed off future-looking technologies like a solar-powered PC. It was replaced by keynotes that didn't touch on deep technology. Privately, attendees grumbled that Intel was losing its core audience of engineers and technology specialists with its grand show of cool devices. Intel will be able to connect to developers via trade shows and workshops, which are more targeted, a company spokeswoman said. 7 Habits of the Effective Network Manager More from NetScout Join the Computerworld newsletter!

Going forward, TweakTown was told to expect more events such as Intel's Technology and Manufacturing Day and Intel's Artificial Intelligence Day. Intel also told us to expect a more pronounced presence at events, where we don't typically see Intel, such as SXSW and even the LA Auto Show.   This pronounced shift in Intel's strategy comes on the heels of Intel's latest restructuring announcements. IDF has been one of the staple events of our industry, but it was clear that in the past few years the event had shifted from mostly PC-focused to 5G/IoT/DataCenter/PC/AI/etc. focused. Last IDF, we saw technologies from almost every corner of the industry, three days almost wasn't enough to see everything.   The Intel Developer Forum has been around for almost 20 years, with the first conference taking place in 1997. As a journalist, I am saddened by the news since I have been going to every Fall IDF in San Francisco for more than five years, and it's one of the places where you can get briefed on everything from the latest PCI-E standards to Intel's latest microarchitecture. It's also where multiple products were launched and revealed, such as Skylake and Optane. It was an important event because it brought together Intel engineers and product teams with media, analysts, and Intel's partners in a fun and bright environment. It's one of the more technical events that we attend, and while we are saddened to see it go, we hope that other events can replace it.   The one thing to take away from IDF's cancellation is that Intel wasn't joking about changing company strategy to meet the needs of an ever-changing market.

Peter Bright - Apr 17, 2017 7:03 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 36 Share this story Intel has cancelled its Intel Developer Forum (IDF) developer events. Earlier in the year, the company said that it wasn't going to hold an IDF in China this year, but now even the San Francisco event (which was planned to be held in mid-August) has been scrapped. The announcement was spotted by Anandtech. In the past, Intel has used IDF to launch each year's new processor architecture along with other big product announcements such as Optane non-volatile storage. The difficulties of physics have made it harder for the company to offer an annual architecture refresh, however. Intel has experienced delays in deploying new manufacturing processes and slow, extended rollouts of new chip designs. While the company earlier said that it would not have a Chinese event, the San Francisco IDF was still being planned, albeit with a "new format," in the early months of 2017.  It appears now that this "new format" is in fact "non-existence." Justifying the change, the company told Anandtech that the cancellation occurred because Intel is no longer so heavily PC-centric, with a wider range of products spanning FPGAs, Optane storage, Internet-of-Things microcontrollers, wireless communications, and more. As such, Intel says that it is going to move to a greater variety of smaller, more focused events. Its recent Manufacturing Day event, wherein the company argued that it was keeping Moore's Law alive even in spite of the slowdown in deploying new processes, is an example of this approach. Still, it was useful for attendees to have a diverse range of Intel experts available at a common location at the same time. And even if the company has a wider focus, it feels like a single event could still address these diverse needs through different developer tracks. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

As someone who uses both sides in multiple rigs in my house, nvidia software sucks in many ways. The sheer amount it takes to open with an SSD is absolutely pathetic. The fact many a few of my nvidia gpus ,gtx 950,gtx 650ti boost, do not scale correctly with HDMI on my TV and can not use 1920x1080 wihtout scaling it to the screen, but a geforce 8400 gs works perfectly fine with no scaling. My HD 5770 works perfectly with my TV even with legacy drivers under windows 10. Both sides have issues in different ways. Geforce experience is a pile of forced ****. I have it installed to use game streaming to my phone with limelight. And most of all, gues what, Nvidia is garbage in gpu market except high end. The majority of people spend $250 or less on gpus. They get the job for most. Guru3d users on average are a very small part of the big picture. Open you'r damn eyes and stop being an ignorant fool. andersondiaz Master Guru Posts: 403 Joined: 2004-11-09 #5421139 Posted on: 04/16/2017 09:09 AM I want a Vega with HBM2, because I have a 4k monitor, cant play BF1 with 4k resolution.

Evildead666 Master Guru Posts: 371 Joined: 2003-09-14 #5421181 Posted on: 04/16/2017 01:21 PM Nice to see he got it up to 1400-1500MHz. A good example of what the process change enables in that region. Is Vega the same GCN tech as Polaris, or is it newer ? If its the same, i guesstimated last night, that it should be around 11380 Gflops, which is a tad higher than the 1080Ti (all stock, of course, assuming Vega hits 1500MHz). That would make it in between a 1080, and a 1080Ti in games. The extra memory bandwidth from the HBM might make the difference needed to leap just over the 1080Ti, but then again, there will probably not be much overclocking headroom, whereas the Nvidia, appropriately cooled, will probably get better results. AMD could also give us some watercooling headroom, if they were nice, and help there. edit : I'd forgotten its a new NCU rather than a GCN, so not totally comparable. Should be better than that guess. NewTRUMP Order Newbie Posts: 25 Joined: 2017-02-04 #5421188 Posted on: 04/16/2017 01:47 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Agonist You have serious problem.

The vega line-up which are expected to be released next month will compete with the GTX 1070 & 1080. And no one knows if AMD is going to release a card that'll compete with the 1080 Ti. But if they release cards that outperform the 1070 & 1080, while costing $50 to $100 less, that'll be great.

Yes while you say some stuff about Nvidia is crap like the Geforce experience. If Nvidia mid rage cards were crap like you are claiming then how come they are doing so well that AMD needs do a refresh of their Polaris cards? Nvidia has done some stupid stuff like the 1060 3GB for example. 3 pages 1 2 3 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum. Guru3D.com © 2017

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / Motherboard / Intel 300-series chipsets to provide USB 3.1 Gen2 and Gigabit Wi-Fi Intel 300-series chipsets to provide USB 3.1 Gen2 and Gigabit Wi-Fi Paul Taylor 14 hours ago Motherboard Some features on the upcoming Intel 300-series chipsets have surfaced on Chinese forum Benchlife. The Intel 300-series chipsets are being developed for Intel’s Cannonlake (10nm) and Coffeelake (14nm), the latter of which should pop up in the second half of 2017 in the form of hexacore desktop processors. There doesn’t seem to be anything revolutionary about the chipset, so far (except its support for new CPUs), so we’d call it another incremental improvement on the old formula. According to the info posted on the forum, the Intel 300-series chipsets will provide Intel’s upcoming CPUs with integrated USB 3.1 Gen 2 (10 Gbps data rate) and Gigabit Wi-Fi. It is also widely assumed that the higher-end 300-series chipsets will support a degree of Intel Optane optimization for added functionality. The image above describes the “maximum” feature set for the chipset connectivity, or what we’d expect to see on a ‘Z370’. The table seems to have been picked off a partner presentation and focuses on the connectivity enhancements over the 200-series, including the chip interconnect (DMI Link) which will remain at x4 (or 7.9GB/s). However, we’ll hold off from calling this the sum entirety of the 300-series features. Intel’s Coffee Lake CPUs, the first ones to use these chipsets, should be out on time for the holiday shopping season at the end of the year. KitGuru Says: The leaked slideware seems to hold water, but until Christmas there’s quite a few months ahead of us and additional chipset information may surface. Simply adding USB 3.1 Gen2 and Gigabit Wi-Fi doth not an entire new chipset make.

In an announcement posted on the IDF website, Intel has announced that IDF is no more, and that the entire IDF program is ending. Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions. Previously, Intel had stated that there would not be an IDF in China this year. However an IDF was still expected in the US, albeit with a “new format.” Prior to today’s update, Intel’s IDF page stated the following (as can be seen on this cached copy of the page). We are making changes to the Intel Developer Forum. This fall the event in San Francisco will have a new format and we will not be hosting an event in China. More details to come soon. Meanwhile the official Moscone Center Calendar had (and still has) Intel reserving Moscone West from August 15th through the 17th. IDF has been Intel's yearly home to major product announcements. This has spanned from CPU announcements like Skylake and Kaby Lake, to storage products like Optane, to networking fabrics like Omni-Path. So the cancellation of IDF means that Intel no longer has a (currently scheduled) venue to announce new products and update the public and investors on their plans. Though what's more interesting is how this will affect developers (both presenting and attending), who were the heart and soul of the show. While it seems highly unlikely that Intel is doing away with trade shows and launch events entirely, it’s clear that something is afoot at Intel, and that as a result the traditional IDF is gone. With Intel's product roadmap becoming increasingly elongated and less aligned to a yearly cadence, a yearly tradeshow is obviously a harder event to hold and justify. But what will replace their combination trade show and venue for product announcements remains to be seen. We’ve reached out to Intel for more information, and will update this story if we hear anything further.   Update 13:26 ET (Ian): I just got off the phone with Intel, discussing why IDF is being cancelled. The main reason I was given is that Intel has been changing rapidly over the last two-to-three years, especially as they are changing from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. With the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive, and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information. As a result, the decision has been made to find new ways to communicate with the audience (media, developers and companies) and the ecosystem with targeted events. These will be like the recent AI Day or Manufacturing Day, or be connected to partner events, or involve separate geocentric events. So rather than have one big melee on everything, Intel is set to split its message across several different areas in the hope that it accurately digs deep enough into every area. I was told that Intel wants to find a better way to present the experiences in each of the fields, and this is the way to do that. Personally, I feel the loss of an event like IDF is frustrating. Here was an annual event, usually held around the same time each year, that went deep into how Intel is pushing their portfolio in the PC space. In the last couple of years, the event expanded into IoT and automotive, and attendances kept rising (despite some of the hardware talks being attended by six people - trust me it was a fun talk nonetheless). With Intel deciding to move to a multitude of different events, I can understand the need to focus on specific parts at each event - if you want to deep on AI, hold an AI event; if you want to go deep on cloud computing, hold a Cloud Day. However, this gives Intel more opportunities to have a disconnected message, and not speak as one, especially if a particular event is split based on region. It also makes it harder to plan from our side, because undoubtedly we have to travel to an event at a few weeks notice that might occur the same time as a holiday that was paid for six months ago. IDF ensured regularity - there were keynotes on the important topics, and it was a chance for Intel to lay all the high-end cards on the table (and have everyone there to talk to). As noted, Intel also removed IDF Shenzhen from the event schedule. If Intel now plans to have something like an 'x86 developer conference' and have it held on the same day at different global locations, that only adds to the logistical complexity, and splits the key members of the team giving the talk(s) or answering the questions. Again, I can see Intel's reasoning for wanting to focus given the spectrum of markets it is now moving into, but IDF will be missed.

Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link That was the best joke ever! Reply ddriver - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link Intel has officially lost the plot. Years of CPU barely incremental mediocrity, a new low bar on nvme for the p600, the hypetane fail, the last epic fail AT didn't even reflect - they are now pushing defective desktop parts with failed iGPU as dual channel, 16 PCIE lanes E series, as if the E line wasn't already trashed by Ryzen and it needs to push performance and features even lower. Reply ddriver - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link looks like they are changing horses. But I am not entirely optimistic here, if they failed at the market they have practically wrapped around their finger, what's to expect when entering uncharted territory? Intel is a very big and bloated corporation, the reason it was too late and ultimately failed to gain any sizable market in mobile device platforms. Their "IoT" products are piss poor value regardless of the price point. "AI"? Gonna have a hard time there as well, after their accelerator completely failed to materialize as a GPU, and is pretty much a meh in HPC, they will now try to shove it as a "machine learning" platform. Alas, it's design is fundamentally inefficient in machine learning, which benefits architectures, optimized for maximum throughput of small integers. And not that they can't design such an architecture, however, it is already late to the show and it is not even announced to be in the works. Thus they do what big bloated corporations always do - go for nonsense acquisitions in hope it will materialize in profit or at the very least, relevance. Turning into a "data-centric company" - woot, great news, because we cannot have enough of them private information hoarding, mining and selling to the highest bidder. They are such a benefit to society. Way to go Intel. Also, don't forget to assure us how Moore's law is alive and well. Reply Kevin G - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link Intel's AI accelerator is from their Nervana acquisition, not something that they bought up in-house like Knight's Landing (which came from Larabee's grave). The AI/deep learning focused part is called Knight's Mill and due later this year. Knight's Landing, that is actually doing pretty OK in HPC and Omnipath had a few adopters. They have been rather mediocre on recent desktop releases, Optane hasn't lived up to the hype (and currently mismarketed) and the idea of Kaby Lake in an ethusiast socket is just stupid (and I'm holding out hope that it is just a fake rumor as that is just stupid). The one thing Intel has going for it is Sky Lake-EP and the platform it is built around. On paper it looks to be rather impressive and something they could used as the highight for this year's IDF. Reply JermaineWilliams - Tuesday, April 18, 2017 - link Right. Let's face it, since Intel was awarded the Apple contract, (and Apple stopped using IBM/Motorola PowerPC RISC platform it honestly doesn't even need to advertise. The most recent ads featuring Jim Parsons (Sheldon from Big Bang Theory) are less of an ad and more gloating that "98% of the Cloud runs on intel". It wasn't long ago when we also had Sun/Sparc platforms as well. But it seems Oracle bought SunMicrosystems just to file a Java lawsuit against Android and Google. If you ask me, way too many things in technology are influenced by Apple. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, April 18, 2017 - link Not for long. Intel is about to get trashed even worse in servers than it was trashed in pretty much every aspect where performance matters in desktops. Intel is becoming a hype company, but behind their cockiness hides the fact they don't have anything aside form a huge pile of cash they made on their monopoly, which itself was made on illegal bussiness practices. The move of apple from Power to x86 also coincided with the company's shift from making decent hardware for professionals to making overpriced toys for vain posers. It didn't really made all the difference, considering the macos market share is the measly 5%. In this aspect, I don't feel the the loss of the IDF itself is even a loss, as the event already was all about making a big deal of not that big "innovations", it was about hyping, and had nothing to do with development whatsoever. So they hire popular dorks to claim how superior they are. This would hardly be needed if that was indeed the case. Sure, they are very big and rooted deep, which allowed them to do great even when their entire lineup was netburst garbage, but having that much money, IP and factories and doing so little with it qualifies for "pathetic" in my book. And speaking of pathetic, they probably hit a new low with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5-gKsQgcRo And I'd say behind that "hip confidence" display they know how pathetic it really is, which is why they have disabled both comments and even rating for the video. Reply boeush - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link Seems like silly penny-pinching on the PR front to me. Not too long ago, they also cancelled their sponsorship of the national science fair... It appears, at least, like a case of penny-wise and pound-foolish. Reply CoreLogicCom - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link More likely Intel has to go back to the drawing board and rethink their cpu strategy in light of the recent AMD Ryzen releases and so there won't be anything positive to talk about this year. Hope AMDs foot to intels posterior is a wake up call to actually innovate and not simply iterate. Reply edzieba - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link CPUs take years, verging on decades to go from architecture concept to actual retail silicon. If Intel 'respond' to Ryzen, it will be many years from now. Everything sooner will be things that have been in the pipeline for years already.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Report: Intel Corporation Preps 6-Core Coffee Lake for Launch in Q4 Intel is planning new processors and related chipsets for the desktop market later this year, according to BenchLife.info. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 17, 2017 at 9:30AM The generally reliable website BenchLife.info just posted new information about Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) upcoming desktop processors, code-named Coffee Lake-S, as well as their related chipsets, marketed as the 300-series. According to the report, Intel plans to launch the new Coffee Lake chips in the fourth quarter of this year, potentially representing a pull-in relative to what previous leaks had indicated (i.e., the first quarter of 2018). Image source: Intel. The new chips will be paired with new platform controller hubs, marketed as the 300-series, which the BenchLife.info leak shows will include enhanced functionality and integration compared with the current 200-series chipsets.  Let's take a closer look at what to expect from this new gear. More processor cores, enhanced manufacturing tech The Coffee Lake chips are expected to retain the same basic processor and graphics architectures as the current-generation Kaby Lake (i.e., seventh-generation Core) processor family. One of the main differences, according to both leaks as well as Intel disclosures, will be additional processor cores -- up to six for the Coffee Lake desktop chips, a boost from up to four for the Kaby Lake chips. There will also be an enhanced 14nm++ manufacturing technology. Kaby Lake is manufactured using Intel's existing 14nm+ technology. The upshot is that these new chips should offer substantially more performance than their predecessors in applications that can utilize multiple processor cores -- the biggest single-generation jump in multi-core performance for Intel's mainstream desktop lineup in a long time, as Intel has been selling quad-core processors into this market for years. Platform improvements, too In addition to improvements in processing power, Intel appears to be planning some interesting platform-level enhancements, according to the BenchLife.info leak. For one thing, the new Z300-series chipsets will apparently include integrated USB 3.1 support, a feature that was missing in the prior Z200-series. Motherboard makers have been able to add USB 3.1 capabilities to their Z200-based motherboards, but this addition required a separate, standalone chip, which ultimately added complexity and cost to the boards. In addition -- and this is the big one -- the Z300-series will apparently integrate both gigabit Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality. Again, just like with USB 3.1, motherboard makers have been including Wi-Fi functionality on to some of their boards for many years, but this has always required a standalone chip. By integrating this functionality, Intel can cut out competing Wi-Fi chipmakers in Wi-Fi-capable motherboards. This should be interesting for the desktop-computer market, since many, but not all, desktops come with Wi-Fi capability anyway, but since the 300-series chipsets will also be used in notebooks, this should be quite nice for the notebook market, since virtually every laptop comes with Wi-Fi today. Foolish takeaway Intel's stated goal is to put out new products on an annual cadence that deliver worthwhile improvements. The company had struggled to stick to this goal in the past under its "tick-tock" product development model, but under its new "waves of innovation" development methodology, it seems to be improving. That said, a generation or two of consistent execution doesn't represent a trend; the company will need to exhibit multiple generations of strong execution before we can say Intel has structurally improved its product execution. However, if Intel can get Coffee Lake out in high volume in the fourth quarter of this year, that'd be a solid start.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Stage one was separating chipset requirements of low core count Xeons from the consumer counterparts, but stage two to occur later this year will be something to wrap your head around. We still haven’t confirmed most of the salient details, such as significant changes in the naming and strategy when it comes to socket and die differentiators, but what we do know is that the large E5-class Xeons (some of which may or may not get a name change from –EP to –SP) will be in the LGA3647 socket, which is exactly where the current generation of Xeon Phi, Knights Landing (KNL), also sits as they will be pin compatible. So for the most part, E5 CPUs will move from the current LGA2011-3 sockets up to a much larger design, and rather than go into the details of what that means, this news post is more about seeing motherboards that support them in the wild. We expect to hear more about the new Skylake-SP Xeon platform in the summer, probably at IDF in August, but for now we get to gaze on accidental leaks like this one. Exxact Corp, an Intel enterprise system integrator, posted up details regarding a pair of upcoming motherboards from Tyan, a well-known Intel enterprise motherboard manufacturer. These motherboards use a pair of LGA3647 sockets on the top of the board, with the DRAM slots above and below to assist with airflow through a server. As with some of the 2P motherboards we see today, the sockets are slightly staggered due to connectors and trace layouts, but both sockets exhibit a full six channels of DRAM with one DIMM per channel (1 DPC, we expect Skylake-SP Xeons to support 2DPC or 3DPC depending on the model). While the image is small, and low quality, some determinations can be made. The specification list of the TYAN S7100GM2NR (and TYAN S7100AG2NR) is fully listed on the SI website as well. Tyan S7100xx2NR Motherboard Specifications   S7100GM2NR S7100AG2NR CPU Support Intel Xeon Scalable Processor Family (Xeon-SP) up to 205W TDP Chipset C621 (LBG-1G) Memory 6+6 DDR4-2666 Slots Up to 768GB RDIMM/LRDIMM Network 2 x RJ45 GbE (Intel I350-AM2) PCIe 4 x PCIe 3.0 x16 3 x PCIe 3.0 x8 PCIe Storage 1 x PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2-2280 (CPU) 1 x PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2-2242 (PCH) Storage 14 x SATA 6 Gbps w/RAID USB 4 x USB 3.0 (rear) IPMI Aspeed AST2500 - Audio - Realtek ALC892 Each socket will support a TDP of 205W, which is up from the previous maximum of 160W on CPUs like the E5-2687W v4 that were focused on high performance. This might mean that Intel is targeting an even higher window for their CPUs, or there will be added silicon on board (how Intel plans to integrate FPGAs into the ecosystem is still unconfirmed, but rumors have been surfacing), or the fact that Xeons might be paired with Knights Landing Xeon Phi chips, which are currently offered from 215W to 260W. Technically that is above the socket TDP for this Tyan board, but that might be because of how the Tyan board expects to be positioned without Xeon Phi, and we might see motherboards with higher TDP ratings and the power delivery to back them up. The chipset is listed as Intel’s C621, which is not listed on ark.intel (the site that holds Intel’s chip specifications), indicating it is a new chip. Typically the chipsets ending in ‘1’ are the low-end models, with Intel putting C608, C236 and others at the top of their respective stacks. The website where the Tyan motherboard is listed also states 'LBG-1G', which is a secondary indicator of the chipset and it's capabilities. We have seen documents signalling potential different types of Intel chipset for the SP platform, and this corresponds with one of those, particularly the '1G' part which is a nod to the fact that this chipset will directly support gigabit ethernet. We won’t comment on unconfirmed details regarding the chipset stack from Intel, however it is expected that the capabilities of the chipset stack will be expanded for Skylake-SP compared to older platforms. With the memory, the website confirms six memory channels per CPU. The website states that the board can support 768GB of RDIMM/LRDIMM DDR4-2666 memory, and given that we have 1DPC this means that the support is the sum across both sockets, leading to 64GB modules maximum. PCIe support shows four primary PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, interspersed with secondary PCIe 3.0 x8 slots. With experience, these secondary slots are most likely switched with the primary slots, such that when occupied the primary slots are reduced to PCIe 3.0 x8 bandwidth. Even with the low-resolution image, it is clear that there is no big PLX 8000-series or 9000-series PCIe switch chip-on-board, suggesting that these lanes are all native to the CPUs. As the board supports four PCIe 3.0 x16 slots natively, this indicates that either a single CPU can support 64 PCIe lanes, or that each CPU takes 32 PCIe lanes. We would expect the latter to be the case for this generation of Xeon processors. Additional to the PCIe slots, there is some storage in PCIe form, with a single M.2-2280 slot being listed as from the CPU, and supporting PCIe 3.0 x4. This most likely comes at the expense of a PCIe 3.0 x8 (as in, when the M.2 is installed, a PCIe 3.0 x8 is either disabled or drops to a PCIe 3.0 x4), depending on exactly how the PCIe root complexes are configured in the Xeons. If the Xeon has a full 40 lanes, installation of M.2 storage probably has no direct effect. For other storage, the website lists an M.2-2242 slot as supporting PCIe 3.0 x4 from the chipset. These new chipsets may mirror the newer consumer chipsets by having plenty of PCIe lanes free for this sort of configuration, though the interesting thing here is limiting it to the 2242 size. There are enterprise drives available in 2242 (and a few consumer ones), although at that size you have limited dies to take advantage of the parallelism needed to saturate a full PCIe 3.0 x4 slot. Along with the PCIe storage, the motherboard will also support 14 SATA 6Gbps ports, all listed as being from the chipset due to Intel RSTe 5.0 RAID support. This would indicate that the new chipsets also have increased native SATA capability (previous generations had 10 SATA ports, of which only six were RST capable). Other connectivity on the boards is listed in terms of Ethernet (two gigabit RJ45 ports from an Intel I350-AM2 controller), USB 3.0 ports (four on the rear) and TPM support. The two boards from Tyan differ in the IPMI and Audio: the S7100GM2NR has the Aspeed AST2500 BMC with iKVM and IPMI, whereas the S7100AG2NR has a Realtek ALC892 audio codec instead. With a larger image of the motherboard, more analysis may have been possible. But seeing this motherboard being listed this early, and publicly, is unexpected (and probably breaks someone's NDA along the line). Nonetheless, system integrators like this are reaching out to potential partners for sales and taking inquiries about future product designs. Sources: Link Many thanks to @momomo_us for the link.

POST A COMMENT 27 Comments View All Comments CajunArson - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link You say: "If the Xeon has a full 40 lanes," The larger LGA-3647 parts have 48 lanes of PCIe connectivity per-socket. Intel has also redesigned the controller hub so that the 48 lanes can be split in 4-lane increments to provide a great deal more flexibility in how the PCIe lanes can be subdivided for different system configurations.

Reply Ian Cutress - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link Is the standard required one of negative contradiction? That's not how any of this works. It's not a case of having to contradict you. It's a case of having a valid, trusted source (usually two, if not from the company itself) which can confirm what is shown. Otherwise, it's an unknown. Who is to say that 2015 slides are accurate today? I have plenty of info from 2017 which has already cancelled. Reply jerrytsao - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link 48 Lanes were basically confirmed 2 years ago, "upgrade" 40 Lanes to 36 Lanes doesn't make any sense. Reply Kevin G - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link With 48 lanes per socket, there would be enough to run all the PCIe slots at full bandwidth (88 lanes out of 100* available). I see a spot for a M.2 slot and what looks like two U.2 connectors. That would bring up the total lane count to an even 100. Additional IO for the audio chip and networking can hang off of the chipset. The pictures are clear enough that you can see traces form both sockets heading toward different sets of PCIe slots so at least both CPUs appear to be used for this. *Repurposing DMI on the second socket would permit an additional four lanes (48 + 52).

Your own forums have detailed lists of the exact SKUs and TDPs that are expected from the Platinum series (almost certainly LGA-3647) and the Gold series (may be LGA-3647 or might be LGA-2066, we'll see). https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/intel-skylake... At this stage claiming that the platform provides 40 lanes of PCIe is pretty much as speculative as claiming it provides 48 lanes, and there are at least semi-credible leaks about the 48 lane support: http://www.itworld.com/article/2985214/hardware/in... Reply Ian Cutress - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link 'It's just as confirmed' = It's not confirmed. AT's editorial standards are quite clear. And just to clarify: I'm not trying to post rumors here. I'm posting a mix of what's known/confirmed, some educated conjecture, deductive analysis of what is at hand, and my experience in this space. I'm not in control of the forums, so whatever gets posted there is beyond my control - there's no editorial scrutiny to what gets posted there. So while it might be right, it's still not confirmed. Reply DanNeely - Monday, April 17, 2017 - link Am I the only person finding the article overly amusing after watching various Anandtech editors smack down more heavily rumor/gossip centric sites (eg Wccftech) in the Twitter feed for posting stuff about LGA3647 as a future conventional Xeon CPU socket when its only known use was for Xeon Phi coprocessors.

Video Let's Play Thimbleweed Park Table of Contents What is overclocking, anyway? Some tips for the journey Overclocking basics Switching to manual control Benchmark, then boost Faster Doesn’t Always Lead to Better Performance Show More If you think that overclocking is solely for performance-obsessed geeks armed with bottles of liquid nitrogen, it’s time to reconsider! Even a small bump in PC performance can delay the need to upgrade your CPU, keeping money in your pocket. Today I’ll walk you through simple overclocking steps that can boost processor speeds 10 percent or more. If you’re a gamer, video artist, or media streamer, that’s a useful, no-cost upgrade. Read on if you want your PC to go faster! What is overclocking, anyway? Overclocking is a technique for tweaking various types of PC hardware, so that it runs faster than the manufacturer’s intended specification. Many processors, RAM modules, and graphics cards can be overclocked, usually by adjusting their settings via your motherboard’s UEFI BIOS. Operate in safe margins and overclocking shouldn’t damage your PC. But, as we’ll discuss, it’s important to manage the additional heat that accelerated hardware can generate. Some tips for the journey Mentioned in this article Intel Core i5-7600K $229.00MSRP $243.00View on Amazon There are a few guiding principles worth considering before you overclock a CPU. First, not all processors can be easily overclocked. If you’re Team AMD, you’re probably in luck. Intel, however, locks most of its mainstream CPUs to prevent smart users from purchasing a budget component and jacking up its performance. Pricier enthusiast processor lines (identified by a K or X suffix, such as the Intel Core i5-7600K), on the other hand, are sold unlocked and can therefore be overclocked. Even then, bear in mind that processors are unique slabs of silicon and electronics. Some processors can tolerate higher operating speeds better than others—even those of the same model and specification. It’s known as the “silicon lottery” for a reason! Stable overclocks entail a delicate balance of speed and heat. The more you push your processor, the hotter it’s going to get. If your PC becomes a little too toasty, integrated fail-safe measures should shut off the power before those expensive components are damaged. To keep your overclocked PC stable, your job is to keep it cool. Budget CPU coolers (the stock heatsink-and-fan assembly that ships with many processors) are going to struggle here. Consider upgrading to a better-performing air cooler (such as those from Noctua) or investigate all-in-one liquid coolers, which work much like a car’s radiator. I recently upgraded my gaming rig with the NZXT Kraken X62 which pumps coolant over the CPU via a sealed system, then extracts the heat via a large radiator and double-fan assembly, mounted in the top of the case. NZXT NZXT Kraken X62 We’re about to get hands-on with a motherboard’s UEFI BIOS software, which allows fine-tuning of your hardware settings. However, some motherboard manufacturers offer convenient apps that attempt to safely overclock your CPU for you. If these manual steps seem a little tough, then check out the likes of Asus Dual Intelligent Processors 5, Gigabyte EasyTune, or Intel’s Extreme Tuning Utility. MSI motherboards even have a physical OC Genie button you can press to turbocharge your PC. Overclocking basics For this guide, I’m using an Asus Maximus VIII Hero Alpha motherboard with an Intel Core i7-6700K processor. Obviously, these steps may need to be tweaked for your particular hardware, but the principles still apply. Before you get started, be sure to download and install the latest BIOS software for your motherboard from the manufacturer’s website. It’s an important step to ensure you have the latest configuration options and that your efforts aren’t frustrated by known issues. Let’s boot up the PC, press F2 (or Delete) at startup to access the BIOS, and get started. As you can see below, this processor runs at a base frequency of 4GHz (4,000MHz). It’s also equipped with a Max Turbo feature that boosts speeds to 4.2GHz when required. When idle, the CPU temperature is a cool 25 degrees C, with a core voltage of 1.264V—the amount of power that’s being supplied to the CPU. Terry Walsh/IDG Click F7 to switch to Advanced Mode, which is where we’ll be spending most of our time in this guide (see below). On the right of the screen, there are two additional settings to mention: BCLK is the base clock frequency, currently set to 100MHz. Underneath that, you’ll see a Ratio setting (often known as the multiplier). Your processor speed is a simple calculation of the base clock speed multiplied by the ratio. In this example, 100MHz x 40 equals 4,000MHz (4GHz). Terry Walsh/IDG To overclock the CPU, we can adjust the base clock frequency or the ratio/multiplier to achieve a faster CPU frequency. A ratio of 42x with the same 100MHz base clock speed would deliver a CPU frequency of 4,200MHz, or 4.2GHz. Switching to manual control Modern motherboards can be equipped with a raft of automated settings designed to make overclocking easy. Terry Walsh/IDG In the Asus Extreme Tweaker menu, we switch the Ai Overclock Tuner from Auto to Manual, which allows access to the base clock frequency setting. Terry Walsh/IDG You can now type a value into the BCLK Frequency field. Hold fire for now, though. Below, you’ll see CPU Core Ratio, which allows us to adjust the multiplier. Some motherboards allow you to target individual processor cores or apply one setting across all cores. Why? Applying the same ambitious overclocking profile to all processor cores may make your PC unstable. But, dial back the settings on individual cores and you may achieve a better balance. Terry Walsh/IDG With the CPU Core Ratio set to anything other than Auto, the Core Ratio Limit settings become editable. Sync All Cores enables the 1-Core Ratio Limit setting. Any value you type here is applied across all four cores. Select Per Core and you can target each core individually. Terry Walsh/IDG We’ll synchronize speeds across all cores in this guide, but feel free to play with individual core settings if required. Before we make any changes to the base clock frequency or CPU ratios, there’s an additional element to consider: voltage. The voltage applied to your CPU varies continually. Faster operating speeds require additional power for stability. Your motherboard handles this behind the scenes but, should you wish, you can set manual voltage levels to support your overclocking efforts. Terry Walsh/IDG Scroll down to CPU Core/Cache Voltage and click the drop-down menu. You can see three alternative settings. Manual Mode sets a single, static voltage level. Whether your CPU is idle or running at full tilt, the same voltage will be applied. Thinking about power consumption, Manual Mode is quite inefficient, but gives you the most control. Offset Mode works by adding (or subtracting, if you wished to underclock) a set amount of power to the standard voltage that the processor would use. The voltage would still vary based on requirements, but the range would be boosted by whatever step you configured. So, if you created an offset of 0.1 V, for example, and the processor typically requires 1.25 V to deliver a certain speed, 1.35 V would actually be supplied. In Adaptive Mode, your CPU would only receive a voltage boost when it enters turbo mode. It’s worth noting that, on some motherboards, you can also include an Offset value for Adaptive Mode, that also provides a voltage boost to the processor outside of turbo mode. Terry Walsh/IDG If you’re taking your first steps in overclocking, allow your motherboard to handle voltage automatically—at least until you’ve built up some experience. If you experience instability, then experiment with Adaptive and Offset modes to support your CPU with a small voltage boost. Benchmarking PCs in manual voltage modes can place significant stress on the CPU, increasing their risk of failure. Be sure to also pay attention to any contextual help provided in your UEFI BIOS, or motherboard manual. In the screenshot above, you can see guidelines at the bottom of the screen outlining minimum and maximum voltage settings, as well as the increment to use.

Ina Jaffe/NPR hide caption toggle caption Ina Jaffe/NPR Gail Dougherty, 61, was a project manager at Intel until she retired in 2016. Now she is working part time at a health center, part of a fellowship paid by Intel as a regular retirement benefit. Ina Jaffe/NPR Not everyone who reaches so-called retirement age is ready to retire. But they may be ready for a change. That's one of the reasons that the tech giant Intel pays longtime employees a stipend while they try out new careers at nonprofit organizations. One of those employees is 61-year-old Gail Dougherty. The former project manager now sits at a desk at the Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center in Oregon, poring over a spreadsheet on her computer. She's crunching patient data with input from doctors and nurses to figure out better ways of delivering care to the health center's high number of patients with diabetes. "Out of my own non-medical, non-health-care ... head, [I] proposed a workflow that seemed like, from what I was hearing might be the most helpful thing for our patients," Dougherty says. Those patients are migrant workers and others who have no health insurance or who qualify for Medicaid. Dougherty says the skills from her old job fit in with her new one, even though the two jobs couldn't be more different. Business Older Workers Find Age Discrimination Built Right Into Some Job Websites Business Too Much Experience To Be Hired? Some Older Americans Face Age Bias "At Intel, deadlines are king," says Dougherty. "You've got a product, you've got to get it out, either first or by the time you promised. Schedules are king." But at the health center? "Not so much," she says, "because what's primary is the patient care." Dougherty is what's known as an Encore Fellow. She'll work at the health center part time for about a year and receive a stipend of $25,000. This is part of a nationwide program started by Encore.org that brings retiring corporate workers into mission-driven organizations. [You may have heard sponsorship messages about Encore on NPR and other media outlets.] But Intel is the only company that pays the stipend for its retirees' fellowships as a basic employee benefit. In the past five years, the company has paid for about 1,000 fellowships at a cost of more than $30 million. "In the scheme of our total labor cost, it's a very small number," says Ogden Reid, Intel's vice president for human resources. The Changing Lives Of Women For Women, Income Inequality Continues Into Retirement Parallels For Some Older Adults In Japan, A Chance To Stay In The Workforce He says it's also a worthwhile expense. "We feel like we're helping our communities," Reid says. "Our retirees give us really positive feedback ... and our workforce that's here see that happening to folks who've had a long career and I think that makes them feel good about the company." Right now, seven Encore Fellows work at the Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center. Gil Munoz, the center's CEO, says they play a crucial role. "They bring a certain discipline, a certain rigor, to looking at problems and solving them," Munoz says. "Having these Encore Fellows who could help lead a project can be the key to whether it's successful or not."

Ina Jaffe/NPR That may be why Jinny Meade, 73, is still here. She came to the health center a couple of years ago as an Encore Fellow. Now she's a permanent part-time employee, working as a project consultant. "I'm sort of the nag that helps them stay on track as much as possible," she says, laughing. It's rewarding to know that her management skills are serving the mission of the health center, but Meade also derives satisfaction from what she gets back in return. "It's really exciting to be part of something that's ... bigger than ourselves," she says. "Health care for the underserved is a worthy cause." And in Meade's case, it's also a second career.

Compact tablet with „Slide Passport,” world’s first slide-style palm vein authentication function As part of its ARROWS Tab series of windows tablets, Fujitsu has launched the new ARROWS Tab Q507/P-SP, a 10.1″ compact and light tablet featuring Slide Passport, a slide-style palm vein authentication functionality offering both strong security and convenience. With the simple action of sliding your hand along the guides displayed on the tablet’s touchscreen, the small slide-style palm vein sensor installed in the tablet’s frame will read and authenticate the pattern of veins in your hand. The technology in this sensor was developed by Fujitsu Limited and Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd., and by adopting an 8mm optical unit that Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd. has been able to mass produce, it became possible to mount it in the narrow frame of a tablet. In addition, the tablet features both water resistance (IPX4) and dust resistance (IP5X)(3), enabling use in a variety of business situations. http://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_FujitsuSlidePassport.jpg ARROWS Tab Q507/P-SP 2.

Topic Areas In 2017, we'll seek topics supporting our 2017 Strategy, working with Mozillians to refine these areas into specific topics: Grow Firefox & From Firefox e.g. user-centered design; user acquisition and retention; metrics & data; teamwork & collaboration; communication Grow New Arease.g. internet of things; artificial intelligence and virtual reality Grow Mozilla e.g. our Issues Agenda including Internet Health e.g. security and privacy, access Speaker Criteria We prefer speakers who: Have practical hands-on experience in their area of expertise (vs. just academic or consulting) Have significant experience public speaking and/or teaching, as well as in their domain of expertise Are willing to customize their material to Mozilla’s specific needs Motivate audiences to both learn and act (as distinguished from purely inspirational “TED”-like talks) Encompass diverse and underrepresented backgrounds, perspectives and geographies Are recommended by other Mozillians Do not promote a commercial or personal agenda The speaker(s) share live from a Mozilla office and are publicly streamed to Mozilla's other offices via Air Mozilla and archived for subsequent viewing. We encourage speakers to allot at least 15-20 minutes for Q&A. Typical in-person attendance at each office is 20-30; additionally roughly 100-200 other attendees tune in live remotely. Follow-on views are available to our thousands of community members and the public. Program Objectives The objectives of the Mozilla Speaker Series are to: Expose Mozilla staff to outside ideas, practices and technologies Facilitate learning, skill-building and professional development Testimonials "Today's speaker challenged my expectations of the internet and of corporate behavior and stimulated good office discussion." --March 2017 "I dislike most presentations. This was among the best I have ever watched." --March 2017 "SUPER INTERESTING talk!!! Glad I had the opportunity to hear Nir speak!" --March 2017 "Today's panel helped me focus on the core problem, which is NOT technology but rather what technology is enabling -- people being jerks and why the technology makes it seem to be OK." --February 2017 "Diversification of inputs makes design more inclusive and helps avoid problems like being wrongly bucketed in a certain demographic. Interesting modes of UX design include the unintuitive slowing down of user interactions, to prevent hasty life decisions based on a heightened emotional response. This is valuable because it is a well thought out piece of a design process - something that I feel like I can take away!" --February 2017 "Laszlo's points were made with enthusiasm, rigor and data. He didn't shy away from the fact the some of the problems are difficult." --January 2017 "AWESOME TOPIC AND ELEGANT SPEAKER, well done!!" --January 2017 "It's rare for companies to be really good at learning from that failure and being diligent in discussing it. Hearing that part of the talk was really valuable to me. I'll try to make a conscious effort to learn from failure." --November 2016 "The concept of reframing failure so others can learn and de-personalizing the sense of responsibility we feel was helpful." --November 2016 "Before Harlo's talk, I also hadn't thought much about the role of freelance journalists and the complexities of protecting people and data who don't necessarily have the shelter of large news organizations. I think there are some implications for Mozilla community there." --October 2016 "Genevieve showed us how designing data-rich experiences for humans often ignores important nuances and dualities that are present in life." --September 2016 "There are human choices built in to the design of our technology systems, and Genevieve provided some examples of this (e.g. turning off mail servers) that I will use." --September 2016 "The opportunity to reflect on the unchanging constants of human behaviour and contrast them with the technology-driven product decisions we often make was illuminating." --September 2016 "When building the next technologies of services, data sets, etc we need to ask ourselves if it plays into what is meaningful to the human race of family/friends, secrets/lies, community. Or we need to solve the challenges that have plagued us, time/reputation/forgetfulness. This is a great basis for Mozilla to start from when "prototyping the future." --September 2016 "The most important thing I learned from Tina was about framing the question, because I often assume that solving the 'function' is solving the problem, when it is not. Zoom out to fall in love with the problem." --July 2016 "Kevin was my favorite speaker yet! Thank you! It was very apropos to the direction we're going with Firefox being the 'personal browser.'" --May 2016 "Please keep it running as long as possible - it's an excellent forum!" --May 2016 "Kirsten was GREAT. I don't think the lessons folks learned as mid-level managers in explosively growing social companies apply to Mozilla. But I do think Wohlberg's lessons apply to us." --April 2016 "This series is really great. Focus on Product seems to be the theme and is a much necessary one for us now. Thanks for bringing them. It really helps." --March 2016 "April addressed some questions that were particularly apropos to a project I'm working on. It was interesting to see how Slack faced the same problem!" --February 2016 "Jocelyn's talk was brilliant. She presented a very insightful and productive way to reframe the conversation about release management. Just what we needed right now. Great choice!" --January 2016 "The speaker was very good, had thought-provoking ideas, yet delivered those ideas in a tasteful and relaxed way. I am likely to share and recommend my friends to go watch the video recording later." --December 2015 "This speaker was especially relevant and valuable because she provided tangible and actionable information in addition to being thought-provoking." -- October 2015 "Seeing speakers like this are really heartening to see at Mozilla. I think it will drive some really impactful change." -- September 2015 "Bringing in subject matter experts from the outside help us push our sometimes-bubble-like thinking. It's very easy to get caught up in our own 'laws' and constraints but hearing best practices such as Hitten will help us open our eyes a bit more. I'm excited because his presentation was spot on and hopefully expanded our horizons a bit." -- August 2015 "Really learned to think differently about a lot of things and also 'argument' differently when discussing new features or ideas. Always think about the user value, and how what you are working on will hinder or improve the user experience." -- July 2015 "This felt like the most interesting speaker so far, perhaps because it was directly relevant to our day-to-day work. He was also quite a good speaker, which helps. Getting people to talk about areas where we think we could do better or use a different perspective seems like a good general strategy." -- July 2015 "I love getting an outside perspective from an expert in an area. We spend a lot of time talking to ourselves so that outside perspective is awesome." -- May 2015 "The talk was engaging and the Paris employees loved the 'Brantina' idea and felt more a part of the conversation." -- May 2015 Upcoming Speakers Wednesday, April 26, 2017: American Spies: Jennifer Granick on U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: American Spies: U.S. Surveillance and its Global Implications Intelligence agencies in the U.S. (aka the American Spies) are exceedingly aggressive, pushing and sometimes bursting through the technological, legal and political boundaries of lawful surveillance. Because surveillance law has fallen behind surveillance technology, the U.S. government has unprecedented new powers. At our April Speaker Series, Jennifer Granick will address how Cold War programs led by J. Edgar Hoover and initiatives sparked by the September 11, 2001 tragedy have led us to today’s fusion centers and mosque infiltrators. She will also show how our current state of mass surveillance is fundamentally incompatible with a healthy democracy. A teacher, practitioner and expert in surveillance and security law, Granick will share how the reality of modern surveillance in the U.S. differs from popular understanding, and what U.S. - and global - citizens can do to minimize its negative impact both for Americans and non-Americans around the world. Host: Chris Riley Speaker: Jennifer Granick Jennifer Stisa Granick is the Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society (CIS) and author of American Spies: Modern Surveillance, Why You Should Care, and What To Do About It (2017). From 2001 to 2007, Granick was Executive Director of CIS and taught Cyberlaw, Computer Crime Law, Internet intermediary liability, and Internet law and policy. From 2007 to 2010 she served as the Civil Liberties Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Granick practices, speaks, and writes about computer crime and security, electronic surveillance, security vulnerability disclosure, encryption policy, and the Fourth Amendment. In March of 2016, she received Duo Security’s Women in Security Academic Award for her expertise in the field as well as her direction and guidance for young women in the security industry. Before teaching at Stanford, Granick spent almost a decade practicing criminal defense law in California. Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, May 10, 2017: When Surveillance Goes Private: A 2027 Retrospective from Adrian Hon Location: Mozilla London + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: It’s 2027. In the UK, 8 out of 10 homes host a range of microphones, cameras and motion detectors. They help users secure their homes, find lost items, assist with cleaning, keep an eye out for accidents and falls, and a hundred other everyday tasks. They're integrated so seamlessly into daily life that they're considered indispensable – and they're cheap. Of course, consumption habits ranging from entertainment, clothing and food are not only known, but anticipated by intelligent systems. These habits are also owned, captured, analyzed and used by the corporations that run them. Interestingly, just a few decades ago in the 1990s, the UK’s introduction of Closed Caption TV (CCTV) met with significant public outcry over concerns of privacy abuses. Yet now, less than half a century later, we’ve not only abandoned such talks: we’ve opted in to 24/7 surveillance of our homes. In our May 10 “future retrospective,” we’ll look at how we - in 2027 - became so collectively compliant to others owning data about our personal habits and lives. What factors led to us to give so much of our lives to corporations, with so little transparency or accountability? Why were we more open to private surveillance than public surveillance? And when we return to 2017, what can we learn from this evolution to map a different future? Host: Sarah Allen Speaker: Adrian Hon Since 2007, Adrian has overseen the creation of all of Six to Start’s main projects, including Zombies, Run!, We Tell Stories, and Smokescreen, and its research and development projects with clients including Disney Imagineering, the British Museum, and Microsoft.

Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Previous Speakers Wednesday, March 15, 2017: Building Habit-Forming Products with Nir Eyal Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 5pm UT Topic: Building Habit-Forming Products Hundreds of millions of people use Firefox every day. But they don’t have to. They can - very easily - switch to another browser. But we know Firefox rocks and we want them to use it. Enter habits. Those human behaviors that become regular, ongoing actions that don’t require thought or intention. Or, per Merriam-Webster, “an acquired mode of behavior that has become nearly or completely involuntary.” Creating software that is habit-forming entails tapping into key human psychological drivers such as rewards, social validation and personal fulfillment. These drivers are at the foundation of developing experiences that drive product growth. Perhaps the biggest benefit is to software makers is significantly lower costs to acquire and maintain active users. But what about the user? Is it manipulative to create habits for people so they can use your products without giving it a conscious thought? To “get in their heads” to ensure they use our software? Do we want people to use our products involuntarily? Nir Eyal has built and invested in products reaching hundreds of millions of users including AdNectar, Product Hunt and EventBrite. He’ll draw on core psychological tenets to show how we can create products for users that are habit-forming. And he’ll show us how we can do this in a way that we feel good about - to “build the change we see.” Speaker: Nir Eyal For most of his career Nir worked in the video gaming and advertising industries where he learned, applied (and at times rejected) the techniques used to motivate and manipulate users. He writes to help companies create behaviors that benefit their users, while educating people on how to build healthful habits in their own lives. As an active angel investor Nir makes it personal, investing his own funds in habit-forming products he believes improves lives. His past investments include Eventbrite, Product Hunt, Refresh.io (acquired by LinkedIn), Worklife (acquired by Cisco), Marco Polo, Presence Learning, 7 Cups, Pana, and Symphony Commerce. Nir is the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Design School. He’s sold two technology companies since 2003 and now helps teams design more engaging products. Nir talks of his advanced degree from the The School of Hard Knocks, but also received an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Host: Chris More Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, February 22, 2017: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) Location: Mozilla San Francisco + Air Mozilla Time: 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm UT Topic: Inclusive Design: The Intersection of Product and Behavior (Panel Discussion) The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible. Its effectiveness as a public resource depends upon decentralized participation worldwide. — Excerpt, Mozilla Manifesto Mozilla cares not only about a functioning web, but a healthy one; a web where all people can both access and participate, resulting in an Internet that reflects the broad the diversity of its users. But the Internet isn’t always like this. Sometimes it's a place where groups of people are excluded. When Airbnb hosts deny service to guests based on their race, the web is no longer accessible. When neighbors make destructive assumptions based on race on local community site Nextdoor, or Twitter conversations devolve into trolling, the web is no longer a place of constructive participation. These companies want to make the web better too. Approaches include hashtag viewing controls on Twitter & filters for abusive comments on Instagram; Airbnb’s Instant Book that prevents harmful stereotyping; and Nextdoor’s reporting system designed to create more thoughtfulness around neighborhood conversations. Mozilla builds products and platforms directly for developers, communities and publishers worldwide. How can we create and sustain experiences that are open, accessible and participatory? And what measures of success can we advocate to support positive experiences for users, communities and publishers? At our Speaker Series panel, we’ll address these questions with product leaders representing consumer, developer, business and gaming audiences as part of a conversation around "ethical design” with community, product and engineering professionals charting new territory in this area. Panelists: Angel Steger (Product Design Lead, Pinterest) is an entrepreneur and product designer developing award-winning products that empower people to get things done. Passionate about complex problems and human behavior, she’s worked in spaces as varied as genetic research, relationship management, and language learning. She currently leads the User State Machine team at Pinterest. On the side, you’ll find her practicing yoga, exploring food in SF, and gardening. Randi Lee Harper (Founder, Online Abuse Prevention Initiative). Randi is founded the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative to fight harassment with technical solutions. This includes the Good Game Auto Blocker tool, built after a long career in tech (KIXEYE, Amazon, IronPort Systems). While Randi believes long term solutions involves cultural changes, but until that happens we can work develop shorter-term solutions to help targets of harassment. Current interests include tracking the way that certain communities interact, and helping define predictive behavior for outbreaks of online abuse.

Questions: During the event join us on IRC #AirMozilla and direct questions to @diane Hashtag: #InclusiveDesign + #MozillaSpeakers Wednesday, January 18, 2017: Data and People: A Discussion with Laszlo Bock, Sr Advisor and former SVP of People Operations, Google Location: Mozilla Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, January 18 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 6:00pm UTC Topic: Data and People: A Discussion with Google’s former SVP of People Operations Laszlo Bock When Google’s head of People came out with the bestselling book Work Rules! last year, he debunked many myths. Adopting an experiments-based approach with their people, his team was able to gather data challenging commonly accepted assumptions about hiring, compensation, performance evaluations, training and more. For example, in 2010 Google's research showed that junior, female software engineers were not getting promoted at the same rate as their male counterparts. Digging deeper, the team discovered differing self-nomination rates. Men, who in many cultures are typically more comfortable self-promoting, were nominating themselves at higher rates than their equally qualified but, on average, less self-promoting female peers. To address this, a senior leader shared the data with Googlers and encouraged all engineers to self-nominate when ready, and told managers to keep their eyes open for promo-ready Googlers. Eventually, promotion rates equaled out. Of course, Google isn’t Mozilla. For one thing, Google has over 60,000 staff in over 70 offices in 40 countries around the world. But the work and findings from Google - whose staff typically provide statistically-significant and rich data sets - can be useful references as we strive to create a Mozilla that is diverse, innovative and, at our core, puts people first. On January 18, Mozilla's Larissa Shapiro will interview Laszlo. She’ll dig deeper into the approaches and learnings Google has taken with people and data, and help us uncover how these types of approaches apply to the science and art of people management at mozilla. Speaker: From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo Bock served as SVP of People Operations, leading Google's people function responsible for attracting, developing, retaining, and delighting "Googlers.” He believes that giving people freedom and supplementing our instincts with hard science are steps on the path to making work meaningful and people happy. During Bock's tenure, Google was named the Best Company to Work more than 30 times around the world and received over 100 awards as an employer of choice. In 2010, Laszlo was named "Human Resources Executive of the Year" by HR Executive Magazine. He is the author of "WORK RULES! Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead," which has been named one of the top 15 business books of 2015. He has testified before Congress on immigration reform and labor issues and been featured in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the PBS Newshour and on the Today Show. Bock's earlier experience spans executive roles at the General Electric Company, management consulting at McKinsey & Company, start-ups, non-profits, and acting. He (briefly) held the world record for Greek Syrtaki dance (along with 1,620 others). * Note: Laszlo dedicates all proceeds of his book to charities relating to education and veterans, the former mainly focused on giving disadvantaged kids better access e.g. Peninsula Bridge.

When you do your planning, you state what you'll achieve and measure those achievements. And when you are rewarded, it's typically for a job "well done.” Why even set goals, objectives or KPIs if you aren’t planning on succeeding? Because the best, most innovative organizations do more than set and achieve goals. They also fail. Failure is actually a by-product of innovation. It's the "risk" element of the "risk - reward” equation. Cue the emergence of global failure events and meet ups. As humans conditioned to win and succeed since birth, navigating how to “fail well" is hardly intuitive. What constitutes a "good failure"? And at what point do you decide you’ve failed, rather than persevere? Or change your direction e.g. the notorious ‘pivot’? In a world where success is rewarded and everyone is in the game to “win,” what does it mean to “fail well”? At our November speaker series, we will explore how Mozilla can be a place where failure is not minimized, denied, or shunned, but instead treated as a valuable source of learning and insight to set us up for future successes. Specifically, Ashley Good of Fail Forward will get us started with very practical insights into how we can: Craft a language of failure Communicate failure for learning Develop the gift of feedback Speaker: Working in Cairo with the United Nations Environment Programme and as a management consultant in Vancouver, Ashley Good saw how fear of failure inhibits innovation, adaptation, and performance. In response, she launched Fail Forward to spark a shift in how we perceive and talk about failure, and to help organizations learn, innovate and build resilience. Since 2010 Ashley has worked with organizations – from grantmakers and nonprofits to government and private sector companies – to use failure as a learning tool and culture driver to support and foster innovation. She is well known for building the Organizational Learning Team at Engineers Without Borders Canada, and she continues to lead their annual Failure Report. Ashley is a contributor to the Globe and Mail Leadership Lab, Public Sector Digest, and World Economic Forum Agenda. Her work has received coverage in a wide range of media and news outlets, including National Post, The Globe and Mail, CBC Radio and Television, The New York Times, and Fast Company. She is recognized by Harvard Business Review and McKinsey as the recipient of the Innovating Innovation Award, hosted Canada’s first ever conference dedicated to intelligent failure, and is a half-ironman triathlete. She earned her Bachelor of Science from the University of British Columbia with honours. Mozilla Host: George Roter Deck Questions: Submit questions during the event on IRC #AirMozilla. Hashtag: #mozSS October 12: Metadata is the new data... and why that (really) matters, with Harlo Holmes, Freedom of the Press Foundation Location: Mozilla Toronto + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Wednesday, October 12 @ 10:00am PT / 1:00pm ET / 5:00pm UTC Topic: Metadata is the new data ... and why that (really) matters Maybe it’s when the person you had a bad date with on Tinder shows up in your “people you may know” feed in Facebook. Or when you accept the default settings on your Android phone and share all of your transit habits with Google. Those moments might lead you to suspect considerable information about you and your behavior (aka “metadata”) is being harvested, shared and saved. But you had no reason to predict that. Nobody told you what was being gathered, or who it was being shared with. Or maybe they did, in a long, detailed unread terms of service. Today’s proliferation of mobile devices and platforms such as Google and Facebook has exacerbated this extensive, prolific sharing about users and their behaviors in ways most do not understand. Announcements about Facebook encrypting Messenger and WhatsApp appear to be encouraging ways of protecting your data... but they belie a different story of splintered approaches to metadata collection and silos among major platform providers. Similar disparities exist among how browsers treat metadata. So while the actual content of our messages may be encrypted, dangerous legal, financial, political and even medical implications to metadata remain. The impact of information about what you do (and when you do it) has yet to be explored or defined, let alone systematized. Fortunately mozilla is in a position to advocate for practices and policies that serve users first. We’ll hear specifically how from Harlo Holmes, Director of Newsroom Digital Security for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Speaker: Harlo is the Director of Newsroom Digital Security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation. She strives to help individual journalists in various media organizations become confident and effective in securing their communications within their newsrooms, with their sources, and with the public at large. She is a media scholar, software programmer, and activist; and contributes to the open source mobile security collective The Guardian Project. She has helped journalists use tools to preserve their privacy and do their jobs better; is a member of Deep Lab, a collaborative group of cyberfeminist researchers, artists, writers, engineers, and more addressing issues such as privacy, surveillance, code and art; and was a Mozilla Knight Open News Fellow in 2014.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Dr. Genevieve Bell is responsible for corporate sensing and insights at Intel. She leads a cross-discipline foresights community that delivers insights into significant societal, technical and global trends. At Mozilla she’ll deliver what she terms “more of a meditation and conversation than a talk” on what it means to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. This sounds high level but it's also practical: we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful. Speaker: An accomplished anthropologist and researcher, Genevieve Bell joined Intel in 1998. During that time, she has helped drive Intel’s focus on user experiences and led various teams of social scientists and designers. She has been granted a number of patents for consumer electronics innovations throughout her career, with additional patents in the user experience space. She is the author of numerous journal papers and articles. She was named an Intel Fellow in 2008, a vice president in 2013 and a Senior Fellow in 2016. In addition to her position at Intel, Bell is a highly regarded industry expert and frequent commentator on the intersection of culture and technology. She has been featured in publications such as Wired, Forbes, The Atlantic, Fast Company, the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is also a sought-after public speaker and panelist at technology conferences worldwide for the insights she has gained from extensive international field work and research.

Wired founder Kevin Kelly has an optimistic roadmap for the future, showing how the coming changes in our lives—from virtual reality in the home to an on-demand economy to artificial intelligence embedded in everything we manufacture—can be understood as the result of a few long-term, accelerating forces. These deep trends—flowing, screening, accessing, sharing, filtering, remixing, tracking, and questioning—overlap and are codependent on one another. And they will completely revolutionize the way we buy, work, learn, and communicate. By understanding and embracing them, it will be easier for us to remain on top of the coming wave of changes and to arrange our day-to-day relationships with technology in ways that bring forth maximum benefits. Join us as mozilla's John Jensen interviews Kevin on these trends: what exactly are they, how are they playing out in our world, and what can we do as technologists ourselves to ensure they contribute to the future we want. Speaker: Kevin Kelly is Senior Maverick at Wired magazine. He co-founded Wired in 1993, and served as its Executive Editor for its first seven years. His new book for Viking/Penguin The Inevitable will be released in early June 2016. He is also founding editor and co-publisher of the popular Cool Tools website, which has been reviewing tools daily since 2003. From 1984-1990 Kelly was publisher and editor of the Whole Earth Review, a journal of unorthodox technical news. He co-founded the ongoing Hackers’ Conference, and was involved with the launch of the WELL, a pioneering online service started in 1985. His books include the best-selling New Rules for the New Economy; the classic book on decentralized emergent systems, Out of Control; a graphic novel about robots and angels, The Silver Cord; an oversize catalog of the best of Cool Tools; and his summary theory of technology in What Technology Wants (2010).

Things like…deciding to develop an OS as well as a browser. And an app. Focusing on devices beyond phones. Changing our approach to advertising and content. Instilling an entire culture of experimentation and measurement across functions. These types of shifts can impact job roles, titles, tools - in short, they impact all the stuff of our daily work. Whether an organization is decentralized or command & control, these kinds of changes are never simple nor straightforward. There’s no silver bullets. And yet, when done thoughtfully and holistically, significant change management can make the difference between life and death of a product, an organization and its community. As a leader of major change efforts at PayPal, Salesforce and Charles Schwab, Kirsten Wolberg has moved a global organization to agile development and helped change the overall ownership of her organization. She'll draw off these experiences and share we might manage the changes happening at Mozilla. Speaker: Kirsten Wolberg currently serves as Vice President, Talent at PayPal, leading the talent acquisition, performance and learning teams. She also holds the role as Separation Executive for PayPal leading the PayPal separation program as part of the eBay/PayPal tax-free split. Kirsten was selected to lead the newly created Talent organization for PayPal to bring her deep background in technology, operations and transformational change leadership to the talent function. She is leading the innovation to reimagine Talent for the newly independent PayPal. Prior to her current roles she led the chief operating functions for PayPal Technology including technology strategy, planning, M&A, quality, transformation, employee engagement and the PayPal Open Source Office. Previously, she was Chief Information Officer (CIO) at salesforce.com and divisional CIO for Corporate Technology at Charles Schwab. Kirsten is on the Board of Silicon Graphics International. She is also Trustees for. Additionally she is a Board Member of the Greater Bay Area chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, Year Up Bay Area, and Jewish Vocational Services.

At what point are you ready to ship? What is the right product? How do you know when you’ve built it? And often more complicated than it sounds: who are your users? The best PMs are less product thought leaders and visionaries (though they certainly may be), but moreso shepherds of stakeholders and builders of processes to sort through these critical challenges. While they typically don’t produce tangible artifacts such as code or mockups, the ultimate success of the team and product can hinge on the effectiveness of the product manager. In short, product management done well helps make companies and products much better. But when done badly, it can significantly hurt a company and team. Speaker: As an investment partner at Greylock, Josh Elman invests in entrepreneurs building social networks and platforms, mobile apps, new media, and connected devices. Josh specializes in designing, building, and scaling consumer products, having been part of multiple companies that have grown to more than 100 million users. Before joining Greylock, Josh spent 15 years in product and engineering roles at leading companies in social, commerce, and media. Josh was the product lead for growth and relevance at Twitter, growing Twitter’s active user base by nearly 10x. Prior to Twitter, Josh worked on the platform at Facebook and led the launch of Facebook Connect. Josh was an early employee at LinkedIn and helped establish early models for user growth and launched v1 of LinkedIn Jobs. Josh also held roles leading product management for Zazzle, and product and engineering for RealJukebox and RealPlayer at RealNetworks. Josh currently serves on the boards of Medium, Meerkat, Operator, and Super. Josh also works closely with our investments in Nextdoor and Whosay. Josh led Greylock’s investment in SmartThings, which was acquired by Samsung in 2014. Josh holds a BS in Symbolic Systems with a focus on Human Computer Interaction from Stanford University.

The Neuroscience of Online Communications with Deanna Zandt Location: Mountain View + Air Mozilla Day, Date & Time: Thursday, September 24 @ 9:00am PT / 12:00pm ET / 4:00pm UTC Topic: “Should I put it on Yammer?” How do you respond when people at Mozilla ask you this? Do you sigh, roll your eyes, let out a small resigned laugh? Most of us know that many seemingly-benign posts (this one now the stuff of legends) can sometimes devolve into a debate nobody expected, necessarily wanted or knows what to do with. Not always, but enough to cause some communications platforms to be feared by some and occasionally counterproductive. This outcome, of course, is not confined to Yammer, nor is the behavior confined to Mozilla. Our September Brantina speaker, Deanna Zandt, has generously volunteered to speak with us about the neuroscientific dynamics of online communications. She’ll provide a deeper understanding of how our brains work when we’re engaged in online discussions which can help us communicate better, make better decisions, be more productive, and ultimately engage with more people driving richer, more dynamic outcomes.

News sign-up Intel emphasises brand experiences News, 17 April 2017 Topics PCs, computing DANA POINT, CA: Intel, the technology group, has successfully reinvigorated its brand by focusing on how its tech products can drive and deliver compelling experiences. Steve Fund, CMO at Intel Corp., discussed this subject at the Association of National Advertisers' (ANA) 2017 Brand Masters Conference. And he reported that the firm's decision to focus on the immersive, empowering and engaging experiences its products and technology provide in its marketing constitutes a major shift from the brand's iconic "Intel Inside" positioning. "Intel was known for what it was, not for what it is – or where it's headed," he said. (For more details, read Warc's exclusive report: How Intel marketing remade the brand.) The company, according to Fund, needed to make sure that consumers know it is responsible for much more than making the processors which help drive computers. "We didn't evolve our brand; we evolved our business. We didn't invest sufficiently to keep the brand relevant and fresh. The brand was stuck in the past and [everybody] thought it was a microprocessor inside of a PC," he said. "We needed to demonstrate the relationship between the brand and the business, and relate the brand promise to what the engineers do. "To have a healthy business, you need to have a healthy brand. Business performance always eventually follows brand performance." Partnerships with actors Jim Parsons, singer Lady Gaga and quarterback Tom Brady have all added an element of star power to its marketing, too. And emphasizing experiences also offers a clearer path to engaging millennials. "Our consumer base was ageing, and older consumers refresh PCs slower than younger consumers," said Fund. "We needed to become more relevant to millennials and go from being the PC component to an experience exponent – to go from being stuck inside to enabling amazing experiences outside. "We've inserted Intel into pop culture, showing up when and where millennials were receptive to our message. We're leveraging their passion points: music, sports, entertainment and gaming."

Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Packages Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact HP’s New Pavilion Laptops & Convertibles Hit the Pricing Sweet Point Azeem Ullah 1 day ago HP, which recently reclaimed the title of the world’s largest PC maker, is back with a new range of Pavilion laptops and convertibles. The products were introduced (for some reason) at the Coachella Festival and hit key price points for all users. Pavilion Notebooks The Pavilion notebooks come in three offerings: 14, 15.6 and 17.3 inch. The display options available are either HD (720p, non-IPS) or FHD 1080p (IPS/non-IPS), while the design is updated with a diamond-cut trackpad and a tilted hinge display. Under the hood, you get Intel chips ranging from Celeron to Core i7, as well as AMD processors (either E2 or A10 APU). The choice for dedicated GPU ranges from Nvidia’s GeForce 940MX to AMD’s entry level Radeon series. Further, a combo of both SSD and HDD can be had for 512 GB and 1 TB capacities, respectively. Meanwhile, for the ports you get a USB-C, USB 3.1, HDMI and an SD card slot. At the top is an optional Windows Hello-compatible IR sensor. The battery is said to last up to 10 hours of usage, while fast-charging is supported as well, which is a major plus. As for the price, the 14, 15.6 and 17-inch versions will start at $700, $600 and $630, respectively, based on your bundle of specifications. Pavilion X360 Convertibles Other than the more ‘conventional” offerings, HP also took towards updating its convertible lineup. The three convertibles will be available in 11.6, 13 and 14-inch variants, with the touch-enabled display being available in both HD-ready and FHD versions. The good thing is that HP packs a stylus with each of these systems. Under the hood, you’ll find Intel’s silicon ranging from the lowly Pentium N4200 to the premium Core i7. Storage will be available in both SSD and HDD options, while there’s option for both discrete Radeon and GeForce graphics. For connectivity, you get USB-C on larger models, HDMI, SD card, audio jack, and a Kensington port alongside the optional Windows Hello support. The 11-inch version is decidedly lower on specs than others, missing out on a Full HD display, dedicated graphics as well as USB-C ports, though, it makes up for it in the price game.

Omnitracs, a global pioneer of fleet management solutions, led the round, which also included existing investors Intel Capital, DENSO International America, BP Ventures, Lockheed Martin, Nokia Growth Partners, UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund, Volvo Group, Sand Hill Angels, Band of Angels and Birchmere Ventures along with new investors B37 Ventures, Mitsui USA, Okaya, Schlumberger, US Venture and Breakthrough Fuel. Peloton has raised a total of $78 million since inception. Series B funds will fuel Peloton’s growth plans, including the rollout of the first commercial two-truck driver-assistive platooning system later in 2017, as well as development of more advanced automation solutions. Several US-based Fortune 500 fleets plan to trial the system within the next year. At the same time, Peloton and Series B lead investor Omnitracs will expand cross-fleet platooning opportunities by integrating the system with the Omnitracs Intelligent Vehicle Gateway telematics platform and developing new joint telematics solutions. Boosted by the new investment, Peloton is accelerating vehicle integration projects with several truck OEMs, including Volvo Trucks North America, a part of investor Volvo Group, as well as Tier 1 brake system and connected-vehicle suppliers. The Peloton investor mix includes a variety of leading global companies, enabling Peloton to collaborate extensively to bring its solutions to international markets. Intel, a co-leader on Peloton’s 2015 Series A round, announced in November 2016 that it will invest $250 million in automated driving solutions.

The image appears to describe the upcoming 300-series chipsets intended for use with the chip giant's "Cannon Lake" processor family. Most notably, the chips are rumored to include support for USB 3.1 (10 Gbps) and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Source: Benchlife Aside from the two new features, the rumored 300-series chipsets look to be pretty similar to existing 200-series offerings. That means they include connectivity for up to 24 lanes of PCIe 3.0, up to 10 USB 3.0 ports, and six 6Gbps SATA ports. Benchlife goes on to say that much like previous generations, there will be a range of chipsets in the 300-series including the whole alphabet soup of Z, Q, H, and B-series models with progressively-reduced capabilities. If this info checks out, you can bet that Wi-Fi will be one of the first things to go as you move down the product stack. The site also says that Intel's next Core chips will be again built on 14-nm technology, something we heard earlier this year. According to that earlier report, it's possible that Cannon Lake desktop processors could come out on a 14-nm process, while mobile processors use a 10-nm process. The new rumors today pertain to the desktop chipsets ("-S" platform), but the benefits of integrating Wi-Fi into the mobile chipsets should be obvious. Benchlife says the desktop Cannon Lake processors are scheduled for release in Q4 of this year. Tags: CPUs Chipsets Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The X370 Gaming Pro Carbon-AC, X370 Gaming Plus, B350 Gaming Plus, and B350 Krait Gaming all belong to the company's Performance Gaming family, marking them as enthusiast-class hardware with an emphasis on stylish design. MSI says the X370 Gaming Pro Carbon-AC is the new flagship for its Socket AM4 Performance Gaming lineup. This board is fundamentally unchanged from the standard X370 Gaming Pro Carbon, except that MSI now throws an Intel Wi-Fi-plus-Bluetooth adapter in the box. With that said, this high-end offering sports a trio of PCIe 3.0 x16 slots, a pair of USB 3.1 ports, and a pair of M.2 sockets. Realtek-powered eight-channel audio and an Intel Gigabit Ethernet controller complement the package. As befits a top-tier model, the X370 Gaming Pro Carbon offers onboard RGB LED lighting. Compared to the flagship model, the B350-chipset version of the Gaming Pro Carbon sacrifices two SATA ports, an M.2 socket, and SLI support. This board otherwise retains its bigger brother's accoutrements, including the USB 3.1 ports. The X370 Gaming Plus and B350 Gaming Plus bear the same edgy black-and-red color scheme common to most of MSI's gaming hardware, and are very similar in appearance as well as function. Almost all of the differences between the two boards come down to their chipsets' feature set. The X370 Gaming Plus comes with three PCIe x16 slots, six 6 Gbps SATA ports, and a pair of USB 3.1 ports. Meanwhile, the B350 Gaming Plus only has a pair of PCIe x16 slots, four SATA ports, and no USB 3.1 ports Both boards use Realtek controllers to provide LAN and audio functionality, and have a single PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 socket. The B350 Gaming Plus does offer some connectivity that its bigger brother doesn't have: two legacy PCI slots. Neither of these boards offers LED lighting. Finally, the B350 Krait Gaming is a little bit fancier than the B350 Gaming Plus above. The Krait is similar to the Gaming Plus in its basic layout, meaning you get two PCIe x16 slots, four DDR4 DIMM slots supporting up to 3200 MT/s, four 6 Gbps SATA ports, and an M.2 socket with four lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity. Since the B350 chipset doesn't offer USB 3.1 support, MSI added an ASMedia controller powering USB 3.1 Type-A and Type-C ports at the rear panel. Lastly, there's backside white LED lighting to provide an ambient glow behind your motherboard. All five boards support for MSI's Mystic Light Sync via onboard RGB LED control headers. MSI didn't announce any prices for the new boards or say when they'll be available. We wager that they'll be showing up at e-tailers any moment now, though.

At the midpoint of that range, Cloudera would raise $195 million at an implied market cap of around $1.66 billion, based on 128 million shares outstanding. Underwriters for the IPO have been granted an overallotment option on an additional 2.25 million shares. Underwriters include Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Allen, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Stifel, JMP Securities and Raymond James. In the filing, Cloudera said that Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) has indicated an interest in acquiring up to 10% of the IPO shares. If Intel were to do so, the chipmaking giant would hold about 21% of Cloudera’s outstanding shares following the offering. Cloudera’s open source-based Hadoop data management platform plays in the same league as Hortonworks Inc. (NASDAQ: HDP) and Box Inc. (NYSE: BOX), neither of which has been able to hold onto its IPO pricing. Hortonworks is down about 60% since its 2014 IPO, and Box is down nearly 30% since its IPO, according to Barron’s. Cloudera’s valuation had declined from $30.92 per share, the amount Intel paid in 2014, to $17.85 in Cloudera’s most recent awards to employees last month. From a one-time valuation of around $4 billion to less than $2 billion is not a particularly good sign for investors.

Are you a gamer in the market for a budget gaming laptop under $700? If you don’t mind tweaking the resolution settings on modern video games down a notch, the brand new Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming laptops are a good buy at a very affordable level. This especially after you discover there’s a release week coupon code slashing prices even further. This week Dell has introduced another budget gaming laptop to its made-for-home Inspiron lineup. The older Insprion 7000 series Gaming Laptops came equipped with the GTX 1050 Ti and are slightly more expensive (the cheapest with 1050 Ti is $833) than the new 5000 series equipped with either the GTX 1050 or the Radeon RX 460 GPU. This makes the newer Insprion 5000 slightly under the power mark of the 7000 series, but nearly $200 cheaper. The new Inspiron 5000 Series Gaming laptop comes in two varieties: AMD or Intel processors. The AMD route is the cheapest way to go with the base configuration only running $637 which is a very impressive price for a gaming capable laptop. The cheapest Inspiron 5000 series gaming laptop with an Intel processor is slightly more expensive at $685, but is also significantly more powerful. New Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming Laptop Deals For all configs $699+ use coupon code: 50OFF699 Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050, 512 SSD, 16GB — $1,076.99 (list $1,150) Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050, 128GB SSD + 1TB, 8GB — $831.99 (list $950) Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming i5-7300HQ, GTX 1050, 256GB SSD, 8GB — $766.99 (list $850) Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming i5-7300HQ, GTX 1050, 8GB, 1TB HDD — $684.99 (list $800) Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming AMD FX-9830P, RX 460, 12GB, 1TB HDD — $684.99 (list $800) Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming AMD A-10 9630P, RX 460, 8GB, 1TB HDD — $636.99 (list $650) Which configuration of the Intel 5000 Series Gaming Laptop is the best value? Well, that depends on what you’re using this machine for. The most expensive $1,077 configuration has pretty impressive specs with a fast booting 512GB solid state drive and a high end 7th gen Core i7 processor. The highest end configuration of the new 5000 series is a hard-to-beat-price for a productivity laptop, but if gaming is your primary purpose consider buying an Inspiron 7000 series or something else entirely as you can get a better graphics card for your money.

The annual Mobile World Congress hosts some of the world's largest communication companies, with many unveiling their latest phones and gadgets. The show runs from February 24 - February 27. (Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images)    Zuckerberg Credits ‘Jewish Mother’ For Turning Down Yahoo’s Early $1 Billion Offer Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 1:19 PM 04/17/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP 5597326 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg credits the willpower to turn down Yahoo’s $1 billion acquisition offer and further his tech company to his “Jewish mother” in a book published earlier this month. The author of the “insider coming-of-age story” writes of a 2009 conversation between 25-year-old Zuckerberg and former CEO of Intel, Andy Grove. “How did you turn down Yahoo’s $1 billion?” Grove asked, according to Business Insider. “I just thought we could do it,” replied Zuckerberg, who was 22 years old at the time of the bid, while citing his belief that his business would grow way larger than people expected. (RELATED: Facebook: Way More Than A Social Media Company) “In that answer, one visionary CEO with willpower recognized another across a chasm of nearly two generations. There was—at that moment—no difference between the two, as the torch passed viscerally from one Silicon Valley era to another,” reads an excerpt from “Becoming Facebook,” a book by Mike Hoefflinger, Facebook’s former director of global business marketing, who also worked at Intel for more than a decade. The passages were made available to Business Insider. Hoefflinger’s perspective is Grove was not asking in an overly critical way, but rather out of sincere curiosity, since at the time of the offer, Facebook only had around eight million users (compared to the billions today). “Where does that willpower come from?” Grove inquired in a follow-up question. “Jewish mother,” Zuckerberg concisely replied. Grove, who was often considered a legend in Silicon Valley, reportedly had several one-on-one meetings with budding entrepreneurs in the tech world, including founders like Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google. Hoefflinger says he’s responsible for connecting Grove and Zuckerberg, after seeing if the fresh-faced recent Harvard graduate wanted to meet with the Silicon Valley veteran. Intel (which Grove led) is not only famous for being a contemporarily influential technology corporation, but for also empowering hundreds of other tech companies to materialize and grow through its revolutionary microprocessors and microchips. Zuckerberg has cited his Jewish heritage before. “I want to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world. After the Paris attacks and hate this week, I can only imagine the fear Muslims feel that they will be persecuted for the actions of others,” Zuckerberg wrote in December of 2015 on his social media profile. “As a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities. Even if an attack isn’t against you today, in time attacks on freedom for anyone will hurt everyone.” Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

It wouldn't make that big of a change in things that don't have to be on the mercy of that link tho. From 2133 to 3200 we can see a huge jump in some games and applications. But not in everything. Like in Hilberts testing on 1080p going from 2133 to 3200 was 13% boost. And in quite a few productivity tests the boost was rather big. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_c...&v=RZS2XHcQdqA and in this you can see few more cases. Is it worth the premium over 2666 or 3000mhz kit is questionable tho. cpy2 Newbie Posts: 16 Joined: 2014-12-30 #5420886 Posted on: 04/15/2017 01:18 PM Go try playing factorio.

It is just for showoff. 1080p gaming is becoming less relevant, even though it is still quite present. You get way past monitor refresh rates, and apart from the pro gaming scene you don't get any benefit over 120hz. 1440p and wide resolution are becoming more popular, and focus is slowly turning to higher res performance. Rendering can benefit to the point from fast memory. But... Music production, that is based on different type of workload, actually benefits quite a lot form high speed memory. Apart from top end CPUs mainstream technology just can't utilize those insane memory speeds.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Channel / Intel pulls the plug on the Intel Developer Forum Intel pulls the plug on the Intel Developer Forum Paul Taylor 15 hours ago Channel, Event, Featured Tech News It was a great run, but Intel Corporation has announced it has pulled the plug on the Intel Developer Forum (IDF). This has left many in the industry with a huge gaping hole in their mid-August agendas, as the staple Intel-branded event now disappears into posterity. The Fall edition, regularly held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and scheduled for August 15 through 18, 2017, has been cancelled after 20 years of non-stop actual newsworthy content. During the past two decades, IDF had been the go-to show for all things Intel – as a journalist you could get in on workshops, masterclasses, demos, get unsuspecting Intel employees on the record without their handler, and even get some insider info on tech that was still under wraps. Others found the event equally valuable, as analysts, partners, customers and the competition made a point of visiting. The event, in recent years, had evolved into the China (Spring)/USA (Fall) format that we’ve become familiar with, although it had also been held in locations such as São Paulo, Brazil, Mumbai in India and Taipei in Taiwan. It had gained such importance, that AMD targeted it for its own brand of “guerrilla marketing” by hijacking Intel guests into a suite across the road and doing their own presentations. The announcement on the IDF website states, “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.” This suggests Intel events will refocus (as they already started with sponsorships and themed events such as MWC), but leaves one pressing question: considering the weight IDF held on the tech community calendar, who will step in to fill up the slot left open by the cancellation? KitGuru Says: IDF has been a great source of information for analysts and journos alike for Intel-related previews and demos, and leaves a huge gaping hole in the event calendar for both Spring and Fall. Other Intel-sponsored shows with a more focused approach will step in, we believe, but nothing as all-encompassing as IDF.

Furthermore, G.Skill has been testing a proof-of-concept kit which ran at "an extreme DDR4-4500MHz speed on the Intel Z270 platform". In such a configuration the RAM provides bandwidth of up to 65GBps (dual channel mode). The latest G.Skill Trident Z memory kit to be announced for the PC enthusiast market consists of DDR4-4333MHz CL19-19-19-39 timing 8GBx2 (16GB) memory modules, at 1.40V. G.Skill claims this speed/capacity represents a PC market first. In the screenshot above you can see the kit being validated on an Asus ROG Maximus IX Apex motherboard with an Intel Core i5-7600K processor installed. Faster In addition to the above validation news, G.Skill has informed us that it is testing even faster DDR4-4400MHz 16GB (8GBx2) memory kits. The screenshot directly above shows this DDR4-4400MHz being stress tested. G.Skill says that the DDR4-4400MHz module kits are still in development and will take 'some time' to be ready for market. And faster G.Skill is always looking to push memory speeds to their max so is working on "Proof-of-Concept DDR4-4500MHz Extreme Speed," memory module kits. Again in 16GB (8GBx2) configuration, G.Skill managed to run its Trident Z modules at DDR4-4500MHz CL19-19-19-39 timing. In its tests on a Asus ROG Maximus IX Apex motherboard it achieved the following; 55GBps read speed, 65GBps write speed, and 52GBps copy speed in dual channel mode. G.Skill has yet to email us with availability or pricing details for its newly validated Trident Z DDR4-4333MHz 16GB (8GBx2) memory kits.

Shame that AMD/Intel and motherboard manufacturers don't officially support such high clocks and require users to overclock the base clock (with varying success) to reach such speeds. At it stands, although Ryzen has had a very successful launch, even reaching 3200MHz (PC25600) – the highest setting currently available before base clock overclocking is required – with two modules rated for that speed is difficult.

Previously, DDR3 DRAM including low-power versions used in tablets, smartphones and notebooks accounted for 84% of total DRAM sales in 2014 and 76% in 2015, but in 2016, DDR4 price premiums evaporated and prices fell to nearly the same ASP as DDR3 DRAMs. A growing number of microprocessors, like Intel's newest 14nm x86 Core processors, now contain DDR4 controllers and interfaces. As a result, IC Insights expects DDR4 to become the dominant DRAM generation in 2017 with 58% market share versus 39% for DDR3. The Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) officially launched the fourth generation of DDR in 2012. In 2014, DDR4 memories first began appearing on the market in DRAM modules for powerful servers and a small number of high-end desktop computers, which had souped-up motherboards or the "extreme" versions of Intel's 22nm Haswell-E processors for high-performance gaming software and PC enthusiasts, but volume sales remained low until 2015, when data centers and Internet companies began loading up servers with the new-generation memories to increase performance and lower power consumption. In 2016, DDR4 memories quickly spread into more data center servers, mainframes, and high-end PCs, accounting for about 45% of total DRAM sales versus 20% in 2015. In 2017, DDR4 will move into more notebooks, high-end tablets and smartphones and is expected to hold a 58% share of DRAM sales. The DDR4 standard contains a number of features that are expected to speed up memory operations and increase SDRAM storage in servers, notebook and desktop PCs, tablet computers, and a wide range of consumer electronics, IC Insights said. The DDR4 standard supports stacked memory chips with up to eight devices presenting a single signal load to memory controllers. Compared to DDR3, DDR4 can potentially double the module density, double the speed, and lower power consumption up to 20%, thereby extending battery life in future 64-bit tablets and smartphones. Meanwhile, the DRAM average selling price has been increasing very rapidly since mid-2016, IC Insights identified. The DRAM ASP increased 54% from US$2.41 in April 2016 to US$3.70 in February 2017. As a result of this big increase, IC Insights raised its 2017 DRAM market forecast to US$57.3 billion, which is a 39% increase over 2016. IC Insights believes that DRAM ASPs will continue to trend upward through most of the first half of 2017, though probably not as rapidly as they did between the period from April 2016 to February 2017. In its latest quarterly financial conference call, Micron indicated its DRAM outlook through the balance of its fiscal year 2017 (ending August 31) was very encouraging, with solid demand coming from PC, server, communication, automotive, and several other applications. However, the bigger question for Micron and other top DRAM suppliers is available supply and whether (more accurately, when will) prices plateau and begin trending downward, IC Insights noted. One indication that DRAM prices could soften in the second half of the year is the fact that Samsung and SK Hynix are bringing additional DRAM capacity online that features smaller process geometries. Samsung is slated to begin operations at its new Fab 18 in Pyeongtaek, South Korea in the second quarter of 2017. Fab 18, with capacity of 300,000 300mm wafer starts per month, features five production lines that are dedicated primarily to making DRAM. The company plans to begin DRAM operations at the fab using an 18nm process technology. SK Hynix has transitioned most of its South Korean-based DRAM output from Fab M10 to Fab M14. With Fab M14 and its dedicated DRAM fab in Wuxi, China, SK Hynix has DRAM capacity of about 280,000 300mm wafer starts per month. SK Hynix is manufacturing most of its DRAM at the 21nm node, but expects to begin using sub-20nm process technology later in 2017, thereby helping to reduce costs and increase the number of chips on a wafer. Following a year of extraordinary gains in pricing, a boost to DRAM supply in the second half of 2017 could lead to reduced ASPs and the inevitable start of a cyclical slowdown in the DRAM market, IC Insights said. IC Insights believes that for at least the first half of 2017, it appears that DRAM market will be very favorable for Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron.

Intel's OpenCL Beignet Implementation Expands Support For Doubles Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 17 April 2017 at 06:15 AM EDT. Add A Comment Intel's Beignet open-source project that provides an OpenCL implementation for Iris/HD Graphics on Linux has landed many commits over night. The 70+ commits are about expanding support for the double-precision floating-point data type. It appears the support for doubles in Beignet is now much more vetted but have yet to see any Beignet developers make any formal comment on the patches or in the mailing list. The latest Beignet patches can be found in Git as we await the project's next release. It was just last week as well that they landed LLVM 4.0 support for their back-end.

Smith | April 15, 2017 MORE $2300 Editors' rating: The Pros Great gaming and overall performance; Stunning 4K, G-Sync display; Attractive design; Comfortable keyboard; Lots of customization options The Cons Very expensive; Below-average battery life Verdict The Origin PC Eon17-X delivers great performance for all your gaming, virtual reality and multitasking needs and offers a deep well of customization options. Review Desktop processors, Pascal GPUs and a stunning display: That's what awesome gaming laptops are made of, and the Origin PC Eon17-SLX is the proof in the proverbial pudding. Priced at $3,682, the 17.3-inch system offers power, speed and beauty with a ridiculous amount of customization options. If you can afford its extremely high price, the Eon17-X is something that has to be seen and played to be believed. article continued below Design From here on out, I'm calling the Origin Eon17-X "afternoon delight," because it most definitely looks like a skyrocket in flight. Origin PC switched things up a bit, adding a slate-gray, brushed-aluminum panel that separates and accentuates the pair of dark-gray, metal speaker grilles and the rest of the lid, which is made of matte-black plastic. The light gray Origin emblem, reminiscent of a far-flung galaxy, is prominently centered at the top. The laptop's interior consists of black matte plastic, which is nice, but a soft-touch finish would have been better. That gray aluminum from the lid also makes an appearance, wrapping over the rear of the notebook to frame the power button and its glossy status-indicator bar. The keyboard resides in a large recess below the power button and above the unassuming touchpad. Like any self-respecting gaming battlestation, the Eon17-X has a ton of ports that support several displays, a couple of mice, and an external hard drive or two. There's a pair of USB 3.0 ports on the left with a secure lock slot and jacks for headphones, microphone, audio-out and S/PDIF. On the left, are two more USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port, a Thunderbolt 3, Gigabit Ethernet and a 6-in-1 card reader. Along the system's rear, you'll find a pair of mini DisplayPorts and the power jack. Weighing a hefty 9.8 pounds, the 16.4 x 11.6 x 1.6 inch Eon17-X isn't what I'd call portable. But it's on a par with the Acer Predator 17 X (16.7 x 12.7 x 1.8 inches) and Alienware 17 R4 (16.7 x 13.1 x 1.2 inches), which weigh 9.8 and 9.6 pounds, respectively. The Asus ROG G701VI (16.9 x 12.2 x 1.3 inches) and Razer Blade Pro (16.7 x 11 x 0.88 inches) are noticeably lighter, at 7.9 and 7.8 pounds. Display Whoever thinks that matte displays don't have vivid colors clearly hasn't seen the Eon17-X's 17.3-inch, 3840 x 2160 screen. Watching the 4K "Tears of Steel" trailer, I was bombarded by a parade of neon blues and hot pinks juxtaposed against the mundanity of verdant suburbia. Details were so sharp that I could see the gears and servos in the actress's robot hand. The screen only helped to accentuate the inherent beauty of the Mass Effect: Andromeda universe. As I explored an alien vault, the long-dormant blue structure sprang to life, sending emerald green light pulsing through intricate paths carved into the structures. A mysterious black liquid undulated below, enticing me with its unctuous surface. The Eon17-X's screen can reproduce an amazing 196 percent of the sRGB gamut, far surpassing the 122-percent desktop-replacement category average. The Blade Pro wasn't too far behind, at 185 percent, while the Predator 17 X delivered 182 percent. The Alienware 17 and G701VI were tied, at 113 percent. Not only is the Eon17-X's panel incredibly vivid, but it's also very accurate, posting a score of 0.14 during the Delta-E test, in which0 is the ideal. That's much better than the 1.3 average as well as the 2.3, 1.6 and 0.5 achieved by the Blade Pro, G701VI and Alienware 17. The Predator 17 X produced a good score of 0.18. When we measured for brightness, the Eon17-X stumbled a bit, averaging 289 nits, which is a bit below the 293-nit average, but better than the G701VI, which hit 277 nits. The Eon17-X's score wasn't enough, however, to outshine the Blade (304 nits), Predator 17 (318 nits) or Alienware 17 (340 nits). In addition to its superhigh resolution, the display also has Nvidia's G-Sync technology built in. That means the laptop's display rate is synchronized with the graphics card, essentially placing a frame cap that matches the panel limit. That makes for near-instant rendering in both full-screen and windowed modes, thus eliminating any tears and leaving smooth images and happy gamers. Audio Thanks to the speakers, subwoofer and Creative's Sound Blaster X-Fi MB5 software, the Eon17-X has some kick-ass sound. Loud, detailed and balanced, the laptop sounded amazing whether it was producing the deep, penetrating bass lines on Kendrick Lamar's "Humble" or the tense strings punctuated by the high-pitched whine of a laser rail gun charging before unleashing a torrent of blue-white hell upon my foes. Keyboard and Touchpad Typing in the Eon17-X's traditional keyboard is like typing on a bunch of tiny springs. There's even a small click with each key (1.5-millimeter key travel with 73 grams of actuation). I easily hit my 65-word-per-minute average on the 10FastFingers Typing test. My one gripe with the keyboard is the first-party app used to program Hot Keys and backlighting. Although it gets the job done, it's not as refined as Alienware's AlienFX software, Razer's cloud-based Synapse or even MSI's Dragon Gaming Center. I'd like a better way to select color and a few more effects to boot. I had plenty of room to perform two-finger scroll and rotate on the 4.2 x 2.4-inch Synaptics touchpad. Whether I used pinch-zoom to enlarge text or launched Cortana with a three-finger tap, the response was fast and responsive. Origin PC is one of the few manufacturers that give gamers the option of embedding a fingerprint scanner on the touchpad. While playing Mass Effect, Witcher 3 or Hitman isn't a state secret, I like the idea that my game saves and actual work have an extra layer of security between them and prying eyes. The scanner supports Windows Hello and is pretty simple to set up; just tap your finger on the scanner a few times to register the digit, and you're ready to go. Gaming, Graphics and VR Go ahead, switch those settings to Ultra and turn on ALL the shaders. The Eon17-X can handle all of that, thanks to its Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU with 8GB of VRAM. Currently the most powerful mobile graphics chip available, the GTX 1080 will deliver excellent frame rates at 1080p and mixed results on 4K. The GPU is also VR-ready, so feel free to whip out that HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. The Eon17-X got 11 on the SteamVR Performance test, easily beating the 9.3 desktop-replacement average. Armed with their own GTX 1080 GPUs, The Predator 17 X, Alienware 17, G701VI and Blade Pro also hit 11. Benchmarks are cool, but actual playtime is better. I had a blast winging glowing purple Spectral Knives at my opponent in The Unspoken. While I was teleporting frantically around the arena, dodging flaming skulls and throwing magical playing cards, the Eon17-X kept pace with the action. Even when I summoned the arena golem and the fighting got really hectic, there was never any slowdown. The Eon 17-X continued to deliver great performance on our benchmarks, notching 66 fps on the Rise of the Tomb Raider test (1080p on Very High), matching the Predator 17. It beat the 51-fps average as well as the Blade Pro (65 fps) and Alienware 17 (62 fps) but not the G701VI, which got 71 fps.  MORE: The Best Gaming Laptops   When we ran the Hitman benchmark, the Eon17-X produced an excellent 129 fps at 1080p, cruising past the 81-fps average. The Alienware 17 wasn't too far behind, with 110, while the Blade Pro and Predator obtained 103 and 60 fps each. Switching the resolution setting to 4K saw the Eon17-X's frame rate drop to 59 fps, which was just behind the Predator 17's 60 fps. At 1440p, the Alienware 17 achieved 87 fps. During the Grand Theft Auto V test, the Eon17-X delivered 84 fps, which was enough to top the 73-fps average. The Predator 17, Alienware 17 and Blade Pro scored lower, at 83, 82 and 65 fps, respectively. However, the G701VI managed to secure the lead, with 90 fps. On the Metro: Last Light benchmark, the Eon17-X got 83 fps, surpassing the 59-fps category average but not the G701VI's score of 90 fps. The Alienware 17 (80 fps), Predator 17 (79 fps) and Blade Pro (65 fps) all scored lower. Overall Performance Sure, Origin PC could have slapped a regular old mobile processor in the Eon17-X, but where's the fun in that? Instead, the system has a 4.2-GHz Intel Core i7-7700K desktop CPU with 16GB of RAM, which can be overclocked if you're so inclined. I had 40 open Google Chrome tabs, some of which had live streams, TweetDeck and other resource-sapping material, all while running a system scan in Windows Defender. The Eon17-X never hit any lag and carried on, unbothered by the whole ordeal. The Eon17-X did equally well on synthetic tests such as Geekbench 4, on which it scored 14,491, beating the 13,250 desktop-replacement average. It also performed better than the Blade Pro (11,702, Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU) and Alienware 17 (14,154, Intel Core i7-7820HK CPU). Sporting overclocked Intel Core i7-7820HK CPUs, the Predator 17 and G701VI achieved 14,795 and 17,404, respectively. When we tested File Transfer speeds, the Eon17-X's 512GB NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD (with a 1TB 7,200-rpm hard drive) duplicated 4.97GB of multimedia files in 5 seconds. That translates into a transfer speed of 1,017.9 megabytes per second. That's fast, certainly faster than the 574.2MBps average and the Blade Pro's (dual 256GB PCIe SSD) score of 391.5MBps and the Alienware 17's (512GB SSD) showing of 282MBps. The Predator 17 (dual 256GB PCIe SSD) and G701VI (dual 512GB SSD) got 1,272.3 and 1,272.4MBps. During the OpenOffice Spreadsheet Macro test, the Eon17-X matched up 20,000 pairs of names and addresses in 3 minutes and 47 seconds. It's slower than the 3:25 average, but better than the Blade Pro's 4:06. The Predator 17, G701VI and Alienware 17 had faster times of 3:41, 2:59 and 1:47. Battery Life When you have desktop processors and top-notch GPUs, you're going to pay the price somewhere. In the case of the Eon17-X, you're sacrificing battery life. MORE: Laptops with the Longest Battery Life The system lasted only 1 hour and 39 minutes on our battery test, which consists of continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi. That mark is well short of the 4:14 average, but the Eon17-X's competitors did only marginally better. The Predator 17 notched 1:58, while the Blade Pro and Alienware 17 clocked in with 2:45 and 2:46. The G701VI lasted the longest, at 3:27. Heat I understand that a system this powerful needs fans to keep things cool, but the ones on the Eon17-X can get a bit distracting. Once I booted up Mass Effect: Andromeda, it sounded like a small turbine was hovering above my desk. Turning the speakers up kills the heavy whirring noises, but in a quiet space, you'll definitely hear the fans. Loud or not, the fans do what they're supposed to: keep things nice and frosty -- at least, they do so on the top of the device. After 15 minutes of running around Andromeda, the touchpad measured a cool 83 degrees Fahrenheit. The touchpad hit 92 degrees, while the undercarriage blew a hot 119 degrees, which is above our 95-degree comfort threshold. However, you probably wouldn't put this behemoth on your lap. Once things cooled down, we streamed 15 minutes of a high-definition YouTube video. Everything was at acceptable temperatures, with the touchpad, center and bottom measuring 76, 91 and 86 degrees, respectively. Webcam The Eon17-X's integrated 1080p webcam takes color-accurate, but fuzzy pictures and video. It captured the exact shade of my electric-blue shirt as well as the orange of some of the boxes on my desk. But like with most laptop webcams, the detail left much to be desired; visual noise plagued the image, making it difficult to discern any finer details. Software and Warranty Thankfully, Origin PC didn't bog the Eon17-X down with a ton of unnecessary bloatware. There is some, including Sling, Twitter and Facebook, but it's nowhere near what you'd find on other systems. Useful software includes Nvidia GeForce Experience, which has several game-centric apps such as Game Optimization and ShadowPlay for live-streaming. You also get Killer Networking, so you can prioritize network bandwidth. Finally, there's DataColor's Spyder4Elite software, which lets you calibrate the color on the display. Origin PC ships the Eon17-X with lifetime 24/7 support, lifetime free labor, one-year part replacement and a 45-day shipping warranty. Configurations I had a blast saving the galaxy on the $3,577 configuration of the Eon17-X, which is jam-packed with high-end specs, including a 4.2-GHz Intel Core i7-7700K desktop CPU with 16GB of RAM, 512GB NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD with a 1TB 7,200-rpm hard drive, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU with 8GB of VRAM and a 3840 x 2160 Nvidia G-Sync display. The $1,883 base model has a 4.2-GHz Intel Core i3-7350K desktop processor, 8GB of RAM, a 250GB SSD, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU with 6GB of VRAM and a 1920 x 1080 G-Sync display. When it comes to customization, Origin PC is king. From laptop chassis to fingerprint readers, you can tweak just about everything about your new laptop. You can choose from five different CPUs, three GPUS and a whopping 35 RAM options, just to name a few of your options. The company also offers overclocking and screen-calibration services. Just keep in mind that creating the gaming system of your dreams can quickly add up. One minute you're buying a laptop, and the next you're forking out enough dough for a down payment on a car. Bottom Line Damn, Origin PC does it again. The Eon17-X has an all-star cast of specs, including a desktop Core i7 processor, an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU and an incredibly vivid display that's been enhanced with Nvidia's G-Sync technology. Toss in a crazy-fast PCIe SSD, and you've got a certified winner. That's before you start tinkering with Origin PC's extensive list of customizations. Want a blue metallic laptop with a color-calibrated display, an overclocked processor, 64GB of RAM and a pair of 2TB SSDs in RAID configuration? Go ahead, but it's going to cost you. As it stands, many users will find the $3,682 version of the system out of financial reach. For $2,999, you can get the Acer Predator 17 X, which is every bit the powerhouse the Eon17-X is, and in some cases, more so. However, you'll lose out on the customization options. But if you're looking for pie-in-the-sky levels of performance and ostentatiousness, the Eon17-X can't be beat.

They have outscored humans in classifying still images—at least sort-of. They have defeated world champions at chess and go. They have become the tool of choice for big-data analysis challenges, from customer service to medical diagnosis. They have shown that, once trained, they can be compact enough to fit in a smart phone. So have we reached the end of history for artificial intelligence ? Or is this just the crest of one wave in a much larger ocean? One answer to that question might come from the plethora of other approaches to AI now jostling for attention. Granted there are always alternatives to a successful technology, if only because every PhD candidate has to find something unique to write about, and every patent has to be circumvented. But many of the alternatives to deep-learning networks today have grown over time out of real issues with conventional static networks like AlexNet. Many are solving real problems and showing up in production systems.

In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realized there aren't enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there's a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can't do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas - and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. "Just relying on data from the roads is not practical," said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the US in 2020. "With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again." As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that's very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros. to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that's been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren't crucial components.) Continued below.

The idea isn't that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game "is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from," said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What's learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Quick Brown Fox Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn't responded properly, "we're able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself," Waymo said in a self-driving project report. "If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes." At Toyota Motor Corp.'s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to "break the system" through what's known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That's the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should "be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing," with follow-up validation. That's the road developers are increasingly traveling.

Supplier Razer www.razerzone.com Price $1849 AUD > Pricing info Specs 12.5-inch QHD display; Intel 7th Gen Core i7-7500U CPU (twin-core, HyperThreaded, 3.5GHz Turbo Boost frequency); 16GB DDR4 memory; 240GB Samsung NVMe PCIe SSD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback Incremental updates to an already fantastic Ultrabook. We were huge fans of the first Razer Blade Stealth, Razer’s entry into the ultraportable market in 2016, to the point where this author now relies on one as his daily laptop. It was super thin and light, with one of the sexiest screens we’ve seen, yet came with a relatively affordable price point. Razer has just released the second itineration of the Stealth, but it’s now facing stiff competition from the likes of Dell and Acer. Can the latest version live up to the reputation of the original?  It appears that the new Stealth uses an identical chassis to the original, which is a mere 13mm deep. This means it’s not the thinnest ultraportable around, but it does have one of the most rugged cases in this category, built from CNC aluminium. There’s extremely little flex apparent on the screen, while the keyboard doesn’t bend in the slightest, even with the heaviest of touches. Yet it’s still a relatively lightweight unit, hitting a mere 1.29kg, but is about 30% heavier than some of the lightest Ultrabooks such as the latest MacBook. One feature that shone bright with the original Blade was its gorgeous screen, which pumped out some of the richest, delicious colours we’ve seen. The new version comes with the same 12.5-inch QHD display as standard, which has a resolution of 2560 x 1440, and it’s just as pretty. There’s also a 4K option, which is pure overkill for such a small screen, as the 234 pixels per inch of the QHD screen is already crystal clear. If there’s one thing that is a bummer, it’s the glossy finish, which can make viewing the screen in direct sunlight a real challenge. The other major improvement is battery life, with Razer claiming a 15% boost in battery capacity. Combine this with Intel’s new 7th Gen Core CPU, which is a power sipper, and it will definitely last longer on a full charge than the original. Unfortunately we encountered some very strange issues with not one, but two of these laptops. Neither would charge when connected to our home’s electrical system, no matter which power cord or power point we used... until it randomly started working. As a result, we were able to test battery life, which came in at 219 minutes in PCMark 8 Home’s battery test, which wasn’t quite as good as we’d hoped. However, just after finishing this review, we were informed by Razer that our issues were a software problem, which will be resolved via a software update from the Razer site. Speaking of the CPU, our review sample came with Intel’s i7-7500U processor. It’s only a twin-cored chip, versus the quad-cores found in the original’s i5-6500U, but the inclusion of HyperThreading helps boost performance. More importantly, it can hit a Turbo Boost frequency of 3.5GHz, yet still only has a 15W TDP. This is a huge drop compared to the 65W TDP of the original model’s CPU. 16GB of DDR4 memory is excellent for this price, but once again we find an Ultrabook that has ultra-small amounts of storage. In the $1,849 model we tested, a single Samsung NVMe 240GB PCIe SSD is included. We’d highly recommend updating this to a larger model for just a few hundred dollars more.  Performance was very solid for such an affordable, portable machine, with a PCMark 8 Home Accelerated score of 3303. This is a large leap over the 2506 points we measured with the first version, though we think that one suffered a little throttling as it was tested in the hot and humid climate of Taipei. This is a little odd though considering our original version had a quad-cored chip; perhaps running two cores without throttling works out to deliver better overall performance than a quad-core chip that must lower its speed when the going gets tough? Other than the new CPU and improved battery life, everything else is much of a muchness, with identical I/O configuration. The integrated GPU is a slight improvement as well, moving up to the Intel HD Graphics 620, which includes huge improvements when it comes to 4K hardware accelerated playback. It’s still no gamer though, hitting a mere 6744 in the extremely lightweight 3DMark Cloud Gate gaming test. We’re still very big fans of the latest incarnation of the Stealth, yet it’s now facing incredibly tough competition from the Acer Spin 7, which is thinner and convertible, though about 10% slower.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Your Nvidia Titan Xp has little to fear Home Hardware What Xbox ‘Project Scorpio’ means for PC gaming By Jeremy Laird on April 13th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Microsoft has dished the deets on its upcoming ‘Scorpio’ hardware update for the Xbox console, and in what amounts to uncharacteristic detail and candour given the ruddy thing isn’t going on sale until the end of 2017. But what are we poor PC peasants to make of the Beast of Redmond’s latest game box and its towering on-paper capabilities? In short, what influence will Project Scorpio’s trick new hardware have on future PC games? As ever with such developments, there is no single and simple answer. Scorpio’s hardware is at the very least a tale of two halves even if they are crammed into a single computer chip or SoC. I speak, of course, of the critical CPU and graphics elements. The media razzmatazz has largely centred on the graphics half of the equation and there’s no denying Scorpio packs some serious pixel-pumping power for a grotty little games console. The headline figures for the GPU rock in at 40 so-called compute units running at 1,172MHz. That compares with ye olde Xbox One’s 12 units at 853MHz and the One S with the same number again, albeit running at 914MHz. It’s AMD, of course, who supplies both the graphics and the CPU designs for the Xbox and, in the Red Team’s standard parlance, a compute unit packs 64 of those, er, shader thingies that make the pixels look so very pretty. We’re talking 768 shaders in the Xbox One and 2,560 of the bump-mapping blighters in Scorpio. If that sounds impressive, AMD’s current fastest GPU, the elderly Radeon R9 Fury X packs 4,096 shaders. And lest you forget, the Fury X is a generation behind and not nearly as fast as Nvidia’s best GPU du jour, the preposterous Titan Xp. On the CPU side of the Scorpio equation, Microsoft has stuck with eight low-power AMD Jaguar-derived cores, albeit running upclocked from 1.75GHz to 2.3Ghz and benefiting from several detail tweaks. The other major part of the package involves the memory and bandwidth combo, which in these consoles is a little more complex given the single-chip architecture means shared memory for GPU and CPU. Anyway, there’s a healthy uptick here too, from 218GB/s and 8GB to 326GB/s and 12GB. The very first observation to make is that while Scorpio moves the game on massively for consoles, it is not exactly frightening today’s high-end PC hardware, much less what will be available when Scorpio actually arrives and, in turn, the PC hardware that will appear over Scorpio’s lifetime. For some perspective, consider that main Scorpio CPU-GPU-SoC thing as a whole clocks in at seven billion transistors. That’s for everything – the CPU, the graphics, the other SoC gubbins, the lot. Nvidia’s biggest GPU, as found in the silly new Titan Xp and indeed the slightly more sensible 1080Ti, packs no fewer than 12 billion transistors. Add billions more for Intel’s finest CPU and a bleeding edge PC’s CPU and GPU alone are more than twice as complex. Even the next tier down in Nvidia’s GPU range, the GTX 1070 and the vanilla GTX 1080 are alone about on a par for complexity with the unified Scorpio chip. So while consoles tend to do more with less, there’s a limit to that philosophy. The PC’s performance and fidelity advantage isn’t being challenged. That’s especially true when it comes to the CPU side of things. Put simply, Scorpio’s CPU cores continue to suck. A fair bit of Microsoft guff has been regurgitated by the tame media regarding Scorpio’s modified cores, the reduced internal latency, 31 per cent faster core clocks, how the new SoC is more customised than before. But I’m not terribly impressed. Clearly, they’re still mostly the the same crappy low-power cores as before, not proper desktop cores. Ermegerd, is that a magnetic hard drive? Put another way, remember what a kicking AMD got for the poor performance of its outgoing FX PC processor? Well, it’s a hell of a lot better than the CPU in any Xbox, including Scorpio. Even AMD’s new Ryzen CPU has been taking a bit of a beating for supposed iffy gaming performance. It would completely obliterate the feeble cores in Scorpio. That’s the disappointing bit, then: That the initial development target for a lot of games for several years to come will still be a system with pretty pathetic CPU cores. The rub here is that while it’s relatively straightforward to add at least some graphical detail to a game when porting for the PC (just chucking in some high res textures can do a power of good for the look of a game), taking advantage of additional PC processor power tends to require a more fundamental rethink of the game engine and indeed the game itself. Which, let’s be honest, isn’t usually going to happen. The exception to all this and what might – just might – prove a saving grace, is the new so-called GPU Command Processor in Scorpio. It’s basically a section of dedicated circuitry on the main SoC design to run DirectX 12 API invocations. In English? Think of it as a DX12 hardware accelerator for some of the more CPU-intensive bits of the game engine like draw calls. It could be a game changer by freeing up even Scorpio’s weak CPU cores to do interesting and innovative things. But it’s far too early to say for sure. If that’s the bad and yet-to-be-proven news, the good is that Scorpio’s focus on pukka 4K capability means that developers will put a lot of effort into making games look great at high resolutions. To pinch a quote from Kevin Gammill, Group Program Director of the Xbox Core platform, “it’s about delivering those pixels with 4K assets, so they look great. It’s about delivering those pixels with HDR and wide colour gamut fidelity. It’s about delivering those pixels with no loss of frame-rate compared to the 1080p version of that title – that’s super-important to us.” In other words, proper high-res textures, geometry and effects that on the one hand really make the most of the detail 4K can deliver and on the other are optimised to reduce performance overheads. And, of course, Scorpio should accelerate the development of games with proper HDR support, which is just another string in developer’s bows when it comes to making games look awesome. Of course, you very likely don’t have a 4K PC screen and you almost certainly don’t have an HDR monitor. But all that should still benefit PC-relevant resolutions like 2,560 by 1,440, otherwise known as 1440p, that sit in between full 4K and 1080p. One part of the Scorpio graphical package for which the benefits to the PC remain to be seen involves tweaks to the graphics engine that go beyond simply adding more functional units. Apparently, Microsoft and presumably AMD took a good look at how developers actually make game engines and then tweaked detailed aspects of the graphics architecture to suit. That’s not going to help existing PC graphics cards. But will we see any of those same hardware tweaks in AMD’s new Vega GPUs, due later this year? My guess is that we may see some similar elements, but probably not everything. So the benefit-cost calculation for the PC in that regard remains to be seen. Overall, Scorpio looks like it’ll be a great thing for PC gaming in terms of plain old eye candy. Whether it will enable more innovation and complexity at the core of game engines is a tougher question and will likely depend on how that funky hardware DX12 setup engine in the Scorpio SoC pans out.

There are still better Intel chips (usually for more money) but with R5, Ryzen looks to be at LEAST comparable price/performance wise. It’s a shame that Scorpio doesn’t seem to be enjoying the Ryzen improvements.

Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:38 particlese says: They’re supposedly also stuffing all the Freesync 2 stuff into the thinger, which should mean low-faff HDR/high-bpp/wide-gamut capabilities will (hopefully) catch on sooner than if it were just AMD pleading with display companies to make things lovelier for us. It’ll spread the joy of non-proprietary variable refresh rate around a bit more, too, although I haven’t myself found that to be the revelatory feature some profess it to be. On the minus side, that’ll all supposedly be implemented exclusively via HDMI, so they’re missing the opportunity to encourage display manufacturers to bung our lovely royalty-free display port into their super-sized photon launchers. Not that it makes a ton of difference in practice, but HDMI is the only display interface which has ever caused me problems, and it did so for a while in various ways, so I tend to be a jerk to it when the opportunity presents itself. So basically, I’d love to someday see a 50″+ screen with Display Port, high (120Hz+) refresh rates which aren’t just marketing “features”, and user-friendly HDR/bpp/gamutStuff; and this newfangled thinger looks to be encouraging much of that. Hooray! Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:47 The Almighty Moo says: Any thoughts on it’s out of he box support for the new FreeSync and HDMI standards Jeremy? I know you covered the standards themselves in a previous article, but I’d be interested to know your thoughts on the effects of this support on the PC / Monitor market. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:46 Jeremy Laird says: Good question. First part of the answer would involve the extent to which games use monitors on consoles. I don’t know the answer to that, but my hunch is the heavy majority of consoles are hooked up to TVs. That said, I happen to know from some corporate work I did recently that at least some monitor makers are very keen to sell screens to console gamers. So, I’d expect at least some to try to crack the market by offering a ‘full’ console experience. Whether TVs will fully support it all is a separate question. Do TV makers engineer for console specifically? Honestly, I don’t know. My knowledge of that aspect of the TV market is pretty thin. That said, HDR is quickly becoming the norm as is HDMI 2.0. My experience recently with an HDR TV is that everything works much more seamlessly than before. Hooking a modern PC up to a 4K TV is a non issue in terms of the res, if not perhaps HDR functionality, for now. That said, I think that most of the features of Freesync 2 if not necessarily Freesync 2 itself along with higher bandwidth interfaces are going to become pretty common. Things have been developing pretty fast in the last couple of years and I don’t see that stopping. Displays just keep getting better. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 14:17 funkstar says: Don’t TVs have to support variable refresh rate if they want to be HDMI 2.1 compliant? According to DigitalFoundry, Scorpio supports *both* Freesync AND the new HDMI VRR standard, so TV manufacturers should be covered Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:10 SquarePeg says: The reason for Jaguar cores in the Xbox Scorpio is backward compatibility. All Xbox and PS4 games till now are built from the ground up for the Jaguar CPU architecture. They wouldn’t run on Ryzen’s “Zen” architecture without an update for every current gen game ever made. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:36 Jeremy Laird says: Jaguar is x86. Ryzen is x86. They are cross compatible except where Ryzen has additional extensions. Ryzen is in effect a superset of Jaguar in terms of the instruction set. So basically, no. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 10:33 Sakkura says: There could perhaps be some very low-level optimizations, like accounting for the timing of how many cycles the architecture will spend on different instructions and structuring the code to take optimal advantage of that… but who would even give a crap about losing such optimization advantages if you were moving from Jaguar to Zen? The latter can easily overcome that deficit, and more to boot. So you’re right. It’s about cost and cooling. Zen is still new stuff, and AMD knows it’s finally got a CPU architecture people will actually pay for. So the price tag would be higher. And while Zen is surprisingly efficient, it’s still a high-power/high-performance architecture optimized for running at higher clocks.

Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 10:47 Asurmen says: Well, Scorpio does have more than four times the power? Also capability is more than just tflops. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 13:07 Don Reba says: Ah, yes, you’re right, I did the math and it is indeed a bit more than 4x rendering power. And when you increase the number of pixels by 4, you pretty much just need 4 times the rendering power. Geometry and fragment shaders don’t take up a large proportion of the computation budget. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 13:59 Sakkura says: On the other hand, the Xbox One usually doesn’t render at 1080p anyway. It’s typically 1600×900 or 1280×720 that then gets upscaled to 1080p. So if we say the Xbox One is capable of 1600×900, and Scorpio is capable of 5 times that much, that’s still a little short of 3840×2160. I suspect we’ll be seeing a lot of games rendering at 2560×1440 and upscaling to 4K. Maybe even 1080p upscaled as well. That will still look very nice on a TV, much better than 720p or 900p upscaled to 1080p. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 14:41 funkstar says: According to DF (going by MS reports) performance testing indicates that all 900p and above titles should hit 4k at the same framerates 14/04/2017 at 16:35 Kinsky says: The Xbox One is barely capable of 1080p and forces developers to employ shortcuts galore to achieve even 900p in some cases, such as using uncompressed video/audio files to reduce CPU load, lower texture resolution, lower poly models, and noisy postprocessing effects like bloom and motion blur to cover up the ugly. Scorpio is setting 4K as its target, but seems barely capable of that as well. This likely means we can continue to expect multi-platform releases and ports (i.e. Battlefield) to have ridiculously bloated installation sizes, poor texture resolution, an over-reliance on postprocessing effects, all that sort of thing. But hey, at least they can put a cool-looking bullet point on the console’s features page. 16/04/2017 at 16:51 fish99 says: Given that most xbone games are 30 fps and Microsoft have said they’re targetting 4K 60fps for the Scorpio, they need more than 4x the performance. And as pointed out above a lot of xbone games don’t even run 1080p. Of course the reality is Microsoft can’t force developers to target 60fps, and most of them would prefer to make the game look better at 30fps since they think it sells better in console land (i.e. the bulk of console games want shiny over smooth). Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 06:32 ElementalAlchemist says: Anyone expecting Scorpio to suddenly change things for PC needs to reign in their expectations. This is not a new generation of consoles, it’s not an Xbox 4, in the same way a PS4 Pro is not a PS5. The baseline/lowest common denominator for game development (excluding the Switch) is still the original Xbone. Games are still going to be developed first and foremost to run on that and the original PS4. All Scorpio will do is (notionally) provide some higher framerates and resolutions (and the jury is out on just how well it will actually perform in practice). So nothing will change for PC going forward in the short to medium turn. We’ll still get the same poorly optimised ports that, on a design basis, are hamstrung by the hardware limitations of the Xbone. Log in to Reply 15/04/2017 at 14:18 scritty says: While games still have to work on the Xbone, all the extra graphical fluff in the world is not going to make these new iterations world beaters. Also CPU speed is vital for many genres of games. Not FPS and 3rd person action games so much, but games where many AI agents are used (like RTS games, 4X games and most strategy games) being hamstrung with an old – if up clocked Jaguar CPU means these consoles will lag a long way behind even a low end PC in all those genres. But all I see on consoles is one 1st person shooter and 3rd person action game and the odd annual updated sports franchise after another, and I guess if that’s all you ever want to play… more power to you. They offer good value. I don’t play games like those though so consoles offer no value for me at all. The day Dwarf Fortress comes out on console and allows me to have over 2000 dorfs and other AI entities in play at one time with no lag? Is the day I consider buying one.

Expensive as all hell, but it looked damn good for the price and had some of the best hardware around. But we're not in 2013 anymore. Competitors are starting to catch up, and the classic Razer styling is starting to age. But if you want a gaming laptop for under $3000 that's thin enough to cart around at work, the Blade still gets the job done. What Is It? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker The Razer Blade is the middleweight of Razer's gaming laptops, with the Razer Blade Stealth targeted at the Macbook Air/Surface Pro crowd and the 17-inch Blade Pro a full desktop replacement, complete with a GTX 1080. The Blade is decidedly more affordable than the Pro, and a lot more portable too. A 14" laptop with a 1080p matte or 4K screen, all models ship with Intel's Kaby Lake i7-7700HQ (2.8GHz base clock speed, 3.8GHz boost). 3x USB 3.0 ports come as standard, as well as a single USB-C port and 16GB of unspecified DDR4-2400MHz memory. You'll get a GeForce GTX 1060 6GB model no matter what. The cheapest Blade will set you back just under $2800 and comes with a 256GB PCIe M.2 SSD drive. There's still a massive premium on extra storage: the 512GB model with a 1080p screen is $3099.95, and those who need the 1TB drive will have to fork over $3699.95. Both units come with a 165W power adapter. The 1080p model weighs in at 1.86kg, while the 4K Blade is a little chunkier at 1.95kg. The dimensions for either at 17.9mm x 345mm x 235mm (h/w/d), which is reasonably thin, but not the thinnest around. You can expect the usual standards as well: a webcam, support for Razer's Chroma peripherals suite, an in-built microphone, 3.5mm headphone jack, Bluetooth 4.1 support and a Killer wireless card. The keyboard, touchpad and chassis are the same as what's in the Razer Blade Stealth, which can you read about below. Every Blade purchase also comes with a copy of For Honor or Ghost Recon: Wildlands, an indie top-down shooter called Livelock and FL Studio 12 Producer Edition, software for music production. The 4K version isn't available in Australia yet, but it'll also ship with a touchscreen. There's no such option on the 1080p model. Razer's Updated Blade Stealth Is A Fine Macbook Air Replacement Last year, the unthinkable happened. I was in Taipei for Computex. I'd just walked into a group press conference ready to take notes and transcribe. I opened up my Macbook Air and ... half the screen was blank. In between interviews, my screen died. Read more What's Good About It? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker The Blade built its reputation for being a gaming laptop that was as portable as a Macbook, and the 2017 model continues to deliver on that ideal. It's no longer the thinnest gaming laptop - Origin's EVO15-s is a fraction lighter and smaller - and competitors are catching up on features and price. But the Blade still maintains a good balance between form and function. You can get gaming laptops with 8GB or 16GB of RAM and a GTX 1060 for much less: the Acer Aspire V Nitro and the Gigabyte P55W both come with a GTX 1060, the same CPU and more storage for just over $2000. But they're far, far less portable than the Blade, and therein lies the value. The Blade is as comfortable to use on the couch watching Netflix as it is on a desk, playing Overwatch or DOOM. It's a laptop targeted at people who like the idea and size of a Macbook Pro, but don't want to pay Apple prices or sacrifice the benefits of the PC ecosystem. One small upgrade over last year's model is the RAM: it's been upgraded to 2400MHz from 2133MHz. That's not a mammoth upgrade, but it will add a couple of extra frames here or there coupled with the move from a Skylake CPU to the newer Kaby Lake generation. Unsurprisingly for something sporting an i7-7700HQ and a GTX 1060, the Blade plays games well. How well, you ask? Given that the Blade doesn't have a G-SYNC display, you're going to want to give yourself a bit of headroom over 60fps. But as you can see, you should have no problem running any major AAA title provided you don't mind dropping the graphics presets down to High or Very High. The Kaby Lake upgrade has made a difference to the Blade's battery life as well. Running at 50% brightness with Wi-Fi on, the power profile set to the Windows 10 balanced preset and the volume at 50%, the 2017 Blade happily continued playing movies for just under six and a quarter hours. You'll get a couple of hours less under a standard productivity load, which isn't too shabby for a gaming laptop. What's Not Good About It? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker The Blade might be a thin gaming laptop, and so are the fans. If you're going to be gaming regularly, have some headphones handy because this thing is loud. The best description I can probably give you comes courtesy of my partner, who looked at the Blade during an Ashes of the Singularity benchmark. "I didn't know you were using the PS4," she quipped. While playing DOOM, the fans were actually so loud that I had to turn the volume up to 70% before the metal soundtrack started to drown it out. Consider yourself warned. The touchpad, as I discovered with the latest Blade Stealth, is fairly reasonable with a little tweaking. But it shares the same major flaw, in that it's a little too sensitive when it comes to palm recognition. I'm still waiting for manufacturers to catch up to the precision and intelligence of the Macbook touchpad, and Razer isn't there yet. There is one difference in that the Blade's touchpad has discrete left and right buttons, much like the Surface Book and other laptop manufacturers. It's not my style, and I'd prefer something a little smaller, but it works well enough. It doesn't support Windows 10 Precision gestures, however, which more and more laptops are starting to do. Another problem that resurfaces from the Blade Stealth is the surface, or at least the lower half. The matte surface is a magnet for fingerprints, and I haven't been using the 4K model with a touchscreen. Speaking of the screen, the bezel around the Blade's screen is unnecessarily massive. Laptop screens have come a long way, and hopefully in the next refresh Razer moves with the times a little. Should You Buy It? Image: Kotaku/Alex Walker If you're after a gaming laptop at the cheapest price possible, there are better choices. If you want the thinnest gaming laptop, you can find smaller. But if you want a good middle ground machine that's under $3000, one you can comfortably use on the couch or at the pub without looking like you just pulled a noisy encyclopedia out of your bag, the Blade is a good pick. It's starting to show its age, having largely kept the same design for the last four years. But while competition is a lot fiercer than it was, the Blade achieves its main objective well: it takes the power of a mid-range PC and puts it into a chassis that doesn't strain your knees or look overly garish. The pricing is pretty reasonable for the whole package on offer, although those bothered more by budget than size, weight or form would do well to shop around.

I'd be extremely wary about buying one of these in Australia until they have some form of local warranty support. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Apr 18, 2017, 11:24am Can't unfortunately. We usually return the laptops (and almost all hardware) to their local distributor/PR after review, as they often get used for other events and handed out to other outlets/content creators or for sponsorship purposes.

Last edited April 18, 2017 11:29 am Reply 0 felicitous_blue @felicitous_blue Apr 18, 2017, 12:18pm The blade has local warranty support. I've got a 2015 blade, it developed some dead pixels, contacted Razer who arranged to send it to a repair shop in NSW, who fitted a new panel (complete replacement of screen section/housing). Turn around was just over a week (from WA). I did have an issue at first, as the replacement screen had dead pixels (including comments written on the still in place screen protector noting the dead pixels!) but razer just authorised a second new screen. This is the fault of the repair centre (who clearly tested and saw the new screen was defective, just didn't re-repair), not razer themselves though... the second screen was perfect and still going strong. Given how some companies won't even replace screens with a few dead pixels, overall I was pretty happy.

Any suggestions or articles worth reading? Reply 0 mccawsome @mccawsome Apr 18, 2017, 11:53am I keep seeing "or 4K screen" on reviews but am yet to see this as an option on the AU store. Am I missing something here? Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Apr 18, 2017, 12:08pm There are two models of the Blade: one with a 1080p display and the 4K touchscreen, the latter of which isn't available in Australia. Reply 0 blighty @blighty Apr 18, 2017, 12:45pm It seems like the Blade is asking for just a touch more than it's actually worth. I'd tolerate being loud if it was a GTX 1070/1080 model, and I'd tolerate a GTX 1060 if it's quiet and cool-ish, but "loud GTX 1060 laptop" doesn't scream "great" to me. No g-sync is also one hell of a caveat for a self-described premium gaming laptop. Small and portable is great, but it seems like there's just a few too many devils in the details. I'm all for a device that's built like a Mac with a Windows environment and a gaming focus, but it doesn't sound like it's quite there yet, which is a shame. Reply 0 Dalton Ackerman Guest Apr 18, 2017, 2:27pm You say that 2800 is the cheapest option. I just went on their site and the 256gb option is 1899. Actually cheaper than I bought my base 2014 config at. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion!

Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas — and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros. to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Quick Brown Fox Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly traveling. Copyright 2017 Bloomberg. Interested in Insurance Tech? Get automatic alerts for this topic.

(AMD) Stock Isn’t What Goldman Thinks With AMD’s GPU strength still gaining traction, combined with recents bets on VR/AR, AMD stock should be owned, not sold. By Richard Saintvilus, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 17, 2017, 11:17 am EDT     Popular Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Isn’t What Goldman Thinks Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock Will Deliver 20%-Plus Returns Ford Is Dividends and Nothing Else Recent Posts: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Isn’t What Goldman Thinks Here’s How BP plc (BP) Stock Can Return 20% This Year Ford Is Dividends and Nothing Else View All Posts Shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) have been under heavy selling pressure of late, falling almost 14% from $14.16 on April 5 to last week’s low of $12.22. The reason? Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari, downgraded AMD stock to “Sell” with a $11 price target. Source: Shutterstock AMD shares closed Friday at $12.31, suggesting there’s possible downside of almost 11%. Despite acknowledging the strong execution AMD has delivered under CEO Lisa Su, Hari noted strong competitive threats from the likes of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). All told, the analyst — who expects AMD to earn just 2 cents per share in fiscal 2017 (versus consensus of 8 cents) — believes any good news about Advanced Micro Devices is already priced into the shares. But that’s where he’s wrong. I expect AMD stock, which has fallen 12% in thirty days, to reach $16 in 2017, delivering 30% gains on the back of greater GPU adoption and rising profit margins. The Bull Case for AMD Stock The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based chip company, which has come back by almost 400% over the past two years to prove doubters wrong, is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results in a couple of weeks. For the quarter that ended March, Wall Street expects the company to report a loss of 4 cents per share on revenues of $984.38 million. This compares to the year-ago quarter when the company lost 12 cents per share on $832 million in revenue. For the full year ending in December, AMD is expected to earn 8 cents per share, versus a loss of 14 cents a year ago, while full-year revenue of $4.74 billion would mark an increased of the 10.9% year-over-year. The significant fiscal year expected improvements — particularly in EPS — presents an opportunity for both investors and traders take advantage of the recent pullback in AMD stock, caused strictly by Goldman’s downgrade. Not only does AMD continue to benefited from strong growth in its popular Radeon line of GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit), there are also signs that the declines in PC sales have begun to stabilize. And thanks to the company’s recent partnership with Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), where its FirePro server GPUs will power Alphabet’s cloud platform in 2017, AMD’s revenue growth should accelerate in the quarters ahead. Bottom Line With AMD stock skyrocketing some 355% over the past year, it’s understandable to question how much more runway is left for the stock to fly, which seems to be the basis for Goldman’s downgrade. But with Advanced Micro’s GPU strength still gaining traction, combined with recent bets on VR/AR, AMD stock should be owned, not sold. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

 The net asset value (NAV) of a closed-end fund is the market value of the underlying investments (i.e., stocks and bonds) in the Fund's portfolio, minus liabilities, divided by the total number of Fund shares outstanding. However, the Fund also has a  market price; the value at which it trades on an exchange. If the market price is above  the NAV the Fund is trading at a premium. If the market price is below the NAV the Fund is trading at a discount. Performance returns for the Fund are total returns, which includes dividends, and are net of management fees and other Fund expenses. Returns are calculated assuming that a shareholder reinvested all distributions. Past performance cannot predict future investment results. Performance will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data shown. Performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of taxes that shareholders would pay on Fund distributions or the sale of Fund shares. Shareholders must be willing to tolerate significant fluctuations in the value of their investment. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include ordinary dividends, long-term capital gains and return of capital. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a Section 19(a) notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time, available at www.all-starfunds.com. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholders' 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year.

With a lightweight design, integrated screen, and easy to use software, Ohmni is designed to be the most accessible (and affordable) mobile telepresence robot yet. Ohmni is heavily focused on ease of use, which is always a good idea when developing a robot for consumers. It arrives completely assembled (folded in half), and setup consists of unfolding it, meaning that you can send it to a relative with minimal computer experience and not have to worry. The display, audio, and video hardware are all integrated, so there’s nothing to mess with there, either. The robot itself is 4’ 8" tall, and weighs just over 18 pounds. It runs Android 6.0 on an Intel X5 processor, with 64 GB of on-board storage and 4 GB of RAM. The lithium battery will keep the Ohmni moving and chatting for 5 hours, and the included dock will give you an hour of life for every hour of charging. Ohmni does include an autodocking feature with minimal autonomy: as long as the cameras can see the fiducial on the dock, the robot can orient and dock itself. Photo: Ohmni One feature you’ll find on Ohmni that distinguishes it from other telepresence platforms is a tilting neck. Not pan and tilt, because it’s not designed to let you look around, rather it’s just a single extra degree of freedom that allows Ohmni to look up, down, and nod. You control this manually, but I can imagine how this simple change would go a long way towards making the robot seem more connected to the person remotely inhabiting it. For more details on Ohmni, we spoke with Jared Go, Ohmnilabs co-founder and CTO: IEEE Spectrum: How do you convince people that a telepresence robot is worth investing in when the cellphones and tablets they already own come with video chatting capability? Jared Go: One key part is helping them realize that they’re just taking for granted what it means to stay in touch by phone or video chat. Almost everyone we talk to tells us they miss the feeling of being there in person, even with all these video chat apps and hardware surrounding us. So there is definitely a value gap there and our research and user testing early on focused on that key question—how to use robotics can help solve that problem. We know now that the key lies in the holistic, differentiated experience. It’s not about having a screen, or remote control wheels. It’s about what this enables. We studied behavior as we let testers try Ohmni with their own family and the results were really awesome. Almost the very instant they tried it, the way they interacted completely changed. Photo: Ohmni For example, we found conversations would immediately move to the most natural and comfortable place, rather than say sitting in the study or on a bar stool. The other side most often said they felt way freer, not forced to constantly aim a device at them, or sit in one spot. Because of this, conversations got longer and instead of just recapping what happened last week, people would spend an hour or more just hanging out around different activities, like watching sports on TV. This is stuff they’d never do with FaceTime or Skype.  How does Ohmni differentiate itself from other mobile telepresence platforms like Double or Beam+? Double and Beam have designed their products around the corporate use case from day 1, which has forced them down a particular road very different from us. We’ve focused on home from the very beginning, which allows us to provide a much better suited experience. We’ve rethought the entire process. The tablet on our robot is not removable and is completely integrated and set up ahead of time. When you order, we can even pre-program WiFi credentials for you so that if you ship it to your parents, they just unbox, unfold, and turn it on. That’s it! We’ve had people 65+ set it up with high level verbal instructions only. That’s super important for the consumer market. The moving neck along with our MotionMap technology is also key to creating biggest difference in experience. Driving around Beam and Double and interacting feels a lot like walking around with a neck brace on, which results in unnatural interaction. We studied this and notice in a lot of cases people will bend down or adjust their pose to look flat into screen, because the screen and camera can’t orient to look straight at them. People say that it’s really the moving neck that makes the product feel really human. The human brain is hardwired to sense attention so seeing what the remote user is exactly looking at has a tremendous impact. Being able to emote and nod too really gives the extra oomph to that feeling. Why should roboticists be excited about Ohmni? What kind of interesting technology (software, hardware, or both) does it use? Two main things. We’re focused on optimized the telepresence experience first, but we’ve already started building out Ohmni as an affordable, human-scale open platform. We have a cloud-based JS framework we call OhmniAPI. Our goal here was to make programming Ohmni as easy as developing web pages. You basically develop a rich HTML5 app that can run display whatever complex media or network logic on the screen and also uses privileged JS calls to have full access to motors, lights, text-to-speech, and so on. And you deploy it to any bot with one click from the cloud. We’ll be extending the capabilities of the framework over time to add higher-level navigation and image/audio recognition so that writing high level tasks will be possible without a Robotics PhD. We’re also developing an in-call developer console so you can run code on the bot while you’re in the telepresence call, which we think is a really exciting way to do robot development! We’ll release more details on this later on in the year. Photo: Ohmni Ohmni’s also built on open standards so it gives devs a lot of flexibility to hack on the hardware. We’ve left extra hardware ports where you can attach extra servos and sensors. The core of Ohmni’s sensors and peripherals is a USB root hub so you can easily plug in and control all the hardware from a beefy laptop or anything else too. We’ll be publishing the packet protocol for controlling motors as well. How do you plan to improve Ohmni through software updates? We’re always iterating on things like autodocking precision, MotionMap precision. Continually improving the driving UI. We’re planning to roll out features over time like hotword detection and speech control (i.e. integrating with the Alexa API). We’ve definitely got plans for more autonomy and more assisted driving and will talk more about that later this year. We’re hoping developers do crazy and fun things with Ohmni like try and do some interesting HCI applications or even things like get a whole set of Ohmni bots to sync together and perform songs from Hamilton*. You can pledge US $1460 (shipping included) for an Ohmni on Indiegogo right now, which is $500 less than the robot will eventually sell for. This is likely to be the biggest issue with Ohmni—even though it’s relatively affordable for a mobile telepresence robot, its price will make it a luxury item for most people, and it could be hard to justify. We certainly agree that telepresence robots have a surprising amount of value, and that it’s something it’s best to experience to really understand how it’s different from (and better than) a regular video chat: the sense of embodiment you get is powerful, and the ability to have a physical presence somewhere else makes interacting with people remotely a much more natural experience. There’s a lot to like about Ohmni, and the platform in general seems to have potential. While it may not represent a significant advance in terms of mobile telepresence technology, it’s a compelling mix of features and affordability that seems to have potential.

Which is why “Grand Theft Auto V” is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulations researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. TOP BUSINESS VIDEOS: Story continues below | Business news first: Sign in for newsletters If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas — and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose for Nio, a startup planning to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” As improbable as it may seem to the layperson, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from “Super Mario Bros.” to “Angry Birds” for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from “Grand Theft Auto V.” Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from the game’s software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving-project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in Los Altos, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes that drivers regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in autonomous vehicles: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly traveling. Dana Hull is a Bloomberg writer.

Starting this month, Microsoft will not be shipping updates to Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs powered by seventh-genration processors like Intel’s Kaby Lake and AMD’s Ryzen. It has however turned out that the company banned old processors by accident. This means systems running on Windows 7 and 8.1 AMD Carrizo chips are no longer getting updates either, and the software giant has stated in a statement that support for these configurations would continue to be provided. “Starting with the April 2017 Cumulative Update release, devices with an AMD Carrizo DDR4 processor running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 might start to receive a message that the processor is not supported with those versions of Windows. Microsoft intends to continue to support Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 with this processor and plans to address the issue causing the message in a future update,” Microsoft says. There’s absolutely no ETA available right now as to when a fix would be provided, but Microsoft explains that the error appears after installing April 2017 updates. According to company’s policy, Windows 10 is mandatory for Intel 7th-generation processors, AMD Bristol Ridge, and Qualcomm 8996, so systems running Windows 7 or 8.1 no longer receive updates. Computers which are banned from getting patches are provided with the following error: “Windows could not search for new updates. An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer. Error(s) found: Code 80240037 Windows Update encountered an unknown error.” Additionally, Windows Update also displays the following message when checking for new updates: “Unsupported hardware. Your PC uses a processor that is designed for the latest version of Windows. Because the processor is not supported together with the Windows version that you are currently using, your system will miss important security updates.” Tags: microsoft, windows 7, windows 8.1, amd carrizo Nation Gallery Prabhu flags off train with see-through Vistadome coach along Vizag-Araku Modi’s magic brings a saffron Holi to Uttar Pradesh 11 dead, at least 30 injured after private bus falls into river in Andhra Pradesh Sky of smoke: Bengaluru's Bellandur lake catches fire again!

Read More , improve performance over mechanical hard drives (HDD). However, if you want the fastest SSD around, you need to know two things: the connector and protocol. There are three different connectors. The most common is SATA, common to desktops and laptops.

Finally, there’s PCIe, which is a desktop-exclusive connector. On the other hand, protocols are split between the older AHCI and the lightning-fast NVMe. M.2 includes NVMe and SATA, whereas SATA is AHCI only. More or less, all desktops support SATA and PCIe SSDs, whereas most older laptops only support SATA. Check out the fastest SSDs among SATA, M.2, and PCIe. The Fastest SATA SSD SATA remains the most common hard drive connection port. It uses the AHCI command protocol which was originally developed for spinning hard disks. SATA ports are found in desktops and most desktops. For the average user, a SATA SSD should be fine. Samsung 850 Pro 256 GB SSD ($138/£88) Image Credit: Amazon Samsung continues to master the SSD space. Its SSDs sport premium features and performance. The Samsung 850 Pro SSD stands as the best SATA SSD available. Onboard you’ll find 3D NAND technology. If you’re confused about NAND, here’s a quick primer on flash memory NAND and eMMC: All You Need to Know About Flash Memory NAND and eMMC: All You Need to Know About Flash Memory The world would be a sad place without flash memory. But how much about flash memory do you really understand? Here are the essentials you should know to make informed buys! Read More . 3D NAND, or V-NAND, offers incredible speed and stability. AnandTech benchmarks found the Samsung 850 Pro SSD clocking in sequential read speeds around 550 MB/s and maximum sequential write speeds around 520 MB/s. Additionally, the 850 Pro comes in a variety of storage capacities, from 128 GB all the way to 2 TB. In their review, CNET praised the Samsung 850’s storage arrays, reliability, and features like the performance-enhancing Rapid Mode and strong encryption. However, Samsung’s Magician SSD toolkit software is Windows only. It’s not available on other operating systems like macOS or Linux. Moreover, the 850 Pro does not come cheap. The 256 GB iteration is $137. The 2 TB SSD is a whopping $874. You can snag a pretty capable PC for that price. There are definitely cheaper options with similar performance. The Samsung 850 EVO SSD offers similar performance at a lower price. The 250 GB 850 EVO is about $94. Nevertheless, the Samsung 850 Pro is the fastest SSD available, especially coupled with its Rapid mode. But if you can’t utilize its Rapid Mode (it only works on Windows), consider the more affordable 850 EVO. Pros 3D NAND technology Rapid mode Excellent encryption Range of storage options (up to 2 TB) Cons Expensive Samsung Magician software only for use on Windows The Fastest M.2 SSD M.2 is a small form factor SSD. This form factor is substantially smaller than traditional SATA drives. Within the realm of M.2 there are M.2 SATA drives, as well as NVMe M.2 drives. NVMe M.2 SSDs use non-volatile memory which is.

They range in price from the ultra affordable to the premium. Read More among the best performing storage available. The Samsung 960 EVO M.2 SSD is an M.2 2280 SSD. Ranging from  250 GB to 2 TB, you’ve got plenty of storage options. This SSD is an M.2 PCIe SSD which utilizes TLC NAND. Like the 960 Pro, the EVO features the same thermal management aspects like copper-backed heat spreading labels and an incredibly power-efficient controller. Measures are also taken to reduce thermal throttling. Yet in opting for TLC NAND over MLC NAND, there’s a slight theoretical propensity toward thermal throttling as AnandTech points out. Nevertheless, Storage Review benchmarks found the 960 EVO beating out the 960 Pro iteration in 2 MB sequential transfer read/write, 2 MB random read/write, and 4K random transfer read/write notably. With its plentiful storage options and superb benchmarks, the Samsung 960 EVO is an incredibly fast M.2 SSD. You may also consider the MyDigitalSSD BPX or Intel SSD 600p. Although AnandTech found the 600P to be the slowest SSD in their tests, it’s one of the most affordable M.2 SSDs. The MyDigitalSSD BPX clocks in at a low price, and even performs better than the average mainstream M.2 SSD. Pros 250 GB to 2 TB storage options Beat out Samsung 960 Pro in certain benchmarks TLC NAND Thermal management features like power-efficient controller Cons Potential thermal throttling from TLC NAND The Fastest PCIe SSD PCIe is another connection type. Certain M.2 SSDs do come with PCIe connections. However for this category, we’ll focus on PCIe as a form factor. Often dubbed add in cards (AIC), these SSDs are suited to desktop use. While many desktops might not fit an M.2 form factor, AIC cards allow users to slap an SSD into an open PCIe port. There are adapter cards for M.2 SSDs for those choosing to opt for a do-it-yourself (DIY) route. Plextor M8Pe Add-In Card ($120) Image Credit: Amazon The Plextor M8Pe comes in a variety of configurations and storage options. The M8Pe(Y) arrives in an Add-In Card (AIC) complete with a heatsink that maintains cooling for the controller and half the board. For storage, the Plextor M8Pe boasts a range from 128 GB to 1 TB. In its review, Tom’s Hardware dubbed the M8Pe an excellent NVMe SSD for enthusiasts. Tom’s Hardware notes that its MLC flash fosters a long lifespan, and even calls this SSD Plextor’s best performing offering to date. The AIC sports a massive heatsink, one of the largest and also best performing. The M8Pe boasts a 16 GB data transfer rate, with sequential data reads for 70 seconds at 2.4 MB/s. Sequential data write speeds clock in at 1.3 MB/s for 40 seconds which equates 52 GB. However, at the 1 TB NVMe level, data was decidedly dicey under a light load. The Samsung 960 Pro and OCZ RD400 both beat the Plextor. Granted, neither of these drives are AIC SSDs. You can snag an adapter, but insofar as per-configured PCIe SSDs, the Plextor M8Pe is the best available. Still, you might consider the Intel 750 Series AIC which yields similar performance in an add-in card form factor.

Founder and CEO Speaking at Parkpine Capital's 2017 Global Ventures Summit in Bali, Indonesia Edwin NG to Discuss US Listing With Foreign Operations on Friday, April 21 News provided by KinerjaPay Corp. Apr 17, 2017, 12:37 ET Share this article JAKARTA, Indonesia, April 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- KinerjaPay Corp.,(OTCQB: KPAY), a digital payment and ecommerce platform, ("KinerjaPay" or the "Company") today announced that it will be participating in the Global Ventures Summit 2017. The event will be held at the Bali Nusa Dua Convention Center, in Bali, Indonesia, April 19 through the 21. The Global Ventures Summit was created to connect influencers of the highest growth startup ecosystems in the world and enable innovative startups to access venture capital professionals, funded technology startup founders, and policy makers in the freshest tech scenes on the planet. The Global Ventures Summit is a business unit of Parkpine Capital. Parkpine Capital aims to raise funds to help connect the SE ecosystem with the valley and invest at the same ticket size in seed and pre-seed as Silicon Valley. Over US$ 3 billion in represented funds from 25 Silicon Valley VC's, 50 International angel investors, 100 companies, and LP's, 4000 attendees will make it to the Global Ventures Summit. Edwin Ng, Chairman and CEO for KinerjaPay Corp., will provide conference attendees with an update about the Company's progress, specifically focused on the issues associated with managing an Indonesian operation trading as a US listed company. The Company is currently scheduled to give its presentation at 11:30 AM.

KinerjaPay continues to make significant progress in Indonesia's ecommerce and financial services sector, and I am very much looking forward to discussing the Company with conference attendees."

Anker SoundCore, $31 with code ANKMAY77 Anker SoundBuds, $23 with code ANKER233 Anker SoundBuds NB10, $30 with code ANKER260 Anker makes our readers’ favorite affordable Bluetooth speaker and Bluetooth earbuds, and both are on sale today on Amazon. The SoundBuds were my go-to Bluetooth earbuds until I got a pair of AirPods, and the SoundCore in particular is notable for its impressive bass and 24 hour battery life. Intel NUC, $144 for Prime members If you want to build a home theater PC, you won’t find a better starting point than Intel’s Next Unit of Computing kits. This tiny box contains a quad core Intel processor, a couple display outputs, and integrated wi-fi and Bluetooth antennas, all for $144. The catch is that you’ll need to add RAM and storage to get it up and running, but once you do, you can install XBMC, Kodi or Plex, and start streaming. The $144 price is within $4 of the best Amazon’s ever listed on this model, but it’s only available for Prime members. SanDisk 32GB SD card, $10 If you still own any of those old-timey doohickeys and doodads that still use full-sized SD cards rather than microSD, Amazon’s top-selling card is just $10 for 32GB right now, an all-time low. Two-Pack Mpow air vent mounts, $8 with code ZYZPEJUQ You all have undoubtedly seen (and probably purchased) these magnetic smartphone vent mounts by now, but why not buy a two-pack? My advice: Keep one in your car, and one in your luggage, because these are awesome for rental cars, and also work as handy phone stands on airplane tray tables if you want to watch a movie. Star Wars: The Force Awakens Blu-ray/digital, $18 The Force Awakens has been basically immune to discounts since it came out on Blu-ray last year, but if last week’s The Last Jedi trailer release made you want to rewatch it, $18 is a solid price for the Blu-ray/digital combo. Minecraft: Story Mode, $20 Telltale’s Minecraft: Story Mode is better than it has any right to be, and you can own the complete adventure for $20 on PS4 and Xbox One today, an all-time low.

By Dana Hull Bloomberg Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realized there aren’t enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why “Grand Theft Auto V” is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas – and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from “Super Mario Bros.” to “Angry Birds” for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from “Grand Theft Auto V.” Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly traveling.

The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should "be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing," with followup validation. That's the road developers are increasingly travelling.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Origin’s budget Windows 10 gaming laptop costs $999 0 by Sean Chan Apr 17, 2017 at 15:40 GMT15 hours ago Origin is today launching its latest gaming laptop powered by Windows 10: The EON15-S The company’s latest gaming laptop is a budget laptop, which means it doesn’t really come with the latest and greatest specs for gaming. But the laptop still includes some good specs that will offer an impressive performance while gaming. First things first, the device comes with Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors. Origin is actually offering three different processors for the EON15-S, and you can choose from either the dual-core Core i3-7100H (clocked at 3.00GHz), quad-core Core i5-7300HQ (clocked at 2.50GHz), or the quad-core Core i7-7700HQ (clocked at 2.80GHz). Despite being a gaming laptop, the device includes a fairly low-end display and that’s probably because of its budget pricing. For $999, you’ll get a 15.6-inch FHD IPS Matte display on the EON15-S which is good enough for a budget gaming laptop — but if you want to get a much better gaming experience, you’d probably want a 4K display, or at least UHD. As for the GPU, Origin is packing the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with 4GB RAM, which means it’s capable of powering VR headsets like the HTC Vivie. You can also get up to 32GB of DD4 RAM on the EON15-S. For $999, the Origin EON15-S seems like a pretty decent gaming laptop in terms of specs. You’re obviously not getting the best of the best with the EON15-S because of its budget pricing, and that’s completely fine, to be honest.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Tablet Surface Pro Speculations On New Spring Event Give Us High Hopes By Catalina Nastase. Published on April 17, 2017. 0 Events like the one announced for the 2nd of May will allow Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and his team to show off their new hardware and what strategies they are currently planning. It is speculated that this year they will be looking for a revision of the popular Surface Pro. This is due to the fact that the Pro line hasn’t seen any update since 2015 and with Intel’s new processors rolling out, this will give them the opportunity to release a Pro 5 and maintain them in the game. While this might not be the most exciting thing they could announce, it could be done to ensure that the Surface Pro 5 will remain relevant. Microsoft has a solid group of manufacturers to ensure that the hardware side of things will be kept on going, but it will need to promote it. Currently, Microsoft is increasing its focus on cloud-centered services. Outlook and Office suites are getting replaced by OneDrive storage or Redmond’s cloud covers. This makes it easily accessible with all operation systems like Android, iOS, macOS. Of course, Windows 10 will be closely integrated and will increase adoption of cloud systems. Windows Cloud could be a massive opportunity for them to trim the hardware requirements and offer manufacturers a new product line, and as such, add more users in the cloud. This will also come as an alternative to the Chromebook, which does not only pose a threat to the Windows OS but also ties down users to Google’s cloud and not Microsoft’s. Another side of the industry that Microsoft could focus on improving compatibility with low-cost computers. It is known that Windows 10 is able to function quite well on cheaper hardware, but it is still taking a heavy toll on laptops, especially as far as resources and storage is concerned.

'Big issue yet untouched': With self-driving vehicles, who'll be liable? From teakettles to trucks: Breaking in through the IoT In all of this talk about autonomous vehicles (AVs) and self-driving trucks, some serious discussion us needed regarding the sheer amount of data required to allow motor vehicles to pilot themselves. A recent blog post by Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of the automated driving solutions division at Intel Corp., puts a number on that data demand and frankly to my eyes it’s unfathomable huge: four terabytes per vehicle per DAY. [How much data is in a “terabyte” you ask? Enough to hold one thousand copies of the Encyclopedia Britannica. And a self-driving car needs FOUR of them.] But that’s just for the hour and half of daily driving averaged by the everyday motorist, according to Winter: we’re not talking about the autonomous trucks that some in the industry are expecting to operate for far longer stretches per day than that. Popular Now Penske launches connected fleet solutions Uber-for-freight finds its footing Are Fleets Ready For Trailer ABS? “By 2020, that’s the amount of data [four terabytes] that 3,000 individual internet users are expected to put out each and every day,” she noted in her post. “It might not sound like much until you think of it in a different way: How many of us have 3,000 friends on Facebook? Now imagine trying to follow and absorb everything they all post each and every single day.” [By the by, Winter’s been delving into several different aspects of the self-driving vehicle phenomenon. Go here and here for two other interesting posts on this subject.] Winter stressed that there’s another interesting twist to the data created by a self-driving car. “What makes data the new oil for autonomous driving – and what makes it a real challenge – is our need to make sense of that data, to turn it into actionable insight that lets cars think, learn and act without human intervention,” she emphasized. “[That’s] data that lets cars do the driving so that the 90% of the accidents caused by human error may one day be a thing of the past.” Yet the “exponentially growing size” of the data required for AVs to operate will require in Winter’s words “an enormous amount of computing capacity to organize, process, analyze, understand, share and store” this amount of information. “Think data center server computing power, not PC [personal computer] power,” she added. The need to train AVs as quickly as possible presents another challenge, Winter noted. “When new driving responses or situations are identified, machine learning, simulation and algorithm improvements must happen almost instantly – not weeks or months later – and updated driving models must be pushed to the cars immediately once available,” she said. “When, where and how that happens has implications not just for today, but for the day when self-driving cars are the norm.” [Frankly, however, a recent survey pours some cold water on that outlook.] There’s also the matter of data protection and what that means for consumers so they will eventually trust what she calls “the autonomous experience.” [Click here for a good story by our own Aaron Marsh that dives deeper into that critical subject.] “How we will achieve truly secure storage and sharing of data is a question I am asked about frequently and one we take very seriously,” Winter continued. “Which data gets stored? Which gets tossed? Which data sets get shared? And how will we protect it all? These are valid questions that will require industry collaboration and our best experts to address in a meaningful way.” Of course, perhaps the biggest overall challenges when contemplating the “four terabyte” needs of AVs is as their population grows into potentially hundreds of millions of them operating worldwide. “The ability to make this happen comes only through the ability to process increasingly larger data sets,” Winter stressed. She added that “true system scalability” will be critical both inside self-driving cars – “back to that four terabyte number” – and outside of them in “massive data centers,” as the self-driving supercomputer and the cloud that supports it continue to evolve. Things to think about as we continue to travel down the road to self-piloting vehicles.

In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realized there aren’t enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas -- and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros. to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Quick Brown Fox Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly traveling. --With assistance from Ryan Beene and Jeremy Kahn Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Two Canadian universities have been chosen to participate in a North American competition to develop a self-driving car in three years. The University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo will compete against each other and six American schools with the goal of autonomous driving in an urban setting by 2020. General Motors and SAE International, an engineering association, have launched the competition designed for undergraduate students that they’ve dubbed the “AutoDrive Challenge.” Tim Barfoot, an engineering professor with the University of Toronto who is overseeing his school’s team, said student demand is intense just days after last week’s announcement that the university had been accepted as a competitor. “There’s something about turning a robot into a vehicle that really captures people’s imaginations,” Barfoot said, adding 250 students have expressed interest in joining the team. “When you can sit inside the robot and it’s driving around, that’s a totally different experience than watching it from the outside.” The other schools competing are Kettering University, Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, North Carolina A&T University, Texas A&M University and Virginia Tech. Each school will receive a Chevrolet Bolt, General Motors’ new electric car, to work on. Intel will provide the computers needed and third parties will provide sensors. The rest will be up to the students. Next spring the schools will enter the first phase of the competition that will test straight roadway driving and object avoidance. By the third and final phase, which will take place at General Motors’ test facility in Yuma, Ariz., the cars will be navigating a complex urban setting, according to General Motors Canada spokesperson Uzma Mustafa. The upshot for General Motors is simple: they’re looking to create a pipeline of well-trained engineers to hire in the company’s big push towards self-driving cars and related technologies. At an event with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last June, the Detroit-based car company announced it was looking to hire about 700 engineers in the next few years, many of whom will work at a new automotive software development centre in Markham, Ont. “We have cars being tested in the United States and this is a good talent pool to see where the ideas are,” Mustafa said. There’s something about turning a robot into a vehicle that really captures people’s imaginations Derek Rayside, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Waterloo who is overseeing his school’s team, said the competition is unique because it is geared for undergraduate students. Artificial intelligence research is a booming field at his school, he said, with at least 20 professors working on various aspects of it, including many in the automotive area. But much of that research is limited to professors, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. “At the undergraduate level, it’s often difficult for those students, to get into that area of research,” Rayside said. “You can’t just do this on your own — you need all this infrastructure, like the car, the computers, the sensors.” Related Canada’s oil industry ponders its fate as the threat of electric cars looms in the rearview mirror Ride hailing, electric vehicles, self -driving cars : Ford Canada wants to be ‘auto and mobility’ company Both schools say their teams will be large. Barfoot thinks his team will have 100 students, but he’s now scrambling to figure out how to accommodate everyone who is interested. Rayside thinks his team will be upwards of 50 students, but admits that could number could grow. “There is huge, huge interest here, in just a few days,” Rayside said, noting his university has already selected a name for the car: WATonomous. The goal is to achieve what’s known as “level four” autonomy by the end of the competition, Rayside said. “That’s a very ambitious goal, but it’s good to have ambitious goals,” he said. Level zero is no automation, Rayside explained. “Level one is stuff like lane-keeping, so you start drifting out of the lane and the car can nudge you back into the lane and that’s on the market now,” he said. “Level two is stuff like the car senses there might be a collision and it applies emergency braking before you can get your foot down. That is on the market now and there is data that shows that this is making the world a safer place.” At level three, the car starts driving on its own, which isn’t available to the public, but exists at research facilities, he said, including at the University of Waterloo, where the self-driving “Autonomoose” — developed by a team of professors, researchers and graduate students — is being tested. “For levels three and four, the car is allowed to ask the human for help, if it’s confused and not sure what to do,” Rayside said. “At level five, the car is not allowed to ask for help. Nobody can do level 5 and nobody is even close to level 5.” The Canadian Press Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Dana Hull A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Photo: AFP San Francisco: In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realized there aren’t enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas—and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a start-up aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the US in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros. to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly travelling.

In a worst case scenario, motor insurance premiums could fall by as much as 80 percent in some mature markets by 2040 because of new technologies, changes to mobility, regulation and companies being incentivized to roll out fleets of shared andautonomous vehicles. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg In the race to the autonomous revolution, developers have realized there aren’t enough hours in a day to clock the real-world miles needed to teach cars how to drive themselves. Which is why Grand Theft Auto V is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers increasingly rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s a lot still to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry up. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas -- and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, California, for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the U.S. in 2020. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” As improbable as it may seem to the lay person, hyper-realistic video games are able to generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from Super Mario Bros. to Angry Birds for a while now, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Read more: The future of driverless cars -- a QuickTake explainer Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from Grand Theft Auto V. Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from GTAV software that’s been tweaked for use in the burgeoning self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 different unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) The idea isn’t that the highways and byways of the fictional city of Los Santos would ever be a substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game “is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor of operations research and financial engineering who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Quick Brown Fox Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, “we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,” Waymo said in a self-driving project report. “If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software, and run those changes in simulation in order to test the fixes.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to “break the system” through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up For all the stupid mistakes motorists regularly make, the human brain is far superior to a computer in perceiving and reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a construction zone to a toddler chasing a ball into the street. That’s the great challenge for all the companies competing to be first in the autonomous space: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving, and make driving safer. A looming question is what state and federal safety regulators will demand as proof an autonomous car should be given license to roam. Hundreds of billions of miles may have to be racked up, one way or another. The authorities will probably accept a combination of real and replicated, but rules spelling out requirements have yet to be written. Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of the Toyota institute, told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee in February that simulation should “be an acceptable equivalent to real-word testing,” with follow-up validation. That’s the road developers are increasingly traveling. Watch Next: Race To Build Self-Driving Cars Accelerates Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

I come to this conviction, perhaps, as a native of Illinois, where cities like Des Plaines (pronounced dess-PLAINS) and Marseilles (mar-SAILS) defy the sophisticated outsider to apply a French pronunciation. Silver Spring Networks (ssni), a publicly traded company that provides so-called smart meters and other networked energy-efficiency services to electric utilities, prefers to be known, at least by its newish CEO, as an Internet of Things, or IoT, company. “IoT is real, not slideware” says Mike Bell, who joined Silver Spring in late 2015. Bell has an illustrious background: a varied career at Apple before and after Steve Jobs returned to the company, followed by senior stints at Palm and Intel. He says he took the recruiter call from Silver Spring because he recognized the IoT potential. “We have 26 million devices in the field on every [habitable] continent,” he says, noting that the networks Silver Spring runs on behalf of its utility customers amount to something nearly as powerful as an alternate Internet. Still, Silver Spring has challenges. It has expanded into non-utility services like managing a municipality’s streetlights to maximize efficiency and minimize downtime. It wants to be more than a smart meter company. Yet three utilities make up nearly 70% of its revenues. And according to its securities filings, Silver Spring faces a bevy of competitors, from giants Cisco, AT&T, and Alcatel-Lucent to smaller players like Sigfox, Ingenu, and a nonprofit cell phone company coalition called the LoRa Alliance, which is focused on IoT. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter, where this essay originally appeared. Silver Spring, which doesn’t make money, is a relative pipsqueak, with a market capitalization of about $600 million. Foundation Capital, one of its venture-capital backers, continues to hold a nearly 20% stake in the company. Bell is right that IoT is real. His well-positioned company’s slowness in capitalizing on the trend illustrates where the skepticism comes from about it. Making money on an idea is harder than it looks.

Most anticipate a new #Microsoft Surface Pro 5 coming though the improvements could disappoint. Advertisements Except for the possible upgrade to an Intel Kaby Lake chipset, the word out is that the Redmond company has hardly changed most of the components. With the Surface Pro line doing well, critics believe that bumping up the SoC would be enough. Compared to Apple, Microsoft does not really need hardware sales to keep its business afloat. Rather, the Redmond company has been known to focus on the software side. Hence, the changes that the Microsoft Surface Pro would have to offer could be in the #Windows 10 Cloud. The answer is in the Windows 10 Cloud With cloud computing and storages plaguing the tech world, the surprise offering by Microsoft could be something in the form of a Chromebook. Most know how #Google was able to come up with a low-cost machine where most of the work was done through cloud-based computing. Tying that up with the recent intro of the Windows 10 Cloud then it does make a big of sense. Breadcrumbs of the feature were spotted in the code of the latest Windows 10 Creators update, hinting the eventual coming of a stripped-down version of Windows 10 that would run on Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. With most of the work left in the Windows 10 cloud, it justifies the eventual shift of trimming down hardware requirements while maintaining their level of efficiency, particularly on the anticipated Surface Pro 5. Bad news for Google With the data mine bared, it also indicates a plan that could place the Google Chromebook in peril. The Windows 10 Cloud-based solution looms as an alternative for consumers, another take since first trying it with the Windows RT. That initiative failed to get any mileage the last time out, but things have changed. Microsoft seems to be using one of its popular assets (Microsoft Surface Pro) to deliver a new solution that may hit both Apple and Google at the same time. Hence, the worries of a less-stellar Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may have just been doused with the new theory tied up to Microsoft’s big spring event happening on May 2. With most shifting to cloud computing, this piece somehow the puzzle on why Microsoft would hold back on a significant upgrade to its hit all-in-one solution. There are still questions that need to be answered such as accessibility and performance on the Windows 10 Cloud, and the new Microsoft Surface Pro device has to offer. This bit may have scraped the top of it all – meaning more details should be known next month.

Tech Search Search JapanTokyo Is About to Make Room for 45 New Skyscrapers WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: April 18 Electric VehiclesLower Gas Prices Haven’t Stopped People From Wanting to Buy Electric Cars ChinaPaul Manafort Meets with a Chinese Billionaire to Talk U.S. Infrastructure Data Sheet Data Sheet—Monday, April 17, 2017 Adam Lashinsky,Heather Clancy Apr 17, 2017 Companies, like people and cities, have every right to call themselves whatever they please. I come to this conviction, perhaps, as a native of Illinois, where cities like Des Plaines (pronounced dess-PLAINS) and Marseilles (mar-SAILS) defy the sophisticated outsider to apply a French pronunciation. Silver Spring Networks, a publicly traded company that provides so-called smart meters and other networked energy-efficiency services to electric utilities, prefers to be known, at least by its newish CEO, as an Internet of Things, or IoT, company. “IoT is real, not slideware” says Mike Bell, who joined Silver Spring in late 2015. Bell has an illustrious background: a varied career at Apple before and after Steve Jobs returned to the company, followed by senior stints at Palm and Intel. He says he took the recruiter call from Silver Spring because he recognized the IoT potential. “We have 26 million devices in the field on every [habitable] continent,” he says, noting that the networks Silver Spring runs on behalf of its utility customers amount to something nearly as powerful as an alternate Internet. Still, Silver Spring has challenges. It has expanded into non-utility services like managing a municipality’s streetlights to maximize efficiency and minimize downtime. It wants to be more than a smart meter company. Yet three utilities make up nearly 70% of its revenues. And according to its securities filings, Silver Spring faces a bevy of competitors, from giants Cisco, AT&T, and Alcatel-Lucent to smaller players like Sigfox, Ingenu, and a nonprofit cell phone company coalition called the LoRa Alliance, which is focused on IoT. Silver Spring, which doesn’t make money, is a relative pipsqueak, with a market capitalization of about $600 million. Foundation Capital, one of its venture-capital backers, continues to hold a nearly 20% stake in the company. Bell is right that IoT is real. His well-positioned company’s slowness in capitalizing on the trend illustrates where the skepticism comes from about it. Making money on an idea is harder than it looks. Adam Lashinsky @adamlashinsky adam_lashinksky@fortune.com BITS AND BYTES Facebook shareholders: How much could 'fake news' hurt the company? A proxy proposal filed last week suggests that the social networking giant prepare a broad report about the issue. The group is interested learning more about both the overriding threat to democracy and free speech, as well as the risks to Facebook's revenue model posed by the phenomenon. Facebook's directors aren't keen on the idea. (Reuters) Apple is now officially allowed to test self-driving cars in California. It recently received a permit from state regulators, serving as confirmation that the tech giant, like its big rival Google, is working on autonomous vehicle technologies. But we still don't know much about the initiative, which reportedly goes by the codename Project Titan—including whether Apple is working on just software or an actual car. (Fortune, New York Times, Fast Company) Bitcoin proponents beware. A hacker group claims to have figured out a way to break into digital wallets by "brute force," potentially allowing them to steal the digital currency. Realistically, though, the chances for significant financial gain are pretty slim. (Fortune) Here's how hotels are making it rough for upstart Airbnb. The industry is using its lobbying power to encourage regulatory scrutiny of the home-rental company at the local, state, and national level, reports The New York Times. It turns out the American Hotel and Lodging Association—backed by Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt—was behind both New York's stricter rules regarding home and apartment rentals, as well as the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into its business model. (New York Times) THE DOWNLOAD Why some cloud deals are fake news. Just under two years ago, NetSuite announced a set of partnerships with Microsoft, including plans to move some of its computing workloads from Amazon Web Services to the Microsoft Azure public cloud. This was interesting in that it seemed to demonstrate a large software company agreeing to use data center infrastructure from Microsoft, which is a distant second to AWS in public cloud—basically a huge set of computing, storage, and networking resources that one company owns, manages, and rents to multiple customers. The thing is: This promised move never happened. Fortune's Barb Darrow reports on why it's not all that unusual for a big multi-vendor partnership to die on the vine.

Taylor, who was 85 when he passed away last week in Northern California, also worked at the Palo Alto Research Center. There, he helped fund the Alto, one of the ancestors to today's personal computers. (New York Times) This edition of Data Sheet was curated by Heather Clancy. Find past issues.

Some companies are trying, and the LifeBeam Vi makes its claim that ears are better because of audio coaching. The Vi is now available at retail, after launching on Kickstarter a year ago. The cost, $249 (equivalent to £200 or AU$330), is similar to many fitness smartwatches. In everyday use, the Vi is a pair of neckband-style Bluetooth headphones with audio developed in partnership with Harman Kardon. They have volume controls, and last about 7 or 8 hours. But when used with a connected app, the headphones track heart rate, pace and distance using your phone's GPS. The headphones automatically sense when they're in your ears, and a touch-sensitive dedicated button brings up AI voice feedback on the fly, like Oakley's Intel-powered Radar Pace earphone-sunglasses. I've given a pair a try, and am working on a review (heads-up: I'm not a runner). But the Vi's design is meant to be friendly and encouraging to newcomers. They're wireless headphones, but with heart rate. Sarah Tew/CNET I slid the buds into my ears, and a twangy female voice encouraged me to start pairing my headphones, and set up my fitness goals. Vi's voice is provided by a real person who LifeBeam used to record all the AI interactions. The Vi's audio sounds OK for headphones, but the flexible neckband's rubberized design sometimes feels hard to rest comfortably. The Vi's earbuds magnetically attach to the band when not in use, or clip together like a pendant. The headphones charge via Micro-USB, and are sweat- and splash-resistant. LifeBeam's CEO Omri Yoffe told me that Vi's voice AI is currently designed for outdoor GPS runs only, but will be upgraded for indoor runs later this year. Eventually, the goal is for the Vi to work for all types of workouts. But, at the moment, it's strictly a training device for outdoor runners. It's all about the app. Sarah Tew/CNET The Vi headphones can play your own own music during workouts, but also hook into Spotify and will eventually recommend playlists to fit your runs. LifeBeam's also experimenting with some gamified music features: The Vi already experiments with playing rhythms to encourage runners to match the beat, and future updates will pick music with beats that fit the desired running pace for the workout. The Vi app runs on iOS or Android, and connects to Google Fit, Apple Health and Strava. It's on sale only through LifeBeam's website now, but will hit Best Buy and Amazon online by the end of April (with retail stores by midyear).

These events allow CEO Satya Nadella and his team to talk strategy, but it also offers an opportunity to announce new hardware. One option this year might be a revision of the popular Surface Pro hybrid of tablet and ultraportable. With Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors available and no hardware updates to the Pro line since late 2015, there is certainly an opportunity to bump the specs up and release a Pro 5 to stay in the game. That choice would be seen as an iterative update, but does not suggest any innovation coming from Microsoft. Keeping up with the latest specifications ensures the potential Surface Pro 5 relevant, but it doesn't generate much excitement. Unlike Apple, Microsoft does not need hardware sales to keep it going - it has an army of manufacturers covering the hardware side for that - but it does need to promote the use of its software and the compelling solutions it can offer. Which is where the idea of Windows 10 in the cloud should be considered in any new hardware. Microsoft’s current consumer focus is built around increasing the adoption of its cloud-based services. From the traditional Outlook and Office suites to OneDrive’s storage and Groove’s music subscription, Redmond’s cloud covers most of the traditional bases. It’s easily accessible through alternative operating systems such as iOS, Android and macOS, but of course it is tightly integrated into Windows 10. Increasing the adoption of Windows 10 also increases adoption of the cloud. A new variant of Windows 10 has been spotted recently. References to Windows Cloud can be found in the code of the latest Windows 10 Creators Update. Noted Microsoft reporter Paul Thurrott had some hands-on time with an early build in February, while Forbes’ Gordon Kelly reported on the OS variant earlier this year: In a nutshell [Windows Cloud is] a stripped down version of Windows 10 designed only to run Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps - aka apps designed to run on both desktop and mobile devices. Any attempt to run standard desktop programs on Windows Cloud results in the warning message: “The app you’re trying to run isn’t designed for this version of Windows”. If you look at the areas of growth in the industry one area is cloud-based computing, which Microsoft has covered. The other is in the low-cost computer that ties into the cloud such as Google’s Chromebook platform. Yes, Windows 10 can run on low-end hardware with many sub $200 clamshells available, but Windows 10 still places a heavy demand on resources and storage that limit these laptops. Windows Cloud would be an opportunity to trim down the hardware requirements, to offer manufacturers another product line and to bring more users towards its cloud. It would also offer an alternative to the increasing prominence of the Chromebook, which not only threatens the Windows OS platform but ties users to Google’s cloud instead of Microsoft’s. Microsoft has been down a similar route before. The original Microsoft Surface was powered by Windows RT, a variant of Windows 8 that ran on ARM architecture. Limited by the ability to only run new ‘Metro-style’ apps that had been specifically coded for Windows RT (as opposed to the entire back catalogue), the Surface line rapidly moved back towards Intel architecture for greater compatibility to find critical acclaim. Five years later and the ability to work in the cloud has become a practical alternative. If Microsoft is looking to push the cloud and create a ‘new spark’ for consumers and manufacturers to gather around, then a ‘Surface Cloud’ would make for an interesting launch next month.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Repels Terrorists' Attack on Strategic Town of Suran Syrian Army Captures Strategic Town of Souran North of Hama Afghans Protest to Condemn US Use of MOAB Mosul: ISIL Launches Chemical Attack to Slow Down Iraqi Forces' Advance Yemen: Hundreds of Thousands Protest against Saudi Strikes in Sanaa Syria: Aleppo Residents Hold Vigil in Solidarity with Convoy Blast Victims Yemenis Protest Saudi Bombings & 'Traitors Supporting War of Aggression' Kashmir Unrest: Protesting Students Clash with Police Dropping the Bomb: It’s Time to Get Rid of Nukes Terrorists Fail to Prevail over Syrian Army in Hama Senior Terrorist Commander Killed in Battle with Syrian Soldiers in Damascus Countryside Iranian Commander: US Augmenting Terrorist Groups in Syria Iraq: ISIL Terrorists Continue to Use Women, Children as Human Shields in Mosul Commander: New Warship, Submarine to Join Iranian Navy Senior MP: US Fails to Achieve Goals in Syria Syrian Army Repels Terrorists' Attack on Strategic Town of Suran TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army forces repelled an attack by Tahrir al-Sham terrorists on Souran in Northern Hama hours after the strategic town was captured by the army.

If that's the case, the two new motherboards coming from Asus' ROG division may be a surprise. Check out the B250H Gaming and B250G Gaming. Both of these LGA 1151 mobos use Intel's B250 chipset and provide budget-priced platforms for high-performance gaming rigs. These actually aren't ROG's first motherboards using the B250 chipset—the B250F Gaming holds that title. The two new offerings skip a few of the niceties on that model (like USB 3.1 ports) in exchange for a spiffy black-and-red color scheme and a lower price. You still get four DDR4 memory slots, six USB 3.0 ports, six 6 Gbps SATA ports, and a pair of PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 sockets. One of the M.2 sockets on each board also supports an Optane cache drive, while the other supports SATA M.2 drives. Asus opted for Intel-powered Gigabit Ethernet on these boards, while audio comes by way of the ROG "SupremeFX" suite powered by Realtek's excellent ALC1220 codec. The only difference in the two boards is that the B250H Gaming is an ATX motherboard while the B250G fits a microATX form factor. The extra size wins the B250H an extra PCIe x16 slot (only x4 electrically) and an extra PCIe x1 slot.  Of course, all overclocking is locked out on motherboards using Intel's B250 chipset, including memory overclocking. As a result, CPUs will be limited to their maximum turbo frequency, and memory speeds will be limited to 2400 MT/s. However, given the high clock rates on offer from Intel's latest CPUs, we reckon all but the most demanding gamers will be satisfied with the stock speeds. We couldn't find the B250G Gaming or B250H Gaming at e-tail yet, but the Guru of 3D got word that Asus will be asking €129 (or $137) for the B250H Gaming and just €99 ($105) for the B250G.

Blacktech Week Marlon Nichols, co-founder of Cross Culture Ventures, Chris Bennett, founder of Soldsie.com and Wonderschool, and Brian Brackeen, founder of Miami-based startup Kairos, talk about startup life at a VC in Residence fireside chat at WeWork. 1 of 2 Technology April 16, 2017 8:25 PM What would a venture capitalist say about that? Startups get a chance to find out By Nancy Dahlberg ndahlberg@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Access to capital is lacking — that’s a common refrain among Miami area entrepreneurs, and particularly in minority communities. So Derick Pearson and Felecia Hatcher, founders of Code Fever and Blacktech Week, thought let’s bring the venture capitalists here. At a recent conference Pearson talked Marlon Nichols, co-founder and managing partner at Cross Culture Ventures and former investment director at Intel Capital, into agreeing to be Code Fever and Blacktech Week’s first VC in Residence. The program, thought to be one of the first of its kind, will have top venture capitalists spend a month in Miami advising and guiding black, Latinx and Caribbean entrepreneurs. Nichols, who generally splits his time between offices in Los Angeles and Silicon Valley, took up residence at WeWork earlier this month and has been holding office hours, fireside chats and lunch and learns that will continue throughout the month to help sharp founders think through the businesses that they are building. It wasn’t a hard sell and the arrangement is benefiting both sides of the table. “You can’t beat coming to Miami in April, but more importantly, Miami is rich in culture and our investment thesis is about understanding global culture to try to predict where consumers are going to spend their dollars,” said the Jamaican-born Nichols in an interview last week. He leads one of the relative few black-led venture capital funds in the U.S. “Black and Latinx cultures have been known for early adopters, so for understanding what is going on in those communities as well as the Caribbean community, Miami is a melting pot. For me it is a lot of learning.” The new VC in Residence program is one of a number of Code Fever initiatives, which include producing Blacktech Week and Weekend, and it recently received $1.2 million in Knight funding. Entrepreneur-in-residence programs are commonly hosted at universities and accelerators to support entrepreneurs, solve problems and help innovate. Code Fever believes that borrowing from this model and inviting VCs to spend a month in residence in communities where there’s little access to funding can help reshape the way black communities are valued in the innovation sector. It’s a big challenge. Only about 1 percent venture capital funding goes to black founders, and only 13 black women founders in the entire nation have raised a million dollars or more in venture capital. In the half-hour office hour visits so far, Nichols has met with tech startups developing products or services for student debt, media content, cloud-based secure storage, educating inmates, dentistry and others. Most of the entrepreneurs are not yet at the stage for venture capital or do not have appropriate businesses for that kind of funding, but the door is still open. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them. Marlon Nichols, Cross Culture Ventures Some were interested in advice for preparing themselves for investment, others wanted mentorship on starting up or just wanted to talk strategy. And it hasn’t been all tech — Nichols met with a cupcake entrepreneur who wanted to talk about the best way to grow her business. And when companies are ready for investment, he wants to know about them. “I think gone are the days when all investments happen in Silicon Valley. ... Amazing companies can be created any where in the world and I want to keep my finger on the pulse of that. ... The biggest thing I will get out of this is developing a network here – with entrepreneurs I will keep in touch with, with angels here and organizations. They will help be eyes and ears for great investment opportunities here.” Nichols is also holding frequent fireside chats, bringing in entrepreneurs who have experience starting and growing companies. “The best resource for new entrepreneurs is successful entrepreneurs as well as unsuccessful entrepreneurs,” he said. “There is just a wealth of knowledge that can be learned from both.” Last week, Nichols hosted entrepreneurs Brian Brackeen of Miami-based Kairos and Chris Bennett of Wonderschool and Soldsie.com for a fireside chat, dinner and networking. Bennett grew up in Miami but moved to San Francisco in 2009. While both entrepreneurs have raised millions in venture capital and angel funding and gave advice on that, they also dished on the realities of startup life — including 180-degree pivots, botched pitches with important VCs, building and overbuilding without reaching product-market fit and somehow keeping a team focused through the toughest months. We also learned that Brackeen wakes himself up at 3 a.m. because he does his best work then, but don’t bother him at 3 p.m. — that’s nap time. Bennett is a big proponent of accelerators – he participated in NewME and 500 Startups — and he said he would do another one today. He also said the benefit to Silicon Valley is there are so many entrepreneurs, engineers and investors to learn from. “Talk to as many VCs as you can, because you learn what they care about. ... The best way to get ready for talking to VCs is to join an accelerator. The next best way is to surround yourself with entrepreneurs who have been successful and learn from them,” he said. Brackeen is bullish on the 305, including on the number of angels in South Florida and the growing infrastructure such as co-working spaces and accelerators — and maybe soon, innovation districts. “You can have the same success as a San Francisco company if you find the right people, find the right lawyer, find the right investors. There is not one model for the result,” he said. See more of their conversation here.   Coming up on Tuesday is a lunch and learn with Silicon Valley startup attorney Brian Patterson and a fireside chat with Diishan Imira, CEO and co-founder of Mayvenn. Pearson and Hatcher plan to bring more VCs down. Find more information about the VC in Residence program at blacktechweek.com/funding. For his part, Nichols said he has been impressed so far with the potential of Miami. “Successful ecosystems have universities spinning out technologies and talent, investors and angel groups, accelerators and co-working spaces — and challenges unique to those communities, that is the biggest thing. I don’t want to invest in the next Uber or the next Lyft. I want new market creators. What are big pain points for people in Miami that haven’t been met? Let’s figure out what those are and go solve them.” Nancy Dahlberg; @ndahlberg READ MORE: Blacktech Week receives $1.2 million in Knight funding to expand entrepreneur programs LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 14 days ago Moby microbe 1:25 14 days ago Moby microbe 5:13 4 months ago Mark Cuban: AT&T, Time Warner merger needed for competition with major tech companies 0:37 7 months ago A laser-powered robot caterpillar View More Video Technology Asian stock markets mixed as North Korea tensions lessen Influence game: Telecom lobbying muscle kills privacy rules Trump order would target high-skilled worker visa program Business group: China backtracking on market opening Netflix standing on the threshold of 100 million subscribers Technology Technology Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Digital Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Miami Herald Rewards Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us NewsMedia in Education Public Insight Network Reader Panel Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Google+ Mobile Apps & eReaders Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Media Kit Commercial Printing Public Notices Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Themed ‚Your Time is Now,’ Cisco Connect UAE 2017 will address the current technology landscape as businesses transition into effective digital enterprises.

The event will offer an unparalleled opportunity for attendees to network, share knowledge and drive the technology agenda for the region’s public and private sectors. „It is a fact that digital transformation has emerged as the most transformative means to ignite sustainable growth and improve society. Technology now connects everything from people, processes and data to things and, consequently, we need to rethink how to approach digitization to maximize its value in both today’s and tomorrow’s digital world,” said Shukri Eid, Managing Director – East Region, Cisco Middle East. „We are committed to partnering with our customers and partners to support them on their journey to a digitally transformed organization that is able to adapt and thrive in an environment of near-constant change.” „The UAE is rapidly evolving as a leading global digital player, paving the way for an even more prosperous and sustainable economic future for its people. Cisco Connect UAE offers platform for industry leaders and change agents of every kind to come together to gain insights and share experiences and ideas on how to flourish in the age of digitization,” added Shukri.

The Middle East and Africa region is predicted to see a 12-fold growth in Mobile Data Traffic; with an increase of Mobile Device and Connections from 1,330 million in 2016 to 1,814 million in 2021. This means that enterprises and industries in the Middle East will have to act with speed, accompanied by good digital strategies in order to survive. Cisco believes that several technology transitions – including the emergence of the IoT, increased mobility, cloud computing, and the growing importance of big data and analytics – are combining to enable IoE.

(MU) Stock Still Has Plenty of Time to Grow 3 Battered Value Stocks That Aren’t Bargains — They’re Bombs! Despite Missteps, BP Plc (ADR) (BP) Stock Can Still Deliver the Goods View All Posts Despite significant concerns about how the markets would absorb the unprecedented administration of President Trump, the anxiety was largely unfounded. Several market sectors, including the volatile technology and semiconductor arenas, have experienced bigly returns. A shining example is Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). Mostly left for dead in 2015 when MU stock tumbled more than 59%, shares stormed back last year, gaining 53%. Source: Mike Deal via Flickr Of course, much more work is required. To come back to parity from a 59% loss, a shareholder would need a 144% return on investment. Therefore, in all fairness, the rally of 2016 was mostly beneficial for Micron stock speculators, not long-time investors. Nevertheless, recent chart action from MU stock is encouraging for all vested players. On a year-to-date basis, Micron stock is up 22%. This figure puts Micron stock in the lead against several names in the chip-making sphere. For instance, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), which has far more stable financials than MU stock — is up 16%. Micron also beats out Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), which is up “only” 8.5%. Click to Enlarge While this has strong upside implications for MU stock, some worries for the overall sector are creeping back in. The exchange-traded fund Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) has lost nearly 4% for the current month. Some of the heavy weights, including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are actually negative for the year. Should investors brace for potential damage control for Micron stock? MU Stock May Fight Some Industry Headwinds The idea of a corrective downside occurring is completely logical. InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth struck a cautious tone with Micron stock, arguing a lack of “easy money” growth potential. He also points out an increasing number of analysts going bullish on MU stock. This trend combines with the fact that fewer analysts are sitting on the fence. However, this may also suggest that people are buying into Micron stock after the positive news has long since passed. I don’t disagree — the easy money has likely been made, mostly because I speak in hindsight. But the underlying catalysts that sparked the initial rally in MU stock are still valid. First, the computer chip supply glut negatively impacting all semiconductors has definitely eased; otherwise, we’d be having a different conversation. And Micron’s dominance of the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), as reported by InvestorPlace contributor Chris Fraley, will drive momentum further. To be clear, I’m on the bull train for Micron stock. My biggest concern, though, is the recent slowdown in the underlying sector. This is not a “panic mode” situation; rather, it’s a tap on the shoulder moment. If I’m going to take a risk on a semiconductor company, I’d like to go with the stronger candidates. MU stock certainly qualifies. Micron Stock Is a Well-Balanced Tech Play The Altman Z-score, which aggregates five metrics to gauge a company’s financial stability, is illustrative here. Virtually no semiconductor company was left unfazed by the demand depression in the industry. Therefore, most everyone took a hit. It’s where they absorbed the damage that truly matters.

I set out my wish list, did a bunch of online research, visited a few retailers and then put the call out to a bunch of vendors asking them to recommend and provide me with a review device. The ultimate aim of the exercise if for me to buy, with my own money, a new computer for when I'm working remotely. The first device to arrive on my doorstep is the Lenovo Miix 510. What am I looking for The list of criteria I provided to the vendors I approached was reasonably straightforward. I'm not too concerned about processor grunt as my needs are quite simple - text editing, light photo editing, web browsing and email. But I need enough storage to carry all my current work files with me as well as a few other bits and pieces. 8GB RAM (I guess I could live with 4GB if I had to) 256GB storage (must) Pen input (preferred) Detachable (preferred) 12 to 13 inch touchscreen display (must) Under $1500 (must) Cellular comms (strongly preferred) The good news is the Miix 510 ticked all the boxes. On price, the recommended price is right on my $1500 budget but I've seen it discounted by as much as $250 recently making it a good deal - if it delivers what I need. Getting started In order to make my comparison between each device fair, I'm going to prepare each device the same way. As review computers have often been used by several different journalists, I used the reset this PC option in settings to remove all applications, customisation and other junk that might be left over from previous users. I used my Windows account for log-in. I then installed used Windows Update to ensure everything was up-to-date and installed the Windows 10 Creators Update. I've only installed a couple of essential apps and am using the default Windows 10 apps for email and calendar so I added account details for those. First impressions One of my concerns with devices like the Miix 510 is the keyboard. I spend a lot of time typing so a keyboard that is comfortable and responsive is a must. The last Windows tablet I spent a lot of time using was a Surface Pro 2. While it was a competent device for its time, I really disliked the keyboard. I found it very "bouncy". The Miix 510 is far firmer - it's quite rigid making it nice to use on a desk, aeroplane tray table or on my lap. While the Miix 510 was going through the reset and update processes, I noticed that the fan was quite loud. The iPad Pro I've been using for the last few weeks is silent but he Miix 510 hums occasionally My son, who is quite handy, thought someone was using his Dremel in the garage (which is some distance away) before he realised it was the Miix 510 on the coffee table. It's not super-loud but it is noticeable in a quiet room. I'm typing some of this article on a train, heading into the city. The screen, while bright is also very glossy and the reflection from the sunlight coming in through the adjacent window is quite severe, making it hard to read what's on the screen. The Miix 510 has a SIM card slot, on the back under the kickstand. I removed the SIM from my iPad and plugged it into the Miix 510. Interestingly Windows 10 did not automatically configure the APN so I needed to add that manually, something I've not had to do in some time. Comfort After years of using traditional notebooks, there was one thing i was completely unprepared for. Convertibles like the Miix 510 and Surface Pro are really crappy to use on your lap. With most of the device's weight held by the kickstand - which is one of the Miix 510's strong points - I starts to dig into the area above my knees when I use the device on a train or when sitting somewhere, waiting for a meeting. The keyboard on the Miix 510 is about a gazillion times better than the iPad Pro. Not only are the keys nicer to hit but the keyboard sits on a slight incline so the angle I'm working at is a little easier on the wrists - something I'm careful about as I've already had one round of carpal tunnel surgery and don't fancy another. The kickstand uses what Lenovo calls a watchband hinge. What makes this special is that I can set the screen at almost any angle from perpendicular to almost flat relative to the keyboard. Performance I'm not going to formally benchmark all the devices I'm trialling. I'm not buying a tablet for high-end gaming or any other processor, memory or I/O intensive tasks. My use-case is very much that of a writer so any of Intel's current processors will more than suffice for my use. With the Miix 510, I'm able to watch full screen HD movies from iTunes and Netflix without any problem. And I haven't experienced any annoying slowdowns or hesitations while working. In short - performance has been fine for me. But if one of the other devices I test makes the Miix 510 feel inadequate I'll update this review and make it clear. As far as connectivity goes, in addition to Bluetooth, cellular data and 802.11ac WiFi, it also has USB 3 with both USB-C and USB-A ports. There's a 3.5mm headphone jack, front and rear cameras, two microphones and integrated speakers that were good enough for me to enjoy the latest Doctor Who via iView last night. Ports and buttons on the Lenovo Miix 510 Using the pen The Miix 510 comes with a pen so you can scrawl notes and draw diagrams on the screen. This is a brave new world for me. Although the ipad Pro supports the Apple Pencil I never used it as I'm primary a keyboard kind of guy. But there are times when being able to scribble some notes or draw a picture can be really handy. The Miix 510's pen gets its power from a single AAAA battery. There's no elegant way to store the pen on the device so you'll need to take care not to lose it. For most of my work, the pen is unnecessary. But I thought I'd give it a try. Lenovo provides an application called WRITEit for writing notes and drawing diagrams. It's quite basic and I suspect OneNote is a better match for most people's needs. There are two buttons on the pen so you'll need to hold it in such a way that your forefinger is placed so that it can tap the appropriate button. When using WRITEit, the buttons can be used for selecting text or erasing what you've just written or drawn. I'm going to need some more time playing with the pen as it's a significant change to how I work. This will, most likely mean I'll need to adapt my workflow to a different, more pen-friendly set of software than my current tools. Dislikes There are two things that have annoyed me. One is the kickstand and how it makes the device uncomfortable on my lap. The other is the fan noise. As someone who has not had to deal with fan noise for some time - the iPad Pro is silent and my two desktop machines are both silent almost all the time. But this is a minor annoyance and it is more than overcome by the other benefits I get from this class of device. Would I buy this? After a couple of days of use, I'm definitely going to shortlist the Lenovo Miix 510. t hits all my key selection criteria and my criticisms are quite minor. And if I can find one at the heavily discounted $1250 mark, it represents excellent value in my view. But even at the full $1500 it's a good buy.

I'll run each one for about a week in order to put it through its paces. Reply 0 themikky @themikky Apr 18, 2017, 2:53pm We got one to demo recently, one other huge plus as, the device is from an OEM, and not Microsoft, you can actually easily get a decent support plan. So you can get a 5yr NBD warranty on the deivce, something you cant get with Microsoft for the Surface, We have tried. One device took over 2 months to get replaced. Reply 0 Anthony Caruana @anthonycaruana AUTHOR Apr 18, 2017, 3:23pm Great point themikky. For me, buying a single device, I'm prepared to play the risk card on the default warranty and my rights as a consumer under Australian law. But for a business/enterprise I'd look at warranty support more closely. When I was responsible for a fleet, I always factored in on-site support for the duration of the lease/financing.

The Government Is Clueless About eBay And Online Retail Anthony Caruana 18 Apr 2017 3:30 PM A few years ago, after much whining and hand-wringing by olde worlde retailers, the federal government began looking into changing the law around GST collection from overseas retailers on purchases of under $1000. Even though it would cost more to collect the GST than the tax would raise the government wants to kick start this exciting new initiative (not) on 1 July 2017. But the impact could suck big time as eBay suggests they might block overseas retailers from their marketplace. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter? Subscribe Have a tip? Contact our editors!

Ask an informed Arma enthusiast what he has planned for his next hardware upgrade, and it'll probably have something to do with faster memory. G.Skill has launched the latest entry in its expansive lineup of Trident Z high-performance memory, targeted at those willing to pay the price for high bandwidth. The company's new DDR4-4333 kits ship with a pair of 8 GB modules for a total capacity of 16 GB. G.Skill says the DDR4-4333 Trident Z kit is the first one on the market at that speed with 16 GB of total capacity. The timings are 19-19-19-39. The operating voltage is specified as 1.40 V, which is on the ragged edge of JEDEC's specifications for desktop DDR4 memory. The company says it validated the sticks' performance using Asus' ROG Maximus IX Apex Z270 motherboard and Intel's Core i5-7600K processor, suggesting that not all motherboards may be able to hit the advertised speeds for this memory. AMD Ryzen users shouldn't expect to hit that 4333 MT/s rate. The company also says that it's working on 4400 MT/s and 4500 MT/s DIMMs. G.Skill says its fastest prototype modules boasted 55 GB/s read speed and 65 GB/s write speed in AIDA64. There's currently no pricing or availability info for the 4333 MT/s kit. We guess that more than a couple gerbils already have their eyes on a RAM upgrade.

Which is why “Grand Theft Auto V” is in the mix. The blockbuster video game is one of the simulation platforms researchers and engineers rely on to test and train the machines being primed to take control of the family sedan. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo may boast about putting no-hands models on the market in three years, but there’s still a lot to learn about drilling algorithms in how to respond when, say, a mattress falls off a truck on the freeway. Advertisement If automakers and tech enterprises want to make their deadline, they have to hurry. The test cars tricked out with lasers, sensors, and cameras being put through the paces on tracks and public roads can’t do it on their own. Simulators never run out of gas — and the ones at Waymo can model driving more than 3 million miles in a single day. ‘‘Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,’’ said Davide Bacchet, who leads the simulation effort in San Jose, Calif., for Nio, a startup aiming to introduce an autonomous electric car in the United States in 2020. ‘‘With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.’’ Get Talking Points in your inbox: An afternoon recap of the day’s most important business news, delivered weekdays. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Improbable as it may seem, hyper-realistic video games generate data that’s very close to what artificial-intelligence agents can glean on the road. AI software has been playing around with games from “Super Mario Bros.” to “Angry Birds” for a while, tackling problems in controlled environments and learning through trial and error. Last year, scientists from Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany and Intel Labs developed a way to pull visual information from “Grand Theft Auto V.” Now some researchers are deriving algorithms from the game’s software that’s been tweaked for use in the self-driving sector. The latest in the franchise from publisher Rockstar Games Inc. is just about as good as reality, with 262 types of vehicles, more than 1,000 unpredictable pedestrians and animals, 14 weather conditions, and countless bridges, traffic signals, tunnels, and intersections. (The hoodlums, heists and accumulated corpses aren’t crucial components.) Advertisement The idea isn’t that highways and byways in the fictional city of Los Santos would ever substitute for bona fide asphalt. But the game ‘‘is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,’’ said Alain Kornhauser, a Princeton University professor who advises the Princeton Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team. Waymo uses its simulators to create a confounding motoring situation for every variation engineers can think of: having three cars changing lanes at the same time at an assortment of speeds and directions, for instance. What’s learned virtually is applied physically, and problems encountered on the road are studied in simulation. Whenever a human has to grab the wheel of a test car because self-driving software hasn’t responded properly, ‘‘we’re able to play back the exact situation and predict via simulation what could have happened if the car had been left to drive itself,’’ Waymo said in a report. ‘‘If the simulator shows better driving is called for, our engineers can make refinements to the software.” At Toyota Motor Corp.’s Toyota Research Institute in California, engineers try to ‘‘break the system’’ through what’s known as the Quick Brown Fox test: running mile after mile in the most challenging weather and traffic conditions. For all the stupid mistakes motorists make, the brain is far superior to a computer in reacting to the unexpected, from a pothole to a toddler chasing a ball. That’s the great challenge for all the companies: how to make on-board systems better than people at driving. Loading comments...

Funding platforms like OurCrowd and iAngels — which require relatively low minimum investments and supply easy access to pre-vetted Israeli startups — are making Israeli industry much more accessible to Jews outside Israel. Summary⎙ Print New funding platforms for Israeli startup companies are making it easier for Jews around the world to invest in the future of Israel. Author Orr Hirschague Posted April 17, 2017 Sammy Rubin, an insurance entrepreneur from London, invested in Israeli startups through OurCrowd. His portfolio includes NextPeer, a gaming company that has been bought, and FreightOS, a shipping management service. Rubin told Al-Monitor that OurCrowd's investment platform lets him “participate in the Israel story, which has turned in the last few years into a high-tech story.” Rubin explained, “When I was younger, supporting Israel was a choice between Zionism and business. But in the last few years, for me personally, these are not in conflict anymore. I can do business and invest money, and I can also participate in the Zionist enterprise.” Investments in startups collected through the new funding platforms are no longer marginal, said Koby Simana, the CEO of the IVC Research Center, an Israel-based market research company. According to Simana, out of the $4.8 billion invested in Israeli technology companies in 2016, 2-4% was invested through such platforms. That the investments go to early-stage companies, where institutional investment is scarce, increases their significance. OurCrowd has invested around $300 million in Israeli technology, making it the biggest investment platform bringing together Jewish investors and Israeli startups. While OurCrowd and other similar platforms are on the whole indifferent to investors' religion or ethnicity, Jewish communities outside Israel are clearly an important target audience for them. OurCrowd is one of the most active funds in Israel. Founded in 2012, it already has 17,000 investors. A company conference in Jerusalem in February drew a crowd of thousands. The platform has already invested in about 100 Israeli startups. OurCrowd members invest in startups selected by a professional investment committee, with a minimum investment of $10,000 per startup. The company is named after a 1967 book — “Our Crowd: The Great Jewish Families of New York” — which looks at the lives of prominent Jewish families in New York in the 19th century. Many of the first investors to join OurCrowd were North American Jews. “Israel's tech miracle is a source of pride,” said Jonathan Medved, OurCrowd founder and CEO. “Up until recently, the problem was that it wasn’t so easy [to invest]. Most of these startups are not public.” OurCrowd's mission, Medved said, is “to provide a way for [private investors] to hook up with startup nation in an easy, well-managed way.” Medved also noted that while there is a “big cadre of Jews” among OurCrowd investors, more than half of OurCrowd members are non-Jews. In the last year, most investments have been from Asia, primarily China and India, where the vast majority of investors are non-Jews. iAngels enables small-scale investors from around the world to easily invest in startups. It has raised $60 million since being founded in 2013 and has invested in around 80 startups, most of them based in Israel. The company enables its members to join in on startup investments by well-known investors, adding their cash to the leading investors' money. The minimum investment in iAngels is $10,000 per company. Shelly Hod Moyal, iAngels co-founder, said that private investors have become much more interested in Israeli industry over the past five years, following some high-profile successes. These include the 2013 NASDAQ initial public offering of Wix, a Tel Aviv-based automated website creation company currently trading with a market value of around $3.4 billion, and Google's $1.3 acquisition of Waze, a popular navigation app, that same year. On March 13 Intel announced its purchase of Mobileye, a Jerusalem-based automotive technologies company, for $15.3 billion. Moyal noted that a Zionist motivation to invest in Israeli startups is a clear marketing edge for iAngels. To attract non-Israeli investors, Moyal said, iAngels needs to maintain very high standards, because it would be easier for potential angel investors to instead invest locally, allowing them more control. Cynthia Phitoussi, a co-founder of SeedIL, a venture capital company aggregating the funds of around 50 mostly European angels, agrees, adding that for some Jewish investors, the possibility of turning a profit on their investment is only a side benefit. “There's the Zionist motivation. I'm Jewish, and I know it benefits the [Israeli] economy. Once the investment is made, I forget about it, moneywise. If something happens, excellent. If it doesn't, it doesn't,” Phitoussi said, describing some investors' mindset. Some SeedIL investors want to help Israeli companies play a bigger role on a global scale and make an impact in areas such as health and national security. “It's about helping Israel but also about helping the world,” Phitoussi added. Homrun, a company founded in 2016, puts the latest spin on the attempt to harness North American Jews to help Israeli companies. According to the company's website, it benefits startups by “using the power of the Zionist community to open doors for Israeli companies.” Members of Homrun pay a fee of up to $15,000 to get business briefs about innovative Israeli companies. They then introduce the companies to their own network of business relations. If these introductions lead to a deal, Homrun and its members are beneficiaries. “It's about matchmaking,” said Daniel Gradus, Homrun founder and managing partner. The company’s mode of operation, he said, offers members a new way of helping Israel. Nearly a third of the company's members have offered to forfeit their expected revenues. Gradus added, “We marry the business side with Zionism.” Mark Berger, the CEO of the New York-based locks manufacturer Securitech, is a Homrun member. “Personally, I don't consider it as a business opportunity,” he said. “My primary goal is to help the Israeli economy and help Israelis stay in Israel.” Aner Ravon, a co-founder of Zirra, a company that offers analyses of startups to investors, argues that Jewish investors were always a part of the local startup scene, and a Zionist agenda was always part of their motivation for investing. What is new, he explained, is that the focus has shifted to smaller, private investors. “It's not the Goldman Sachs Jewish banker now. It's the Flatbush family investing in OurCrowd.” Read More: http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/04/israel-startup-funding-platform-investment-technolongy.html Orr Hirschague Contributor,  Israel Pulse Orr Hirschauge is a freelance journalist.

The data analytics startup said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it expects to issue 15 million shares at a price range between $12 to $14, raising roughly $195 million in the process. With roughly 128 million shares left outstanding, Cloudera would have a public market valuation of around $1.7 billion, which is lower than the $4.1 billion valuation it received in 2014 as part of a $900 million funding round. Cloudera filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange in late March and plans to trade under the symbol CLDR. In its regulatory flings, the company disclosed that its annual sales jumped 57% in 2016 to $261 million. However, Cloudera lost $187 million during the same time period, and said in the filings it may never be profitable. Intel owns 22% of Cloudera having invested $740 million in the startup in 2014 as part of Cloudera’s overall $900 million funding round in that year. Intel paid $30.92 per share for Cloudera stock in 2014. Company now wants to price IPO at $12-$14 per share. OUCH!- Dan Primack (@danprimack) April 17, 2017 Intel (intc) paid Cloudera $30.92 per share during its 2014 investment, and could potentially buy another 10% chunk of shares during the IPO, according to the Wall Street Journal and regulatory files. By purchasing 10% of Cloudera’s shares during its IPO, Intel could continue to own roughly 21% of the company as opposed to having its stake diluted, the Journal noted. Cloudera listed in its filing several competitors including Amazon Web Services (amzn), Oracle (orcl), and Microsoft (msft). Technology analysts typically compare Cloudera against its data analytics rival Hortonworks (hdp), which went public in 2014.

The router system operates on a mesh network which allows you to maintain stronger connectivity across your house, increasing coverage even in dead spots. And now, an FCC filing from Google has been spotted (via) which appears to detail a new Google Wifi version that strangely seems to be lacking a particular feature Related: Best wi-fi extenders A different model number to the existing Google Wifi device tells us this is indeed an updated version of the system, and it seems the newer update will see Google do away with support for the ZigBee IoT protocol. Yes, the new version appears to be missing one of the wireless bands (the 2.405-2.475 GHz) that would previously have been used for the ZigBee support. ZigBee is an open wireless technology for smart home devices and has been competing with other similar technologiess to become the standard for all smart home products. It's controlled by the ZigBee Alliance, which is made up of Intel, Philips, Samsung, and Qualcomm, with Philips’ Hue smart bulbs using the wireless technology. And while it looks like Google has dropped support for ZigBee, the company has had a good relationship with the alliance in recent months, so it seems likely we'll see the standard integrated into another of Google's products. Google included ZigBee support in the OnHub and the current version of Google Wifi, but it's never actually turned the functionality on, so it's not a huge loss, and could possibly mean we'll see ZigBee support crop up on a future version of Google Home. At this point, there's no official word from the company on what it's plans are, so for now nothing's been confirmed. But it seems Google has some sort of plan which is likely to become clearer in the near future so stay tuned.

Microsoft will be having an event on May 2, but it may still not launch the new device. Many believe that Surface Pro 5 will be launched in October instead.Microsoft The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has been in the rumor mill for quite some time now, especially since it was initially anticipated to be announced last October. When Microsoft launched only the Surface Studio and Surface Book i7 back then, new speculations point to a March update. Still, March has come and gone and Microsoft has not said any word about the device. Now, Microsoft is going to have an event coming to New York City on May 2. Many believe that this could pertain to the launch of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, given that the company usually uses these events to unveil new products. However, according to Business Insider, sources close to the company say that it is unlikely for Microsoft to launch Surface Pro 5 in that event. Instead, Microsoft may use the event as a venue focusing on creativity and education, especially after the launch of the Windows 10 Creators Update. According to the sources of the same news portal, the company's news will tackle both software and hardware, but it is still uncertain what exactly are these. This is quite consistent with the discussion between Joe Belfiore, corporate vice president in Microsoft's Operating Systems Group, and Mashable. The news portal revealed that Belfiore is focused on the release of the Windows 10 Creators Update. He is also working on creating innovative and interesting Windows devices, as well as increasing the reach of the Microsoft Edge. As for any news regarding the Surface Pro 5, Belfiore did not comment further regarding the hybrid device. Despite the lack of information, there are still rumors regarding the possible specifications of the Surface Pro 5. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may come with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 635 chipset or the Intel Kaby Lake processor. Along with this, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may come with 16 GB of random access memory (RAM) and 512 GB of internal storage. Advertisement In addition, there are speculations that the upcoming device may launch two variants, one with a 2K resolution, while the other a 4K resolution. Other features rumored for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 include a longer battery life, a USB Type-C port support, as well as a rechargeable Surface Pen. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may be released in October. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it Is suicide a sin? And is it forgivable?

The seven-time Grammy winner’s weekend-closing set further helped cement his position as a star  — and a consistent and important voice during a time when he’s choosing not to remain silent about recent social and civil rights injustices. Featuring nearly 20 songs, his concert was woven together with a series of videos about one Kung Fu Kenny (played by Lamar), a character he mentions frequently on DAMN. The 29-year-old performed at least a half-dozen tracks from that record, which dropped last Thursday, opening with the album’s “DNA” after showing footage of Fox News anchors criticizing his protest song “Alright,” a single he performed later in the show. Lamar got lots of love from the Indio music and arts festival crowd for new tracks “ELEMENT,” “LUST,” “PRIDE,” “FEEL,” and “HUMBLE,” and he, in turn, gave some back in the form of “LOVE,” which served as the encore of the roughly 75-minute set that featured appearances by Travis Scott, ScHoolboy Q, and Future (all three had their own Coachella sets this year) performing “goosebumps,” “THat Part,” and “Mask Off,” respectively. Lamar also worked in some older cuts, including “King Kunta,” “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe,” and “m.A.A.d city.” While fans might not have lyrics committed to memory just yet for Lamar’s fresh DAMN releases, that didn’t stop them from becoming absorbed in the rapper’s undeniable ability to command the stage with his passion and energy. Watching his loyalists is enough to make a newcomer want in on the fandom. Lamar is just one of the many highlights from Coachella 2017. Read on to see what — and who — else made the list. Lady Gaga premiered “The Cure” Amy Harris/Invision/AP Mother Monster pulled through in more ways than one for Coachella 2017. In addition to stepping in for a pregnant-with-twins Beyoncé, who postponed her headlining appearance until 2018, Gaga brought a hot new song to share with the desert crowd: “The Cure,” a pop single driven by its electro-chorus. @ladygaga has #TheCure for @coachella. Listen to the first performance of her brand new single! #gagachella #coachella2017 #coachella A post shared by Gerrad Hall (@gerradhall) on Apr 16, 2017 at 11:13am PDT Gaga has headlined hundreds of shows at venues ranging from the Super Bowl to dive bars, but Coachella is a different animal. Fortunately, so is she, and because of that, she knew exactly what to do to entertain fans of all genres. (Read our full recap of her Coachella set here.) Drake, The Weeknd, and more made cameos Kevin Mazur/Getty Images; Frazer Harrison/Getty Images; Rich Fury/Getty Images Drake — who brought out Madonna when he headlined Coachella in 2015 — came out for a surprise appearance at Future’s Saturday set to perform condensed versions of “Jumpman” and “Gyalchester” off his recently released More Life playlist before asking the crowd to help create a “real Coachella moment” as they sang “Fake Love” together. Nbd just @champagnepapi stopping by to show some #reallove at #Future's #coachella set w/ #fakelove #jumpman #drake A post shared by Gerrad Hall (@gerradhall) on Apr 15, 2017 at 8:35pm PDT Elsewhere, people stopped and looked at each other in shock when they heard Lauryn Hill sing the opening to the Fugees’ “Ready or Not” during DJ Snake’s set, where she also got the crowd hyped performing “Killing Me Softly” and 1998 solo song “Lost Ones.” As for other surprises, the Weeknd dropped in during Canadian rapper Nav’s set to perform “Starboy” and “Party Monster,” along with the duo’s recent collaboration, “Some Way”; Gryffin welcomed Daya to the stage for “Feel Good”; and British singer Dua Lipa surprised the large and lively crowd at Dutch DJ Martin Garrix’s show to perform his single “Scared To Be Lonely.” You know what I think of @Daya joining @gryffinofficial at #coachella … #ILikeIt #pun #watchandsee #putyourhandsup #coachellasurprise #coachellaguest #surprise #sahara #coachella2017 A post shared by Gerrad Hall (@gerradhall) on Apr 15, 2017 at 8:21pm PDT A$AP Rocky got the most out of his trip to the festival grounds by pulling double-duty, appearing during DJ Mura Masa’s set — where Charli XCX also stopped by — then later popping up at ScHoolboy Q’s show. Migos were everywhere Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Coachella With four surprise appearances in one weekend, it seems hip-hop trio Quavo, Takeoff, and Offset — a.k.a. Migos — are poised to see their star rise. The Atlanta-bred rappers first hit the stage with Future to perform No. 1 single “Bad and Boujee” and “T-Shirt,” later that night getting some time with both the DJ Snake and Gucci Mane crowds to perform the former. But their weekend wasn’t done there… DJ Khaled, in his own words, “takes Coachella” Kevin Mazur/Getty Images If there’s one thing DJ Khaled knows how to do, it’s how to tease a crowd and build anticipation. Playing 15-30 seconds of a song, then pausing to remind everyone “this is just my intro” — a process that played on loop for several minutes — Khaled promised, “I got so many surprises.” So many, in fact, he said the media would be changing its tune about him and that all the new headlines would read, “DJ Khaled takes Coachella.” Well, with some 20 minutes left in his 50-minute set, out those surprises rolled. Migos made yet another appearance, again with “Bad and Boujee,” while 2 Chainz performed a few of his own songs, including “All Me” and “Rich as F—,” a Lil Wayne track he’s featured on. Rick Ross, A$AP Ferg, Wale, Swae Lee, and French Montana all also made it to the Sahara tent stage for Khaled’s Coachella takeover. And because you don’t have to be at Coachella to enjoy it thanks to livestreaming options on Coachella.com, social media got in on the action.

The preview offers another peek at the upcoming Melodrama (out June 16), which includes the already-released singles “Green Light” and “Liability.” Kevin Mazur/Getty Images “I want you to give the song the biggest f—ing birthday of all time,” she asked of the Coachella crowd before playing the track. @lordemusic had a really cool stage at @Coachella … actors in a glass box elevated above the stage, and in there performing vingettes with each song. Check out a portion of #Royals and #GreenLight, but first, hear some of a new song she previewed called #HomemadeDynamite from her upcoming album Melodrama. #lordechella #coachella2017 #mainstage #boom A post shared by Gerrad Hall (@gerradhall) on Apr 17, 2017 at 8:19am PDT HP introduced their Antarctic Dome While there is intriguing artwork scattered throughout the festival grounds, one structure stands out among the others because of what’s inside: HP’s Antarctic Dome is home to a completely unique visual art experience. Developed by creative artist Android Jones, whose previous installations have appeared on the Sydney Opera House and Empire State Building, the less-than-10-minute 360-degree animation displays across the entirety of the dome, viewed from a seated, laidback position to maximize visibility. Combining “the pulse of the music and the flow of human movement,” according to a press release, the projected sequences “are driven by data captured from audio analysis and motion capture, setting a new bar for high fidelity immersion.” See some video and photos below. WOW. Not sure I've ever seen something so visually breathtaking, mystifying, hypnotizing, and euphoric as #Antarctic #coachella 360 dome. Was even, strangely enough (or maybe not?), emotional. Bravo, @obscuradigitalsf and @hp #didntwanttoleave #takemeback #therapy A post shared by Gerrad Hall (@gerradhall) on Apr 16, 2017 at 5:45pm PDT HP and Intel also put on a nightly light display with the use of 300 drones, a portion of which you can see below. Whoever is behind these drone light shows in artist parking @coachella… so sick! 🎮🛰 pic.twitter.com/3gnN6QuYT4 — ira brian miller (@irabrianmiller) April 16, 2017 This drone light show was epic #coachella #drones A post shared by Geoff Clark (@geoffreyjamesclark) on Apr 16, 2017 at 1:36pm PDT Hans Zimmer brought his orchestra (and Pharrell) In one of the weekend’s more rousing “wow” moments, film composer Hans Zimmer and a full orchestra dazzled the Outdoor stage crowd, playing excerpts from movies he has scored — Inception, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King, and The Dark Knight — but with an added dose of caffeine. “It takes a special kind of crazy person to bring an orchestra into the desert,” he told the crowd after opening with a snippet of the Inception score. “But it had to be done, didn’t it?” The stirring instrumentals — Pirates was performed via cello concerto — were often accompanied with a visual show displayed on the screen behind the stage, enhancing an already special experience. This was one of the coolest ideas… @hanszimmer and that #orchestra! Wowowowow Movie songs and scores at @Coachella … I could've sat there all day long! And then @pharrell stopped by to sing #Freedom! #inception #piratesofthecaribbean #thelionking #thedarkknight #hanschella #thosepeoplehavetalent A post shared by Gerrad Hall (@gerradhall) on Apr 17, 2017 at 8:12am PDT If that wasn’t enough, even Zimmer got in on the “Surprise!” game, bringing out Pharrell Williams to perform his recent single “Freedom.” “He makes the world a better place,” the Oscar-winning composer said of the singer and music producer. “This man is peace and love and freedom.” Travis Scott was flying high Texas-born rapper Travis Scott didn’t headline Friday night, but he might as well have for his first fest outing: The crowd at his Outdoor stage show was one of Day 1’s biggest, and the hip-hop-loving scene was ready for his show, which included the 24-year-old performing on the wings of an enormous animatronic bird perched on the stage in a nod to his upcoming Bird’s Eye View Tour. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Coachella Performing “Antidote,” “goosebumps,” “Pick Up the Phone,” and the auto-tune-heavy “Skyfall,” among many others, Scott hyped the crowd all the way. “I came for the rage, Coachella,” he proclaimed (via Billboard). “If you not tryna mosh pit … get the f— out.” Radiohead got “Let Down” by technical difficulties Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Coachella Their third time as headliners was not a charm for Radiohead: Friday night’s top act was giving fans everything they wanted and expected… until it wasn’t what they wanted or expected. The speaker fuzz and feedback came first, then, total silence. They played through the issues as long as they could before it became necessary to stop so the issue could be fixed. Ironically, the sound went out again as they played their 1997 song “Let Down.” Francis and the Lights hypnotized Francis and the Lights singer Francis Farewell Starlite came dressed for the occasion, telling the crowd he always wanted “a tent designed exactly the color of my jacket,” referring to his burgundy ‘80s-inspired get-up that matched the chandelier-accented covering of the Gobi tent where he performed. @francisandthelights couldn't be contained! Such a fun, mesmerizing #Day1 #coachella set! A post shared by Gerrad Hall (@gerradhall) on Apr 15, 2017 at 12:50pm PDT When singing, Starlite’s intriguing and emotional vocals were almost hypnotizing, but it’s when he stepped away from the mic that he was the most mesmerizing, bouncing across the stage (and even into the audience — see above) with reckless abandon, possessed with an intoxicating energy that his loyal fans expected and that newcomers couldn’t help but join in on.

It’s apparently so realistic, in fact, it could help shape the future of transportation. Deploying and researching self-driving technology costs companies valuable resources, especially time. This is where simulation platforms, including “GTA V,” come into play for engineers looking to test the various conditions autonomous vehicles could encounter on the road, according to Automotive News. “Just relying on data from the roads is not practical,” Davide Bacchet, head of Nio’s simulation efforts, recently said, via Automotive News. “With simulation, you can run the same scenario over and over again for infinite times, then test it again.” Given “GTA V’s” variety of vehicles, weather conditions, characters and streets, the game reportedly is a valuable tool for people working on autonomous technology. Last year, scientists in Germany and Intel Labs found ways to pull visual information from the game, and now researchers are taking actual data from “GTA V” and applying it to the tech they’re working on, according to Automotive News. “(The game) is the richest virtual environment that we could extract data from,” Alain Kornhauser, who advises Princeton University’s Autonomous Vehicle Engineering team, said, via Automotive News. We’re not sure if future self-driving vehicles need to account for gang members escaping hoards of police and hopping into helicopters, but who knows what the world will look like in the next 10 years.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Winning Design of Mouser Electronics’ International Space Station Design Challenge Is 3D-Printed in Space DALLAS & FORT WORTH, Texas–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Mouser Electronics Inc. and Grant Imahara today announced that the winning design in the International Space Station (I.S.S.) Design Challenge has been 3D-printed in space. The winning design, a satellite-launching device, is now in orbit and may one day be used by astronauts for a variety of missions. Cupertino (Calif.)-based engineer Andy Filo designed the device, which allows astronauts to launch femtosatellites (tiny satellites about the size of a postage stamp and weighing less than 100 grams) in zero gravity. Scientists can use femtosatellites in many different missions and applications, including monitoring disasters, studying Earth’s environment, and even flying in formation to create a giant antenna for deep space analysis. “Mouser is excited to be part of new and innovative projects that bring together engineers and makers from around the world and — in this case — beyond,” said Glenn Smith, President and CEO of Mouser Electronics. “Andy’s femtosatellite-launching device meets the needs of astronauts as well as earthbound researchers and engineers.” Filo’s femtosatellite project was chosen from 242 entries and digitally transmitted to the I.S.S., where it was 3D-printed on April 3 by Made In Space’s Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) — the first commercially available off-world manufacturing service and the only 3D printer adapted for use in the vacuum of space. Made In Space and Filo made some last-minute modifications after I.S.S. received the original design, rounding the handle to increase usability and comfort and further editing the design to increase printing speed. Filo and his creation are showcased in a video that features celebrity engineer Grant Imahara as the two visit the Made In Space 3D Printing Lab at NASA’s Ames Research Center. Mouser will soon release the final video in the I.S.S. Design Challenge series on Mouser’s YouTube channel as well as on the Empowering Innovation Together™ program page. The I.S.S. Design Challenge is one of several innovative series in the Empowering Innovation Together program, which features the Innovation Lab for new projects ranging from bringing superhero technology to life to 3D printing a semi-autonomous car with drone technology. Mouser’s valued suppliers Amphenol and Intel® are co-sponsors of the I.S.S. Design Challenge. Mouser also partnered with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and Made In Space, along with Hackster and MacroFab.

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. Both USB-C ports will charge the computer. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Specs Hexa-core Dual Arm Cortex A72 2GHz Processor 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB eMMC storage Model Number – XE513C24-K01US 12.3-inch LCD Touchscreen Display with 2400 x 1600 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio and 400 nit brightness 2-in-1 rotating display Shared integrated graphics 2 1.5watt stereo speakers facing down 720p webcam 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with Marvell 88W997 wireless card Bluetooth 4.0 Headphone mic combo audio port 2 USB-C 3.1 ports (up to 5Gbps and 4K display output with optional adapter) 1 micro-SD card slot Spill resistant 74-key keyboard S Pen 2-cell Li-ion 5140mAh batter with 39 watt hours Dimensions – 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ Weight – 2.38lbs The Bottom Line Samsung makes the best Chromebook money can buy. It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   2 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

TP-Link Deco M5 router review: This mesh network comes with a side of... Video LiFi’s blazingly fast connectivity uses LEDs We only looked at the first iteration of Google Wifi, the company’s mesh networking set-up, a few months ago and already it looks like version two is in the works. A Google filing recently spotted at the FCC describes a new dual-band router, possibly an update to the company’s Google Wifi. Mentioned in this article Google Wifi  TechHive rating $125.99MSRP $129.00View on Amazon PDFs included with the filing mention a model number AC-1304—compared to the current model, which is NLS-1304-25. The most notable change, as first spotted by Android Police, is that this router apparently is not equipped with a ZigBee radio. Google filed an RF exposure evaluation report for a 2.4GHz wireless LAN, a 5.0GHz wireless LAN, and Bluetooth LE, but nothing for a ZigBee radio. Ian Paul/IDG The suspected Google Wifi label spotted at the FCC. ZigBee is an open, low-power wireless technology for smart home products. It’s controlled by the ZigBee Alliance, which includes Intel, Philips, Samsung, and Qualcomm as member companies. Philips’ Hue smart bulbs are one of the most popular ZigBee products. ZigBee has been chasing the dream of being the unifying IoT application layer for years but is only one of several standards vying for that title. Why this matters: Google and ZigBee have become increasingly cozy over the past few years, announcing at CES 2017 plans for the ZigBee Alliance to certify devices that use the Google-developed Thread protocol for networking. It wouldn’t make sense for Google to back away from ZigBee now. What might be happening instead is that Google is working to incorporate ZigBee into some other home networking product—perhaps a new Google Home that also functions as a smart home hub. But that is pure speculation on our part. To comment on this article and other TechHive content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The list includes … The State of California has granted 30 permits to automakers who are looking to test autonomous vehicles on the Golden State’s roads. The list includes “classic” automakers like BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, but also, tech giants from Silicon Valley – Google, Apple, NVIDIA and Uber. To acquire a testing permit for public streets, the DMV requires companies to have well-trained test drivers with a clean driving record in the vehicle at all times. Several auto company suppliers are also testing in California. These include Delphi Automotive and Bosch. The Google division of Alphabet Inc. leads the tech companies on the list. It has tested its own self-driving cars for millions of miles and is considered one of the industry’s leaders. BMW has been testing autonomous cars for years now, but all the testing was done on private race tracks or BMW-owned properties. Just a few years back we had the chance to ride in a 3 Series self-driving car which took us, at high speeds, around Laguna Seca race track. Earlier this year, BMW Group, Intel and Mobileye announced that a fleet of approximately 40 autonomous BMW vehicles will be on the roads by the second half of 2017, demonstrating the significant advancements made by the three companies towards fully autonomous driving. To further propel the development of the autonomous platform, the partnership plans to release hardware samples and software updates in the upcoming years. The BMW iNEXT model, which will be introduced in 2021, will be the foundation for BMW Group’s autonomous driving strategy. The entire list, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles, includes: Volkswagen Group of America Mercedes-Benz Google Delphi Automotive Tesla Bosch Nissan GM Cruise BMW Honda Ford Zoox Drive.ai Faraday & Future Baidu USA Wheego Electric Cars Valeo North America NextEV USA Telenav NVIDIA AutoX Technologies Subaru Udacity Navya Renovo Motors UATC (Uber) PlusAi Nuro CarOne Apple [Source: 247wallst] appleAutonomous Drivinggoogleself-driving carsUber Previous post Our Michelin Tire Experience: More than just a tire company Next post Genesis Gran Turismo to take on the new BMW 6 Series GT RECOMMENDED FOR YOU BMW testing highly autonomous vehicles in Europe and America As part of BMW’s work with Intel and Mobileye, the Bavarian brand has set a timetable for its efforts in autonomous driving, with BMW iNEXT in … People’s fear will slow down self-driving cars more than tech There are many questions surrounding the self-driving car.

Read all about it below: Related articles Today's channel rundown - 17 April 2017 Today's channel rundown - 16 August 2016 Today's channel rundown - 15 September 2016 Today's channel rundown - 15 April 2016 Google's Russia deal Google has reached an agreement with the Russian authorities to open up its Android system to rival search engines in Russia, Reuters reports. The move comes after a two-year dispute with Russian competition authorities, which, according to the report, saw the country's competition watchdog, FAS, in 2015 declare that Google was breaking the law when it mandated that applications, such as Google's search tool, had to be pre-installed on mobile devices that use Android. The agreed-upon deal will see Google ditch its application demands on Android-based devices in Russia, as well as remove any restrictions on the pre-installation of rival search engines, Reuters said. IoT's latest malware Internet of Things (IoT) devices running Linux are at risk of a new variant of malware, according to the latest research cited by security partner LIFARS. The solution provider said that BrickerBot operates like Mirai - a malware program that targets, enlists and groups IoT devices into botnets for sweeping DDoS attacks. LIFARS notes there is one noticeable difference between the two malwares, however, which is that BrickerBot engages in PDoS - permanent denial of service attacks, which, according to the cyber security specialist, are specifically targeted at Linux/BusyBox-based IoT devices that leave their Telnet port open and exposed to the internet. Cloudera's IPO Software vendor Cloudera is pegging its share price at $12 to $14 a share in an IPO of 15 million shares, according to Seeking Alpha. By this reckoning, the Apache Hadoop-based software player will be valued at $1.79 billion, based on 128M shares outstanding expected after the offering, Seeking Alpha's figures note. The vendor has previously been valued at $4.1 billion, when in 2014 Intel snapped up a chunk of the company for $30.92 a share. The chip vendor may be on course to buy 10 percent of the forthcoming IPO, Seeking Alpha said. Apple's cars Apple Friday secured a permit for autonomous vehicle testing in California, according to various news outlets. Fox Business reported Friday that the permit was awarded by California's Department of Motor Vehicles and that it is Apple's first for autonomous cars. The outlet also noted that the permit allows Apple to test its cars on public roads. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, described the issuing of the permit as "the clearest sign to date of progress in [Apple's] secretive efforts to develop self-driving car technology". Apple is pitting itself against Tesla, Google, Uber and General Motors, according to Seeking Alpha. Semiconductors' revenue Worldwide semiconductor revenue is set to hit $386 billion in 2017, according to the latest research from Gartner. The analyst said that the 12.3 percent rise comes after favorable market conditions meant an increase in momentum in Q2 2016, in particular for commodity memory. This will likely be corrected, however, in 2019 by additional capacity in DRAM and NAND flash, according to Jon Erensen, research director at Gartner. "While price increases for both DRAM and NAND flash memory are raising the outlook for the overall semiconductor market, it will also put pressure on margins for system vendors of smartphones, PCs and servers," Erensen said. "Component shortages, a rising bill of materials and the prospect of having to counter by raising average selling prices will create a volatile market in 2017 and 2018."   Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Channel Business Channel Rundown Google Apple Internet of Things (IoT) Semiconductor Gartner Cyber Crime Cyber security DDoS More on Channel Business Channel Business Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 14 April 2017 14 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 14 April 2017 14 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 13 April 2017 13 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 12 April 2017 12 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 11 April 2017 11 Apr Solution Provider Channel still lacking confidence in digital transformation strategies 11 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 10 April 2017 10 Apr Channel Business Channelnomics story of the month - March 2017 10 Apr More news Hybrid cloud driving solution provider demand among Oracle users As vendor builds cloud business, end users are turning to channel partners for integration help Solution Provider 17 April 2017 Today's channel rundown - 17 April 2017 Daily tech news and analysis channel partners need to know now, including Google's Russia deal, Cloudera's IPO, semiconductors' revenue and more Channel Business 17 April 2017 Entry-level today, managers tomorrow: Tapping the millennial workforce Amid an aging channel, players are seeing millennials as strategy People 17 April 2017 Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 14 April 2017 What's been happening this week on Channelnomics?

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 17, 2017 4:41 pm UTC reader comments 68 Share this story An in-browser version of System 7. Take a tour of the days when you needed to manually fuss with memory and cache sizes. MacPaint. There was a time when this was really impressive! Typing up my magnum opus in MacWrite. Playing some Solitaire. Silicon Beach's original 1986 Dark Castle game. Getting some Lode Runner. Developing the next big app in Microsoft Basic. The Internet Archive is a great resource if you're looking to play with older PC apps and operating systems—thanks to a JavaScript port of DOSBox, you can run stuff like Mario Teaches Typing and Windows For Workgroups 3.11 right in your browser, giving you a quick and easy way to get some idea of what it was like to use a computer 20 or 25 years ago. Now, the Internet Archive has some retro computing offerings from the other side of the great Mac/PC divide. Using a version of the PCE PC Emulator that has been ported to JavaScript, people interested in the Mac's early years can run System 6, System 7, and dozens of old apps, including MacWrite and Microsoft Basic using their browsers. The hardware that this old black-and-white software would have run on is wholly different from modern Macs—it hearkens back to the pre-PowerPC days when Macs still used the same Motorola 68000-series processors as the original 1984 Macintosh. Even so, the user interface is recognizable even if you've only used Macs in our current post-Mac OS X, post-Intel era. Showing mounted volumes on the desktop, the idea of a "trash" can that could hold deleted files until you were sure you wanted to delete them, and the persistent menu bar complete with Apple logo are all still hallmarks of modern Macs. Names like "Finder" have also persisted, even though the modern-day Finder has little in common with the one in System 6 or 7. The Internet Archive's sampling of Mac software can be found here. Take a look, even if only to appreciate anew how much more capable today's computers are compared to what we had three decades ago.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: NVIDIA GPUs Are Powering Some Big Clouds NVIDIA has partnered with many of the largest technology companies to democratize the data center for smaller businesses and organizations. John Ballard (TMFRazorback) Apr 17, 2017 at 11:00AM NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) data center segment grew 145% in fiscal 2017 to $830 million as growth in applications of deep learning and cloud computing fueled demand for NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs). So, what is driving the usage of data centers and cloud computing? It's all about big data NVIDIA's Tesla P100 GPU accelerator for data centers. IMAGE SOURCE: NVIDIA INC.  The world is racking up huge amounts of data. Every day, we create a 2.5 quintillion bytes of data from social media posts, photos, videos, transaction records, and the list goes on and on. It's estimated that 90% of the data in the world has been created in just the past two years.   It's not just the data you see on the surface, either, like a tweet or an online video. There is data that piles up behind the scenes to help businesses understand customer activity. In addition, scientists and medical professionals rack up huge amounts of data from sensors and images. Self-driving cars will create a whole new smorgasbord of data from maps, cameras, weather detection equipment, and sensors. The faster we can gather insights from this data, the greater the speed with which businesses and organizations can create breakthrough new ideas and innovate. Unlike the central processing units (CPUs) used to open and close applications on PCs, the GPU can handle multiple parallel processing tasks simultaneously, allowing large amounts of data to be processed much faster. What is known as GPU-accelerated computing has brought to reality the idea of deep learning -- an advanced form of artificial intelligence. Deep learning allows a computer to process all of the data we generate and learn from it without human input. The power of GPUs applied to deep learning is reducing each learning cycle of a computer to days, instead of weeks or months. The explosion of cloud computing Major technology companies like Baidu, Alphabet, and Facebook were among the first to use GPUs for deep learning. But there are also many start-up businesses and organizations that would like access to a data center for the application of deep learning with GPUs, except it's too costly. The solution from cloud providers has been to put a data center in the cloud. So far, partnerships with many of the largest technology companies in the world are positioning NVIDIA as the GPU provider of choice for cloud computing. NVIDIA is selling GPUs to the biggest cloud providers out there, including Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services (AWS), Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, International Business Machines, and Tencent Holdings. These companies are providing very fast GPU-powered cloud computing for a much lower cost than the large capital investment it would otherwise require. As a result, start-up businesses will be able to act on innovative new ideas in a way that was out of reach in the past. Microsoft and NVIDIA The partnership with Microsoft might be the most important one for the graphics specialist. In March 2017, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced the HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator to power AI cloud computing. According to the companies, the HGX-1 is 100 times faster than a CPU-based deep learning system and provides cost savings of up to 20% for implementing AI training. The HGX-1 uses NVIDIA's NVLink technology to allow companies to customize the right ratio of CPUs and GPUs for a specific task. NVIDIA and Microsoft are labeling the HGX-1 as the new architectural standard for cloud computing. The HGX-1 is part of Microsoft's Project Olympus initiative to create a standardized open-source hardware architecture for cloud providers to build data centers around. Microsoft and NVIDIA are hoping that by making it simpler and easier to configure a data center around a standard design, the market for cloud computing can accelerate even faster. Intel and Microsoft's partnership in the 1990s created the ATX standard configuration for PC motherboards, causing a boom in demand for Intel CPUs. Intel still dominates the CPU market. If the same thing happens with respect to the HGX-1 for cloud computing, it could further accelerate demand for AI cloud computing, with NVIDIA holding a position as the dominant chip provider. The market opportunity is growing fast There are different cloud computing markets, but the one fueling NVIDIA's data center segment is the market for cloud system infrastructure services (IaaS), such as Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure. The IaaS market is expected to grow from $25 billion in 2016 to $71 billion by 2020, according to Gartner.  NVIDIA is becoming more deeply entrenched in this booming market with every partnership win. As the IaaS market continues to grow, demand for NVIDIA's GPUs should grow along with it. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

The device might not actually get a big event launch due to the minimal changes it have. (Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Microsoft will be having an event in New York on May 2, but fans expecting the unveiling of the "Surface Pro 5" will be disappointed as it will not be part of the festivities. The company won't likely have a big event when it finally reveals the 2-in-1 hybrid device. According to a report from LearnBonds, the invitation Microsoft sent only had the #MicrosoftEDU educational hashtag. But the event will likely be a special event, where the company will reveal new software and hardware. The report said that the event on May 2 have people speculating and anticipating that Microsoft will be revealing its new Surface device lineups, like the "Surface Phone," "Surface Pro 5," and "Surface Book 2." Unfortunately for them, Microsoft won't be able to reveal any of these speculated products during the event. iDigitalTimes reports that the likely reason for the "Surface Pro 5" to skip the May 2 event is because Microsoft is not planning any big spectacle when they finally come out with the new 2-in-1 hybrid device. This is because the company doesn't really have any major changes for the successor to the "Surface Pro 4." The report said that the Microsoft "Surface Pro 5" will likely sport the same specs that its predecessor has. The only difference the new 2-in-1 hybrid device will have is the addition of the Intel Kaby Lake processor, which is a more efficient CPU but doesn't really provide much of a difference. If this is true, it seems a lot of the rumored specs about the "Surface Pro 5" won't be adopted by Microsoft. Whether it turns out as a good thing or a bad thing will remain to be seen. For now, fans will just have to continue to wait on when the Microsoft "Surface Pro 5" will finally be revealed. Check out more news and rumors about the company's new 2-in-1 hybrid in the video below. © 2017 Traverlers Today, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio How-To Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets Hiring activity has decelerated: Nasscom chief S Ronendra Singh comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet RAMAN ROY, Chairman, Nasscom Raman Roy says the focus of H-1B talks with the US will be on the value of India’s IT as a ‘net creator’ of jobs for Americans The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) recently appointed Raman Roy as its Chairman for 2017-2018. Roy takes charge at a time when the IT industry is facing challenges such as the H-1B visa, but is also involved in exciting projects across the country as part of the Digital India programme. In his first interview with a publication after taking over charge as the Nasscom chief,Roy, founder of BPO firm Quatrro and whom Forbes dubbed as ‘Father of India Outsourcing’, shares with BusinessLine how projects such as rural BPOs are expanding with help from Nasscom members. Edited excerpts: What are your priorities as the Chairman of the IT industry body? Nasscom is playing a critical role in evangelising digital opportunity for the sector, and I will support the industry in facilitating skilling and re-skilling efforts through disruptive models. Building India’s innovation edge is another key priority and we plan to scale our start-ups and centre-of-excellence initiatives to the next level. I look forward to continued involvement of our members to accelerate the momentum on all initiatives. We have an array of priorities to enable Nasscom in achieving the 2020 vision for the industry, which includes showcasing the importance of global skilled-labour mobility, navigating new policy requirements and evangelising skilling and re-skilling of talent, to help continuity of business. The Nasscom leadership will also work towards further strengthening various sector councils. What are the major challenges for the IT industry in the backdrop of the restrictive policies in the US and Europe? The major fallout of these restrictive policies in the US and countries in Europe is that the business is being hampered. The US in itself accounts for around 60 per cent of the Indian IT industry’s export revenues — making this one of the biggest challenges on our way. However, we are working toward mitigating this problem by initiating conversations with the new US administration, and highlighting the facts that show the discriminatory nature of these policies. We are also working toward identifying and partnering with newer markets that can be built as potential business venues. According to you, what immediate measures should the industry adopt? As far as the H-1B visas are concerned, Nasscom will continue to engage with the US administration and legislators, both directly and through the Centre. The focus will be on highlighting the value contribution of India’s IT sector as a ‘net creator’ of jobs in the US, where it has helped American businesses by providing high-skilled IT solutions to innovate, open new markets and expand operations — creating thousands of jobs for Americans. The emergence of technologies such as Cloud, Internet of Things and automation, has created uncertainty as well as opportunity for the industry. Companies will need to transform themselves from IT services providers to digital-transformation partners and provide re-skilling opportunities for their staff to mitigate the requirement for newer skills in these emerging areas. Though the H-1B rhetoric has been around for some time, it looks like it’s going to be a real threat this time round (like declassifying programmers from the list). What kind of financial burden do you see on IT firms, and how do you plan to address this issue? The Indian IT sector has enough strength to withstand any headwind. In the past, too, it has shown resilience, and this time will be no different. In fact, some business leaders have already termed the current development as a blessing in disguise, pointing to the huge size of the domestic IT market and ample opportunities available in different industries and geographies that are yet to be explored. However, there is a need for skilled-labour mobility in the wake of protectionism toward outsourcing talent across different business regions. The sharp decline in IT jobs in India is a cause for concern. What could be the intake of the industry in 2017-18? Hiring activity has decelerated compared with previous years. While fresh hiring is either static or gently declining, it is not as if overall hiring is going down; but it is just not going to have the same pace as earlier. There has been an increase of 1.7 lakh employees in FY17, growing the overall employee base to 3.9 million. The reason behind this is that companies are focussing on productivity and automation. Having said this, there is an outlook towards requirement for newer skills and change in existing skills across job functions. This will result in more re-skilling opportunities for existing employees. How is the 10,000 Start-ups initiative taking shape? When we started the initiative, entrepreneurship in India was dispersed. It lacked a proper organisation that brings together key stakeholders of the ecosystem, including incubators, accelerators, angel investors, venture capitalists, support groups, mentors and technology corporations. Our vision is to foster entrepreneurship, build entrepreneurial capabilities at scale and strengthen early-stage support for tech start-ups. As we move forward in our fifth phase, we continue to script success for this initiative. Since its launch in April 2013, we’ve done about 800 events in 25 cities, which were attended by 30,000 attendees, received 17,800 applicants, and 2,934 start-ups were shortlisted. In 2016 alone, the programme received over 4,000 applications, out of which 658 start-ups were shortlisted, 130 women leaders were inducted and 300 influencers were involved in mentoring. The mortality rate among start-ups is alarming. What does the Nasscom plan to do to improve the situation? While the overall mortality rate is an industry pain point, the B2B sector’s mortality rate is lower than that of B2C ventures. To combat this trend, we have a Nasscom Industry Partner Program (NIPP), to foster sustained engagement between large corporates and innovative technology ventures. The programme is acting as a bridge between product start-ups and large IT-BPM (Business Process Management) companies, including multinationals such as Google, Microsoft, Intel, Motorola, Sony, Allstate, Lowe’s, Accenture, Dell, Wipro, CA Technologies, UBS and Zafin. Today, these companies are collaborating with product start-ups in areas such as computer vision, human-machine interfaces, HR, gamification, bank-in-a-box, mobile payments, connected cars and in-store engagement. We need to have many such collaborations to spread entrepreneurial culture in other cities too. The government has given a flame to the Indian entrepreneurial spirit with the launch of the Start-up India plan. We are confident that this will further boost the entrepreneurial culture in other cities gradually. The government in the recent past has opened up avenues for starting rural BPOs. Are Nasscom members participating in such projects? Nasscom has always been a part of the rural BPO revolution. Today, rural BPOs are not just about entry-level basic work for village employees, but small-scale rural BPOs are catering to international clients and some key domestic customers, offering niche services such as email and chat-based help desk, GIS-based mapping, content creation and social-media marketing. This progress has primarily been possible due to the availability of internet and fibre optic network, which is largely attributed to the government efforts in connecting India. With our member companies skilling and training local talent across locations, we are seeing the trend of rural BPOs going forward to deliver even more complex processes. I have personally been a great advocate, and at Quatrro, we have more than 600 rural BPO workers. I believe the next generation for the BPM industry will leverage technology and take jobs to where people are, rather than migrate to the larger cities model.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) has become a name to reckon with in the online retail marketplace. The core business has given it so much clout and prowess that it has helped it to diversify into cloud computing business. Amazon, being what it is, has found tremendous success in the business technology market. Launched in 2006, AWS, or the Amazon Web Services fetched Amazon revenues of $12.2 billion in 2016. Although this accounts for roughly 9 percent of the total revenues, the segment reported staggering year-over-year growth of 55 percent, outpacing the run rate at its core business. Given the potential the AWS business promises, it is imperative that Amazon invests resources in it to realize the full potential. To this effect, the company has been organizing AWS Global Summits at multiple locations. The company claims these events educate new customers about the AWS platform and offer existing customers deep technical content to be more successful with AWS. For 2017, the company is holding the summit in four North American locations, one place in Latin America, 12 places in Asia-Pacific, eight places in Europe/Middle East and three places in Greater China and Tokyo. The North American Schedule San Francisco — April 18–19. Washington, D.C. — June 12–14. Chicago — July 26–27. New York City — August 14. This week's San Francisco event will be held at Moscone West, 800 Howard St. Featured Speakers Andy Jassy, CEO, Amazon Web Services and Amazon Infrastructure. Julia Grace, Head of Infrastructure Engineering, Slack. Prakash Janakiraman, Co-Founder and Chief Architect, Nextdoor. The Itinerary The summit events are in the form of sessions and workshops, bootcamps and the HUB. Sessions And Workshops Under sessions and workshops, Amazon is organizing: Sessions (one-hour breakout sessions led by AWS subject matter specialists and/or top AWS customers. Workshops. Demos. Bootcamps. Gameday. Security Jam, organized by Splunk and Trend Micro Incorporated (ADR) (OTC: TMICY). Serverless Mini Conference. Bootcamps Bootcamps are full-day training sessions to learn about AWS services and solutions through immersive exercises and hands-on-lab. All boot camp attendees are required to bring their own device and each camp costs $600. The topics for the bootcamps are: AWS Technical Essentials. Secrets to Successful Cloud Transformation. Building a Serverless Data Lake. Running Container-Enabled Microservices on AWS. The Hub This Partner & Solutions Expo will feature leading cloud technology providers and consultants and is sponsored by a host of companies, including chip giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). The HUB hours are as follows: 11 a.m.–7 p.m., Tuesday, April 18. 8 a.m.–9 a.m., Wednesday, April 19. 11 a.m.–6 p.m., Wednesday, April 19. Does Amazon Stock Move Amid The Summit? The 2016 AWS Summit was held in Chicago on April 18 and 19 and in New York on August 10 and 11. Amazon's stock gained 1.5 percent on the first day of the summit but pulled back on the second day, still gained 0.3 percent over the two days of the summit. For April as a whole, the stock advanced 10 percent, although much of the gains could be attributed to the better-than-expected first quarter results for the fiscal year 2016, released on April 28, which sent the stock up by 4.6 percent.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Microsoft Invents Iris ID for Unlocking a Future Surface Smartphone and other Devices | Main | LG may announce in June whether they've decided to Enter Apple's OLED Supply Chain as Requested » April 17, 2017 Facebook to Kick Start their Virtual Reality F8 Conference Tomorrow Morning   Last year Patently Apple reported that Regina Dugan, who led Google's Advanced Technology and Projects (ATAP) group, left the company to continue her work over at Facebook. Tomorrow Facebook will hold their annual F8 conference for software developers that will emphasize Augmented Reality. During Wednesday's session we may get to see some of the new toys that Regina Dugan has been working on for Facebook.   From the live-streamed event, expect advances in how virtual reality can become truly social, beyond playing games or taking selfies in 360-degree recreations of real places, and updates to Facebook Messenger.   On the second day of the conference, Facebook will tease futuristic gadgets, some of which are being cooked up in a secretive lab called Building 8 run by former Google executive and head of DARPA Regina Dugan. Building 8 has been stocking up on experts in consumer electronics, neuroscience, and robotics and computer vision. Cameras are said to be part of the experimental mix and so is brain scanning.   You could learn more about the F8 conference here. Sessions will focus on smartphone cameras, virtual reality, Messenger, and more.   Without a doubt Silicon Valley is pushing forward with Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality projects. Just yesterday Patently Apple posted a report covering a patent from Hollywood's Warner Bros. Entertainment preparing a movie distribution system to push AR/VR movies to theaters, home theaters and future headsets powered by Intel and ARM processors.   In March Patently Apple posted two reports on the subject (one and two) covering Apple's growing team dedicated to all things Augmented Reality and beyond. Rumors have suggested that Apple may introduce an Augmented Reality application for the iPhone 8.   In the end, Facebook's F8 conference will be full of super hype to show that Facebook is the leader is this field even though nothing of real value has yet to crack the consumer market. In February we posted a report about how thrilled Zuckerberg was wearing VR Gloves to type on a virtual keyboard within the Oculus VR headset.   Here's to hoping that in F8's session two on Wednesday we'll get to see cooler developments beyond VR gloves.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Insiders Roundup: NuStar Energy, Opko Health, Alphabet (GuruFocus) The latest feud isn't pitting two Hollywood celebrates against each other, rather two high profiled tech executives. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA)'s CEO Jen-Hsuan Huang published a dual-purpose blog post: First, document the company's advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and second, refute a report from Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)'s Google unit, in which it claimed to hold a leadership position in AI processing power. According to analysts at Argus, Google's leadership claim in the AI space and Nvidia's response clearly demonstrate the "heightened interest" in tensor processing and the growing market for AI and machine learning technologies. Also, the rise in AI and hyperscale data centers will transform future data centers, which bodes well for GPU companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) but also carries "major risks" for legacy CPU companies like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC). Significant Upside To Nvidia Stock The analysts at Argus argued there is room for "significant" appreciation in Nvidia's stock despite a notable pullback from the stock's all-time high of $120.92 to below the $100 per share mark. The analysts highlighted Nvidia's push into markets beyond gaming and the company has even defied the "law of large numbers" in which it is "growing faster as it has gotten bigger." Shares of Nvidia remain Buy rated with an unchanged $130 price target.
