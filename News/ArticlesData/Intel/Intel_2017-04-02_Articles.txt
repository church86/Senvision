Last month, Chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican, made a point of racing to the White House to brief President Donald Trump on intelligence he had viewed that, he said, showed that some Trump campaign officials had been caught up in the government's surveillance of foreign nationals and that their identities had perhaps been improperly unmasked.

News reports later revealed, however, that at least three senior White House officials were involved in handling the intelligence information that Nunes had received - prompting an outcry from Democrats, and even some Republicans, that Nunes had politicised his committee. They said Nunes was simply acting on behalf of the president to try to buttress Trump's earlier claims, on Twitter, that former president Barack Obama had wiretapped Trump Tower during the election campaign.

Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, Schiff said Nunes and the White House's actions proved that they were trying to distract from the broader question of what role, if any, Russia had played in the US election. Advertisement "It certainly is an attempt to distract and to hide the origin of the materials, to hide the White House hand," Nunes said. "The question is, of course, why? And I think the answer to the question is this effort to point the Congress in other directions, basically say, 'Don't look at me, don't look at Russia, there is nothing to see here.' You know, I would tell people, whenever they see the president use the word 'fake,' it ought to set off alarm bells. And I think that is really what has gone on here."

"Well, the question for the White House and for Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because, if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? There's nothing ordinary about the process that was used here at all."

"There is a lot we need to learn before entertaining anything like this," Schiff said. "We don't want to do anything that will interfere in any case that the Justice Department may decide to bring. We also have to determine whether he really can add value to our investigation, whether we need him to learn information we can't learn from other sources. So, it's very early, I think, even to be considering this."

"At this point, I can't say whether anything was masked or unmasked improperly," he said. He also said he was not prepared to answer one of the central questions his committee is investigating: whether Trump campaign officials colluded with Russians to damage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign. "I don't think we can say anything definitively at this point," Schiff said. "We are still at the very early stage of the investigation. The only thing I can say is that it would be irresponsible for us not to get to the bottom of this." Washington Post ﻿ Related Content Is Rex Tillerson a Foggy Bottom novice, or just low-key?

Nice round numbers and anniversaries make for good headlines. So my ears certainly perked up on Tuesday when Intel said that it can now pack more than 100 million transistors in each square millimeter of chip “for the first time in our industry’s history,” said Kaizad Mistry, a vice president and co-director of logic technology at the company. Delivering more transistors in the same area means the circuitry can be made smaller, saving on cost, or it means that more functionality can be added to a chip without having to make it bigger.  The news came during Intel’s first Technology and Manufacturing Day, a behind-the-scenes look at the company’s latest chip classes and packaging technology, and another opportunity for the chipmaker to declare that Moore’s Law is alive and well—at least for Intel.  “All these things are difficult, but once they’re done they seem normal. And that’s the magic of Moore’s Law.” – Intel’s Kaizad Mistry The nice round 100 million milestone (100.8 million, to be exact) belongs to Intel’s latest-and-greatest chip generation: 10 nanometers. For those uninitiated in semiconductor lingo, the 10 nm designation is a reference to the “node” or manufacturing technology used to make such chips. As a general rule, the smaller the number, the denser the circuitry. But even though node names look like measurements, today the numbers don’t really correspond to the size of any particular feature and there can be significant variation between companies. When I wrote about Intel’s 10-nm plans in our January issue previewing the coming year in technology, the company was not yet ready to say much publicly about the specific dimensions of the transistors. This week, they were more forthcoming with figures [pdf]: it’s 34 nm from one fin to the next in the company’s FinFET transistors and 36 nm from one wire to the next in the most dense interconnect layers (down from 42 nm and 52 nm, respectively, in the previous, 14-nm chip generation). Shorter distances such as these mean that 10nm chips can pack significantly more transistors in a given area. The 100 million density figure comes from a metric that Intel senior fellow Mark Bohr has proposed the industry resurrect, in order to better compare chipmaker offerings. Instead of measuring a chip manufacturing generation by an area taken up by a certain component or set of components, Bohr proposes that we instead measure chip generations by their transistor density—in particular, by the number spit out by an equation that combines the transistor density in a standard 2-input NAND cell and a scan flip-flop logic cell.  Image: Intel Ten years ago, the state-of-the-art for Intel was 3.3 million transistors per square millimeter. And by that metric, Bohr says, Intel has more than doubled its transistor density in recent years. From 22nm to 14nm, the transistor density jumped by a factor of 2.5x. And in the move from 14-nm to 10-nm chip manufacturing technology, the jump was 2.7x, from 37.5 million transistors per square millimeter to more than 100 million. Crucially, the company says, the 10-nm transistors have the capacity for higher speed and greater energy efficiency than their predecessors (although, when I spoke with Bohr late last year, he said the focus lately has been on the latter).  It remains to be seen whether the industry will agree that the new metric is a meaningful one. In comments to EE Times, one analyst said transistor count over a larger area, closer to the size of a real chip, would be a more relevant metric. And an unnamed spokesperson from rival chipmaker TSMC told the site: “I have no idea how Intel does its new calculation...for example, its [first-generation 14nm CPU] Broadwell used to have 18.4 million transistors per mm squared, yet under the new measure it suddenly has 37.5 million transistors per mm2. Are they trying to play paper games?” Not so fast, says Intel. After this story originally posted, a company representative wrote to IEEE Spectrum to stress the difference between talking about a chip’s transistor density and this metric, which is designed to assess the capabilities of a manufacturing node. “Simply taking the total transistor count of a chip and dividing by its area is not meaningful because of the large number of design decisions that can affect it–factors such as cache sizes and performance targets can cause great variations in this value,” Bohr wrote in his proposal, titled “Let’s Clear Up the Node Naming Mess.” Even if there is room to quibble over that specific 100 million figure, Intel is also saying that it is more than doubling transistor density with each new chip generation—and that this more aggressive level of miniaturization helps to counteract the slower cadence that has recently set in with respect to the introduction of each new generation. On balance, Intel said, the company is still on a pace that roughly corresponds to a doubling of transistor density every couple of years. Intel calls the suite of strategies it uses to accomplish this more-than-doubling “hyperscaling.” It includes design improvements, but a big piece is the company’s approach to laying down the patterns that ultimately become the chip’s transistors and wiring, which Intel fellow Ruth Brain outlined in her talk [pdf].  With its 14-nm chips, Brain said, Intel began using a strategy called self-aligned double patterning (SADP). SADP is a form of multiple patterning, a range of strategies that can be used to make chip features much smaller than the 193-nm light that is used to print them by splitting the patterning process into multiple steps. Image: Intel At Intel’s 10 nm, the fins that form the current-carrying transistor channel are taller, more closely spaced, and also a bit nicer looking than in previous chip generations.  Other companies, Brain said, use a simple multiple patterning approach that essentially prints the same pattern multiple times, offset slightly. But that technique relies on a lithography machine’s ability to pinpoint the same spot for each exposure, and variability in this process can degrade chip performance and lower the number of usable chips produced. SADP splits up the patterning in a different way, to sidestep this “overlay” issue. With 10-nm chips, Intel as adopted self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP), a similar approach that requires four passes through a lithography machine. Mistry says SAQP has one more generation in it, which would take Intel down to the feature sizes needed to produce the next generation: 7 nm.  Somewhere in there, we may just see extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography enter the picture. EUV uses 13.5-nm radiation (pretty much X-rays) instead of 193-nm ultraviolet light for feature patterning. But back to the present and that 100 million transistors per square millimeter figure. It’s easy to underplay the engineering feats that go into making that sort of milestone (assuming it stands the test of time) possible. “You know one of the remarkable things about Moore’s Law is that Moore’s Law’s past seems preordained and ordinary, and Moore’s Law’s future is difficult and requires inventions,” Mistry told IEEE Spectrum.  Now, he says, the FinFET transistor seems par for the course, but it wasn’t when Intel introduced the technology in 2011. “All these things are difficult, but once they’re done they seem normal,” he adds. “And that’s the magic of Moore’s Law.” This article was updated on 31 March to add a response from Intel to the comments from TSMC and to correct a caption.

By: Sudhir Chowdhary | Published: April 3, 2017 5:24 AM In September 2016, Intel and TPG announced an agreement under which the two parties will establish a newly formed, jointly owned, independent cyber security company. In September 2016, Intel and TPG announced an agreement under which the two parties will establish a newly formed, jointly owned, independent cyber security company. The new company will be called McAfee following transaction close, planned for this month. “When we spinoff as McAfee, we will be one of the largest cyber security players in the market,” says Christopher Young, senior vice-president, general manager, Intel Security Group. With smartphones becoming an integral part of our connected lives, it is important consumers realise threats that exist in the digital world and understand how to safeguard their valued data, he tells Sudhir Chowdhary in an interaction. Excerpts: What is your perspective on the Indian market because the government is pushing to streamline public service offerings? I think it’s exciting in a lot of ways because it’s going to digitise many different aspects of life which will help the Indian consumers in some ways leapfrog more developed economies in terms of what they can do. You can already see that some of the payments and financial transactions, e-commerce capabilities that are available on the mobile device here in India are more forward-looking compared to what we have in the West. How can Intel Security Group partner with the government in these initiatives? We spend a lot of time with the government and in some cases, we are a trusted adviser to the government. We work with them around the threat landscape and we also sell to the government as well. We had a good growth business, we grew 20% last year here. I expect we will see double-digit growth in this market for the course of the next several years. You might also want to see this: I think security has to be built into some of the government initiatives, such as Smart Cities, Digital India and a host of e-governance progammes. As we build our digital infrastructure, whether its cloud infrastructure and the data center or mobile infrastructure, security has to be part of it. It has to be part of the architecture and has to be part of the product set. It’s one of the reasons why we just made the Micromax announcement. As the mobile device is becoming more core to the user experience in India, we just believe that integrating security into that experience out of the box makes a big difference on protecting the consumer. What are some of the biggest security threats perceived by consumers globally? Consumers are worried about viruses. They worry about malware. Increasingly, they are worried about ransomware. The problem is most consumers aren’t that well aware of what the risks really look like. So they rely on security providers. They rely on governments and on others to anticipate what could go wrong for them and to find ways to protect them. That’s a good example of what we are doing with Micromax, what we generally do across our portfolio and consumers. We try to bring security to the experience that they already have. We try to integrate it in as many places as we possibly can, because we know that consumers are not security experts. India is ranked fairly high as vulnerable to cyber attacks. Any suggestions to overcome these challenges? Every country has critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and India is not unique in that respect. We are all chasing and fighting against the cyber security problem and it’s a dynamic model. I think that there is no silver bullet answer; there is not a specific thing you can do to fix every problem. The most important thing is leadership paying attention to it, rewarding good decision-making, and emphasis on cyber security is the first step to improving everything across the board. Tell us something about Intel Security, its growth globally in recent years and in India as well. When we spinoff as McAfee, we will be one of the largest cyber security players in the market. I like to joke that we will be an over $2 billion start-up because we will be a new company, but relatively large in size. We have a robust portfolio. One of the things that makes us unique is we protect consumers as well as businesses and government. So we cut across the entire spectrum of people and places to protect and we are one of the best in the industry doing that. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 2, 2017 at 2:09PM Machine learning is part of the broader artificial intelligence (AI) market, where computers are given information and learn how interpret it on their own. Self-driving cars, for example, may be preprogrammed not to cross over a double yellow line when they drive, but machine learning within those driverless cars will learn that in certain situations -- like getting around a parked car on the street -- it may be necessary to cross over that line.  Machine learning's market potential is often lumped together with the AI market, which is expected to be worth $47 billion in 2020, according to industry analytics company IDC. And three companies -- NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) -- are betting big on the market in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. NVIDIA NVIDIA's known for its graphic processing units (GPUs) for the gaming sector, but the company is increasingly using its chips to power machine learning systems in powerful servers.  NVIDIA says on its website that GPUs can process more information in less time, and use less data center infrastructure to do so, which makes them the ideal candidate for machine learning systems.  And a lot of companies are already using NVIDIA's GPUs for their machine learning. Facebook uses the company's GPU accelerators for its Big Sur machine learning computers and says on its website that, "Leveraging NVIDIA's Tesla Accelerated Computing Platform, Big Sur is twice as fast as our previous generation, which means we can train twice as fast and explore networks twice as large." And Alphabet's Google is tapping into NVIDIA's GPUs for its cloud platform. The company recently wrote on its blog that NVIDIA's Tesla K80 GPUs are now available on Google's Compute Engine and Cloud Machine Learning to allow developers to rent the machine learning resources that they need. Grabbing big clients like Facebook and Google is important, of course, but NVIDIA also has its own machine learning and AI prospects as well. The company sells its $129,000 DGX-1 server for AI processing and its Drive PX 2 computer for self-driving cars.  NVIDIA's own offerings, along with sales to other companies, are already starting to pay off. The company's data center revenue grew by 205% year over year in the most recent quarter. That didn't all come from machine learning, but it shows that NVIDIA is already on the right track with its GPU-powered data centers, and machine learning could accelerate that opportunity even more.  Intel Intel has long been the clear leader in the server space, with 99% of market share, and the company is trying to parlay that position into a strong machine learning offering as well.  One way it's doing this is with the recent acquisition of driverless-car tech company Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). According to a recent MIT Technology Review article, "Intel's acquisition of Mobileye shows how critical data and machine learning are to the auto industry's future." With this acquisition, Intel is paying $15.3 billion to help keep up with NVIDIA, which has been pulling ahead in machine learning. Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said in an investor note several months ago that Intel has been "playing catch-up to NVIDIA" in the AI space, but that it's making progress toward better long-term prospects. Mobileye should certainly be considered one of those long-term prospects, as the company's technology is already used in 70% of advanced driver assistance systems and will give Intel an opportunity to show whether its processors can compete against NVIDIA's GPUs in the self-driving car market. IBM Last but not least, IBM is making a huge play in machine learning with its Watson machine learning analytics. IBM recently announced that it's bringing Watson to its mainframe customers, allowing them to intelligently search through their own data.  The company says that most data lives in what's called the private cloud (mainframe servers owned by large companies) and that its machine learning systems will help companies sort through their own data and make better decisions with it.    For example, IBM says that its new cognitive platform can help retail companies forecast sales market trends on a daily basis, as opposed to the usually monthly analysis. Or offer financial advisors a better way to recommend products based on a client's interests, trends, and market movements. IBM also says that its machine learning platform can analyze the best way for healthcare companies to offer individual products on a more personalized basis. IBM believes the cognitive computing market, which encompasses machine learning, will become a $2 trillion market by 2025. To help capture more of that market, IBM has made a series of acquisitions in the cognitive healthcare space recently -- to the tune of $4 billion -- in order to solidify its position. Top stocks, but still some unknowns While the machine learning space is growing, there are still a lot of uncertainties as to who will benefit the most in this space. But if I had to pick one stock right now, I'd lean toward NVIDIA. IDC has said that GPUs can "improve the performance of analytics computing", which encompasses machine learning systems. The company has huge upside potential in the space, considering that NVIDIA is the leader in the GPU processor space right now. Additionally, if machine learning takes longer to grow than expected, NVIDIA has its strong gaming revenue and a growing data center business to fall back on.  Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Dean Takahashi@deantak April 2, 2017 9:05 AM Tags: Gordon Moore, Intel, Kaizad Mistry, Mark Bohr, Qualcomm, Ruth Brain Above: Ruth Brain and Kaizad Mistry are manufacturing tech leaders at Intel. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Intel was quiet about its technological advances for a while, and that made people wonder if Moore’s Law was slowing down. In 1965, Intel chairman emeritus Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors on a chip will double every year, and that prediction has held true. And by living up to that prediction, the world’s biggest chip maker has helped deliver the wonders of the modern world, which delivers the same computing power in a smartphone today that took a giant mainframe computer more than a decade ago. Last week, Intel tech executives spoke up and asserted that while this latest cycle of Moore’s Law is taking longer, it is delivering more than a 2X gain in the number of transistors. The result is that Intel is still on track with Moore’s Law. We interviewed Kaizad Mistry, Intel’s corporate vice president in the logic technology group, and Ruth Brain, an Intel fellow, about Moore’s Law. They both said that the believed in the future of Moore’s Law and the industry’s ability to meet it, and they said that wasn’t a religious belief. Dan Hutcheson, a longtime chip analyst, concurred in a separate interview. Here’s an edited transcript of our conversation with Mistry and Brain. VB: I hadn’t made it to a lot of the analyst days, but it sounds like you’re sharing a lot more here than you have at some of those. Kaizad Mistry: I think it’s time, in our 10 nanometer technology, to make some technology disclosures. Each technology, we reach a point where it’s time to disclose what’s in it. Back when we did finFETs for the first time, about two-three-four quarters before the product’s out, we would do the big technology disclosure. It’s that point for 10 nanometer this time around. VB: It’s a good message, to have that better-than-Moore’s-Law result in the latest part of the graph you’re showing. Mistry: Or at least it’s a different way of achieving the same result. It’s a bigger step, but with a longer cadence, achieving the same annual rate. That’s a message we haven’t consistently given before, even though it’s been true. It was true for 14, but we haven’t gone through and systematically explained that before. Above: Gordon Moore, chairman emeritus of Intel. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: Everybody had been worried about Moore’s Law slowing, because of the previous part of the graph. It’s been a few years, instead of the usual two. Mistry: That’s the thing we’re trying to explain. It’s a bigger step over a longer time, but the same rate. VB: What explains that part? Is it a bumpier stretch than we may have seen in the past? Mistry: There are sound technical reasons why we’re taking bigger steps that take longer. The biggest one is that you have to go to multi-pass patterning. As Ruth explained, if you’re going to do two-pass patterning, you spend twice as much to pattern that layer. You might as well scale faster than .7X to extract the value of spending twice the money. If you spend twice the money to scale .7X, you’re not going to get the traditional cost-per-transistor improvement. You have to go faster. Ruth Brain: You need both. You need the innovations, and once you’ve done the innovation, you might as well utilize it. Not just barely inch yourself along. Mistry: If you don’t—Mark showed this. If you do that hypothetical, if we had spent the money on the dual-pass patterning but scaled at the traditional 2X Moore’s Law pace, we would have fallen off that cost-per-transistor improvement rate. The technology would have been better than the previous one— Brain: –but just not really scaled. We would have done all that innovation, but not gotten the benefit of it. Mistry: That’s what’s changed. Multi-pass patterning is what’s fundamentally driven the change. There are sound economic reasons behind it. VB: I thought it was an interesting chart, to go back 10 years and see 18 companies on the leading edge. Now we have only four. But that also explains a lot of things. It shows why the foundry business is more attractive. Brain: A lot of independent design teams are still out there, and they still need a place to go. Mistry: If you look at that same chart for design teams, there are many, many more. VB: It does seem like the other guys have been saying the same things forever, and you guys have been saying you’re a generation ahead forever. Brain: That’s why we try to show those real density values. That’s us trying to get back to quantifying it. We tried to show—you show that they incremented a technology node, but they got four to nine percent. That’s not even close to what we would have traditionally called a node. When we go in and quantify it, we’re trying to help people understand that the name doesn’t mean much anymore, versus really going in and doing the quantification. Above: Ruth Brain, an Intel fellow, says Moore’s Law is holding up. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: Some of the arguments I’d seen, at least from Qualcomm, using Samsung, was that they were catching up because of the transition from PCs to smartphones. That was their rationale for why it makes sense that they’re catching up or have caught up. Mistry: This is what we’re saying. Not all 10 nanometers are the same. Brain: It’s come out in our technical papers. If you look at our technical publications we’ve put out at IEDM and things like that, you can see it. The name confusion has caused a lot of trouble for people who don’t look at the analysis. That’s part of what we did today, to set the record straight again. You can say this node number, but let’s look at the data. We’re engineers. Let’s quantify things and show what they really look like. VB: As far as the future of Moore’s Law, everybody has been saying forever that it has to slow down, but you’ve shown that it’s on track? Mistry: I can answer that in three different ways. First is the direct answer, which is that seven is defined for us. We know exactly how we’re going to do it. It’s in active development. Mark Bohr is actively in the process of defining five. We think we have the elements to put together to make five work. If you look back historically, our visibility has always been a couple of generations out. That’s no different today from how it has been. I’ve been in this industry since the mid-‘80s. My first technology was two micron, at a different company. That’s 2000 nanometers. I remember in 1989, we were talking about the sub-micron barrier. Would we cross that chasm? And then the lithography barrier, with 248 to 193 and 193 to immersion, and then double patterning. No technology has been easy. Our visibility today is no different from it was in 2000, when silicon dioxide was coming to end and we didn’t know how we would solve that problem. It’s always innovations that help us solve the problem. To go back to Gordon Moore himself: when he was speaking to engineers at Intel 20 years ago, he was asked how long Moore’s Law would continue. His response was, “No exponential is forever, but your job is to delay ‘forever.’” We keep delaying it. Our visibility is still about two years out, which is what is has been the last couple of decades. 1 2 View All ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 2, 2017 at 9:30AM At Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Technology and Manufacturing Day, the company had executive Murthy Renduchintala -- the president of the company's Client and Internet of Things Group, as well as the head of the company's System Architecture group -- talking about Intel's chip-manufacturing technology from a product perspective. After all, Intel doesn't sell chip technology to its major customers today, though it certainly has ambitions to do so in the future. Instead, it sells finished products that it designs itself, using mostly its own manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel. So, it's important to have a sense of not just what manufacturing technologies Intel has today and coming down the line, but also what the company plans to do with it to build salable, competitive products. At the event, Renduchintala talked about Intel's plans to fundamentally change how it builds future processors for personal computers. Let's take a closer look. Old versus new Intel first talked about the "old" way it has designed chips, showing how the old methodology called for everything to be integrated into a single piece of silicon.  Image source: Intel. About the chip in this image, Renduchintala said that it's "pretty typical of what the industry has traditionally done." "It's monolithic, where all the [intellectual properties] are constituted in the same process technology," the executive explained. Renduchintala went on to say that the need to build these individual technologies in the same manufacturing technology, which has been necessary since they're all integrated into a single piece of silicon, is "constraining" to the company. "Intel has a rich portfolio of [intellectual property] in an array of process nodes, all optimized to localized power, performance, and area, or PPA" he began. "And this presents an incredible opportunity for Intel in creating heterogeneous [systems-on-a-chip]." What Renduchintala means is that instead of building a single piece of silicon that integrates all the key technologies, the company can build individual subsystems in different manufacturing technologies and stitch them together using a technology that it calls Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge. Image source: Intel. Renduchintala said this new design methodology will have "a profound impact on how [Intel] will deliver products to the market now and in the future." The executive explained how this new methodology allows Intel to "mix high-performance blocks of silicon and [intellectual property] together with low power elements made from different nodes for extreme optimization." Some interesting possibilities Intel didn't go into specific details about the future products that will be built using this heterogeneous design methodology, but if Intel can get it right. then it's not hard to imagine, and it's easy to get excited about the possibilities this new methodology opens up.  Today, Intel is quite limited in the number of unique chip variants it can build. Remember, not only does Intel work under the constraint that everything needs to be built using the same manufacturing technology, but it also has to deal with the reality that since everything is integrated into a single piece of silicon, it can only really afford to build a handful of chips that it needs to use to address a wide range of markets.  You might be surprised to learn that Intel's entire mainstream desktop processor family -- which includes countless variants at a very wide range of price points -- is made up of just two distinct silicon dies. Those same dies are also used for the company's high-performance notebook products.  Intel does a reasonable job of using those two chips to span such a large cross-section of the overall personal-computer market, but with a little imagination it's not hard to see how Intel could -- using this new product-development methodology -- broaden the range of products that it offers into these markets. Such a broadening of the portfolio would probably have a positive impact on both product margin and product mix: It's likely that the former would go up, and the latter would become richer.  Today, Intel's main offerings in what it calls the "enthusiast gaming" market are chips known as the Core i3 7350K, Core i5 7600K, and Core i7 7700K. The 7350K is simply a dual-core desktop chip that runs at a high frequency and can be adjusted by the user. The 7600K and 7700K are quad-core desktop chips that run at higher frequencies than their non-"enthusiast gaming" counterparts and, like the i3, have user-adjustable frequencies.  These chips do well for Intel, but there are some problems with them. Since they're based on the same silicon dies as the company's more mainstream desktop and notebook chips, they include integrated graphics processors that take up a significant portion of chip space. Enthusiast gaming users aren't going to use those graphics processors, so Intel is in effect selling chips to users that are larger than they need to be, and thus more expensive to manufacture than they ought to be. In an ideal world, Intel could sell chips without taking up all that space with graphics, lowering Intel's product costs and improving its margin. It could even boost its profits by offering chips that replace that wasted graphics silicon with more of the stuff that enthusiast gamers would be willing to pay for, such as more I/O, CPU cores, and cache memory.  The enthusiast gaming market isn't yet large enough to justify separate monolithic dies, so Intel simply repurposes or tweaks silicon dies that it uses for other, higher-volume segments, which means certain segments get suboptimal products because those chips were designed subject to too many constraints.  In a world where Intel can simply mix and match intellectual properties to build particular products, Intel could have the ability to remove the bits that enthusiast gamers aren't going to use or pay for -- i.e. the graphics block -- while building out products that include more of what those customers are willing to pay for, potentially driving up product mix. Now, this is just one example, but the personal-computer market -- as Renduchintala pointed out at the company's investor meeting back in February -- isn't one-size-fits-all. There are lots of sub-categories of the market that may not have been worth doing specialized chips for under the old monolithic chip design methodology but that in this new world of heterogeneous chip design would be great candidates for specialized chips.  Such specialization could mean better products for Intel's customers and better cost structures for each product segment, which together could lead to a much more successful and profitable Intel.    Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Here are five strong ideas. John Rosevear (TMFMarlowe) Apr 2, 2017 at 9:05AM There are three things that most analysts in the automotive space agree on: Autonomous vehicles, or "self-driving cars," are for real, and headed to market. Once there are enough of them on the world's roads, the car business will be transformed, somehow. It will take several years (at least) for the nature of these transformations to become clear. Those points lead to a couple of questions that investors have been asking: Are there ways to invest in this emerging trend? Can we collect a dividend while we wait for these new businesses to emerge? The good news is that there are some companies that stand a good chance of seeing significant bottom-line growth in the self-driving world of the near future -- and that pay a good dividend right now. Here's why I think Autoliv (NYSE:ALV), Daimler AG (NASDAQOTH:DDAIF), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) are worth a closer look. Autoliv Autoliv is a big, important auto-industry supplier based in Sweden. Today, it's the world's largest supplier of automotive safety systems, a category that includes products like adaptive cruise control and automatic forward-collision braking systems that are building blocks for full self-driving. Importantly, its client list already includes most of the world's major automakers. Autonomous-vehicle systems are a natural extension of its current product line. Last year, the company announced a partnership with Volvo Cars to develop a full self-driving system. About 200 employees drawn from both companies are working on a Level 4 self-driving system. Once it's ready, Autoliv will have the right to market it to other automakers, likely early next decade. Autoliv's dividend yield is 2.4%, with a probably-sustainable payout ratio of 35.8%. Its price-to-earnings ratio is just under 16, on the high side but not outrageous given its technology orientation. But I'd argue it's still good value for a company with a solid track record of careful management, well-positioned to take advantage of this emerging trend. Daimler Daimler is mostly known to U.S. investors as the maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles. But it's more than that: Daimler is also a major global producer of medium and heavy trucks and buses under several brands, including Freightliner and the Mercedes-Benz brand. Daimler has been working on self-driving systems for many years, and its efforts appear to be quite advanced. Self-driving has obvious near-future applications in luxury cars, but the more significant opportunity over the next several years may be in automated long-haul trucking. Daimler could be a leader in the transition to self-driving heavy trucks. Its Highway Pilot system allows automated tractor-trailers to "platoon," or drive in a closely spaced, automated convoy. Mercedes-Benz tractor-trailer trucks fitted with a prototype of Daimler's Highway Pilot system in an Autobahn test last year. Note the position of the driver's hands. Image source: Daimler AG. Like most automakers, Daimler is a bit undervalued by the market at the moment. That makes for a fat forward dividend yield of about 4.6%, on a payout ratio of 41%. Under CEO Dieter Zetsche, Daimler's sales and margins have grown while the company makes strong investments for the future. Qualcomm There's much more to chip giant Qualcomm's business than autonomous-vehicle technology, of course. But it's taking a big leap into the self-driving space with the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which is expected to close by the end of this year. NXP specializes in semiconductors for automotive applications. That's more specialized than you might think: Autos, with their long lives, constant vibration, and wide temperature cycles, require rugged chips. NXP's offerings include chips designed to process radar and camera inputs, and an off-the-shelf product called BlueBox that packages several processors into a pre-wired "brain" for autonomous-vehicle developers. Qualcomm had about $24 billion in revenue in 2016. The combined company is expected to generate about $30 billion, so NXP is a significant addition. Qualcomm's forward dividend yield is a nice 3.7%, on a hefty 63% payout ratio. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 11.9, on the low side. The company has raised its dividend annually for 14 consecutive years. Intel Intel is kind of the dark horse here. On the one hand, as plenty of analysts will tell you, its core business is stagnating and its management team has been scrounging for growth catalysts. But on the other hand, I think it found a huge catalyst for growth when it announced a $15.3 billion deal to acquire Mobileye N.V. (NYSE:MBLY) last month. Mobileye is a big deal in the self-driving world. It makes chips and software that help computers intelligently understand images. These are critical components of today's advanced driver-assist systems, and they will be huge in tomorrow's self-driving vehicles. Simply put, Mobileye comes with deeply respected technology and a client list that includes nearly all of the world's automakers, two very important assets. When the deal closes later this year, those assets will be Intel's, and Intel will instantly become a major player in advanced automotive systems. CEO Brian Krzanich thinks of self-driving cars as "data centers on wheels"; he believes the total addressable market for systems for autonomous vehicles, and the data centers that will support them, will be over $100 billion a year by 2030. Whatever its other flaws, Intel is now in a prime position to grab a big piece of that. The impact on a company that generated $59.4 billion in revenue in 2016 is likely to be quite significant. Right now, Intel pays a forward dividend yield of 3.1%, for a payout ratio of 49%. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio is just over 12, a reflection of analysts' concerns. But the Mobileye deal looks from here like a gateway to big growth -- and a better valuation. Ford Motor Company There are several good reasons to think that Ford is a value buy for investors willing to be patient. Self-driving is one: Ford's research and development efforts, already fairly advanced, took a very big step forward earlier this year when it announced a $1 billion investment in a new start-up called Argo AI. Argo AI is a big deal. This start-up, led by self-driving superstars from Alphabet and Uber, will create the software "brain" for Ford's self-driving cars. Its structure should give Ford's effort a big recruiting and retention advantage over rivals. That could prove to be huge. Ford's self-driving test fleet uses modified Fusion sedans. Image source: Ford Motor Company. On the product side, Ford plans to begin mass-producing a dedicated Level 4 self-driving vehicle for car-sharing and ride-hailing use in 2021. It appears to be laying the groundwork for an app-based suite of mobility services that might include a Ford-branded challenge to Uber and Lyft. Taken together, the world of "mobility" offers a significant bottom-line growth opportunity for Ford, one that CEO Mark Fields is already working to seize. Meanwhile, Ford is booking fat profits on trucks and SUVs. But the stock is cheap, because analysts are skeptical of its near-term growth potential; it's trading at around 6.5 times its adjusted 2016 earnings. Patience will be required, as it will take some time for the bottom-line growth to materialize. But while you wait, you'll collect a fat (and likely sustainable) dividend yield of 5.16%. And you'll sleep at night: Fields and his battle-tested management team, nearly all veterans of Ford's turnaround, are making the right moves to take Ford into a profitable future.

Israeli artificial vision device company OrCam has closed a $41 million financing round that values the company at $600 million, the company's chairman Prof. Amnon Shashua has told "Reuters." The Jerusalem based company was founded in 2010 by Shashua and CEO Ziv Aviram, the same duo who founded car sensor developer Mobileye, which was sold to Intel last month for $15.3 billion - easily a record exit in Israel. OrCam has raised $63 million to date, including the latest financing round. Prof. Shashua did not disclose details about the investors in the latest round but previous investors included Intel Capital, BRM and Aviv Venture Capital. RELATED ARTICLES Liberating the visually impaired Intel invests $20m in artificial vision co OrCam OrCam has developed a computer vision device that includes a miniature video camera and processing unit that can be attached to eyeglasses. Through a computer vision algorithm, the device is able to vocalize texts it encounters, such as street signs, a restaurant menu, a newspaper, or a book, to those with vision problems. It can identify supermarket products and distinguish different denominations of bills. The identification is communicated to the user verbally with almost no delay from the moment the information is requested by pointing. The device weighs a very light 14 grams. Like every electronic device, it must be kept charged. Shashua told "Reuters" that OrCam expects to conduct an IPO on the NYSE or Nasdaq by the end of next year."Sales targets for 2017 are four times more than 2016," Shashua said. "By the end of 2018 the revenue, the profit, of the company will be at such a level, together with the ability to forecast, that it's good enough for an IPO." Shashua does not see a problem in leading both Mobileye and OrCam at the same time. He told "Reuters,""I'm going to get more responsibilities as folding in Intel's assets in autonomous driving and leading the combined effort, but I believe that this is not going to change anything in terms of the time I spend at OrCam." OrCam has two products. The first, OrCam MyEye, is designed for reading texts in newspapers, books, documents, and signs; identifying products at home or in a store (such as distinguishing between a can of corn and a can of beans); and identifying people's faces (mainly for people with face blindness syndrome – an inability to distinguish between people). The second, OrCam MyReader, is designed for reading texts on smartphone screens. A third product still in development, OrCam MyMe, which can be worn on a shirt, provides the user with information about almost anything, from the food he is eating, the person sitting in front of him, the time he spent in his recent sports activity, etc. OrCam's solution still cannot be used to watch television, because you have to point to the screen from close up.

Here is a look at those who are at the center of the storm. House Intelligence Committee The investigation of Russia led by chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) is in crisis. The New York Times reported this week that two White House officials played a role in passing classified information to Nunes, giving more ammunition to critics who say the GOP-led investigation has been compromised. It was the latest setback for the embattled Nunes, who has steadfastly refused to present evidence or sources for his claim that some in Trump’s inner circle were the subject of incidental surveillance during the transition. Questions about Nunes’s handling of the issue — and the Trump administration’s possible involvement — have prompted calls from Democrats for Nunes to step aside. Republicans have tried to hold ranking Intelligence Committee member Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: 'Alarm bells' should go off when Trump calls something 'fake' Former House intel chief: 'I wouldn't grant immunity' Top Intelligence committee Dem: Too early to draw conclusions on Russia probe MORE (D-Calif.) to the same standard, taking him to task for claiming — without proof — that he has seen hard evidence of collusion between Trump officials and Moscow. Senate Intelligence Committee With the House investigation flailing, many are looking to the Senate to conduct the authoritative review of Russia and possible Trump connections. The committee’s first public hearing this week spent little time on the politically explosive aspects of the Russia issue, such as intelligence leaks or President Trump’s wiretapping claims. Still, there were several revealing moments. Sen. Marco RubioMarco RubioMeet the actors in the Russia drama Health officials brace for return of Zika Democrats go for broke in race for Tom Price's seat MORE (R-Fla.) said Russian hackers had targeted his presidential campaign, while a former FBI agent accused Trump of spreading Russian propaganda and "fake news." But overall, chairman Richard BurrRichard BurrMcCain: Nunes 'killed' opportunity for bipartisan investigation into Russian interference Meet the actors in the Russia drama Senate Intel Dem says panel 'not ready' to consider Flynn immunity MORE (R-N.C.) and ranking member Mark WarnerMark WarnerMcCain: Nunes 'killed' opportunity for bipartisan investigation into Russian interference Meet the actors in the Russia drama Senate Intel Dem says panel 'not ready' to consider Flynn immunity MORE (D-Va.) seem eager to avoid the appearance of politicization in their investigation. Michael Flynn Trump’s former national security adviser has offered to provide testimony to the House and Senate Intelligence committees on the condition that he is given legal immunity. So far, the panels have not taken him up on the offer. Democrats have characterized Flynn’s request as an admission of guilt. But in a tweet on Friday, Trump encouraged Flynn to testify and said he was smart to request immunity amid the “witch hunt…by media & Dems.”  The White House says it is not worried that Flynn might have dirt on the administration. Trump asked Flynn to step down in February for lying to Vice President Pence about the nature of his conversations with Russian officials during the transition period. There are also questions about whether Flynn was properly registered as a foreign agent.  It was revealed this month that Flynn lobbied on behalf of the Turkish government during the campaign. Flynn only filed his foreign agent documents after news reports detailed how his consulting firm had taken more than $500,000 for the work. Paul Manafort President Trump’s former campaign chairman left the campaign last August amid questions about his work for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. Now, McClatchy reports the FBI, Justice Department and Treasury Department are investigating who paid Manafort for that work, how Manafort handled those payments and whether he was properly registered as a foreign agent at the time. Manafort’s personal finances have also attracted scrutiny.  WNYC reports that Manafort used shell companies for cash purchases of property in New York City before taking out loans against those properties in his own name. And NBC reports that Manafort closed about a dozen bank accounts in Cyprus after his dealings attracted scrutiny from regulators there. Manafort has denied any wrongdoing and has offered to be interviewed by the House Intelligence Committee. The White House has sought separation from him, with press secretary Sean Spicer saying Manafort “played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time” with the campaign. The Obama administration Republicans are certain that holdovers from the Obama administration are behind a series of damaging leaks of sensitive information.  Attorney General Jeff SessionsJeff SessionsNewark mayor: Trump trying to force sanctuary cities into becoming 'fugitive slave catchers' Meet the actors in the Russia drama Maher, Roger Stone share marijuana cake on TV MORE has said that rooting out those leaks and prosecuting offenders who have broken the law will be a priority for his Justice Department. Trump’s allies are adamant that while the media chases stories about collusion between the campaign and Russia, that only one verifiable crime has been committed — the unmasking of Flynn in a classified intelligence report and its subsequent leak to the media. At a House Intelligence committee hearing this month, Rep. Trey GowdyTrey GowdyMeet the actors in the Russia drama Gowdy: Nunes briefed president on matters 'unrelated' to Russia probe Sunday shows preview: Aftermath of failed healthcare bill MORE (R-S.C.) asked FBI director James Comey about potential “suspects,” ticking through the names of former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, former national security adviser Susan Rice, former White House adviser Ben Rhodes, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. He asked whether they would have had access to the intelligence in the leaked reports. Comey responded in the affirmative for each. Meanwhile, Republicans are eagerly awaiting Nunes’s findings. They think he will reveal that the Obama administration passed around surveillance reports — obtained legally, but through backdoor means — of the Trump campaign. Fox News White House reporter John Roberts said Friday he had been told by intelligence officials that Nunes is “aware of who did the unmasking of certain individuals in the transition and may be aware of who ordered the unmasking of those individuals.” Sens. John McCainJohn McCainMcCain: Trump is nothing like Reagan Trump makes little headway filling out Pentagon jobs McCain: Nunes 'killed' opportunity for bipartisan investigation into Russian interference MORE (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey GrahamLindsey GrahamGraham booed at town hall after saying he will vote for Gorsuch Meet the actors in the Russia drama Trump takes risk with Freedom Caucus attack MORE (R-S.C.) McCain and Graham have led the charge in calling for an independent 9/11-style commission to investigate Russian meddling in the election. The senators have been extremely critical of Nunes’s handling of the House Intelligence Committee investigation, saying the effort has been spoiled by partisanship, bungling and questionable contacts with the White House. The senators want either a special prosecutor brought in to oversee an investigation outside of Congress, or for lawmakers to appoint a select committee to lead an investigation on Capitol Hill. An independent investigation has strong support from Democrats, but has so far been rejected by the White House and most Republicans in Congress, who want to see the House and Senate committees complete their work. Cracks are beginning to show in the GOP, however. Two other Republican lawmakers — Reps. Walter Jones (N.C.) and Carlos Curbelo (Fla.) — told The Hill this week they would support a select committee or independent commission to lead an investigation. Jared Kushner President Trump’s son-in-law, who is also a White House senior adviser, has volunteered to be interviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee. Kushner has acknowledged meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign, although it is common for foreign diplomats to meet with campaign and government officials. But the revelation that Kushner spoke with executives from a Russian bank sanctioned by the U.S. for its role in Russia’s incursion into Ukraine has raised questions. Officials from the bank have described the encounter with Kushner as a normal-course strategic session with industry leaders. Sally Yates Democrats are eager to hear from the former acting attorney general after a Washington Post report this week suggested the Trump administration sought to use executive privilege to block her from testifying before the House Intelligence Committee.  After Trump fired Yates earlier this year for refusing to defend his immigration executive order, it was revealed that she had previously notified the White House that then-national security adviser Flynn had not properly explained his contact with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn was later fired for misleading Vice President Pence on the issue. The Washington Post has published documents that showed the DOJ informed Yates that if she testified, she might be limited in what she could say because of executive privilege. Yates was scheduled to testify this week before the House Intelligence Committee, but Nunes canceled the hearing. That has led to accusations that the Trump administration and House Intelligence Committee conspired to squash testimony from a witness out of fear she would provide damaging testimony. The White House said it never considered invoking executive privilege, and press secretary Sean Spicer this week said he hopes Yates will testify. Roger Stone The conservative political operative and longtime Trump ally is in hot water over his own public statements. Shortly before WikiLeaks published emails that hackers stole from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Stone tweeted: “Trust me, it will soon be Podesta’s time in the barrel.” And Stone has acknowledged a private Twitter correspondence with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker. At the Senate hearing this week, ranking member Warner said Stone “predicted the release of Podesta’s emails” and was in contact with Guccifer 2.0, described by Warner as “the Russian intelligence persona responsible for these cyber operations.” Stone maintains that he had no idea the Podesta leaks were coming and described his conversation with Guccifer 2.0 as “totally benign.” Stone has volunteered to give public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. He says the FBI has not contacted him about an investigation into his activities. Carter Page Page was a foreign policy adviser to Trump, although the campaign downplayed his involvement. The oil industry consultant whose financial dealings involve deep ties to Russia officially left the campaign last September amid scrutiny over one of his trips to Moscow. Page has denied meeting with Russian officials on the trip and says the allegations leveled against him in an unsubstantiated dossier compiled by a British spy are false. Page has been blanketing the airwaves to say he’s the subject of a witch hunt and a smear campaign. He has offered to speak with the House Intelligence Committee on the matter.  Tags Lindsey Graham Jeff Sessions Richard Burr John McCain Adam Schiff Mark Warner Marco Rubio Trey Gowdy   View the discussion thread.

It also shipped a Curie-based “Radium 96BIE” SBC. Last September, Gumstix unveiled two single board computers based on Intel Joule and Curie modules, and built to 96Boards CE and the new, MCU-oriented 96Boards IE (IoT Edition) form-factor specifications, respectively. The Curie-based 96Boards IE compliant Radium 96BIE board is now available for $75, and Gumstix has also added Arduino IDE support for designing similar Curie-based boards in its Geppetto D2O custom board design and manufacturing service. Radium 96BIE, front and back (click images to enlarge) By adding Arduino IDE support for the Curie’s Quark SE MCU, both Arduino and Intel x86-oriented designers can use Geppetto to “rapidly design and manufacture small form-factor expansion boards for their wearables, IoT and robotic devices in minutes,” says Gumstix. “We are excited to support the Arduino community with a rapid, low cost and simple hardware design-to- order platform,” stated Gordon Kruberg, Gumstix CEO. Designers can start with the Radium 96BIE design to prototype or create their own Curie-based custom expansion board design. During the free design process, users can compare alternatives for features and costs, create multiple projects, and share ideas, and then go straight from a design to an order in one session, says Gumstix. Custom BSPs and documentation are available with orders, and production quality boards are shipped in 15 business days. The initial manufacturing cost is $1,999, with discounts for quantity orders and repeat board spins.

The technical press labeled it a ‘marchitecture,’ and complained that customers weren’t actually getting the performance they thought they were entitled to.” “What we later realized,” Krzanich continued, “Was that we didn’t actually have to sell people any performance improvements at all. We could just tell them the chips were faster, make up some benchmark numbers, and kick the product out the door.” Krzanich then gave a rough timeline of events, including secret pacts between Intel and IBM, mutual agreements between itself and ARM that killed the early “smartbook” concept but led to Intel’s withdrawal from the mobile market, and AMD’s disastrous attempt to buck this shadowed conspiracy arrangement and go it alone. He chuckled, recounting how Intel funneled hundreds of millions of dollars in secret payments to GlobalFoundries and the Mubadala Development Company, ensuring that AMD’s fab partner was actually responsible for sabotaging the entire Bulldozer product family. That move, by the way, was payback for AMD’s counter-espionage that savaged Itanium and the IA-64 instruction set by paying Microsoft billions to promote the false notion that AMD64 was a superior architecture. “It took us several years,” Krzanich concluded, his voice hoarse and sounding vaguely like Emperor Palpatine, “But we finally got the mobile companies on board as well. Have you noticed how advances in mobile chips have slowed? It’s not power consumption issues. It’s certainly not a problem with our materials technology — silicon could easily hit 10GHz, like Craig Barrett predicted nearly 20 years ago. We just realized we didn’t need to bother doing it. The sheeple never knew what hit them.” A bombshell discovery For years, ExtremeTech and dozens of other publications and websites have written about the decline of silicon scaling. We’ve discussed future transistor designs, the myths of Moore’s law, the evolution of that law over time, process node technology, the failure of 450mm wafer development, and a dozen other topics. Now, that research stands in ruins; the work of hundreds of journalists, lithographers, and engineers, disproved by a single CEO’s secret taped remarks. But Krzanich’s remarks just lead to further questions. How has this super-alliance of evil been flawlessly maintained for decades? How could thousands of people working for dozens of companies possibly have been convinced or coerced into keeping this mammoth conspiracy a secret? Is it the Illuminati? The Bilderberg Group? Is Cthulhu stirring in the dead city of R’lyeh? We don’t know. But we’re going to find out.         LATEST STORIES (7) Syrian Army Continues to March on Terrorists' Positions in Hama Syrian Army Troops Storm Terrorists' Positions North of Hama Syrian Army Forces Push against Al-Nusra Terrorists North of Hama Syrian Army Continues to March on Terrorists' Strongholds in Hama Syria: New Areas Liberated after Heavy Clashes with Terrorists North of Hama Residents Return to Khattab after Syrian Army Captures Town Iraqi Families Flee Mosul Amid Fighting Between Gov't Forces, ISIL Terror in Yemen: Saudis Delight in Blood and Pain - Without a Redeeming Feature Nature’s Day Celebrated in Iran Scores of ISIL Members Killed in Clashes with Kurdish-Led SDF in Northern Syria Terrorists' Centers in Aleppo Province Receive Severe Blow in Syrian Armed Forces' Attacks Syrian Army Shells Terrorists' Positions in Southern Outskirts of Damascus Dara'a: Terrorists' Command Post Destroyed in Syrian Army Attack Hama: Terrorists' Military Grid Sustains Major Damage in Syrian Army Attack Official: Registration for Iran's Presidential Candidates Slated for April 11-16 Syrian Army Continues to March on Terrorists' Positions in Hama TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian Army troops continued to hit hard the terrorists' strongholds in Northern Hama and managed to recapture more lands after hours of non-stop clashes.

Mark WarnerMark WarnerMcCain: Nunes 'killed' opportunity for bipartisan investigation into Russian interference Meet the actors in the Russia drama Senate Intel Dem says panel 'not ready' to consider Flynn immunity MORE (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says his committee is "not ready" to consider former national security adviser Michael Flynn's request for an immunity from prosecution. "That would be a decision that the chairman [Sen. Richard BurrRichard BurrMcCain: Nunes 'killed' opportunity for bipartisan investigation into Russian interference Meet the actors in the Russia drama Senate Intel Dem says panel 'not ready' to consider Flynn immunity MORE (R-N.C.)] and I make. But we are not ready to consider that," Warner said in an interview with John Catsimatidis that aired Sunday on New York's AM 970. "We are not even publicly acknowledging that he contacted us ... we just started reviewing the raw intelligence," he added. ADVERTISEMENT Flynn's attorney said this week he would be wiling to testify to officials investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election only if he is given immunity from "unfair" prosecution, but members of the committees have so far signaled that they're not prepared to make such an agreement. Flynn was asked to step down from his White House role in February after he misled Vice President Pence about his discussion of anti-Russia sanctions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Warner in the interview Sunday also called the behavior of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) "bizarre, at best." Nunes visited the White House last week to brief President Trump after he said he learned that the U.S. intelligence community had incidentally collected information on members of his transition team. Warner said that members of the Senate panel will request the intelligence that was shared with Nunes, who was reportedly aided by two White House officials last week when he obtained the information that he later used to brief Trump. "Obviously we should review these materials. It needs to be done in a secure location in the Congress," Warner said. "I have a lot of questions about what Mr. Nunes did or didn't do. His behavior is bizarre, at best," he added. Rep. Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: 'Alarm bells' should go off when Trump calls something 'fake' Former House intel chief: 'I wouldn't grant immunity' Top Intelligence committee Dem: Too early to draw conclusions on Russia probe MORE (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, visited the White House on Friday and said he viewed what was presented as the same information given to Nunes last week. Warner said that the Senate Intelligence Committee is prepared to conduct a fair investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, calling the probe the most important project of his political career. "When I took on this investigation almost two months ago, I said at that point it was going to be the most important thing I have ever done in my political career," he said.

This is creating a mergers and acquisition bonanza for investment banks. By Peter Köhler and Robert Landgraf Published on 02. April 2017, 12:00 Why it matters Why it matters The M&A business is the dominant sector in investment banking. Facts Facts In the first quarter of 2017, the volume of M&A deals worldwide reached $684 billion (€635 billion). Deutsche Bank dominates the market in Germany; it collected $76.1 million in fees in the first quarter. Advising on the spin-offs of business units is also a burgeoning sector for investment banks. Audio Audio LISTEN Pdf Samsung's $8 billion purchase of electronic systems provider Harman kicked off the digitalization boom. Source: Harman The renowned futurologist Yuval Noah Harari once painted a dark vision of the digital revolution. “Most people will no longer be needed for the economy – they will be superfluous,” he said. Investment banks may not be the first affected group that springs to mind, but it seems that the world’s financiers are embracing those words. Experts in mergers and acquisitions, the premium class of investment banking, are now sensing opportunity, especially when it comes to deals involving automation. Deutsche Bank, for example, is currently building a four-person Emerging Technologies Team in Munich and Berlin. “The convergence between technology companies and the traditional sectors will become more and more of a driver in the M&A business in the coming years,” said Patrick Frowein, co-head of Corporate Finance at Deutsche Bank. The classic M&A business is still dominant in investment banking today. This is where the experts known as rainmakers work on all kinds of takeover deals in various industries, deals worth billions. In the first quarter of 2017, the volume of mergers and acquisitions announced worldwide reached $684 billion (€635 billion), incorporating more than 8,600 transactions. Calculations show that U.S. investment banks Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Citi were most frequently involved. “Digital factories and digital administrations are changing the added value structures in all industries.” Norbert Reis, Board member, HSBC Deutschland Investment banking as a whole – which includes both M&A consulting and the issue of stocks, bonds and loans – is an important source of income for banks. Deutsche Bank dominates the market in Germany. It collected $76.1 million in fees in the first quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Rothschild follow close behind. In the M&A business, investment bankers always make money when transactions are concluded. This is why the banks assisting with pharmaceutical giant Bayer’s acquisition of U.S. seed producer Monsanto will only cash in this fall, when the deal is concluded. Investment bankers are convinced that the digitalization of industry and services will be the next gold mine. “Digitalization will drastically change M&A in the coming years. Acquisitions in a single industry will be pushed back in favor of cross-sector transactions. This applies to the telecommunications and automobile industry, for example, where digitalization is already changing sectors at a rapid pace,” said Kai Tschöke, a manager at Rothschild. Deals like the €15.3 billion purchase of technology company Mobileye, which specializes in accident prevention systems, by chipmaker Intel will become more common in the future. Intel is pursuing a simple goal with the purchase: to acquire the technology for self-driving cars. The established German car industry also needs to beef up its capabilities with self-driving cars, multimedia networking and electric engines, said Mr. Tschöke, noting that German automakers have the capital and cash resources they need to move forward. Suppliers also need to be reorganized, he added. “One or more major deals involving cross-sector transactions this year, in which digitalization is the trigger, would not be surprising,” the banker predicted. Many investment bankers see Intel’s acquisition of Mobileye as the starting gun for a new type of globalization. Prior to it, Samsung’s purchase of electronic systems provider Harman for about $8 billion served as a wakeup call for experts. “The auto industry, together with its suppliers, is a good example of the fundamental changes that digitalization of various sectors entails,” said Armin von Falkenhayn, head of German operations for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which places first in M&A volume in Germany, ahead of Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. Competitors took great interest in transactions such as Samsung/Harman and Intel/Mobileye, said Mr. Falkenhayn. “You certainly look into your own need for action, and some of the questions – partly because of the speed of the transformation – can only be answered with acquisitions or the sale of business units.” Such dramatic changes are triggering a wave of purchases and sales of companies, he added. “Digital factories and digital administrations are changing the added value structures in all industries. This doesn’t just apply to the automobile sector,” said Norbert Reis, a member of the board of HSBC Deutschland. Transactions in the double-digit billions are not to be expected in the German market anytime soon. But in the coming years, many fast-growing startups will become attractive takeover targets. For Thomas Schweppe, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, the digitalization of industry will trigger further transactions, often in the form of joint ventures or smaller acquisitions. He estimates that an acquisition like that of U.S. software maker Mentor Graphics by Siemens in 2016, for the equivalent of more than €4 billion, was one of the bigger transactions. But the strong prospects for the future are not the only reason investment bankers are overflowing with optimism. “The year 2017 is going to be better than expected,” said Mr. Tschöke of Rothschild. “The drivers of deals are still in place: financing is cheap, the capital market is profitable, the economy is improving and the markets are optimistic. Bold investors have an opportunity to come out ahead through M&A.” Corporate spin-offs are also increasing. Retail group Metro, for example, plans to divide its business into a food business and a consumer electronics business (Ceconomy). Previous examples include utilities E.ON and RWE, which spun of their Uniper and Innogy business units last year. “The number of spinoffs of business units has increased considerably. We assume that the trend will continue in 2017,” said Jens Maurer, co-head of investment banking for Germany at Morgan Stanley.   Peter Köhler is a Handelsblatt editor in Frankfurt, reporting on banks, private equity firms, venture capital and corporate funding.

Nvidia and Intel have also released powerful new hardware, and PC builders are faced with a difficult choice of which components they should put in their system. To get an idea of the pricing difference between manufacturers, we compared the price of a gaming PC with Radeon and Ryzen hardware to a system using Intel and Nvidia components. Nvidia vs AMD build The GeForce GTX 1060 6GB and Radeon RX 480 8GB were used due to their similar performance and pricing, and the cheapest Ryzen 7 and Intel Core i7 processors were selected for the builds. All pricing is taken from Wootware. The comparison includes only the latest hardware from AMD, Nvidia, and Intel. Nvidia PC Build AMD PC Build Component Price Component Price Intel Core i7-7700 R5,099 AMD Ryzen 7 1700 R5,199 GeForce GTX 1060 6GB R4,199 Radeon RX 480 8GB R3,999 MSI Z270 Gaming Pro Carbon Motherboard R3,365 MSI X370 Gaming Pro Carbon Motherboard R3,365 G-Skill Ripjaws 16GB DDR4 RAM R1,729 G-Skill Ripjaws 16GB DDR4 RAM R1,729 Samsung 850 Evo 250GB SATA SSD R1,699 Samsung 850 Evo 250GB SATA SSD R1,699 Corsair VS550 Power Supply R771 Corsair VS550 Power Supply R771 Thermaltake Versa N21 ATX Chassis R770 Thermaltake Versa N21 ATX Chassis R770 Total Price R17,623 Total Price R17,523 Performance As you can see, there is R100 separating the AMD system and the Nvidia-Intel build. Each of the systems has its own advantages and disadvantages, as Intel’s Core i7 processors have been shown to yield better overall gaming performance than AMD’s new Ryzen 7 processors. However, AMD’s Ryzen 7 chips boast 16 threads and significantly better performance in multi-threaded processing applications. The Radeon RX 480 8GB and GeForce GTX 1060 6GB are similar in overall performance, but each have their own strengths. While the GeForce GTX 1060 is marginally better in DirectX 11 games and boasts better performance in games with GameWorks features, the Radeon RX 480 8GB shows promising results in games with DirectX 12 and Vulkan support. Both the AMD and Nvidia builds are similar in price and performance, leaving gamers free to make hardware purchasing decisions based on their workload or which manufacturers they prefer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News 3 Popular Stocks Hedge Fund Tycoons Are Ditching It’s not uncommon for Wall Street and retail investors to look toward the world’s top money managers for guidance on where the stock market, and some of the most popular stocks, are headed next. While these hedge-fund magnates can be wrong just like the rest of us, their track record suggests they know a thing or two about investing, which is why the investments of the world’s top hedge funds are so closely monitored. According to 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the fourth quarter, a handful of highly popular stocks were kicked to the curb by prominent hedge funds and their managers. Three of those popular stocks, as highlighted by our Foolish contributors, are chipmaking giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) , branded-apparel retailer Michael Kors Holdings (NYSE: KORS) , and mortgage real estate investment trust Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY) . Image source: Getty Images. Patience is a virtue Tim Brugger  ( Intel ): With approximately $160 billion in assets under management, Bridgewater Associates is one of the largest money managers around, and like many of its peers and individual investors, it appears it’s run out of patience as Intel continues its business transformation. In the last quarter of 2016, Bridgewater shed 570,700 shares of Intel, equal to over 37% of its total stake. With its stock down 3% in 2017, Bridgewater isn’t the only Intel naysayer. That said, thanks in part to a stronger-than-expected PC market and continued growth in key units, Intel is coming off a record-breaking quarter and year in which revenue climbed to $16.4 billion and $59.4 billion, respectively. Client computing continues to drive much of Intel’s revenue, but it was its focus on cloud data center sales, the Internet of Things (IoT), and data security that put it over the top. Intel is very much aware that PCs are not where it’s future lies, and it has gone on record saying it is now a data center first provider. Image source: Intel. Intel’s client computing unit revenue climbed a respectable 2% last year to $32.9 billion. But data center sales jumped 8% to $17.2 billion, IoT soared 15% to $2.6 billion, and data security was up 9% to $2.2 billion. With each passing quarter, Intel derives more and more of its total revenue from its up-and-coming units. Add to that Intel’s 3.1% dividend yield, and patient investors will be rewarded, despite what some of the industry’s big hitters think. When the fashion tide turns…. Brian Feroldi ( Michael Kors Holdings ): David Einhorn, the famous billionaire investor who runs Greenlight Capital, is a hedge fund manager I like to keep tabs on. One stock that Einhorn recently sold out of completely is Michael Kors Holdings, the luxury retailer that owns the iconic „MK” brand. It isn’t hard to figure out why Einhorn isn’t feeling bullish about this company’s prospects any longer. Kors has posted a string of disappointing earnings reports that feature declining comparable-store sales. This metric declined by 6.9% in the all-important holiday quarter, driving a 3.2% decrease in total sales. While the company’s massive buyback program helped to drive its EPS higher year over year, the declining comparable-store sales hint that this brand is losing its consumer appeal. If true, that could mean that the company’s troubles are likely to get worse. Image source: Michael Kors Holdings. While management has a plan to right the ship , it admits that the near term is going to be challenging. For the upcoming quarter, it’s projecting that comps will fall in the „low teens,” which doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. It is possible that management’s plan could work out and that shares could be a bargain way down here. However, Einhorn clearly doesn’t believe that a turnaround is in the cards, which is why he got out while he could. I agree with him that keeping this stock far away from your portfolio is probably the best move. This nearly 11% yield was on the chopping block Sean Williams ( Annaly Capital Management ): Mortgage real estate investment trust Annaly Capital Management is exceptionally popular among income investors because of its nearly 11% dividend yield. Assuming this yield remained static, investors could double their investment on the payout alone in less than seven years. However, certain hedge funds wanted nothing to do with Annaly Capital during the fourth quarter. Clough Capital Partners, headed by Charles Clough, former chief investment strategist of Merrill Lynch , dumped all 1.41 million shares of Annaly in Q4 2016, Similarly, Acadian Asset Management, which has more than $20 billion in funds under management, dumped nearly 2.5 million Annaly shares, and Rockefeller Financial Services sold almost 7.2 million shares. These are big hedge funds running for the hills. Image source: Getty Images. What has these big money hedge funds spooked? Look no further than the Federal Reserve’s ongoing monetary tightening. REITs of all forms thrive off borrowing money and reinvesting those assets to generate nearly guaranteed income. As interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing rises, which throttles the ability of REITs to use leverage. It also has a tendency to inhibit margins. In Annaly’s case, it means a narrower net interest margin, and potentially less cash to divvy out to investors. Even more so, rising interest rates can make dividend stocks appear less attractive. As yields rise on safe interest-bearing assets, investors may choose to opt out of riskier dividend stocks, which can harm a company’s share price. This Fool does understand why hedge funds are approaching Annaly with caution, but I believe they’re overlooking a few key points. Namely, that Annaly’s management team is experienced and has weathered a rising interest-rate environment before, and that Annaly predominantly deals in agency-only (i.e., government-backed) mortgage-backed securities. This means it’s protected from defaults, which makes it among the safer mortgage-REITs. Even if Annaly’s dividend yield were to fall, it’s still likely to have a much higher yield than nearly all S&P 500 companies, and it’s valued at just below its book value. There are plenty of reasons to believe this popular income stock can still be a winner for investors. 10 stocks we like better than Intel When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Buckle in, here it comes. Ask yourself why you never see some things on video, why some things are never reported.  In Afghanistan, it is a death sentence to show the real war to Americans, not the fighting part, the heroin processing part, the dams built by USAID for poppy field irrigation or the shiploads of special fertilizer brought in through Karachi to grow the drug crop. Why isn’t there a single uploaded video on YouTube from the Greenzone in Baghdad or the American village near the Turkish border in Northern Iraq?  The US has built facilities all over Afghanistan, including luxury homes and there isn’t a photo anywhere.  It sure as hell isn’t to keep this from the Taliban who provided the workers that actually built the projects. Then we ask about how TOW missiles get to ISIS and al Qaeda, yet how they get there is a mystery.  If Saudi Arabia and Qatar are arming terrorists, and they are on a massive scale, lets invade them, take down their governments and drag their royal asses out of holes and hang them from lamp posts.  Want to find terrorist criminals in Afghanistan?  Try the US backed government, thieves and drug dealers, terrorists and gangsters and everyone in Afghanistan and the region knows it but there is a total blackout in reporting it except on VT. Were you aware Google is a major CIA contractor through their mercenary company Google Idea Groups run by Jared Cohen, who represented the Mossad with the Bush administration?  Wonder why VT is crushed by Google or their search engine, and they now run all search engines, have choked off every dissenting opinion except for “approved” fake news sites like InfoWars and Breitbart? What is the real “dark web?”  Its news and information censored by Google and the NSA, not crime.   Heart of Darkness Let’s name one of the most dangerous and sinister groups on earth.  Whenever anyone gets close to the real dark side, the fake news starts with their “Soros” chant. We’re going to take a look at a few of the media groups that can and on occasion do start wars, groups that could well parallel similar organizations whose leaders were brought before the tribunals at Nuremberg. Let’s take a look at something really rotten, a Google/CIA front called “Movements.”  You can find them at the website, Movement.org.  This is where the Syrian War came from, this is the gang that recruits and moves jihadists around the globe and coordinates NGO’s for moving illegal arms and producing propaganda on a massive scale. And, since it is “Google,” it controls the internet, controls all search engines and simply erases every attempt to “out” their games.  This is the gang that moved poison gas into Syria, ran assassination teams in Iran, killed hundreds in bombings in Damascus, Baghdad and Istanbul, oh and Paris too.  From, of all things, Wikipedia: In October 2008, Columbia University, the US Department of State, Google, Howcast Media and other media companies sponsored the inaugural Alliance of Youth Movements Summit. This event brought together digital activists, technology and media leaders, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and governments to convene, share best practices, and create a network of socially responsible Grassroots activists using technology for their movements and campaigns. Following the inaugural summit, Jason Liebman (CEO and co-founder of Howcast), Roman Tsunder (co-founder of Access 360 Media), and Jared Cohen (Director of Google Ideas at Google) co-founded the Alliance for Youth Movements. This organization was dedicated to identifying, connecting, and supporting digital activists at the annual summit and throughout the year. In December 2009, The Alliance for Youth Movements hosted its 2nd annual summit in Mexico City. This summit was sponsored by the US Department of State as well as other sponsors. The event convened activists and supporters interested in how social media and connection technologies were helping to combat violence, with a special focus on Latin America. In March 2010, The Alliance for Youth Movements hosted its 3rd annual summit in London, which was sponsored by the UK Home Office and other media companies. At the end of the summit, it was announced that the Alliance for Youth Movements was launching a new online hub for digital activism, Movements.org. In February 2011, Movements.org officially launched and the Alliance for Youth Movements re-branded itself as Movements.org. In June 2012, Movements.org formally became a division of Advancing Human Rights (AHR), created in 2010 by Robert L. Bernstein (the founder of Human Rights Watch and former President and CEO of Random House for twenty-five years). AHR focuses on freedom of speech, women’s rights and promoting the freedoms outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, particularly by leveraging the power of the Internet.[1] In August 2012, Movements.org in collaboration with Al Jazeera launched an interactive tool that tracks the defections of senior Syrian military officials, members of parliament and diplomats of Assad’s regime. The tracker was released on Al Jazeera.[2] On July 9, 2014, Movements.org launched as a marketplace site, where dissidents in closed societies could connect to legal, PR and technology experts in open societies.[7][1]Natan Sharansky said of the platform, “Too often, leaders of the Free World have proved to be a disappointment to today’s dissidents. The citizens of free nations don’t need to.” ___________ Let’s look at where this takes us.  Most of us know that Al Jazeera is a front for the Qatar royal family that funds al Qaeda.  Those who don’t know Human Rights Watch is dirty don’t pay attention either. Let’s take a second to look at Ronin Analytics, the cyber-warfare private contractor.  What the hell does this have to do with a youth charity? Then we look at Jason Liebman and “Howcast.”  This is a YouTube “instructional video” partner except that it isn’t.  In reality, Howcast is a CIA propaganda project tied to YouTube, another CIA propaganda project.  From Alternet: The U.S. State Department has announced it is sponsoring a “New Media Technology” delegation to Iraq to “explore new opportunities to support Iraqi government and non-government stakeholders in Iraq’s emerging new media industry.” Of all of the areas in Iraq in desperate need of attention, its “emerging new media industry” is not the one that pops to mind. Things like clean water, electricity, right of safe return for refugees and an end to the occupation seem more pressing than increasing Nouri al Maliki’s Twitter followers. But unfortunately, that’s how U.S. priorities in Iraq seem to work. Anyway, the super star tech delegation, according to the State Department press release, includes “a mix of CEOs, Vice-Presidents and senior representatives” from “AT&T, Google, Twitter, Howcast, Meetup, You Tube and Automattic/Wordpress.” Ever wonder who brings in the smoke machines and actors for those phony “White Hats” rescue videos in Syria that are usually filmed in Egypt?  This article by Liebman explains a version of reality: “IN 2007, COALITION forces found an Al Qaeda manual on how to be a terrorist. We said, ‘Hey, let’s create an alternate manual to use tools to promote nonviolent social change.’ So Jared Cohen, who was then at State [now at Google], and I launched Movements.org to bring together activists, NGOs, governments, and tech and media leaders to network and share best practices. We have a set of how-to guides — everything from how to anonymously post online to what to do if your Internet goes down. We tell people, you can use Tweet-to-Speak, which Google rolled out during the Egypt uprising, to dial in from a landline and tweet. We’re trying to provide the resources for activists to do what they’ve been doing for a while, but more effectively and faster.” How “nonviolent social change” turned into a civil war that has killed 500,000 is something you won’t find on Google.  Wonder why? Then there’s Roman Tsunder, from of all things, Huffington Post, a whitewashed version of something more interesting: Tsunder is the the CEO and co-founder — along with “Viva La Bam” executive producer and “Jackass” consultant Terry Hardy — of PTTOW!, an organization that attempts to convince artists and powerful companies to work as a team to reach goals that vary in detail but are united in their appetite. The specifics of what role PTTOW! plays in any of these deals is unclear — the partnerships are formed in highly private sessions — and that shadowy influence has earned the organization an air of mystery leading to suspicious publications filling in the gaps. Fast Company referred to the PTTOW! as the “illuminati IRL.” Forbes compared the organization to the “Bohemian Grove,” a legendary meeting place for the rich and powerful first started in the 19th century. But Tsunder argues that even the Bohemian Grove, a community that included many American presidents, has nothing on this new conclave. Then again, if you wanted to follow Facebook and their role in the election, the barrage of conspiracies and fake news, Pizzagate and more, you have to learn about the Edelman Company, the masters of social media propaganda.  Here Richard Edelman sells the cure and not the disease: BY RICHARD EDELMAN, PUBLISHED NOVEMBER 18, 2016 BuzzFeed released a story earlier this week showing that false election news articles outperformed real news on Facebook during the final months of the election. These false news stories generated more engagement on the social network than election stories from 19 major news outlets combined including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, NBC News and others. The false stories ranged from the ridiculous to the scandalous, including an endorsement of President-elect Donald Trump by Pope Francis. One site alone had four stories that were shared 3 million times on Facebook, including one about Hillary Clinton selling arms to ISIS. At a press conference in Berlin on Thursday, President Barack Obama made an impassioned plea to get serious about fake news “in an age where there’s so much active misinformation.” “If we are not serious about facts and what’s true and what’s not, and particularly in an age of social media when so many people are getting their information in sound bites and off their phones, if we can’t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems,” said the president. This false news trend has also moved into the corporate sector. PepsiCo* had to manage a mini crisis over the last week after a series of false articles on social media claimed that CEO Indra Nooyi told Trump supporters to “take their business elsewhere.” In fact, she said no such thing. Now Back to Kurdistan Few Americans get to see the real Iraq or Afghanistan. I was in Erbil when it was a ghost town, no sewers, bombed buildings, no water or electricity. Today it is a virtual Dubai with fine restaurants and an American city. There is a similar American city in Kabul with luxury villas and a lifestyle that allows the military brass and their fatcat contractor friends to live a life unthought of in America. At that time, the unexpected turn of the war had stopped the American city north of Erbil, which bled off the resources that would have restored water and sewer but instead was spent on a vast failed luxury condo complex with golf course. Not “tens” but hundreds of millions have been spent on luxury villas used by Americans who try to compare their time overseas with that of those fighting wars.  General Michael Flynn is one of these, a man who went to war much as Donald Trump has just without the gold toilets and the Russian mobsters downstairs at Trump Tower. When did it begin?  Was it Eisenhower during World War II with his love of Europe’s finest homes, the best wines and female companionship. In Vietnam, when General Westmoreland took over the French compound used by MSUG’s Wesley Fischel, as his headquarters, a world of air conditioning, flown in video taped TV shows and Michelin 3-star chef’s became the norm for American wars.  Congressmen lined up to visit Vietnam where US Special Forces recruited virgins from rural villages. During a “stand down” back in 1969 while BLT 1/26 was waiting for replacements after losses during Operation Defiant Stand, I witnessed a confrontation between ARVN forces and a “skivvy patrol” of Special Forces outside DaNang’s luxury “Puzzle Palace.”  Whether the fight was over the use of Vietnamese children for prostitution or simply over money, we will never know.  Frankly, this was typical “combat” in Vietnam for many. VT has extensive resources in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  We can’t begin to describe what goes on in Kabul, the money spent and the lifestyles maintained there. You wouldn’t friggin believe it. ____________ Related Posts: Intel Drop: Israel Unleashes WikiLeaks on Russia, Trump Removal Plotted Intel Drop: Amateur Hour has begun Intel Drop, December 13, 2016 Intel Drop, February 26, 2016 Will Trump Deconstruct Administrative-Bureaucratic State?

Follow Kyle on Twitter here.  Apr 02, 2017 Share Tweet Subscribe to Complex Video via There may not be a modern athlete who has faced more scrutiny than LeBron James. Labeled "The Chosen One" all the way back in his high school days, James has had to live up to gargantuan expectations his entire career. When you have a target on your back as big as he does, a lot of silly criticism ends up being directed your way. Related King's Court: LeBron's Greatest Moments in Cleveland Ray Allen Is Reportedly Leaning Towards Joining the Cleveland Cavaliers Kobe, LeBron, Kobe, LeBron: Complex's 25 Favorite Kobe and LeBron Lyrical References In the latest spot he filmed for tech company Intel, LeBron decided to poke fun at the people who focus too heavily on his emotions on the court. After he knocks down what appears to be a game-winning jumper, the camera zooms and pans until it reveals a frame of LeBron's face that looks like a small child crying. The announcers trade incredulous reactions and jokes about Baby LeBron, with one broadcaster saying, "somebody pick him up!"  The real James often takes heat for being demonstrative during games. The shot looks a lot like the Crying LeBron meme that briefly emerged after last year's NBA Finals triumph, and fans love to harp on him when he stops to advocate (or "cry") for calls with the referees. Do a quick Twitter search if you don't believe me. The partnership with Intel appears to be all about making fun of both himself and the people freaking out over his every move. In the other recent spot, the same announcing crew talks breathlessly about a quad stretch he's doing at the free-throw line, calling it "the greatest quad stretch of all-time." It can't be easy to live in a fishbowl as he has for the last decade and a half. The reigning Finals MVP has been especially focused on this subject lately, and it's pretty clear he feels people should dial down the scrutiny. A recent Instagram post for the #WeNeedMore campaign told fans we don't need another LeBron, but we do need more scientists, doctors and engineers. It's hard to disagree with that logic. If we all spent less time spewing hot takes at LeBron and focused on achieving goals in our own fields, the world would probably be a better place. Don't expect an advertisement to change how he's covered, though—it didn't work before and probably won't now.  Tags: News, Videos, Cleveland Cavaliers, Commercials, Lebron James, NBA, lebron  Like  Follow  Chat Show Comments Lateststories Rob Gronkowski Joins Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal at Wrestlemania 33 BY Kyle Neubeck 7 hours ago Lance Stephenson Compares His Return to the Pacers to Michael Jordan's NBA Comeback BY Jose Martinez 8 hours ago Derrick Rose Is Out for the Season (Again) BY Aaron Mansfield 10 hours ago Alabama Bar Apologizes After Patrons Pressured Deshaun Watson to Leave BY Aaron Mansfield 10 hours ago Le’Veon Bell Confirms His Threat to Sit Out the Year Was an April Fools' Joke BY Aaron Mansfield 11 hours ago Tom Brady Spent April Fools' Trolling a 'Fake News' Headline Claiming He Lost the Super Bowl BY Kyle Neubeck 13 hours ago LeBron's New Intel Ad Makes Fun of People Who Call Him a Crybaby BY Kyle Neubeck 15 hours ago Gonzaga, North Carolina Win Final Four Games to Advance to NCAA National Championship BY Kyle Neubeck Apr 1, 2017 Tracy McGrady Named to 2017 Basketball Hall of Fame Class BY Kyle Neubeck Apr 1, 2017 Baltimore Ravens Claim They're Taking a Boat to 2017 London Game in April Fool's Day Joke BY Kyle Neubeck Apr 1, 2017 Load More Stories NowTrending SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER   Contact UsTerms of Use CareersPrivacy Policy AdvertiseSite Map FeedsPersonalization MusicStyle Pop CultureSports SneakersLife © Complex Media Inc.

The E3-1200 v6-family of products have slightly higher clock frequencies and are a notch better on power efficiency. If you look at the specifications then they match the consumer desktop parts pretty closely. The Xeon models however have support for ECC memory and Intel's vPro.  Most models have been clocked 0.2 GHz higher on the turbo bins. The TDP decreased from 80 Watts towards 73 and 72 Watts (IGP difference). Motherboard like Z170 and Z270 will be compatible after a firmware update since the processor is not based on a new socket.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement DDR5 memory will be up to twice as fast as DDR4 03/31/2017 at 6:00 PM by Brad Linder 3 Comments Intel and Micron may be prepping us for a world where computers use the same type of hardware for both memory and storage, but we aren’t there just yet. So get ready for DDR5 memory. The organization responsible for setting memory standards says the DDR5 will offer twice the bandwidth and twice the density of DDR4 RAM, which should lead to improved performance. DDR5 should also be more energy efficient than current memory. The Joint Electron Device Engineering Council says the DDR5 standard should be finalized in 2018, although that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to buy the memory next year. It could take a little longer for DIMMs to actually hit the streets, since hardware makers will also need to update motherboards to work with DDR5 memory. As Ars Technica points out, the DDR4 spec was finalized in 2012, but DDR4 memory wasn’t widely available until 3 years later. DDR5 will probably be released for desktop PCs first, but eventually the new platform could bring faster memory to laptops, tablets, and smartphones. via PC World Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 3 Comments on "DDR5 memory will be up to twice as fast as DDR4" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest bolomkxxviii Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

If everything was as fast as the CPU, we’d see really good boot times… But at this point its more important to shrink computers and reduce power consumption. At least on the consumer end… Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 1 day 7 hours ago Guest BoBBy Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. Yes, memory needs to catch up, but also busses (and/or memory controllers) (and I mean inter-core, not just PCIe). And we need new techniques for branch prediction, or some way to mitigate the effects of pipeline stalls and flushes. And better instructions to enable mass parallelisation (transactions, low overhead fences etc). Anyway – that’s all very tough to do.

By Laura Woods | April 2, 2017 Previously World Series-Winning Teams With the Highest and Lowest Payrolls 1/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons CC BY-SA 2.0 / hyku They sit on top of the business world today, but many prominent CEOs started at the bottom. Good old-fashioned hard work and an unstoppable desire to succeed helped them rise through the ranks from entry-level employee to head honcho. Navigating your own ascent up the ladder might feel long and discouraging at times, but you can do it. Take a look at these 15 CEOs' first jobs, and get inspired to climb the career ladder. 2/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Loren Javier Bob Iger He's ruled The Walt Disney Company as its chairman and CEO since 2005, but Bob Iger's introduction to the company wasn't nearly as glamorous. He graduated from Ithaca College in 1973 and promptly went to work as a weatherman for a local news station. A few months later, he landed a job in New York City as a studio facility supervisor for ABC — Disney bought the network in 1996 — and the rest is history. His integrity, humble nature and genuine appreciation for creative talent helped him get to where he is today, according to a 2016 Variety article. 3/16 Show Thumbnails Krista Kennell / Shutterstock.com Ursula Burns In 1980, Ursula Burns landed an internship at Xerox. And by 2009, she was the CEO. She held this role until 2016, when Xerox split into two separate companies. Burns is currently chairman of the board of the document technology company, but she'll retire in May 2017. Originally an engineer, her career took a pivotal turn when she accepted a job as executive assistant to the then-president of marketing — a developmental role for high-performers. Burns called this a "risky job" in a 2013 interview with Bloomberg, because her engineering skills weren't needed. Despite the gamble, this bold move clearly paid off. 4/16 Show Thumbnails ©Bama Paula A. Marshall Paula Marshall has been the CEO of baked goods company Bama Companies — her family business — since 1984. Immersed in the company from a young age, her first official role as an employee was a production line job as a teenager. For the next 12 years, she held various jobs in the company, until her father retired and named her CEO. At the time, it was less common for a woman to take the reins of a company, but Marshall stepped up and has since led the company to impressive growth. Use Marshall as an example, and don't let doubters hold you back.

He worked his way up to chairman and CEO in 1981 and remained top dog until 2001. In a 2015 LinkedIn post, Welch said doing two things all the time will lead to personal growth in an existing company. "The first is over-delivering on results within the values criteria that your boss sets for the team," he said. "…The other quality that makes you promotable is constantly working to make your boss smarter." 6/16 Show Thumbnails ©General Motors Mary T. Barra When she was 18 years old, Mary T. Barra joined General Motors as a co-op student in the Pontiac Motor Division. After 34 years with the company, she landed the role of CEO in 2014 — and chairman in 2016 — becoming the first woman to helm a major car corporation. Barra spoke candidly about her career in a 2016 interview with Esquire. "The people looking over their shoulder and wondering about their next job are the least successful," she said. "There's no decision you should ever make that would embarrass you if it became public." 7/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons CC BY 3.0 / Shane Bevel Doug McMillon Some CEOs' first jobs turn into powerful careers more often than you might realize. Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., has been leading the retail giant since 2014. This is especially impressive since his first job with the company was an hourly gig loading trucks at a distribution center during his teenage years. The youngest-ever CEO to fill Sam Walton's shoes, McMillon has held various roles with the company, including assistant store manager and a buyer trainee. Eventually, he went on to hold senior management roles in every Wal-Mart business segment, making himself invaluable. 8/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Fortune Live Media Doug Oberhelman In 1975, Doug Oberhelman landed a job in the Caterpillar treasury department, with the goal of paying off his car and student loans. In a 2013 interview with Leaders magazine, he said if someone would've told him he'd become the company's chairman and CEO in 2010, he would've thought they were crazy. A genuine passion for the work kept him with the company for 41 years, until he stepped down as CEO at the end of 2016. Oberhelman remained executive chairman through March 31, 2017. 9/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons CC BY 4.0 / Office of the President-elect Rex Tillerson Becoming U.S. Secretary of State meant Rex Tillerson had to change employers for the first time in more than 40 years. Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation since 2006, he joined the oil and gas company as a production engineer in 1975. Prior to commandeering the boardroom, Tillerson developed his leadership skills by holding several senior roles in the company. If you have sky-high career ambitions, holding various roles throughout the company will allow you to develop a well-rounded knowledge of company operations. 10/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Intel Free Press Brian M. Krzanich Intel CEO Brian M. Krzanich joined the company as a process engineer in 1982, but he made an error 25 years ago that almost got him fired. In a 2017 interview with the Fortt Knox podcast, Krzanich explained what he did. "I wiped out the output of an entire factory for a week," he said. "I'm lucky to be employed at Intel, sometimes I say." Rather than letting the mistake take him down, Krzanich used the situation to change the company for the better, etching out his legacy. He was appointed CEO and elected to Intel's board in May 2013. 11/16 Show Thumbnails ©Walgreens Boots Alliance Jim Skinner In 2012, Jim Skinner stepped down as McDonald's CEO and vice chairman, but his 41 years with the company weren't all so prestigious. Following a 10-year stint in the Navy, he landed a job as a manager trainee in 1971. Even CEO first jobs aren't always amazing, but you have to start somewhere, Skinner said in a 2012 interview with the Quad-City Times. "You must be willing to go to work," he said. "In that job, you must add value to that company and gain experience and be committed to the brand. You do the best you can to grow that brand." 12/16 Show Thumbnails ©Fidelity Investments Abigail Johnson She was born into the family business, but Abigail Johnson — Fidelity chairman and CEO, and one of the richest women in the world — worked her way to the top. Although she's the third generation to lead the financial services firm, Johnson wasn't handed her leadership role. Her tenure with Fidelity started in high school, when she spent a summer answering customer service calls. She eventually returned to Fidelity in 1988 as an analyst, but she quickly transitioned into a portfolio management role. Over the years, she got to know the company by working in most of its main areas, which prepared her to take over for her father as CEO in 2014. 13/16 Show Thumbnails nd3000 / Shutterstock.com Justin Copie Justin Copie joined technology company Innovative Solutions as a co-op student while attending the Rochester Institute of Technology. After 13 years with the firm, he took on the role of owner and CEO. Prior to the transition, he spent five years being groomed by former owner and CEO Bob Titus. His thirst for knowledge is likely what led him to the top. "I always want to progress," Copie said in an article on the company website. "I always want to move forward… I'm still learning and I'm always seeking more information and trying to figure out what fits (and) what doesn't…" 14/16 Show Thumbnails ©Hill Holiday Karen Kaplan Not all first jobs evolve into company leadership, but Karen Kaplan's did. Now the CEO of Hill Holliday, a prominent advertising and communications agency, she originally joined the company as a receptionist to earn money for law school. Instead of doing the minimum to get by, she put 100 percent effort into the role, which skyrocketed her career. "I was going to be the best damned receptionist in history and that's how I approached the job," she said in a 2014 interview with Fortune. "I took it really seriously. I didn't just bide my time out there." 15/16 Show Thumbnails Wikimedia Commons - CC BY-SA 3.0 / Gage Skidmore Samuel Palmisano In 1973, Samuel Palmisano landed a sales job at IBM and, 30 years later, he became chairman, president and CEO. He reigned from January 2003 until December 2011. Palmisano cited "phenomenal resilience" as the key to a successful career in a 2015 interview with The Washington Post. Beyond that, he emphasized the importance of forming good business relationships. "You don't have to be brilliant to run a company, but you have to be a good people person," he said. "You have to be able to lead, to cajole. You have to care. That's what you have to do." 16/16 Show Thumbnails Flickr.com / Fortune Live Media Alex Gorsky He's the chairman and CEO of Johnson & Johnson, but in 1988, Alex Gorsky started his career as a sales representative for Janssen Pharmaceutica — a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary. He spent years in various sales, marketing and management roles. This, paired with his West Point education and six years in the U.S. Army, helped him develop leadership skills that took him to the top. "People are not looking for a perfect leader," Gorsky said in a 2014 interview published on Knowledge at Wharton. "They want a leader who cares about them and is going to help them try to be better."

To qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet other conditions. If approved, your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including term of loan, a responsible financial history, years of experience, income and other factors. Rates and Terms are subject to change at anytime without notice and are subject to state restrictions. SoFi refinance loans are private loans and do not have the same repayment options that the federal loan program offers such as Income Based Repayment or Income Contingent Repayment or PAYE. Licensed by the Department of Business Oversight under the California Finance Lender Law License No. 6054612. SoFi loans are originated by SoFi Lending Corp., NMLS # 1121636. (www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org) Fixed rates from 3.375% APR to 6.740% APR (with AutoPay). Variable rates from 2.365% APR to 6.290% APR (with AutoPay). Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at either 8.95% or 9.95% depending on term of loan. See APR examples and terms. Lowest variable rate of 2.365% APR assumes current 1 month LIBOR rate of 0.79% plus 1.825% margin minus 0.25% ACH discount. Not all borrowers receive the lowest rate.

For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month LIBOR index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the LIBOR index increases. The SoFi 0.25% AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. *To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit inquiry. Unlike hard credit inquiries, soft credit inquiries (or soft credit pulls) do not impact your credit score. Soft credit inquiries allow SoFi to show you what rates and terms SoFi can offer you up front.

WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer addressed the matter several times during Friday’s White House press briefing after he was peppered with questions about Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), who said last week he had seen evidence to suggest President Trump’s “wiretapping” claims are true. “When Mr. Nunes came out initially and talked to the media, he made it very clear he had been looking into this, he had stated this much earlier than the president had ever raised this issue about surveillance and the unmasking of individuals for areas that had nothing to do with Russia and nothing to do with substantive intelligence or surveillance,” Mr. Spicer said. “So I think that as we continue down this path, if you begin to focus really on the substance, I think we see more and more a very, very troubling and devastating path.” Last week Rep. Nunes visited the White House complex, he came under scrutiny because it is not clear who let him through the gate, who showed him the classified information that showed surveillance was collected about President Trump and/or his Transition Team, and why. Mr. Spicer has said several times the media is too focused on the process and timeline of the story rather than the substance of the information being revealed. Friday,Mr. Spicer referenced comments made by former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia/Ukraine/Eurasia Evelyn Farkas, in which she seemed to suggest intelligence against President- elect Donald Trump and his Team was actively gathered before he took office in January. “I think the substance of this matters, and what continues to come to light in terms of Obama officials admitting either off the record or, frankly, on the record consistent with what Dr. Evelyn Farkas says that there was clearly an attempt to do something politically motivated with the intelligence out there,” Mr. Spicer said. “The question is, why? Who else did it? Was it ordered, by whom? I think more and more, the substance that continues to come out on the record by individuals continues to point to exactly what the President was talking about that day on March 5.” Later in the briefing, Mr. Spicer had a tense back and forth with Glenn Thrush of The New York Times regarding the timeline of Nunes’ White House visit and who was aware of his presence on the 18-acre campus that contains multiple buildings. “You’re playing cute there. … No, the White House chief of staff does not know every single person who is on the 18 acres at any given time,” Mr. Spicer said. “No, we don’t track every single person who is on the 18 acres. Do we know generally speaking who is in the Oval Office? Not all the time because people can go in.” It was terrific to watch, Mr. Spicer put the NY-T back on its heels, Sean Spicer is good, he takes no prisoners. Have a terrific weekend.   Nunes, president, Spicer, surveillance, team, Trump, White House, wiretapping White House Issues a Direct Warning to “Deep State” Intel Leak’rs added by Paul Ebeling on April 1, 2017 View all posts by Paul Ebeling → The following two tabs change content below.

Written by: Vicky Nanjappa Updated: Monday, April 3, 2017, 10:57 [IST] Subscribe to Oneindia News The Islamic State has put up a kill list yet again. This time the threat is to US President Donald Trump and the list features only Americans in it. SITE Intel Group reported that the kill list has 8,786 names on it. The list was released by the pro-Islamic State United Cyber Caliphate hacking group. The group released a video message threatening the US and President Trump, along with a 'kill list' of 8,786 names and addresses, commanding, "Kill them wherever you find them." The IS is known to put out such lists. It had also put out a similar list for Indians last year, with 4,681 civilians picked in a random manner. 'O individual wolves out there in the world kill the cross where ever you find it and Kill them strongly, kill them hardly'. This was a chilling message on the private Telegram channel of the Islamic State United Cyber Caliphate. This was a message was put out before the IS put out a kill list of 4,681 civilians across the world of which 285 were Indians. The list was examined by the NIA, who has said that on the face of it, the list appears to be a diversionary tactic. The list of Indians was prepared by Yusuf al-Hindi aka Shafi Armar, the alleged handler of the IS based out of Syria.

Duh. AU Editor's Note: The 2017 version of the HP Spectre x360 is set to be launched in Australia in the coming weeks. We'll update this review with its relevant Australian pricing as soon as we know it! — Cam HP has had a rough few years. The only thing we've really liked from the company recently was its $US200 Windows laptop, which despite being total garbage, was garbage at a price that was impossible to ignore. Meanwhile, the company keeps trying to do weird concepts like the HP Sprout, that scanner PC with no mouse, or last year's "luxurious" Spectre. When it's come time to recommend Windows PCs for regular users, Dell's XPS line is almost always our recommendation, and HP is rarely part of the conversation. Which is why I'm so impressed with the x360, a very good 15-inch Windows laptop that comes at a very good price. An amazing price really. The model I reviewed has a 4K screen, Intel Kaby Lake i7500 i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, Nvidia 940MX discrete graphics, and a 512GB SSD. Those are top-notch guts, but the computer sells for just $US1500 — several hundred dollars less than similar configurations from Dell or Apple. You can even special order a version with a smaller hard drive and less RAM for $US1300, if you've really got to pinch pennies when picking up a high-quality 15-inch laptop. This isn't a slim laptop. It doesn't feel overly bulky, but it's definitely thicker than an old MacBook Pro or the Dell XPS 15. More impressive than the price is the fact that the laptop is actually a pleasure to use. The new x360 has a handsome design with a much smaller bezel than last year's model. It's also got an aluminium body that manages to feel svelte despite being a tad thicker than its predecessor. It's gained the extra thickness to pack in a larger battery, which gave me 10 hours of mixed usage at 70-per cent brightness. You'll notice at this point that I haven't said much about the x360's convertible screen. The "360" part is actually the least interesting feature of the laptop. Sure, you can fold it over and use it with its included pen as a gigantic arse tablet, but in practice, this isn't what makes it worth your money. The laptop isn't all good, though. I'm annoyed that HP added row of function keys to right side of the keyboard. As a touch typist, I felt myself off by a letter, which was extremely frustrating. The good news is, you'll get used to the extra keys. The bad news is it will take a few days. The keyboard, is a departure for HP and actually great to type on, except for those extra function keys on the right. Fortunately, the rest of the laptop experience is very good. I like that the x360 has two USB-C ports, an HDMI port, a regular USB, and an SD card slot, because it means I didn't have to grab an adaptor when I needed to charge my phone. The screen, which works with either your finger or the included pen, is absolutely gorgeous and responsive. The display's colours are bright, and image quality was crisp and clear while playing both Civ VI or watching videos on Netflix. The stylus isn't as good as the experience you'll get on a Surface Pro or Surface Book, because it feels just a little more basic and its internals aren't as advanced, but it was able to keep up with my doodles and handwritten entries with ease. In fact, the whole computer keeps up with most of my processing demands. I never felt like the laptop was dragging — whether I was running Gizmodo's Photoshop test, or chatting on Skype or tempting fate and leaving two web browsers with dozens of tabs open. This isn't going to be as beefy as a quad-core computer you could buy from Dell or Apple, but you're also paying at least $US300 less, so it might not matter. Traditionally, going cheaper means sacrificing build and quality, but HP is proving that you can still get a lot of really good computer for a really low prices. If you're looking for a 15-inch laptop that won't break the bank, has a great screen, decent port selection, and costs under $US1500 the HP x360 should definitely be on your list.

It's thicker and longer than the XPS 15 and the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, but it never feels bulky. The screen is gorgeous and the touch screen is responsive. The discrete graphics are a nice touch, especially at this price, but don't expect to do any serious gaming on this thing. In addition to the ports, a USB-C to Ethernet and USB-C to USB-A dongle was included in the box. That's nice. Only one of the USB-C ports is backed by Thunderbolt 3, which limits some of the expandability. The charger is USB-C. Use the non-Thunderbolt port for max performance for other stuff.

Carpenter's blog The Trump administration's staggering incompetence in its coverup P.M. Carpenter Article Tools E-mail Print Comments (0) Share    The Trump Administration by P.M. Carpenter | April 1, 2017 - 6:41am I'm coming to believe that the guilty-as-hell Trump administration is seeking exoneration-by-pity. Never in the history of American political skulduggery has such absolute incompetence in covering up crimes been demonstrated — or invoked? Nixon's plumbers, who had helpfully retained the White House's telephone number in their personal belongings (so that the FBI could instantly make the conspiracy connection) were at the head of their cloak-and-dagger class compared to the bumbling boors who have so far constituted the Trump-Russia Affair. The administration's management of a scandal that is in fact bigger than Watergate has been so inept (one is tempted to say "Bush league") and self-wounding, I'm beginning to feel rather sorry for them; my piling on feels as though I'm making fun of the developmentally disabled. Yesterday, when the "news" broke that House Intel Committee chair and Trump employee Devin Nunes had been "helped" by "a pair of White House officials" to "somewhat vindicate" the bumbler in chief, I could scarcely work up a yawn. Who didn't already suspect this — indeed, "this" as a transcendence of suspicion and a matter of knowledge? Who on God's red earth hadn't already connected the immensely prominent dots? One of Nunes's helpful WH elves was Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a National Security Council clown and Michael T. Flynn stooge whose job was protected only through the intervention of the utterly mad Steve Bannon. The NYT's passage on "what prompted Mr. Cohen-Watnick to dig into the intelligence" is a screamer. "There were conflicting accounts" of Cohen-Watnick's motivation, writes the Times, but "one official" says it was "to find evidence that would justify Mr. Trump’s Twitter posts about wiretapping." Well blow us away. The Times then positively drips with straight-reporting sarcasm: "The real issue, Mr. Nunes has said, was that he could figure out the identities of Trump associates from reading reports." Oh that devilish Devin. He's a sharp one. But I've no doubt that his pitiable, real-issue reasoning was handed to him, in crayon, by the White House. Then within hours broke the news that the already-proven-to-be-guilty-as-hell Mr. Flynn has requested immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for congressional testimony. That's when my pity really kicked in. One of the bigger rats has abandoned the U.S.S. Trump, and he's now slapping detonators on its hull. It would have never come to this had the campaign and then the administration been even remotely competent in the covering of its crimes. But Jesus! what a trail: Flynn, Roger Stone, Carter Page, Jeff Sessions, Paul Manafort, indeed the candidate and president himself ("Trump urges Russia to hack Clinton's email") — a confederacy of self-evident incompetence so titanic, it makes one wonder how any of the confederates ever made it so far in business, consulting, or politics.

As reported by the Washington Post, initially, Flynn earned at least $1.3 million through his consulting firm Flynn Intel Group. The subsequent disclosure does not list how all of his compensation broke down monetarily, however, but is reveals sources that paid him $5,000 or more in a year. In the latest disclosure, Flynn admitted that he received fees for speaking at events held by the Kremlin-backed RT (Russia Today) news network, Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions., but how much they paid him remains unknown. The former US Army general has asked for immunity, according to his attorney, who added that Flynn is willing to “tell his story” if granted immunity for his testimony before congressional committees conducting an investigation into the scandal. Since he and other Trump allies criticized aides to Hillary Clinton who sought immunity during the probe of her email server, Democrats and comedians eagerly seized on hints of a deal as evidence that Flynn has secrets to hide. “Let’s be clear: Flynn’s immunity request very strongly suggests there was a criminal conspiracy at the highest levels of government,” said Seth Abramson, an attorney, academic and journalist. “Today’s discovery that Mike Flynn hid payments from Russian propaganda and cybersecurity outfits may be bigger news than we think.” Connect with NJTODAY.NET Join NJTODAY.NET's free Email List to receive occasional updates delivered right to your email address!

Flynn’s attorney says the former national security adviser is in discussions with the House and Senate intelligence committees on receiving immunity from “unfair prosecution” in exchange for questioning. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner says no “reasonable person” with legal counsel would answer questions without assurances. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)More WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn has disclosed that he earned more than $1.3 million for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors as well as for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman. The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments. In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn's lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Flynn's recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Flynn's business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia's state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies. The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump's campaign. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. The first filing was turned in on Feb. 11, just a few days before Flynn stepped down. It doesn't include an itemized listing of his speaking engagements including the payments from RT, the Russian television network that U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a propaganda outlet. The later disclosure, filed Friday, cites RT and other Russian clients and breaks out the payments and provides more details on Flynn's paid speeches. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn's first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. "Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so," Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version. An OGE document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn's lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17. The White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Flynn's client, Ekim Alptekin, told the AP that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice Department officials contacted Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and "potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey." Flynn reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business, Flynn Intel Group Inc., detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. As part of his firm's lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan's, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey's claim was false and that "no such discussion occurred." Flynn's new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee. The group's website says it aims to "promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States." But Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York. The new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks. Flynn was paid $15,000 for a speech to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles group headed by a longtime conservative activist. Flynn was also paid $10,000 for a speech to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit think tank promoting libertarian ideals.   For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android.   Reblog Share Tweet Share Popular in the Community Massachusetts city council to vote on Trump impeachment resolution 14418 reactions5%60%35% Police detain protester during an anti-corruption rally in Moscow and more: April 2 in photos 23 reactions0%79%21% ‘Our Dishonest President’: L.A.

On Wednesday and Thursday he posted several tweets attacking the House Freedom Caucus – the relatively small yet powerful group of far right wing Republicans who derailed TrumpCare – along with the entire group of 193 House Democrats. On Friday, Trump took another swing, this time at all Democrats, and the media, his other active target this week. .@SenAngusKing: In decision on whether or not to grant Flynn immunity, Intel Committee must not compromise FBI probe https://t.co/kfCcZf1G6o — New Day (@NewDay) March 31, 2017 "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!" the President said Friday morning on Twitter. Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017 Michael T. Flynn, of course, is the man Trump fired. Flynn was a top campaign advisor who Trump placed as his National Security Advisor, despite having been fired by President Barack Obama. In late January then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates told Trump or someone high up in his administration Flynn was susceptible to Russian blackmail. It took Trump three weeks to fire Flynn, and he only did so after media reports that Flynn lied to Vice President Mike Pence grew too oppressive to ignore. On Twitter, some noted this tweet, and this video, from last year, showing Trump's never-ending hypocrisy: ATTN: @HillaryClinton - Why did five of your staffers need FBI IMMUNITY?! #BigLeagueTruth #Debates — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 10, 2016 Trump today: "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity" Trump on Sep. 27th: "If you're not guilty of a crime, what do you need immunity for?" pic.twitter.com/t647jv6Htq — Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) March 31, 2017 It is unprecedented that a sitting U.S. President would weigh in on a matter of national security and side with the party who may have put our nation at risk.  Let's not forget, Flynn, in an arrangement with the Justice Dept., retroactively registered as a foreign agent because he had been working for the Turkish government – while advising Trump. And let's also not forget, President Trump is supposed to be working for us. He should be demanding every agency and every committee get to the bottom of the Russia story, to protect our national security and our elections, now and in the future.  It's feeling like that's not his goal.

Ogg April 1, 2017 9:20 am EDT Print Email Tweet With Friday having been the last trading day of March and the first quarter, it was a rather busy week. The Dow was up over 5% and the S&P 500 was up over 6% so far in 2017, coming into Friday. What cannot be ignored is that investors have continued to buy market pullbacks in an eight-year bull market, and those same investors are looking for new trading and investing ideas. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each day of the week, which this ends up being hundreds of analyst calls over the course of each week. Our goal is to find new ideas for our readers. Some analyst reports cover stocks to buy, and the week of March 31 brought some significant upside targets in analyst upgrades and initiations with solid Buy and Outperform ratings in major technology stocks. For some balance, investors should keep in mind that the calendar is entering a time where the markets might need a breather and when technology stocks are facing a slower three to four months ahead on a historical basis. These were some of the top technology analyst calls for the week of March 27 to March 31, 2017: Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was started with a Buy rating and assigned a $1,100 price target at Loop Capital on March 31. It was given a similar upside target at Barclays this week as well, and Amazon saw its price target raised at Stifel from $912 to $1,025. Shares traded Friday at $886.54, in a 52-week range of $585.25 to $890.35. The consensus target price is $948.61. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) hit a new high this week, and UBS has outlined how Apple shares could hit $200. What is amazing here is that the UBS price target is not even at the highest of the analyst universe. Instinet raised its Apple price target to $165 from $135. Needham raised its Apple target price to $165 from $150 during the last week of March. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) was started as Outperform with a $265 price target (versus a $220.04 prior close) at Macquarie on March 31. Analysts have been raising their expectations for Broadcom in recent weeks, and its shares ended trading at $218.96 on Friday. Its 52-week range is $139.18 to $227.75. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Goldman Sachs on March 30. It also was raised to Outperform from In-Line and the target price was raised to $60 from $51 (versus a $49.04 prior close) at Evercore ISI on March 29. CyberArk shares closed trading at $50.87 on Friday, and its 52-week range is $37.00 to $59.28. Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ: FTNT) was raised to Outperform from Neutral and the target price was raised to $50 from $38 (versus a $36.56 close) at Robert W. Baird on March 29. Fortinet has a 52-week range of $28.08 to $38.56, and its stock was trading at $38.35 on Friday’s close. Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ: GRPN) also gets grouped in with the tech stocks, but it is perhaps a misnomer due to social-couponing for retail spending. Groupon was started with a Buy rating and assigned a $5 price target (versus a $3.99 prior close) at Citigroup. The 52-week range is $2.92 to $5.94, and a consensus analyst price target is $4.91. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) was started with an Outperform rating and assigned a $40 price target (versus a $35.75 prior close) at Macquarie on March 31. Intel has a 52-week range of $29.50 to $38.45 and a consensus analyst target of $40.03. Red Hat Inc. (NYSE: RHT) saw its price target raised to $98 from $95 at RBC Capital Markets after the company reported one the strongest quarters in recent years as billings jumped. BMO also raised its price target on the shares to $90 from $75. Those targets compare with the current Wall Street consensus target of $87.16. The 52-week trading range was $68.54 to $85.01. The stock closed Monday at $82.20, and shares were trading almost 5% higher in the premarket at that time. Red Hat shares ended the week at $86.50, and its new 52-week high after solid earnings is now $87.91. Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) falls under tech due to its social media efforts, but some of us think of it as a waste of time more than anything. The analysts came out on March 27 with their post-IPO coverage after the quiet period had ended. Many of the underwriting firms were far more positive than the independent analysts who said to sell Snap (should you be surprised?). Cowen, Morgan Stanley, RBC, Jefferies, Goldman Sachs and more firms were among the positive analyst calls. More key analyst calls and research reports have been seen as follows: SunTrust Robinson Humphrey has five reasons to keep buying the top chip stocks. Merrill Lynch has six top software picks to buy now. Seven stocks with over 50% to 100% upside from recent analyst calls.

Un véhicule équipé de la technologie Mobileye. (photo credit:COURTESY MOBILEYE) Following the recent multi-billion dollar acquisition of Israeli company Mobileye by Intel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly stated that his government plans to further assist companies developing technologies in the area of smart mobility by cutting down regulation, thus enhancing Israel’s prominence in the area of autonomous vehicle technology, i.e. driverless cars. This is an important statement which the burgeoning Israeli market has long been waiting for. The government is in a position to develop autonomous vehicle governance that could be adopted by other countries around the globe and is necessary for the introduction of this very promising technology. With a technophilic population, a can-do start-up mentality and a poor driving record, Israel is an optimal laboratory to show how useful letting technology take the wheel can be in reducing congestion, slashing road fatalities, conserving energy, saving unnecessary costs and mitigating other car-culture- associated ills. And while the Israeli government may have traditionally looked to European neighbors and Western allies to emulate proven regulation, now Israel needs to take the initiative to be the relevant light unto the nations. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. In terms of legal issues at play, the moral and legal dilemmas of whose life to spare are at the heart of the artificial intelligence-based system of autonomous vehicles. Most are familiar with some version of the Trolley Problem – a decades-old thought experiment wherein doleful law students are called upon to make dreadful moral choices in prioritizing citizen’s lives as a runaway trolley barrels down the avenue. In its modern form, we ask how an autonomous vehicle should resolve which life to endanger and which life to save, in a situation where the only outcome is that someone has to die. Our society and government ponder whether the machine driving the vehicle can make as ethically sound a decision as the average human driver. Can we trust autonomous vehicle technology behind the wheel? Can we trust it with our lives? However bizarre and perplexing the philosophical questions behind letting a robot drive a car may be, regulators must first dive even deeper into the technological adaptation before they can provide a green light for such systems to take the road. Any new regulations which would stimulate the introduction of this technology need to account for current innovation, but also be flexible enough to prevent the holdup of this rapidly developing field in the face of government inaction or short-sighted rules. For a simple example, take the standard that all cars must have a steering wheel and that all drivers must keep both hands on the wheel while driving. While this law is great for targeting inconsiderate folks who talk on their cellphone while driving, it is sorely out of date for a car that doesn’t need a driver. And while it may seem obvious that this rule needs an update, it is far from obvious as to what will replace it. If successful, the right adaptable autonomous autotech guidelines will account for unconventional insurance models, changes in the nature and cause of accidents and the accompanying criminal and civil liabilities, distracted- driving regulations, gas consumption and its heavy taxation, privacy concerns (as the cars record our every trip) and the ever-present threat of hacking, whereby conceivably someone other than your friendly software chauffeur could take control of your car. In addition to these regulatory and legal changes, the government will also have to adapt to, or even proactively promote, societal changes that will accompany these technologies. There will be those whose livelihoods will be more affected than others by this innovation, most prominently workers across different transportation-related industries. In fact, given the success of another Israel- related player in this area – Otto, a company that retrofits trucks to make them autonomous – those in the transportation sector may be the first to feel the impact of autonomous vehicle integration. At this juncture, the government may need to provide retraining opportunities for those who need to pursue alternative prospects and, eventually, even subsidies for those who can’t. Autonomous vehicles will affect more than just the liabilities associated with human interactions on the roads. Their introduction will necessitate changes in urban design and development, particularly as public and private transportation models change. For example, parking garages and curbside parking are important when you have to leave your car where you exit it – less so when the car can park itself in much tighter, more distant spots and return upon command. Much of our current infrastructure, built with current human driving trends in mind, will also need to adapt or be repurposed if and when car ownership fails, as car sharing (both within and beyond the family) becomes the norm. Potentially most disruptive, with commutes becoming less tiring and onerous there could be a drive to move out of the center of the country and into the suburbs, necessitating substantial investment in infrastructure outside of the large cities. All of these efforts are far from trivial, and will require the collaboration of ministries, agencies, technologists, lawyers, politicians and academics in assessing how best to move forward in a calculated and thorough manner. As former US transportation secretary Ray LaHood recently noted, it is crucial that we move forward in bringing all stakeholders into this conversation while the iron is still hot.

The die-shot as such must be the Skylake-SP series of products in the Xeon Platinum range. Yes, Platinum. Each core would get 1024KB of L2 cache. The Xeon SKUs always have been segmented into a numeric schema, like the E5-2640 v5. Starting with the 8000 series the 22 to 28 core models will be the flagship products, these will be the Xeon Platinum series.  The 14 to 22 core parts 5000 and 6000 series will be the gold models.  The 4000 series on their end will get 10 cores, will be the Silver series.     The new processors will be based on a new socket (Yes intel LOVES new sockets) called LGA 3647. Earlier on a user on the Anandtech forums already posted the new lineup and specs on these processors, though that remains unconfirmed information. It is unclear yet when Intel will announce the new Xeon processors.  Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ... Not the best 3 ... Average 4 ... Good 5 ...

Not buying another Intel product until they stop being silly. one would assume there must be a general trend at some point given the amount of cores that you will need new socket, so the socket itself is not holding back the CPU. that's assuming you don't utilise head up arse thinking. pato Member Guru Posts: 132 Joined: 2003-08-25 #5413617 Posted on: 03/29/2017 01:17 PM On the other hand, this are server products. I don't know many companies who upgrade their CPUs in servers. They rather buy a new server with more current technology and fresh warranty.

I've had my 2600k for 5-6 years now. When I upgrade I want all the latest tech. My Z77 does not provide that. I will have to buy a new motherboard, what does it matter at that point if it is lga 1150, 1151, 1155, 2011 or what ever else? wavetrex Member Guru Posts: 61 Joined: 2008-07-16 #5413627 Posted on: 03/29/2017 02:20 PM The only real reasons for new CPU socket is new memory tech and width (channnels) So, basically, we should have had one socket per DDR type (on the same number of channels). Of course, more channels ( like the HEDT plaform ) - another socket. But 1156, 1155, 1151, 1150... yea, that is completely silly.

If you were happy with the 2600k, why should you need to upgrade your processor to benefit from other peripheral upgrades like M.2 slots and the like. Sure, you'd need to buy a new motherboard, but Intel's frequent socket changes is what ties the chipset upgrade with a CPU upgrade, a tie that doesn't need to exist. The last umpteen Intel processor updates have maintained the same DMI chipset connection, yet Intel's frequent socket swapping effectively forces CPU upgrades when all you might want is a upgrade to USB 3 or M.2. Sure, Skylake brought DDR4, that likely warrants a socket upgrade. Yet compare LGA1155 and LGA1150, and there is very little change in supported technologies. Ivy Bridge supported DDR3, PCI-E 3.0, so did Haswell. But if you wanted things like M.2 which started coming in with the Z97 chipset, you needed Haswell, even though m.2 functionality is independent on the processor as they both support the same chipset connection. Reality is, Intel most likely could have made the Z97 chipset support LGA1151, allowing you to keep your 2600k and still take advantage of newer technologies like M.2 and more USB3 ports. But doing that wouldn't force people to buy a new processor, so less money for Intel. holystarlight Master Guru Posts: 668 Joined: 2007-10-14 #5413633 Posted on: 03/29/2017 02:38 PM man, all these socket changes, cant they just make a oversized socket and utilize the pins that are needed, and extra pins can be used at later date when they change the architecture. Like they must have insight knowledge of new memory bandwidth/tech and all that stuff waaaay before they even think about making a CPU. Hate having to buy a whole new system each time a high end CPU is released, grated the x99 as lasted for ages now. eclap Ancient Guru Posts: 31490 Joined: 2005-01-08 #5413634 Posted on: 03/29/2017 02:38 PM Quote: Originally Posted by genie If you were happy with the 2600k, why should you need to upgrade your processor to benefit from other peripheral upgrades like M.2 slots and the like.

Personally, I do see a problem with new consumer-grade sockets every other gen. If making a new socket is a necessity then by all means go for it. But I have a very hard time believing Intel needed a new socket for the CPUs that fit in 1155, 2011, and 1150. As for 1151, I'll give that a pass, since that was transitioning to DDR4. Meanwhile, look at what AMD accomplished - if you have an AM3 (non-plus) CPU, that can fit in AM2+, AM3, AM3+, and some some cases, AM2 boards. These are not pin-identical, and, this goes from DDR2 to DDR3. Based on release dates of the sockets themselves, that's a range of roughly 5 years. If you take into account when AM3+ was superseded by AM4, that would be 11 years. That's impressive. Sure, AM3 CPUs were a slower than their Intel counterparts, but not by a wide margin. In another perspective, AMD also had at least 2 completely different architectures compatible with socket AM3+. Intel has the funding to make a socket last, but, it wouldn't surprise me if they have a deal with motherboard manufacturers where they're expected to break compatibility in order to increase sales. If Intel went AMD's route, motherboard manufacturers would likely lose tens of millions of dollars every year. Think of it in this way: motherboard manufacturers maybe give Intel a small bribe for making a new socket, allowing them to make an entire set of sales when Intel releases a new CPU. As for Intel - they don't care. They have their own fabrication facilities so it's not like they have to pay a 3rd party a hefty price for changing designs. They're going to make sales whether they change the socket or not, so the little bribe they get from the motherboard manufacturers likely pay for the expense of changing things up. In the end, it's a win-win for both companies. The consumer never knows the secrets behind these designs, so they'll never know if the change in socket was ever a necessity.

Both of them have to spend a little extra in design changes, but that's worth it if it ensures both sides make sales. Without changing the socket, only Intel will profit. If Intel kept the same socket for most of their consumer-level DDR3 CPUs, mobo manufacturers would be at a massive loss, because nobody would need to buy a new board when upgrading the CPU. Since Intel isn't really in a position to anger mobo companies, they likely made a deal to change things up once in a while. 4 pages 1 2 3 4 Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

Frank DiPietro (CMFFrankDip) Apr 2, 2017 at 10:07AM A dramatic shift in our daily routines is headed our way. It won't happen tomorrow, but as self-driving cars hit the roads, the people in them won't need to keep their eyes on the road, and this will give them time to do other things. It's going to be a big change that should start becoming visible over the next couple of decades. Let's look at the potential winners and losers as what happens inside the car changes. Corning's next generation concept car. Image source: Corning. Driving today When we think about what to do while driving, most of us think about listening to the radio. Bruce Springsteen captured the idea when he wrote the opening verse to his song "Fire": I'm driving in my car. I turn on the radio.  Commuters are estimated to spend an average of 87 minutes per day listening to audio in their cars and 90% of commuters say they listen to AM/FM radio, according to Edison Research. All that listening translates to advertising dollars for broadcasting companies, but it's not all smooth cruising as terrestrial radio is facing major headwinds from today's connected car, which allows people to access their favorite streaming platform, including those from Pandora (NYSE:P) and Apple. What happens when drivers no longer need to actually drive and can divert their attention to watching videos? Some percentage of that terrestrial-radio audience is going to turn their attention elsewhere and that could be an additional major headwind for companies that derive revenue from terrestrial radio. The table below shows just how poorly radio companies are already doing. Each company's balance sheet has tremendous debt in relationship to its overall size. Autonomous driving looks to only make it worse. Company Enterprise Value Market Capitalization Long-Term Debt Cumulus Media Inc.  $2.27 billion $9.65 million $2.4 billion iHeart Media Inc.  $19.63 billion $109 million $20 billion Salem Media Group Inc.  $440 million $177 million $262 million Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Here's a look at what enterprise value is and why it's important. A headwind for automobile audio entertainment Wunderlich analyst Matthew Harrigan recently downgraded Sirius XM Holdings stock on the news that Intel plans to buy Mobileye, noting that autonomous cars bring "eventual implications for a proliferation of in-car entertainment." Increasing in-car entertainment options, including video and social media, will be "a clear major priority," Harrigan wrote.  This helps paint the picture that some portion of people who listen in cars today will not be listening tomorrow.  In addition to being a headwind for terrestrial radio, the expansion of in-car entertainment options could spell bad news for Pandora. Today, Pandora's service is available in 190 car models and accounts for 10% of radio listening, according to the company. Unlike subscription music services that make money regardless of whether a subscriber listens to anything, the portion of Pandora's service that is ad-supported makes money from the difference between the ads and the cost to license the music. By 2020, Pandora is targeting ad-supported revenue of $1.8 billion, or 46% of total revenue. If listeners tune out, that will negatively impact the company's ad revenue. A tailwind for video entertainment There are numerous streaming video players that could add to user numbers in an autonomous driving world. My mind immediately jumps to the biggest and possibly most creative in the space: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which is closing in on 100 million worldwide subscribers.  There are about 70 million new non-commercial vehicles built each year on a worldwide basis. Autonomous vehicles will give drivers the freedom to enjoy their favorite streaming service while on the road. Auto-bingeing may become the norm. Netflix Chief Product Officer Neil Hunt recently laid out the potential for Netflix to explore optimizing certain cuts of its videos for smaller screens like smartphones and tablets. The initial impetus for this effort is to enhance the viewing experience in developing countries where mobile viewing is the main way for subscribers to consume Netflix. It's not that much of a leap to see how this effort could be adapted to support viewing in autonomous vehicles. If you are watching video, you will need a screen If people are going to be watching video as their car drives them around, they will need a screen to view it on, and that could play right into the hands of Corning (NYSE:GLW). At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, Corning presented a car featuring its patented Gorilla Glass technology. Gorilla Glass is tough and damage-resistant. It also can include anti-glare and anti-reflective treatments to improve viewing in strong, ambient lighting. The product has some unique characteristics in terms of light weight and ability to be formed into 3D shapes, enabling designers to make custom designs and shapes for auto interiors. In a world with 70 million new non-commercial vehicles coming on the road each year, one can imagine a big role for this Corning product. These are just some ideas to keep in mind as the world changes around us. Keep a long-term perspective and watch for new companies that may come into view that can profit from the disruption that lies ahead. Frank DiPietro owns shares of AAPL, Netflix, and Pandora Media.

View Latest Posts >>> Flynn failed to disclose income from Russian entities: White House By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on April 2, 2017 This Flynn story is really just another one of a top official trying to grab everything he can get, as others before him have done …from Press TV,  Tehran Flynn new from his DIA position all the dirty things that Erdogan was into, but was still eager to take the money. Why? [ Editor’s Note:  The Flynn story refuses to go away, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. He is by no means the first to cash in on his former high government position experience. But for those in the top security slots, it seems to be open season for them marketing their influence, based on all the classified information they had access to. This is way past any defense of the right to pursue one’s private retirement employment endeavors. No one has posed this yet, so I will be the first. CIA people in certain slots are routinely polygraphed to assure they have not been bad boys, and these are people way down the line. We hear this even extends to post-retirement for some specialties. It is time to get onto the table that all of these top people who market their past government experience ALSO need to be subjected to similar polygraphing, with the national security concerns far outweighing any right to privacy. They are paid six-figure retirements under the theory of that being their reward for their government service, but we see now that is viewed as just the starting point — just start up money for building a second career in influence pedaling. One of the things I applauded Trump on was his call to ban all Congresscritters from being lobbyists for foreign governments. Hiring an ex-DIA chief would be a big score for a foreign Intel operation Another uncovered aspect to this is all the top-tier group of law, PR and speaker firms that act as intermediaries in these transactions, which give cover to the newly retired hustlers that they remain within the letter of the law. And if push comes to shove, they have the added protection of, “I relied on my very experienced legal counsel”, which is usually a ticket that protects one from a “malicious intent” charge. Than can actually fly if you can show that it is the norm in Washington. But the catch comes not in whether the structure is kosher or not, but if the facts submitted have been “jiggled” to fit the proper format. That would then put the intermediaries in the crosshairs of a conspiracy case, which bottom line, is what most of these post-retirement hustles are, as they are conspiring to get around the laws. VT has said this before and will keep saying it. These huge fees are not paid for “open source” Intel or analysis. That is just the cover for what is being purchased, but none of it ever goes on paper. The customers want top-quality classified Intel, getting it from someone who appears to be above suspicion.  That is what too many of these retirees are marketing, as they are not naive; and most have been watching how this game is played and have planned to get their piece of the action way before they retire. Flynn’s real risk, besides the layer of smoke being blown, is his deal with the Turks, who have run huge espionage operations in the US, and to not overpay… Jim W.

According to documents released by the White House on Saturday, the former official listed speaking engagements to Russian entities, including the Kremlin-funded RT TV and Volga-Dnepr Airlines. A financial disclosure form signed by Flynn on March 31 revealed this information. An initial form was submitted to the Office of Government Ethics and the White House in February and just days before Flynn was ousted from his post amid controversy over his contacts with Russia’s ambassador. However, the process of review and revision of the first form in consultation with the White House Counsel’s Office and the Office of Government Ethics was suspended when he resigned. In those documents, he noted that he received fees through a speaker’s bureau, but he did not state the names of the organizations that paid to have him as a speaker. In recent days, officials at the White House asked him to finish the process and advised him to itemize each organization that paid him. Early in March, Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, disclosed new documents showing that Flynn had also been paid in 2015 for speeches in Washington by Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions. The disclosure forms show that Flynn earned at least $1.3 million in the past year, including more than $827,000 through his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group.

The conversation, which took place before Trump’s inauguration, centered around lifting then-President Barack Obama’s sanctions against Russia. Any discussion of sanctions at that time would have amounted to a breach of US law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy. The FBI, as well as the Senate and House intelligence committees, are investigating Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and any possible ties between Trump’s associates and Moscow. Flynn has been in discussions with congressional investigators on receiving immunity from “unfair prosecution” in exchange for agreeing to testify about ongoing probes into possible contacts between Trump’s election campaign and Russia. ___________ Related Posts: NEO – Erdogan’s Dance of Conquest with Europe and America Trump, Flynn and the Trifecta of Deception Trump’s “Super-Sewer:” Flynn Paid Ex-FBI Agents, Behavior Analysts In Lobbying Work For Turkish Government Manbij: Turkey Asks Russia and US to “Attack their own allies…and themselves” Exclusive: Russia Issues Ultimatum to Turkey The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Flynn's recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid Flynn's effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump's election campaign in 2016. The new disclosures show that Flynn declared more than $827,000 from his work for the Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The disclosures detail Flynn's financial activities dating back to 2014, including Flynn's 2015 work for Russia's state-supported television network and speeches to two other Russian companies. Flynn has been interviewed by the FBI, which has been investigating allegations of contacts last year between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials and surrogates. The White House released two filings for Flynn on Saturday. One was filed while he was still in the administration. The other was filed Friday, more than a month after Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser. Trump has said he asked Flynn to step down because he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn's first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the Office of Government Ethics. "Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so," Kelner said. The White House on Friday began releasing scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Flynn's client, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice officials contacted Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and "potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey." Flynn reported assets worth between $1.2 million and $2.4 million during the last year. He also reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Stay Informed Subscribe to our politics newsletter.

Photo by Carlos Barria/Reuters WASHINGTON — Former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn has disclosed that he earned more than $1.3 million for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors as well as for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman. RELATED LINKS Flynn told to leave after losing Trump trust, spokesman says Ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn didn’t sign ethics pledge Michael Flynn is seeking immunity before he’ll testify to Congress The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments. In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn’s lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Flynn’s recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Flynn’s business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia’s state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies.

The first filing was turned in on Feb. 11, just a few days before Flynn stepped down. It doesn’t include an itemized listing of his speaking engagements including the payments from RT, the Russian television network that U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a propaganda outlet. The later disclosure, filed Friday, cites RT and other Russian clients and breaks out the payments and provides more details on Flynn’s paid speeches. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn’s first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel’s office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. “Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,” Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version. An OGE document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn’s lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17. The White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials.

On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. As part of his firm’s lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan’s, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey’s claim was false and that “no such discussion occurred.” Flynn’s new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee. The group’s website says it aims to “promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States.” But Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York. The new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks. Flynn was paid $15,000 for a speech to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles group headed by a longtime conservative activist. Flynn was also paid $10,000 for a speech to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit think tank promoting libertarian ideals.

Adam SchiffAdam SchiffSchiff: 'Alarm bells' should go off when Trump calls something 'fake' Former House intel chief: 'I wouldn't grant immunity' Top Intelligence committee Dem: Too early to draw conclusions on Russia probe MORE (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that it is too early to definitely conclude that members of President Trump’s campaign staff colluded with Russian associates to interfere in the U.S. election. “I don’t think we can say anything definitively at this point,” Schiff told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We are still at the very early stages of the investigation.” Schiff, who has been leading the House committee’s probe into Russian meddling with Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), said it would be “irresponsible” not to get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in the presidential election. ADVERTISEMENT The House committee’s investigation into Russia has been hindered by political infighting after Nunes briefed President Trump on intelligence materials he reviewed that showed incidental surveillance of Trump transition team members. Nunes admitted that he visited White House grounds to meet with a source and analyze the material one day before briefing the president.  The New York Times reported last week that two White House officials helped Nunes obtain the relevant material. A spokesperson for Nunes following the report refused to “confirm or deny speculation about his source's identity.” Schiff on Sunday reiterated his calls for Russia’s actions to be “thoroughly investigated” as part of the probe.  Tags Russia Adam Schiff   View the discussion thread.

Print Email Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com By Jeff Darcy, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Follow on Twitter on April 02, 2017 at 7:30 AM, updated April 02, 2017 at 7:35 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- President Donald Trump's call for "extreme vetting" obviously never applied to his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Saturday, The White House released financial statements for its staff, revealing Flynn had not initially disclosed financial payments from Russian entities, when disclosure forms were filled out in February. The payments to Flynn included a $45,000 speaking fee from RT, the Russian television network operated by the government.  On Thursday, Flynn, through his attorney, requested immunity before testifying before the Senate and House Intelligence Committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election, and collusion between the Trump administration and Russia. "General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should circumstances permit," wrote Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner.  Kelner explained that "no reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch-hunt environment without assurance against unfair prosecution." Both the Senate and House committees indicated they would not consider granting Flynn immunity until they are further along in their investigations.   In their press conference last week, the leaders of the Senate  Intel committee said they wouldn't call individuals to even testify until they had done their due diligence on them.   Normally, Congress does not grant immunity before first consulting with the Department of Justice, because granting immunity to a target of a DOJ investigation can seriously jeopardize the DOJ's chances of sustaining a conviction, as was proven in the case of Oliver North. North's convictions in the Iran-Contra scandal were overturned due to his being given immunity by Congress for his testimony. It's speculated that the North case may have been one of the reasons Flynn's lawyer has made an aggressive move seeking immunity, hoping maybe House Chairman-Trump lap dog, Devin Nunes might bite. Usually, prosecutors only grant immunity when they know what the subject is going to say, and know that testimony will hook a bigger fish.  The only bigger fish than the President's National Security Adviser, linked to the Russia investigation, are Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Trump himself. During his speech at the Republican National  Convention, Flynn egged on "Lock Her Up!" anti-Clinton chants.  Turns out, they should have been playing John Lennon's "Instant Karma." In September, on "Meet the Press" Flynn, said that "when you are given immunity that means you've probably committed a crime, " referring to Clinton associates. A day later at a rally, Trump asked,"If you're not guilty of a crime, what do you need immunity for?" Now, of course, Trump's tweeting out a different tune when it's his former National Security Advisor seeking immunity.   "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!" Press Secretary Sean Spicer said, "The president is very clear that he wants Mike Flynn to go and be completely open and transparent with the committee and whatever it takes to do that he is supportive of." A week earlier, Spicer was in full cover-up spin mode, dismissing Flynn as just a campaign "volunteer" and Manafort, the campaign manager for six months, as someone who had a "limited role" for a "limited time," Flynn's immunity request "doesn't look good," said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, House Oversight Committee Chairman.  "The witch hunt, I don't buy that either.  We're just trying to get to the facts." Here are the known facts so far  on Trump's flimflam man, Michael Flynn: Mislead Mike Pence and FBI about calls to the Russian Ambassador. Flynn was ousted as National Security advisor after misleading Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI about his calls to the Russian Ambassador and the nature of those calls.   Flynn had indicated to the FBI that he had not discussed the sanctions that had just been imposed by the Obama administration.  The transcripts showed that he had.  Lying to the FBI is a felony. DOJ warned Trump that Flynn could be compromised. Prior to being fired, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates warned Trump that Flynn  had mislead Pence about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador and that Flynn could be compromised by the Russians.   Despite this grave notice, Trump did not take immediate action to remove Flynn. Flynn did not disclose he was a "foreign agent" for Turkey. Flynn did not disclose he was a "foreign agent," as legally required, doing consulting and lobbying work for Turkey, until after he was ousted. Flynn failed to report financial payments from Russian entities. Saturday, the White House released staff financial disclosure forms showing Flynn failed to report payments from Russia, including a speaking fee of $45,000 from RT, the state-run Russian propaganda television network. Former CIA Director implicates Flynn in kidnapping plot. Former CIA Director James Woosely told The Wall Street Journal  he attended a meeting where Flynn and representatives of Turkey's government discussed a "covert step in the dead of  the night to whisk away" Turkish dissident leader Fethullah Gulen  from his home in Pennsylvania.     Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, blamed Gulen for the failed coup attempt against his government.  At the time, Flynn was a campaign adviser to Trump and a lobbyist for Turkey. The only presidential campaign under federal investigation on election day was Trump's, not Clinton's.   The only one now seeking an immunity deal, is Trump's former National Security Advise, not Hillary Clinton.   Unfortunately for Trump, flimflam Flynn didn't make his immunity request on April Fool's Day.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics AI artificial intelligence artificial intelligence Chorus.ai US President Donald Trump’s reputation as a gonzo salesperson and savvy deal-clincher has been tainted by his inability to pass his health care reform bill, a fumble that may well be the subject of studies and speculation in coming years about what went wrong. But in the here and now, there are new technologies available to help the US president figure it out. Startups are now developing artificial-intelligence (AI)-based technologies aimed at helping sales teams improve their sills and clinch that slippery deal. One of them is Chorus.ai, a San Francisco- and Tel Aviv-based startup that uses AI to analyze sales conversations and learn how organizations can increase the number of deals they win. “Our software transcribes what is said in the call and analyzes the conversation: what topics were discussed? what questions were asked? ​is the person hesitant? ​Does ​their tone sound excited or engaged?” said Micha Breakstone, co-founder and head of R&D ​at​ Chorus.ai in an interview at the company’s offices in Tel Aviv. “Our aim is to figure out the hidden dimensions ​that govern outcomes of human conversations.” Chorus.ai Israel-US teams (Courtesy) The company’s technology uses a combination of​ proprietary speech recognition, natural language processing​ ​and AI technologies developed in-house to transcribe, analyze and deliver real-time feedback on sales conversations. The software helps organizations understand their sales calls, detecting the most important moments and learning what teams could do differently to achieve better outcomes. This feedback helps sales managers coach their workers to​ improve their sales pitches and selling skills, ​Breakstone said. “In sales every 1 percent improvement in conversation ​translates to 1% bigger revenues for the company,” said Breakstone, who holds a PhD in Cognitive Science from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem​ and who previously co-founded Ginger’s Virtual Personal Assistant Platform Business Unit acquired by Intel in 2014. ​ With sales force​s​ spending ​thousands or tens of thousands of hours each quarter in online or phone meetings with customers and prospects, conversations are a sales force’s most valuable and underutilized asset, he said. “No one has opened up the sales calls for analysis,” he said. “Conversation Intelligence is such a new concept, ​it took time to convince people ​of its value, but now customers are ​asking for it.” The company, ​founded two years ago ​by​ Roy Raanani, the company’s CEO, ​Breakstone, and Russell Levy ​as founding CTO, released its software ​in late 2016​ and has since has been selling its product to “billion-dollar companies with huge sales forces,” according to Breakstone. Chorus.ai co-founder Roy Raanani, the company’s CEO (Courtesy) Its customers, including Qualtrics, Marketo and Dynamic Signal, have used the Chorus.ai platform during the last year to analyze ​hundreds of thousands of sales conversations, he said. This is how it works: Customers use Chorus’s SaaS software to make calls, prospects are notified the call is being recorded, then Chorus.ai’s software records, transcribes ​and analyzes ​all the conversations​ in real-time​, giving sales managers access to a huge amount of information regarding the sales process that they can then use to coach their reps. The software also allows for the classification of conversations by topic, time of calls, and speak/listen ratio, and can be set to highlight when specific moments or ​topics — like price or budget — are mentioned; and also, ​what the next steps are, like whether a conversation needs to have a follow-up call or not. ​”This is ​coaching​ on steroids,” said Breakstone. “Also, we help companies ​automatically surface​ what differentiated closing deals vs. failed pitches. We can analyze topics and see if there is a pattern.” The software has found some counterintuitive insights. More questions are better than fewer, but they need to be open-ended ​and engaging, Breakstone said. Also, it can sometime be good to mention competitors in the conversation. “​When a prospect mentions a competitor, they already know the market, and may be closer to making a final decision,” he said. And that means the pitch can be changed to home in on a close. Chorus.ai issues reports that highlight patterns and indicate what could be done better. The company is also working on an update to be released next month that will give sales reps real-time analysis and tips on how they can do better, like, “You are talking too fast​ or too long​,” or, “​when such and such question was asked, ​the best​ reps have used this answer to ​close the deal.” Micha Breakstone, Chorus.ai co-founder and president (Courtesy) “Technology is not the hitch to providing immediate feedback,” said Breakstone. “What makes the matter sensitive is the ​focus and attention of the salespeople. The big question is how to give them the feedback subtly​, without distracting them from the call​.” Sales tech startups globally raised $5 billion in funding in 2016, CB Insights, a New York-based data company said in a March 21 report. These include companies that are developing tech-enabled solutions that directly serve sales teams or improve the sales process, as well as serving customer relationship management platforms. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that by 2020 there will be 2.6 million inside sales reps, those who work over the phone in the US, up from 1.2 in 2010. “People travel much less ​these days to sell,” said Breakstone. There are fewer face-to-face deals and communications are becoming more virtual. “Video conferences are almost as good as fact to face. That is how people are selling today, and we are ​creating a new product category in this space,” he said. Russell Levy, founding CTO of Chorus.ai (Courtesy) Chorus.ai keeps the recorded calls as long for as the customer remains on board, then ​deletes​ them. The statistical ​metadata collected, however, stays with Chorus.ai. At the moment the technology works only with English. But other languages ​are doable, said Breakstone. “We need to invest money and work to do that,” he said. “It is as if now we have built a stereo system and all we have to do to get it to work with other languages is to change the disk.” Chorus.ai is in a market that is “in a positive trajectory point and is expected to grow rapidly in the immediate future,” said Zirra.com Ltd., a Tel Aviv-based research firm that analyzes private companies using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. However, as there are “many existing companies already in the market space, Chorus.ai must display a strong differentiating factor in order to surpass the clutter.” Direct competitors include Deepgram, TalkIQ, and Persado, Zirra said. In February Chorus.ai raised $16 million in a Series A financing round led by Redpoint Ventures with participation from original seed investor Emergence Capital. “We spent a year researching the market and it’s clear to us that Chorus.ai is the leader,” Tomasz Tunguz, a partner at Redpoint Ventures said at the time of the announcement. “Their unique technology enables them to provide real-time feedback to account executives, accelerating training, tuning performance and empowering those teams to win more business every day.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  AI artificial intelligence,  artificial intelligence,  Chorus.ai,  Micha Breakstone,  Roy Raanani,  Russell Levy,  CB Insights,  Zirra More in Israel Inside Police rescue IDF soldier from ultra-Orthodox mob Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Start-Up Israel Current top stories Paris Hilton reveals sparkling-water ‘miracle’ By Jacob Magid   Donald Trump could sharpen sales skills with AI next time By Shoshanna Solomon   Israeli scientists design robot to squeeze through small intestine By Times of Israel staff   Israel second to US for cyber-defender firms By Shoshanna Solomon   GE Ventures leads $25m funding round in Israeli freight firm By Shoshanna Solomon   Start-Up Israel Blogs March 30, 2017, 7:51 pm A Problem in Delaware May Impact Workers in Tel Aviv Coming from the recent AIPAC convention, we heard a lot about the similarities between the United States......

Flynn's initial disclosures, which he submitted in mid-February, were made public as part of a White House release of financial disclosures of 180 White House officials. However, Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner said that his client had only just commenced the financial disclosure filing process at the time he was leaving the White House. "He filed a draft form explicitly listing his speakers bureau contract, and he expected to engage in the usual process of consultations with the White House Counsel's Office and OGE (Office of Government Ethics) regarding what he was expected to disclose. That process was suspended, however, after he resigned. When the White House asked him this week to complete the process and to itemize the specific speaking events, he did so," CNN quoted Kelner as saying. The disclosure forms revealed that Flynn had made earned about USD1.5 million last year and received USD 827,055 in salary and bonus from his firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. He had disclosed a speaking engagement for a Russian TV network in the form but did not specify the amount he got received for it. U.S. President Donald Trump has urged former national security advisor Michael Flynn to "ask for immunity" in the investigation into his Russia links, saying the probe is a witch hunt by the Democrats and the media. "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!," the President tweeted. Flynn is reportedly seeking immunity from prosecution in exchange for agreeing to testify about alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump's Presidential campaign. Flynn, who played a crucial role in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was asked to resign after it became public that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence on conversations he had before moving into the White House, regarding sanctions on Russia with Sergey Kislyak, the Kremlin envoy in Washington. Flynn, in his resignation letter, wrote that he "inadvertently" briefed top officials with incomplete information regarding his call with the Russian ambassador. He had initially denied discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador Kislyak during the transition, and Vice-President Pence also defended him in front of the media.

See Offers Politics Posted Yesterday at 4:00 AM increase font size Collins, King say Senate committee’s Russia probe will be steady The investigation of Moscow's effort to sway the election is a model of bipartisanship, the lawmakers say. By Colin WoodardStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-791-6317 Share Comment Read Article As the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of Russian interference in last year’s presidential election collapsed last week, Maine’s two U.S. senators expressed renewed confidence that a committee they both serve on will conduct a credible and comprehensive investigation. Republican Susan Collins and independent Angus King both say they and their colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee are committed to a thorough investigation of Russia’s activities, including any ties between Moscow and President Trump’s family, close associates and campaign aides, and that convening a special committee or appointing a special prosecutor was unnecessary. Sen. Susan Collins Sen. Angus King Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → “We’re going to follow the evidence wherever that may lead – I’m absolutely confident of that,” Collins reiterated Thursday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program. “And we are going to ask the kinds of tough, probing questions that need to be asked not only for the sake of our democracy but to assure the American people that we have gotten to the bottom of this.” King, a former two-term governor of Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, appeared on the same broadcast alongside a Republican colleague on the committee, Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, in a show of solidarity. “We’re going to try to avoid some of the infighting that you’re seeing on the other side” in the House, King said, in remarks later echoed by Lankford. After the appearance, Lankford tweeted a photo of the two taking a selfie together. “Honored to serve on the Senate Intel Cmte w/this guy!” he wrote of King, followed by the hashtag “#bipartisanship.” King retweeted it, saying in return, “Thank you for your hard work on behalf of the American people.” WORKING TO DRAW CONTRASTS The senators’ appearances were part of a conscious effort last week by members of the Senate Intelligence Committee to demonstrate a bipartisan cooperation and resolve on the investigation, in contrast to what critics view as the naked partisanship of the House Intelligence Committee and its chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. Nunes, an early supporter of Trump’s presidential bid, is under fire for a late-night trip to the White House to brief Trump officials on the investigation and to view intelligence documents they provided that he subsequently refused to share with his committee colleagues. Nunes and his House colleagues have focused their investigation on finding who was leaking information about Trump aides’ contacts with Russian officials, rather than the revelations the leaks contained, or the fact the FBI found the situation troubling enough to launch an investigation, which is ongoing. The ranking Democrat on the House committee, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, on Monday called for Nunes to recuse himself from the proceedings. As in the House, Republicans are a majority in the Senate and have eight of the 15 seats on the Senate Intelligence Committee and the chairmanship, held by Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, but its members are working to convince the public that they will put partisanship aside. On Wednesday, Burr and the committee’s vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., held a joint news conference to brief the media on their progress. “We’ve known each other for a long time. We’re social friends,” Warner said of Burr in a television appearance Friday with PBS’s Charlie Rose when asked why the committee was holding together. Collins agrees. “This really has been a nonpartisan investigation, not just a bipartisan investigation,” she said Thursday on “Morning Joe.” “Many of us have forged personal relationships with Democrats with whom we work on our committees,” she added, “and we’ve learned the simple truth that if you want to get things done in the Senate, it usually requires 60 votes.” The Republicans have a slim 52-48 majority in the chamber. SKEPTICAL OF INDEPENDENT PANEL The Senate committee has not been without its problems. Like Nunes, Burr has had friendly relations with Trump, serving as a member of his transition team and last month agreeing to a White House request to call reporters to sow doubt about media reports on contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. When Burr’s actions became public in late February, Warner, King and Collins all criticized his actions. “This committee must have credibility not only with our colleagues, but also with the American people – to whom we owe nothing less than a thorough, fair and nonpartisan investigation – and I will have serious concerns if it seems that we are no longer able to proceed in this matter,” King said in a statement to the Portland Press Herald at the time. Throughout the controversy, both Maine senators have resisted calls for the formation of an independent committee or the appointment of an outside commission to take over the congressional investigations – a position held by Schiff, Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine’s 1st District, and Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. King reiterated his position Thursday, telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper that another Senate committee “wouldn’t be materially different than the committee that you have today,” which was well-balanced and committed to impartiality. His panel’s staff has the requisite security clearances and is already at work. “You’d have to start all over with security clearances for the staff and the members of the commission,” King said. “It would be six to eight months before such a group got to where we are today.” He said on “Morning Joe” that the Senate Intelligence Committee’s own investigation would likely take six to eight months. Collins told The New York Times that the drama on the House Intelligence Committee hasn’t helped their work. “I worry that the chaos on the House side has affected the public’s view on whether Congress can credibly investigate this matter,” she said. “I believe the answer to that is still yes, and that the Senate is the place.” Colin Woodard can be contacted at 791-6317 or at: [email protected] Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

Trump wrote at 9.50am: 'Wow, Fox News just reporting big news. Source: "Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked...."' Twelve minutes later, he added: '..not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated." If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.' Scroll down for video Donald Trump tweeted about a Fox News story this morning that seemed to support his claim he was spied on during the election. The story cited a single anonymous source. Trump's first tweet was published at 9.50am and his second was published at 10.02am. The tweets do not appear to quite follow each other grammatically and it is not clear if there was a reason for the 12-minute delay between them The Fox News story cites a single anonymous source who said that a 'very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world' individual, not associated with the FBI, was responsible for allegedly revealing the identities of private persons involved in the Trump campaign. An unnamed congressional source said: 'The main issue in this case, is not only the unmasking of these names of private citizens, but the spreading of these names for political purposes that have nothing to do with national security or an investigation into Russia’s interference in the U.S. election.' The Fox News story did not provide further details of who these private citizens were.   RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Trump 'didn't win this election': New DNC chair says...

Share this article Share 117 shares The story comes as Devin Nunes, a California Republican representative and the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, said US intelligence collected incidental evidence on Trump, The Hill reported. Nunes came under fire for alleged closeness to the Trump team, particularly when it emerged that White House officials colluded with him during his investigation into the alleged surveillance.  Trump also on Saturday morning attacked NBC News' Chuck Todd in a furious tweet, wondering why the 'sleepy-eyed' host didn't give more air time to his claims that the previous administration wiretapped his headquarters. In the Fox News story that Trump cited, a single anonymous source said that a 'very well known, very high up, very senior in the intelligence world' individual, not associated with the FBI, was responsible for allegedly revealing identities of private persons in Trump campaign The president's Twitter rant came a day after Todd warned on MSNBC that Trump could be on the verge of a 'lame duck' presidency due to the current investigation over his campaign's alleged ties to Russia. Todd's 'lame duck' quote was immediately picked up by conservative websites such as Breitbart news, where it was making headlines Saturday morning when Trump published his tweet. The Russia probe, which has been fed by Trump's unsubstantiated wiretapping claims, escalated to new heights over the end of the past week, with Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn asking for an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony.  The president followed up with another message 21 minutes later, once again taunting media outlets for not predicting his victory in the presidential election The president's Twitter rant came after Todd warned that Trump could be on the verge of a 'lame duck' presidency due to the investigation over his campaign's alleged ties to Russia Todd said in a commentary on MSNBC Friday that Trump's presidency had been left 'beyond crisis mode' by the ongoing Russia probe fiasco.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 April 2017 by Military News 3 Top Apple Suppliers to Buy in 2017 Strong earnings growth and the dominance of the iPhone, which more than 700 million consumers use worldwide, have combined to help Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  stock rise more than 900% in the past decade. Apple is the largest company to trade on any U.S. stock exchange by market cap, and it has by far the most cash of any public company. It’s using that cash pile to make huge investments in research and development. But we’re not going to talk here about Apple. I want to focus instead on what companies have been benefiting from Apple’s success as they help supply the parts and services necessary for Apple’s continued growth. Here, then, are three key Apple suppliers that could also make top stocks for 2017. Image source: Apple. Micron Technology Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU)  is a semiconductor manufacturer that makes products for computers, consumer electronics, the automotive industry, industrial applications, and more. The company supplies the internal processing power of iPhones and other Apple products. Micron’s stock was a great performer in 2016, gaining more than 50% during the year, and looks on track to continue gaining in 2017. Micron’s NAND products, which are advanced rewritable memory devices, seem to have huge potential as cloud computing continues to grow, which could help to diversify and grow sales in the coming quarters. In its most recent quarter, Micron’s sales rose 58% year over year. The company does face some risks, including an increasing threat from major players in the field, including Intel . It also faces volatility in the prices for its products, the same thing that’s sent the stock tumbling in the past. In addition, Micron’s CEO recently announced his retirement, and so far a replacement hasn’t been named. It should also be noted that Micron stock is still off its November 2014 high, which was followed by more than a 70% drop over the next 18 months. Still, analysts expect Micron’s earnings to continue growing quickly, and the stock price looks attractive at less than 6 times forward earnings estimates. Texas Instruments Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN)  is an advanced semiconductor maker that makes chips and processors, including various components of Apple’s iPhone and iPad. The company recently got a major operational boost when it moved to a new type of chip for one of its main products that reduced production costs significantly — as much as 40%. For the full year of 2016, sales rose only about 3%, but earnings per share grew nearly 24%. The company showed strong momentum within its auto and industrial segments, two areas the company has been investing heavily in, and which seems to be paying off now. Sales are climbing faster now than they did in 2016, and management has guided for Q1 sales of as much as $3.43 billion, compared with $3 billion during the prior-year period. As for the stock’s valuation, it looks relatively cheap in its industry, trading at just 23 times earnings. It also comes with a nice 2.5% yield that’s grown very consistently over the past decade and is likely to continue growing, as the company has a payout ratio of less than 50% and strong cash flow. The progression of iPhone generations. The iPhone 8 is expected in fall 2017. Image source: Apple. Broadcom Last, but certainly not least, is Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) , which, following the 2016 merger with fellow semiconductor behemoth Avago, is a $94 billion company by market cap. Broadcom is a major supplier of wireless chips used in the iPhone, and there’s been speculation lately that Broadcom and Apple are working together on wireless-charging technology that could be in the iPhone 8, expected to be released later this year. That would be a major positive development for both companies. Thanks to the merger, Broadcom’s 2017 sales are likely to grow substantially from last year, but expect that growth to continue as the company expands its market share. The company’s long-term earnings growth potential looks even better, as it’s expected to grow around 15% annually over the next five years. While the stock looks expensive because of the cost of the acquisition, it’s trading at just 14 times forward earnings estimates, and it also pays a 2% dividend yield. Is it a good idea to invest in companies that might ride Apple’s coattails, or is it better to just invest in Apple itself? That’s a fair question, as Apple already looks like one of the best stocks to own in 2017 , and betting on its suppliers has been a gamble in years past. Apple has a history of squeezing suppliers on prices to protect its own margin, while new entrants in the chip space have left some companies with questionable growth prospects. However, each of the companies we’ve looked at have many more buyers than just Apple, and each also has its own unique growth prospects. Therefore, it wouldn’t be a bad strategy to consider both Apple and these suppliers as good stocks to own going forward. 10 stocks we like better than Texas Instruments When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Flynn’s recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid Flynn’s effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump’s election campaign in 2016. The new disclosures show that Flynn declared more than $827,000 from his work for the Flynn Intel Group, a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. The disclosures detail Flynn’s financial activities dating back to 2014, including Flynn’s 2015 work for Russia’s state-supported television network and speeches to two other Russian companies. Flynn has been interviewed by the FBI, which has been investigating allegations of contacts last year between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials and surrogates. The White House released two filings for Flynn on Saturday. One was filed while he was still in the administration. The other was filed Friday, more than a month after Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser. Trump has said he asked Flynn to step down because he misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Flynn’s first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel’s office and the Office of Government Ethics. “Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,” Kelner said. The White House on Friday began releasing scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company’s lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” Flynn’s client, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. Flynn reported assets worth between $1.2 million and $2.4 million during the last year. He also reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Flynn provided to the bureau. Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin.

Flynn submitted the initial disclosures in mid-February, just days before he resigned from his post after it became public that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. His resignation came amid federal probes into allegations that Trump associates colluded with Russian operatives to interfere in the US election. The initial disclosures left out that Flynn received money from Russia’s state-funded television network, RT, for a speech in Moscow in December 2015 and from air cargo company Volga-Dnepr Airlines and cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the United States. The initial document also left off nearly two dozen other speeches from a diverse array of organizations, including business groups and financial services companies, which Flynn was required to itemize. Flynn included the speaking fees in disclosure forms he filed Friday, according to the documents. Both sets of filings were made public as part of a White House release of financial disclosures of 180 White House officials. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said Flynn “had only just begun the financial disclosure filing process at the time he left the White House. “He filed a draft form explicitly listing his speakers bureau contract, and he expected to engage in the usual process of consultations with the White House Counsel’s Office and OGE regarding what he was expected to disclose,” Kelner said. “That process was suspended, however, after he resigned. When the White House asked him this week to complete the process and to itemize the specific speaking events, he did so.” When asked to list sources exceeding $5,000 year, in his initial paperwork, Flynn disclosed only five organizations from which he received speaking fees in the past two years, including a speakers bureau that set up many of the speaking engagements that he detailed in his second filing. The revised forms specify nearly 30 entities that paid Flynn to give speeches during the same period, saying he received at least $250,000 from individual companies, groups and speakers bureaus for the work. Fourteen of those speeches were arranged by Leading Authorities, the bureau Flynn listed on his initial disclosure. The agency set him up with the three speeches to Russian groups, as well as talks to a slew of other companies and organizations, such as Wells Fargo and the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce. Flynn also left some speeches off his initial forms that don’t appear to be linked to Leading Authorities or another speakers bureau. Those include talks to Halifax Investment Management and Black Duck Software, which he identified only as consulting jobs in his initial filing. The initial and recent disclosures also show discrepancy in how he listed a speaking engagement paid for by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a former official with the nonprofit Assembly of Turkish American Associations, a Turkish-American advocacy group based in D.C. In his initial forms, Flynn lists Kurtulus in a section detailing sources of income exceeding $5,000 in the past two years. In his revised forms, Flynn provided more detail in a section of the form covering income from the past year, saying he received $10,000 from Kurtulus for a speech he delivered in October 2016. The disclosure forms show Flynn made as much as $1.5 million last year. According to his financial snapshot, Flynn received $827,055 in salary and bonus from his firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. CNN has reported that Flynn gave the speech in Moscow, paid for by the Russian television network RT, but the existence of the other two speaking engagements paid for by Russian companies was disclosed last month by House Democrats. In his recent filing, the retired lieutenant general listed the speaking engagement for “RT TV” when asked in the form to disclose “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” but did not specify the amount. CNN previously reported that Flynn, according to a top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, was paid more than $33,000 of a $45,000 speaking fee by RT for the speech in December 2015, with most of the remainder of the money going to Leading Authorities, the speakers bureau. The US intelligence community has long assessed RT, formerly called Russia Today, to be a propaganda tool of the Kremlin, writing in a January report on Russian interference in the US election that the organization had participated in disinformation campaigns aimed at the US. Flynn initially said he was paid by his speakers bureau for the talk. The forms say Flynn received “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year” from the Russian airline and cybersecurity company for speaking engagements in the United States. House Democrats last month also revealed the existence of those two speeches, saying Flynn received $11,250 from the airline and $11,250 from the cybersecurity firm. The White House acknowledged in March that Trump’s transition team was aware before Flynn was tapped to serve as national security adviser that he had engaged in work that would likely require him to register his consulting firm as a foreign agent. Flynn’s Justice Department filing last month raised questions when it revealed that Flynn’s firm worked on behalf of a Turkish-owned company, Inovo BV, to improve US confidence in Turkey’s business climate. Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from the company and acknowledged in its registration as a foreign agent that the work may have benefited the Turkish government. The White House has many advisers who earned millions of dollars last year, including President Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, whose assets combined with her husband’s could exceed $700 million. Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income, according to a new financial snapshot of about 180 of the men and women serving in Donald Trump’s White House. Other Trump aides with lucrative histories include Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of banking giant Goldman Sachs, who netted up to around $75 million in the previous year. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon made up to $2.5 million. The newly released financial disclosure forms list the assets the Trump aides held when they walked in the doors of the White House in January — before administration counsel advised them to resign from various postings, divest certain holdings or recuse themselves from future decisions. But the documents nevertheless offer a portrait into the lives of several key White House aides, especially those who came from Wall Street or have other ties to the financial industry. Kushner, like Trump, a prominent real estate titan, held a position in 267 separate entities, ranging from the Trump transition team to dozens of property holdings in New York and New Jersey. Ivanka Trump, who just this week formally said she would join the West Wing after serving as an informal adviser to her father, has yet to file her own disclosure forms. But the White House said earlier on Friday that her documents would look largely similar to her husband’s. Bannon’s forms reveal numerous ties to various conservative organizations and sources funded by the family of influential Trump donors Bob and Rebekah Mercer, such as Breitbart News, which he led as executive chairman, and Cambridge Analytica, a data firm used by many Republican clients. Other income sources for him are Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consultancy firm valued at as high as $25 million, along with Affinity Media Holdings, which could have awarded him capital gains of as high as $1 million last year. Bannon is also in the process of selling some of his stake in Cambridge Analytica and Glittering Steel, another Mercer-backed entity, according to the forms.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Light up your desktop's insides with… Light up your desktop's insides with Corsair's colorful new Vengeance RGB memory kits By Kevin Parrish — March 29, 2017 4:37 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you PC builders wanting to spruce up the innards of their desktops with colorful hardware now have five new memory kit options from Corsair. Corsair began selling its five new Vengeance RGB DDR4 memory kits, which range in price between $150 and $600, on March 21. As the name implies, these high-performance DDR4 memory sticks sport a “precision-engineered” light bar across the top of the heat spreader to light up the innards of your desktop with various colors and effects. They can even change color based on system temperatures. Here are the specs and pricing of all five kits: CMR16GX4M2A2666C16 CMR16GX4M2C3000C15 CMR32GX4M4A2666C16 Kit contents (size): 2x 8GB 2x 8GB 4x 8GB Type: DDR4 DDR4 DDR4 Number of pins: 288 288 288 Performance profile: XMP 2.0 XMP 2.0 XMP 2.0 SPD latency: 15-15-15-36 15-15-15-36 15-15-15-36 SPD speed: 2,133MHz 2,133MHz 2,133MHz SPD voltage: 1.2 volts 1.2 volts 1.2 volts Tested latency: 16-18-18-35 15-17-17-35 16-18-18-35 Tested speed: 2,666MHz 3,000MHz 2,666MHz Tested voltage: 1.2 volts 1.35 volts 1.2 volts CAS latency: C16 C15 C16 Price: $150 $155 $300 CMR32GX4M4C3000C15 CMR64GX4M8A2666C16 Kit contents (size): 4x 8GB 8x 8GB Type: DDR4 DDR4 Number of pins: 288 288 Performance profile: XMP 2.0 XMP 2.0 SPD latency: 15-15-15-36 15-15-15-36 SPD speed: 2,133MHz 2,133MHz SPD voltage: 1.2 volts 1.2 volts Tested latency: 15-17-17-35 16-18-18-35 Tested speed: 3,000MHz 2,666MHz Tested voltage: 1.35 volts 1.2 volts CAS latency: C15 C16 Price: $305 $600 Each Vengeance RGB memory stick consists of a custom performance printed circuit board, hand-screened integrated circuits, and a built-in heat spreader for cool, superior performance no matter the load. The XMP 2.0 support means that each chip can safely switch between preconfigured, tested Intel XMP profiles for safe overclocking. “Vengeance RGB’s Corsair Link software control is compatible with a wide range of Intel DDR4 platforms, from dual-channel Z270 and Z170 to quad-channel X99, with more boards adding compatibility every week and AMD Ryzen support planned soon,” the company said. Corsair added that each Vengeance RGB stick packs “specifically designed” lighting circuitry, meaning users won’t see a memory performance decrease with the lighting enabled. And through the Corsair Link tool, users can synchronize the memory’s lighting and effects with other compatible Corsair products installed in the system. The lighting effects include Static, Rainbow, Breathing, and Color Shift. According to Corsair, the new Vengeance RGB memory sticks are compatible with third-party motherboard software RGB control. The first motherboard maker to embrace Corsair’s colorful new memory is Gigabyte, which now supports Vengeance RGB lighting in its RGB Fusion app. Other motherboard partners will add support for the Vengeance RGB sticks “soon.” As a refresher, CAS latency is the time between the memory controller’s initial command to the availability of stored data on the output pins. Naturally, the smaller the number, the faster the memory performance per clock cycle. The four-digit latency numbers actually represent four parameters: CAS latency, Row Address to Column Address Delay, Row Percentage Time, and Row Active Time. Thus, for an additional $5, customers get less latency and higher memory speeds using the CMR16GX4M2C3000C15 kit than they would with the CMR16GX4M2A2666C16 kit. But the performance increase also increases the power draw, upping the usage to 1.35 volts from 1.2 volts.

Flynn’s attorney says the former national security. Credit: Evan Vucci/AP Associated Press 2 April 2017 • 8:51pm Former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn has disclosed that he earned more than $1.3 million (£1 million)  for work for technology firms, political groups and government contractors as well as for speeches to Russian companies and lobbying for a firm owned by a Turkish businessman. The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments.  In response to questions about the differences in the filing, MrFlynn's lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Mr Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Mr Flynn's recent financial history, made available on Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Mf Flynn's business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia's state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies.  The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015.  The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump's campaign. Profile | General Michael Flynn Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinised by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. The first filing was turned in on Feb. 11, just a few days before Flynn stepped down. It doesn't include an itemised listing of his speaking engagements including the payments from RT, the Russian television network that U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a propaganda outlet. The later disclosure, filed Friday, cites RT and other Russian clients and breaks out the payments and provides more details on Mr Flynn's paid speeches. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner said that Mr Flynn's first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel's office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. "Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so," Mr Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalised version. A document obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request by The Associated Press showed that there were no written communications between the agency and Flynn's lawyers about his financial disclosure and ethics agreement between the November election and March 17. The White House on Friday released scores of disclosures from Trump administration officials. Michael Flynn Credit: Carolyn Kaster/AP Mr Flynn declared last month in a filing with the Justice Department that his company's lobbying for a Dutch-based firm owned by a Turkish businessman "could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey." Flynn's client, Ekim Alptekin, told the AP that the decision to file as a foreign agent had come under pressure from Justice Department officials. The Daily Caller reported Friday that Justice Department officials contacted Mr Flynn on Nov. 30. A document obtained by the media site under the Freedom of Information Act quoted Justice Department concern about a pre-election op-ed that Mr Flynn authored stressing Turkish government aims and "potential ties between Lt. Gen. Flynn and others who might be acting on behalf of the government of Turkey." Mr Flynn reported that he served as a consultant for the FBI and received more than $5,000 in compensation from the bureau. Mr Kelner said the FBI compensation was for a speaking event in 2015 and training Mr Flynn provided to the bureau. Mr Flynn reported between $750,000 and $1.5 million in mortgage debt related to his personal home and a rental property. He also had a line of credit between $15,000 and $50,000, the filing shows. In a separate filing to the Justice Department last month, Flynn and his business, Flynn Intel Group Inc., detailed $530,000 worth of lobbying work for Inovo BV, the Turkish firm owned by Alptekin. On his new disclosure, Mr Flynn said only that he personally earned compensation in excess of $5,000 from Inovo BV. As part of his firm's lobbying, Alptekin invited Flynn last September to meet at a New York hotel with a group that included Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Michael Flynn Credit: Ozan Kose/AFP Another participant, former CIA director James Woolsey, said the group discussed a plan for the covert removal of a political foe of Erdogan's, a Muslim cleric based in Pennsylvania. Flynn acknowledged he attended the meeting, but a Flynn spokesman said Woolsey's claim was false and that "no such discussion occurred." Flynn's new disclosure also details a $10,000 payment for a speech in New York last October paid by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a New York financial adviser who is also listed as an advisory board member for the Turkish American National Steering Committee.  The group's website says it aims to "promote and amplify a unified Turkish American voice on issues that affect the Turkish American community and Unites States." But Kelner said Saturday that the speech paid by Kurtulus was made to an audience of Korean-Americans. Kurtulus did not immediately reply to phone calls by the AP to several numbers associated with him in New York. The new disclosure also details several Flynn speeches for conservative groups and think tanks.  Mr Flynn was paid $15,000 for a speech to the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a Los Angeles group headed by a longtime conservative activist. Mr Flynn was also paid $10,000 for a speech to the National Center for Policy Analysis, a nonprofit think tank promoting libertarian ideals.

It was reported on Friday that Trump wanted its administration to find out the countries and goods res­­ponsible for the United States’ nearly US$50bil (RM221.35bil) trade deficit. A report by AFP, quoting Com­merce Secretary Wilbur Ross, said the United States would look for “inappropriate behaviour, trade deals that have not lived up to their promise, lax enforcement, currency misalignment and troublesome World Trade Organisation constraints”. Malaysia was named in the list of countries seen as “potentially involved”. Speaking to reporters here after attending the Xianning-Kuala Lum­pur tea promotion and tea culture exchange conference yesterday, Ong said it must be made clear that Malaysia was not taking advantage of the United States. Quoting February trade figures, he said 53% of exports to the US were electronics produced by American companies here, while the rest included furniture and chemicals. He said that taxes were imposed on goods entering the United States as both countries did not have a free trade agreement. Therefore, exports there had always been low, he added. “If Trump were to ‘punish’ us for this, the American firms will be the ones dealt a severe blow,” Ong said. On another matter, he said the trade in tea between Malaysia and China grew almost 40% to RM57mil last year from RM40.9mil in 2015. He said there was room for further growth in the tea business to help both countries reach the US$160bil (RM708.320bil) trade goal. Ong said that tea leaves could be transported via railway to China and Europe should there be a comprehensive rail system connecting Asean to China, which is already running a train route linking 18 European cities. The event was organised by the Tea Trade Association of Malaysia to push for closer cooperation between tea merchants from Malay­sia and China’s Hubei province. Seven pairs of Malaysian and Chinese tea merchants signed memorandums of understanding to expand their collaboration.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by satprnews satprnews IoT Processor Market Value Share, Supply Demand, share and Value Chain 2016-2026 In this connected world, internet of things (IoT) is fueling every aspect of human lives. The data that is generated every day from these connected devices is humongous. Proper functioning of these connected devices requires real time exchange of data and information amongst them so that they can solve human problems. In another word IoT means more data, more sensors, agile responses, end-to-end connectivity and smarter user interfaces. All these features come at cost like high performance sensor, more silicon area, more power, and more heat. Here comes the concept of IoT processor, while general purpose processor are good to run application on embedded systems, they are not really capable of dedicated task like those required to support IoT applications. IoT processor is a low-power processor that can run number of applications from multiple connected devices in real time. Global IoT Processor Market: Drivers and Challenges As more and more devices are getting connected day-by-day, carrier providers are finding it difficult to collect, process, and dispatch information from one device to another device because of the limitation of interoperability of general purpose sensor. That is creating a separate need of IoT processors. For instance, IoT processors in wearable devices do a lot of controlling, sensing, processing, storing, and interpreting information while consuming very little power area. This would not have possible had vendors of wearable devices such Apple Inc. and Xiaomi would have deployed general purpose processors in their devices. Furthermore, technological advancements in the field of cognitive and affective computing are also driving the growth of IoT Processor market. Cognitive and affective computing systems generally process data which available in the form of video, image, sign etc. Request Report Sample@  http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-2491 Despite the big opportunity IoT market present for processor makers, some processor companies have hesitated to make significant investment in this sector. The greatest issue is that products within the IoT sector tend to appeal to niche market and generate relatively low sales volume. But in coming couple of years more semiconductor companies will invest in IoT processor market. Global IoT Processor Market: Segmentation IoT Processor Market can be segmented on the basis of type, application, and region. Type category includes 8bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit processors. On the basis of application, the market can be segmented into automotive, manufacturing, energy and utility, and retail. Region wise, global IoT Processor Market can be segmented into North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Japan, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Middle East & Africa. Regional Overview North America is expected to the largest market of global IoT Processor market. Majority of IoT Processor vendors such as Intel and Texas Instruments are based in North America region itself and they are also investing in the field of IoT ecosystem of local market. For instance, BMW group, Intel, and Mobileye teamed up for autonomous driving. Visit For TOC@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/toc/rep-gb-2491 Several IoT Processor startups such as Samsara, Notion, and Hologram IoT are expanding their operations in Europe region. Asia-Pacific region is expected to have moderate growth rate for IoT Processor market as countries such as China and Taiwan have advantage of large pool of semiconductor vendors. Latin America and Middle East and Africa regions are yet match the pace of global IoT Processor market. Intel Corporation, QUALCOMM, Samsung, and ARM are some of the key vendors of Global IoT processor market.

Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop.

Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images Michael Flynn did not list three Russia-linked sources of income in the legally required ethics forms he submitted days before being ousted from his job as President Trump’s national security adviser (amidst concerns that he may have had an inappropriate ties to Russian officials). Though he did disclose the more than $1.3 million in income he made last year in the documents he submitted on February 11, he did not specify that some of his non-government compensation had come from the Kremlin-backed RT (Russia Today) news network as well as from speaking fees collected from two Russia-based companies, Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions. Flynn had reported his speaking-engagement income, in general, but he did not list who had paid him for individual speaking engagements. That information was subsequently included on an amended disclosure form, which the White House released on Saturday. The second form does not list how all of his compensation broke down monetarily, however, just who had paid him $5,000 or more in a year. Politico reports that the White House only asked for more detailed information about his private-sector work and assets this past week, and Flynn sent them the amended form on Friday. Flynn’s newly released financials also indicate that he has worked for various tech and D.C. consulting firms, even though he has previously criticized other retired military leaders for taking similar private-sector gigs. More than $800,000 in income came from his now-shuttered consulting firm, the Flynn Intel Group, though he did not disclose the company’s clients, like the Turkish-owned business linked to the Turkish government that hired Flynn’s company — another source of ethical controversy for the retired lieutenant general. It’s also possible that Flynn would have ultimately itemized the Russia-linked income had he not been forced from his White House job, since the disclosure process often involves some back and forth with government ethics officials and that may have been prevented on account of him no longer working in the government. Flynn was fired, or more specifically, asked to resign, from his White House post in February after the media learned that he had been recorded discussing the latest Obama-issued U.S. sanctions against Russia with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, then misled Vice-President Pence about it. Flynn is currently under investigation over his Russia ties while a member of the Trump campaign, and last week his lawyer suggested that Flynn has “a story to tell,” but should be granted immunity if investigators want to hear it, citing concerns that he would otherwise face “unfair prosecution.” On Sunday, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Adam Schiff, said that he is treating that immunity request with “healthy skepticism.” NYT CNN Politico WaPo Related Flynn’s Offer to Testify for Immunity May Not Be As Explosive As It Sounds Tags: michael flynn russia scandal trump administration politics Flynn Initially Failed to Disclose Russia-Linked Income Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Here’s What Democrats Need to Do to Take Congress in 2018 Can Anti-Trump Fury Help a 30-Year-Old Democrat Win Newt Gingrich’s Old Seat?

DDR5 has been under development since late 2015, when Samsung and others tossed in some cash start work on faster DRAM. JEDEC's announcement that “development of the widely-anticipated DDR5 (Double Data Rate 5) and NVDIMM-P Design standards is moving forward rapidly” is therefore a decent milestone. As is the following description of the forthcoming standard's specs: JEDEC DDR5 memory will offer improved performance with greater power efficiency as compared to previous generation DRAM technologies. As planned, DDR5 will provide double the bandwidth and density over DDR4, along with delivering improved channel efficiency. These enhancements, combined with a more user-friendly interface for server and client platforms, will enable high performance and improved power management in a wide variety of applications. JEDEC has this to say about the new NVDIMM-P standard: Hybrid DIMM technologies such as JEDEC NVDIMM-P will enable new memory solutions optimized for cost, power usage and performance. Adding to the existing NVDIMM-N JEDEC standards, NVDIMM-P will be a new high capacity persistent memory module for computing systems. The Storage Networking Industry Association also offers a little data about NVDIMM-P, in this document (PDF) from which we have extracted the slide below. It's not hard to see why JEDEC has decided to let us all know that work on the standard is proceeding: Intel's just announce its Optane products for servers and PCs, both with impressive specs. The new JEDEC standards show that memory-makers other than Intel have plans for faster and/or persistent, memory too. We know there's plenty of demand for this kind of stuff because analytics applications increasingly assume they can access a large pool of memory. And who ever passed up the chance for faster components inside servers and PCs? JEDEC doesn't say exactly when in 2018 the new specs will arrive. It's even harder to say when product or computers that support the specs might arrive. Clues about those matters will be on offer on June 19th 2017, at JEDEC's Server Forum. ® Tips and corrections 2 Comments More from The Register Micron wheels out 'highest density' SATA SSD on the market +Comment 3D TLC latecomer catches up 13 Comments Micron making mucho memory moolah Quarterly results show a boomtown rat raking in dollars 5 Comments See that flashing taillight?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by Military News ZEISS and ASML Strengthen Partnership for Next Generation of EUV Lithography Due in Early 2020s ASML buys 24.9% of ZEISS subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT for EUR 1 billion in cash Start of development of entirely new High NA optical system for the future generation of EUV ASML supports Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capex for approximately EUR 760 million over the next 6 years VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands/OBERKOCHEN, Germany – 3 November 2016 – Netherlands-based ASML Holding NV, one of the world’s leading chip industry equipment providers, and Germany-based Carl Zeiss SMT, a business group of Carl Zeiss AG (ZEISS), have agreed to strengthen their long-standing and successful partnership in the semiconductor lithography business. The main objective of this agreement is to facilitate the development of the future generation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems due in the first few years of the next decade. This technology will enable the semiconductor industry to produce much higher performance microchips at lower costs. ZEISS and ASML jointly announce today, that they have agreed on a 24.9% minority stake of ASML in ZEISS’s subsidiary Carl Zeiss SMT, for which ASML will pay ZEISS EUR 1 billion in cash. The companies stated that no further exchange of shares is planned or agreed. ASML is a key supplier of semiconductor patterning products and services used by the world`s top producers of microchips. With its high-performance optics Carl Zeiss SMT supplies an essential subsystem of ASML´s semiconductor lithography scanners and is ASML`s most important strategic partner. ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT have been in close partnership for more than 30 years. Both firms have grown strongly over the last decades benefiting from each other`s strengths. A new cycle of investments required for the development of an entirely new optical system for the future generation of EUV, expected to be provided to the chip making industry in the first few years of the next decade, has triggered the partners to take a further step in the collaboration. “In 2018 the first chips made on current technology EUV scanners are expected to roll off the production lines of our customers. A lot of work is still being done to ensure the introduction of EUV in volume manufacturing, in tight conjunction with our highly successful immersion scanners which we continue to improve. Yet ASML and ZEISS are looking beyond this important milestone. We see a long and successful future for EUV lithography in advanced chip manufacturing and with this agreement we set the right conditions for development of the next generation of EUV by ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT, so that our customers can reap the rewards of their EUV investments up to the end of the next decade,” said Peter Wennink, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASML. “With this agreement we clear the road for advanced lithography to support the new concepts and designs for future generations of advanced chips. After the many years of fruitful partnership, we see this agreement as a further strong endorsement of our long term cooperation which allows us to further expand our joint leadership that we have already accomplished together”, says Michael Kaschke, President and CEO of ZEISS. The next generation of EUV optics will offer a higher numerical aperture (NA), making it possible to further reduce critical dimensions in the lithography process. The current EUV systems have an optical system with NA of 0.33 whereas the new optics will have NA larger than 0.5, enabling several generations of geometric chip scaling. In addition to the agreement of the minority interest, the two companies have also agreed that ASML will support Carl Zeiss SMT`s research and development (R&D) for approximately EUR 220 million as well as capital expenditures and other supply chain investments for approximately EUR 540 million over the next 6 years. These investments will predominantly be allocated at Carl Zeiss SMT’s main location in Oberkochen, Germany, and will primarily be used for capacity and resource expansions, with positive effects on long-term employment at this location. Carl Zeiss SMT will remain fully integrated into the structure of the ZEISS Group as one of the major and important business groups. “High-NA is the logical next step for EUV, as it circumvents complex and expensive 0.33 NA EUV multiple patterning. High-NA EUV is a robust way for chips to scale all the way down to the sub-3 nanometer logic node in a single exposure with high productivity and reduced cost per feature. That is several generations from where we are today and underlines our commitment to propel Moore’s law,” said Martin van den Brink, President and Chief Technology Officer at ASML. Carl Zeiss SMT will pay an annual dividend to its shareholders Carl Zeiss AG and ASML. ASML expects that the minority share transaction will be accretive to its earnings before adjustments related to purchase price accounting and differences in accounting standards. Furthermore, ASML`s contribution to Carl Zeiss SMT`s R&D and capital expenditures will be taken into account in the future pricing of SMT`s next generation EUV optics to ASML. The transaction has been approved by both companies’ supervisory boards. ASML will fund the transaction from available cash, potentially supplemented by new debt. The transaction is subject to regulatory clearance and is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2017. Update ASML Share Buyback Program In light of the investments by ASML announced today, ASML will prolong the pause of its share buy back program for the time being. As a result, the 2016-2017 program may not be completed for the full amount. Otherwise, the current program will remain in place, yet it may be further suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. As part of ASML’s financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buyback programs, ASML in January 2016 announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 1.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2016-2017 time frame. About Moore`s law The phenomenal growth of the semiconductor industry has been driven by Moore’s Law, named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore. In 1965, Moore observed that the number of components on a chip that could be manufactured at optimum cost had doubled every year. He predicted that this trend would continue. It was an empirical observation, not a law of nature. In the five decades that followed, the “law” has been rewritten several times, but the principle continues: chip makers cram more transistors on ICs with every new generation, making computing power and storage capacity cheaper year after year. Today’s consumers carry more computing power in their pockets than a multi-million-dollar supercomputer could deliver in the 1970s. Moore’s Law has inspired generations of engineers to push technology forward. About ASML ASML is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Our vision is to enable affordable microelectronics that improve the quality of life. To achieve this, our mission is to invent, develop, manufacture and service advanced technology for high-tech lithography, metrology and software solutions for the semiconductor industry.

That's how often I use an Apple TV. I have three at home, and one of them always comes with me on vacations. As I type this, my TV is displaying one of those amazing Aerial screen savers (of the Great Wall of China, by the way). I use Apple TV all of the time; that's how I know it needs to get better. Apple TV is an interesting product in Apple's line-up. For much of its lifespan, it was considered a "hobby." That's Apple CEO Tim's Cook's word. Though Apple execs never marketed the device as strongly as they do iPhones and Macs, personally, I was sold the moment iOS supported AirPlay for Apple TV. [ Related: Video review: Apple's new AirPods ] Sure, every major platform ecosystem now has the capability to stream images and video to another device hooked up to a TV, but the ability to do so on the Apple TV debuted almost seven years ago. For me, AirPlay has always the best way to easily display movies and photos on an HDTV, and it was the only way to get iTunes content onto a TV. The integration with other Apple products through AirPlay has been an important feature check for those in the Apple ecosystem. Whenever I considered the alternatives, -- everything from Google Chromecast to Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick -- the fact that I stored my content in iTunes and the convenience of AirPlay gave Apple TV the edge. Software updates, yes. But... As of now, the Apple TV hardware hasn't been updated in 520-plus days and counting. The current model arrived in October 2015. Usually, I'm not concerned about the length of time between updates. Apple has a solid history of supporting its hardware lines with consistent software updates. Case in point: An update for Apple TV arrived on Monday, eliminating the "scrolling through long lists" issue I would have complained about. So it's not as if Apple has abandoned its hobby, like so many Android devices that won't see any updates long before their usefulness is over. Despite a dearth of hardware updates, new features, security updates, and bug fixes continue to trickle in for Apple TV. But there are some things software can't fix, and Apple under Cook seems to have but one priority when it comes to regular hardware updates -- the lucrative iPhone line. Given the revenue the iPhone brings in, this makes sense. But when you consider other products like the Mac Pro -- which hasn't been updated now in three years -- and the Mac mini, the question becomes: What's going on here? To be blunt, I'm concerned that Apple TV is a core product that is being ignored in an era of increased competition from smaller and cheaper alternatives. The iPhone -- the "corest" of Apple products -- is safe from being outgunned by competition because every resource at Apple is dedicated to it. The Mac notebook and iMac lines are beholden to Intel's processor launch schedules, but remain more or less competitive with similarly-specced PCs. But the Mac Pro and Mac mini continue to languish. I don't want the same thing to happen to the Apple TV. It's easy to second-guess Apple's strategy, especially since the public isn't privy to the data corporate decisions are based on. Yet that doesn't change the fact that the Apple TV -- for all of the software updates it's received -- needs major hardware updates if Apple wants to keep the device competitive. It's time for 4K The Apple TV needs 4K support, as soon as possible. I understand why a 4K model hasn't been rushed to market -- mainly because 1080p high-definition is the sweet spot for most TVs. Meeting the demands of most users is a financially sound decision. It's a safe decision. Certainly, the processors capable of decoding 4K video would have eaten into profit margins, or forced higher Apple TV prices. But remember when Apple used to be the forward-thinking company? Okay, maybe that's a tad inflammatory. In many cases, Apple products are (or at one point were) market leaders in forward-thinking. Think about the original iPod, iTunes, the first iPhone and iPads. Or the latest MacBook Pros, and the shift to USB-C ports. Going all in on USB-C was a very 'Bondi Blue iMac' decision by Apple. But I'm concerned about the Apple TV. 4K isn't an inevitable future possibility, it's happening now, in more and more households as potential cord cutters look for viable solutions. Embracing 4K lets current 4K TV owners in the Apple ecosystem use their TVs as God intended, and it gives developers a higher resolution canvas to design for. And in case you haven't noticed, 4K TV sales are soaring as prices plummet. Thankfully, the arrival of 4K on the Apple TV seems to be coming soon. But that's not the only thing needed. ...And gaming? This may be a stretch, but why not ship the Apple TV with game controllers? It doesn't have to be complicated; even something as simple as ancient SNES controllers would work. If Apple were to leverage its position and ship game controllers with the next Apple TV, it would give developers consistent hardware standards to write games around. Right now there are third-party options for controllers -- as well as the capability to use an iPhone as a game controller -- but that's not enough. If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious? ​CIO Executive Council member profile: Emmanuel Steve Dulvin More from CIO Executive Council Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Ten years ago, laptop sales overtook desktop PC sales to become the dominant hardware platform for computing. Now smartphones are about to do to laptops what laptops did to desktops. But wait, you may ask. What's wrong with laptops? Apple has run out of good laptop ideas For the past decade, Apple has led and dominated the laptop market with design and innovation. The company has been moving toward better quality, so-called "Retina" screens. Apple’s keyboard designs and unibody aluminum construction have been heavily imitated. The company used to dazzle the industry by sweating the small stuff, like the MagSafe power connector and lights that shine through aluminum. It's not just that Apple innovated. It's that its laptop innovations evolved their products toward elegance and usability. And that's over. After years without a significant new laptop design, their latest release, last year's MacBook Pro, landed with a thud. The laptop was seriously underpowered — called by some a MacBook Air at a MacBook Pro price. The company ditched its incredibly popular MagSafe power connector in favor of USB C power. And that Touch Bar! Some like it, others hate it. Either way, the innovation turns away from elegance and simplicity toward awkward interface design and complexity. Most reviewers and users either hate the Touch Bar or like the Touch Bar, but few love it. The keyboard is a mixed bag. Its short key travel thrills some and annoys others. And the touchpad is way too big. Users report constant accidental taps. Apple's attempt to be more elegant and minimalist has had the opposite effect. By offering only four USB C ports, the laptop itself has become simpler. But USB C requires the user to buy ugly, awkward, easy-to-lose dongles and adapters for all those devices and media we use that don't support USB C. Yuck! The best thing that can be said about the MacBook Pro is that it's faster and has a better screen than previous models. But this is inevitable and expected, not revolutionary. There's nothing about this laptop that's going to drive the industry to imitate. Rivals are more likely to see the new MacBook Pro as an opportunity to provide something different, not something similar. Most importantly, is the MacBook Pro worth the price? We'll get to that question in a minute. But first, let's look at all the trends happening this year that conspire against the laptop in general. Flying the unfriendly skies The U.S. and U.K. governments recently banned all non-medical electronic devices larger than a smartphone as carry-on for U.S.-bound flights on specific airlines from specific airports in the Middle East and North Africa. Passengers are required to check their laptops. The ban may have been implemented in response to two recent laptop bomb explosions — one blowing a hole in an airplane flying from from Somalia to Djibouti and the other wounding six people in a Somali airport. These events coincided with intelligence chatter finding increasing sophistication by Al Qaida in building laptop bombs. One congressman said at a recent security conference that more countries would be joining the ban. There are several assumptions we can make about the ban. First, like so many security measures, the ban may spread globally and eventually include all flights. For the next few years, it may become impossible to use a laptop on a commercial flight. Second, such a ban will affect laptop sales. Many travelers won't want to place an expensive laptop in checked luggage for fear of loss or theft. The general fear, uncertainty and doubt around laptops on airplanes is enough to change consumer behavior. And the frequent flier is the laptop industry's best customer base. Third, the ban will be an incentive to develop alternatives so passengers can travel without laptops. Wait, what alternatives? The docking smartphone alternative Samsung announced this week its upcoming Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and the public is impressed. But even more impressive is a Galaxy S8 peripheral called the DeX Station. The DeX is a smartphone dock into which you plug a keyboard, mouse and monitor. DeX enables you to use your Galaxy S8 as a desktop PC. (Instead of a monitor, you can also plug in a TV or projector.) The dock outputs at a 4K resolution, and it supports Ethernet for faster connections. I expect some of you business users to buy two — one permanently installed in your office and another in your home office. That would enable you to use your smartphone full time as your only device, even as you benefit from the giant screen, full-size keyboard goodness of a desktop PC everywhere you work. You can take it with you on trips, and use it in hotel rooms to plug into the room's big TV. Years ago, the use of a phone as a desktop PC wasn't practical. But now, thanks to the cloud and the emergence of strong, even enterprise-capable apps for Android phones, a smartphone docking setup makes perfect sense. The DeX Station costs $149.99 and ships in late April, according to Samsung. At that price, you still can get a bigger screen and better keyboard than what you get on a laptop, and at a fraction of the price — even if you have to go out and buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse. It's possible that even Apple may get into the docking racket. Apple last week published a patent application for a clamshell laptop-like device that runs off an iPhone. The iPhone is inserted in the same spot in front of the keyboard where the touchpad now sits on a MacBook Pro. The phone not only powers the device entirely, but you use the iPhone's screen as the touchpad. This would give you the laptop experience without the laptop price. Better still, you'd use iOS instead of OS X, and could use a single device for everything. You can bet that if Samsung and Apple are enabling the use of smartphones instead of desktops or laptops, the rest of the industry will do so as well. In fact, a small company called Andromium, which makes the Andromium OS (an app that gives Android the look and feel of a desktop OS) is offering for pre-order something called the Superbook. It's a $129 laptop-looking "shell," that's powered by an Android phone. I think the practice of docking in general, and docking a smartphone in particular, will go mainstream fast. The smartphone-size laptop alternative Docking isn't a new idea — even docking a smartphone isn't new (consider Microsoft's Continuum, for example). What's likely new is the embrace of docking as a mainstream alternative. Here's another old idea that's about to go mainstream: clamshell smartphones. In 1997, a company called Psion perfected the so-called personal digital assistant, or PDA. Psion did this through amazing industrial design. The Psion Series 5 had a surprisingly large and touch-typeable keyboard. Sadly, this perfection was washed away by the rising mobile phone movement, which replaced PDAs. Now, the same designer who created the Psion Series 5, Martin Riddiford, is re-creating it as a dual-boot Android and Linux smartphone called the Gemini PDA. He's designing it for a company called Planet Computers. Planet Computers The Gemini PDA is a clamshell Android phone that you can use instead of a laptop. While closed, the Gemini PDA can be used as a phone. While open, it can be used as an Android smartphone with a built-in keyboard — or a Linux laptop that fits in your pocket. In fact, the smartphone-size PC idea is emerging more generally, including in the gaming space. Even Apple has a patent for a clamshell iPhone, which uses a bendable screen. If users want a physical, touch-typeable keyboard, in other words, they won't need a laptop to get one. 3 more trends fatal to laptops All these alternatives provide incentives to use smartphones instead of laptops. And there are three more trends — the last of which will close the lid on laptops once and for all. The first fatal trend is that young people are already choosing smartphones over laptops, even without docking and clamshell smartphones. ComScore reports that the use of laptops and desktops among younger people is on the decline. Some 20 percent of millennials use their smartphone as their only computing device, according to a recent report, and this percentage grows each year. Raw demographics alone favor the end of laptops. The second fatal trend is that the industry is champing at the bit to move everything off Intel and onto ARM. (Intel and Intel-compatible chips have powered desktop and laptop platforms for decades; the smartphones and smartphone apps run on ARM chips.) Once laptops, especially laptops from Apple, run ARM chips, they'll run iOS and Android instead of OS X and Windows. And at that point, they'll essentially be identical to docking solutions, but more expensive. The third and final fatal trend can be found in your wallet. Smartphones are becoming amazing. The Galaxy S8 is amazing. And this year's iPhone is expected to be mind-blowing as well. The new phones have cameras that rival DSLRs. They have performance that rivals desktop PCs. They run increasingly amazing apps, including professional-quality apps. Unlike laptops, smartphones are exciting. And they're expensive. Consumers are now ready to pay $700, $800 — even $1,000 and upwards for a phone. (Already a top-of-the-line iPhone 7 with AppleCare costs $1,100. The iPhone 8 is expected to be more expensive.) Consumers will pay this amount because smartphones are worth it. This is especially true if they don't have to shell out $1,500 or more for a laptop as well. Laptops are too boring and expensive. The industry is churning out new designs that enable smartphones as laptop replacements. Young people are favoring smartphones. The industry wants to use smartphone OSes. And consumers are spending more on smartphones, which will make us spend less on laptops. The dominance of laptops is over. You may never buy another laptop.

If Apple wants its Apple TV to be a Trojan horse into the living room, the company needs to give buyers (and developers) something to cheer about. An Apple TV that's also a gaming machine could be a major differentiation from competing devices, and it would allow Apple to attract users who might not want to pay PS4 and Xbox money for gaming. Gaming could and should be treated as part of the next Apple TV's core functionality. There's been much talk over the years about Apple's desire to revolutionize the living room TV with Apple TV, but that hasn't yet happened. An Apple TV revamp doesn't need to reinvent the wheel to gain a bigger foothold; it just has to do what it does now, at higher resolutions and -- if Apple needs to justify a higher starting price -- offer real gaming support. So what's it going to be Apple -- stick with the hobby or get serious?

Schiff, a 56-year-old eight-term congressional representative from the Los Angeles, California, area, appeared Sunday morning on the CNN political interview program State of the Union, hosted by Jake Tapper, where the topic was classified intelligence documents that Schiff viewed on Friday at the White House. Schiff, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, viewed the documents more than a week after that committee’s Republican chair, Devin Nunes, said that he had viewed leaked intelligence that appeared to indicate that Trump and members of his campaign team were under surveillance during the late stages of the 2016 presidential campaign. House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes viewed liked intelligence documents without sharing them his fellow committee members, as would be required. [Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images] Nunes created a firestorm of controversy because he took the documents to the White House to “alert” Trump to the surveillance before sharing them with Schiff or any other committee members. As of Sunday, Nunes had still failed to share the documents — even after it was revealed that his source for those documents was a trio if White House officials, and that he obtained the documents at the White House itself. Nunes said that the surveillance was legal and occurred only “incidentally,” meaning that Trump was recorded while speaking to someone who was targeted by the surveillance warrant. When Schiff himself visited the White House on Friday to finally view the documents, he was told that they were the same documents that Nunes had seen — even though White House officials earlier claimed that no one in the administration had seen those documents, the Democratic rep told Tapper. “How does the White House know that these are the same materials that were shown to the chairman if the White House wasn’t aware what the chairman was being shown?” Schiff asked, saying that the answer to that question was “the most important thing people need to know about these documents.” Watch Schiff’s interview with Tapper on Sunday in the video below. White House spokesperson Sean Spicer had earlier said that the documents viewed by Schiff had been created “in the ordinary course of business” at the White House. But Schiff said that assertion raised another important question. “Well, the question for the White House and for Mr. Spicer is the ordinary course of whose business? Because, if these were produced either for or by the White House, then why all of the subterfuge? There’s nothing ordinary about the process that was used here at all.” Fired Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whose request for immunity was turned down by the House Intelligence Committee. [Image by Saul Loeb – Pool/Getty Images] Schiff has emerged in recent weeks as the most visible and vocal figure in congress demanding answers from Trump. But when Trump’s former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn — who was fired for lying about his meetings with Russian officials — requested immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff said the committee turned the request down. On Sunday, Schiff told CNN that he treats Flynn’s request with “healthy skepticism,” saying that premature grant of immunity for Flynn could interfere with any case that the FBI may be building against Flynn.

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! WASHINGTON: Michael T Flynn, the national security adviser who was forced out of the job in February, failed to list payments from Russia-linked entities on the first of two financial disclosure forms released on Saturday by the Trump administration. The first form, which he signed in February, does not directly mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia. The second, an amended version, lists the names of the companies that made the payments under a section for any nongovernment compensation that exceeds $5,000 "in a year". That list appears to include all of the work that Flynn, a retired three-star Army general, has done since leaving the military in 2014, without providing compensation figures for any of it. No reason was given for the discrepancy between the two forms. The Russia-linked payments were detailed in a letter released in March by congressional investigators, and included a $45,000 speaking fee from RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed news network, for a speech in 2015 in Moscow. During the same trip, Flynn attended the network's lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting at the elbow of President Vladimir V Putin of Russia. Flynn has faced fierce criticism for the Moscow speech and for his lobbying efforts for Turkey. But the work paid well, and the disclosure forms showed income of nearly $1.5 million, a sizable amount for a man who left the military less than three years ago. What Flynn, who spent most of his adult life earning a military officer's salary, does not appear to possess is the kind of incomeearning investment portfolio enjoyed by most wealthy Americans, including the numerous millionaires and billionaires in the Trump administration. His form listed assets valued at $380,000 and $800,000, most of which is tied up in retirement funds. Flynn reported an income of $1.37 million to $1.47 million. The bulk — $827,055 — came from the Flynn Intel Group, the consulting business he founded after being pushed out as the chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014. The rest included speaking fees and income earned for doing consulting work and sitting on corporate boards, such as that of Adobe Systems, which paid him $125,250. The speaking fees, all of which were from 2016, ranged from about $10,000 to about $22,000. He gave talks to relatively run-of-the-mill groups like the Lincoln Chamber of Commerce in Nebraska, but also to the David Horowitz Freedom Center in California, which the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as an anti-Muslim hate group. It is unlikely that Flynn, who is seeking immunity from congressional and federal investigations into Russia's meddling in the election, will match the same income this year. He shuttered the Flynn Intel Group at the end of 2016, and then was forced out of the White House in February for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of phone calls he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States in December.

Marketers who truly know their customers can better cater to their needs, convert them and then identify opportunities to upsell and cross-sell them. Image credit: Shutterstock Randy Antin Guest Writer VP of marketing for Jumpshot ---Shares April 2, 2017 Reader Resource Tune in April 7 and find out how to provide stellar customer care with social media in our free webinar. Register Now » Few companies can connect the dots when managing their massive amounts of customer information. According to research by Econsultancy and Ensighten, only 10 percent of marketers have successfully aggregated data from social, web analytics, customer purchase history and in-store visits and sales. Even the necessary centralization of that data is becoming more difficult. In a recent CMO Council study, 44 percent of marketers said they believe data aggregation is crucial for completing their picture of the customer experience. Even if an organization stores, collects and aggregates all of its own site's data, it still has a limited view of consumer behavior. Most marketers don’t observe customers’ online activity beyond their own sites. According to Teradata, 87 percent of marketers believe data is a valuable yet largely underused tool. Now is the time to start unleashing its full potential. A lack of aggregation harms consumer relationships Without a holistic view of the customer experience, conversion funnels are inefficient. Marketers who truly know their customers can better cater to their needs, convert them and then identify opportunities to upsell and cross-sell them. For example, if an online retailer knows a customer liked a specific product on Facebook and made a similar purchase before, it can provide personalized messaging and product filtering on its site and provide relevant promo codes. Customers are getting used to this type of customized experience thanks to suggestion mechanisms such as those on Amazon and Netflix. Failure to analyze data properly leads to a lack of accurate customization options, putting the user experience at risk. Related: Perform Powerful Personalized Marketing in 4 Easy Steps I’ve learned that aggregating data is a fundamental step toward understanding customers. At Gap, I worked with various teams and agencies to combine paid search performance data with in-store retail purchase activity from our customers. Matching in-store transactions to paid online search activity allowed us to properly measure ROI regardless of where customers purchased and see how our online activity boosted in-store sales. Then, we expanded customer outreach by focusing on programs we may have shied away from previously. Related: 5 Strategies for Understanding Customer Needs While Competing in Digital Marketing Now that I'm at Jumpshot, my team uses clickstream data to set up KPI touchpoints across the internet. In today’s cookie- and pixel-driven digital world, it’s easy to measure reach, impressions, clicks and the resulting conversion events on a company's own site. But what about companies such as Intel that primarily sell their products through other platforms such as Amazon and Best Buy? By having data from all of these touchpoints, marketers can finally understand the complete impact campaigns have on their audience and properly allocate money to the digital channels that are truly driving business. Where to start with data aggregation Companies that fail to recognize the same individual across social, search, email, and website visits compromise personalization and effectiveness; they also risk decreasing campaign optimization and advertising ROI. Here are four ways to aggregate data effectively to create a holistic picture of the consumer journey: 1. Identify current data sources, and bring them together. Find the data point or points that different data sets have in common. Usually, this process is more complicated than finding a common customer ID across channels. Instead, observe how two data sets match and then use a different data point to compare how two other sets match. Once enough matching data points appear, piece them together in an intricate jigsaw. Foursquare does this through a data-mining technique called “social network analysis.” It uses data to find the most popular person in a group and targets its marketing efforts to that person. The technique assumes that this person will influence his or her friends. Foursquare analyzes not only customer habits, likes and dislikes, but also the connections between different people in a group, allowing the company to effectively advertise places, products and neighborhoods. 2. Find external data sources, and match them to internal sources. Fully understanding customers means knowing not only what they do on company web properties, but also what they do when they are on other organizations' properties. Locate external data sources through a data onboarder, such as LiveRamp, Datalogix or Merkle. LiveRamp, for one, partners with Google to integrate with Customer Match. Customer Match lets brands activate their first-party data to target across YouTube, search and Gmail. Once partnered up, look at the onboarder's lists of existing data partners to cover any company needs. This makes it easier to provide relevant content to audiences across channels and devices. 3. Get someone to analyze your aggregated internal data. Aggregation requires a team to collect, manage and analyze the data -- then share the results. Either hire people such as analysts, data scientists or Excel experts or find a vendor or a project-based outsourcing solution such as Fiverr, CrowdFlower or Experfy. Once the data is analyzed, put it in the hands of the people who can get the most value from it. One lesser-known advantage of analyzing internal data is new product ideas. Home automation and security company Vivint analyzed data from its doorbell cameras. The company found that families, especially those with young, cell phone-less children, were using its cameras most during late afternoons on weekdays. Vivint Ping emerged from this discovery: a two-way videochat children can use to communicate with their parents once they arrive home after school. 4. Establish KPIs and reporting. Know what’s important to the company and how it is measured; then, apply it to programs, data and overall marketing and CRM initiatives. Without effective measuring techniques, it will be hard to determine which marketing efforts are worthwhile. KPIs vary across companies, but for most entrepreneurs, customer acquisition cost, lifetime value and profit margins are very important. Track the amount of money spent to acquire new customers, measure the lifetime value of each customer relationship, and analyze how much an offering sells for above its production cost. Once the metrics that will be used for measuring success are nailed down, apply them -- and make sure no updates or changes are needed for those metrics.

Aggregating data helps piece together a more holistic view of the customer journey. Then, use that information for long-term success.

Many of the forms, which detail employees' income and holdings when they arrived at the White House, are long and convoluted. That's what happens when you have a lot of money. The documents provide only a snapshot in time. Administration lawyers who monitor compliance with federal conflicts of interest laws have advised staff members to resign from outside positions and sell certain assets. The divestment process is still underway. Still, the disclosures provide a window into some of President Trump's closest advisers. 1. The Trump White House is very, very wealthy Trump has filled the White House with advisers who raked in millions of dollars last year. Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income. Their assets combined could exceed $700 million. (The disclosure forms generally require employees to list dollar amounts in ranges, such as $100,000 to $1,000,000.) Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, netted up to about $75 million last year, according to his disclosures. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon made up to $2.5 million. And adviser Kellyanne Conway's income was up to $846,000. 2. Michael Flynn didn't initially list Russian speaking gigs Former national security adviser Michael Flynn did not include thousands of dollars in speaking fees he received from three Russian companies in the initial set of forms he filed in February, just before he resigned. Flynn's initial disclosures omitted money he received from Russia's state-funded television network, RT, for a speech in Moscow and from air cargo company Volga-Dnepr Airlines and cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the United States. Flynn included the speaking fees in disclosure forms he filed Friday, according to the documents. 3. Kushner reported Ivanka's stake in Trump's Washington hotel It was announced only last week that Ivanka Trump will become an official government employee, so her financial disclosure forms are still in the works. But we know from a 54-page document filed by her husband, Jared Kushner, that she maintained partial ownership of the Trump International Hotel in Washington. Her stake was valued at between $5 million and $25 million, and it earned her between $1 million and $5 million in income in 2016. Her lawyer has said she will file her own forms within 30 days. We don't know whether the Office of Government Ethics will require that she divest her interest in the hotel or if she will volunteer to do so herself. 4. Bannon's financial ties to Mercer family are detailed Bannon's forms show that he has financial ties to an array of conservative organizations and sources funded by Bob and Rebekah Mercer, the family of influential Trump donors. Bannon lists $191,000 last year in consulting fees from the Breitbart News Network, which he led. And he received more than $125,000 in consulting fees from Cambridge Analytica, a data firm used by many Republican clients. The Mercers have close financial ties to both organizations. Other of sources of income include Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consulting firm valued at as much as $25 million, and Affinity Media Holdings, which could have awarded him capital gains as high as $1 million last year. Bannon is selling some of his stake in Cambridge Analytica and Glittering Steel, another Mercer-backed entity, according to the forms. 5. Goldman Sachs made Gary Cohn rich Most of Cohn's money came from his job at Goldman Sachs, which he left in December, and related investments. He lists assets that are worth between $252 million and around $600 million. Cohn's portfolio also includes a smattering of positions in individual companies. He held up to $500,000 in Intel shares and up to $1 million in Microsoft stock. Cohn also had stakes in Kraft-Heinz, Live Nation Entertainment, McDonald's, Philip Morris, Facebook, Box and Twitter. The lengthy document also shows that Cohn held a stake in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China when he took the White House job. His shares were worth more than $1 million, according to his forms. 6. Sean Spicer reported investment rental properties Sean Spicer had skin in the real estate game. The White House press secretary owned one commercial property and two residential properties in different cities in Rhode Island. He also owned two commercial properties in Madison, Alabama, and four residential real estate properties in Alexandria, Virginia. Six of the properties are worth between $250,000 and $500,000. One is worth between $100,000 and $250,000. Two are worth between $500,00 and $1,000,000. 7. Omarosa Manigault received $25,000 wedding dress Omarosa Manigault, a White House adviser and former contestant on "The Apprentice," appeared on an episode of TLC's "Say Yes to the Dress" that hasn't aired yet. But she didn't do it for free. The gig earned her a wedding dress, custom veil and accessories worth $25,000, according to her financial disclosure forms. 8. Peter Navarro hit the speech circuit Economist Peter Navarro, the head of Trump's trade council, scored a number of paid speaking gigs in the past year. He cast a wide net. Navarro made $10,500 for a keynote speech to the Casket & Funeral Supply Association of America after the election in November. He also earned $10,000 for a speech to the Captive Insurance Companies Association in March 2016 and received $7,500 for a talk delivered to the Metals Services Center Institute in January 2016. -- CNN's Theodore Schleifer contributed reporting to this article.

Many of the forms, which detail employees’ income and holdings when they arrived at the White House, are long and convoluted. That’s what happens when you have a lot of money. The documents provide only a snapshot in time. Administration lawyers who monitor compliance with federal conflicts of interest laws have advised staff members to resign from outside positions and sell certain assets. The divestment process is still underway. Still, the disclosures provide a window into some of President Trump’s closest advisers. 1. The Trump White House is very, very wealthy Trump has filled the White House with advisers who raked in millions of dollars last year. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income. Their assets combined could exceed $700 million. (The disclosure forms generally require employees to list dollar amounts in ranges, such as $100,000 to $1,000,000.)

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Exclusive  ⋮  Hardware EXCLUSIVE: Upcoming NVIDIA GTX 1080 “11Gbps” Cards Unlock to Full GTX 1080 Ti With BIOS Flash By Mikey Apr 1, 2017 321Shares Share Tweet Submit NVIDIA is known for wanting to maintain its performance dominance over AMD at all costs, so to help ensure this, they have done something very special for their loyal customers. Just a few days ago, we reported that NVIDIA will be releasing a faster version of the GTX 1080 with 11Gbps speed memory in April, the same as that found on its bigger brother, the GTX 1080 Ti. Now, our sources at NVIDIA (who wish to remain anonymous for obvious reasons) have told Wccftech that Founders Edition GTX 1080 11Gbps graphics cards bought directly from NVIDIA’s geforce.com website, are really full GTX 1080 Ti cards in disguise. Related Cemu 1.7.4 Preview Shows Great Zelda Breath of the Wild PC Improvements These come with the full GP102 GPU instead of the cut down GP104 GPU and the full complement of 11GB video RAM. The only visual difference will be that the cooler will show “GTX 1080” and not “GTX 1080 Ti”, a mere cosmetic difference only. Out of the box, they will work just like a GTX 1080, with the same performance and power usage. Additionally, the video driver will also identify them as a GTX 1080. However, by simply flashing them with the video BIOS of a Founders Edition GTX 1080 Ti, the full performance will be unlocked! The video driver will then identify them as a GTX 1080 Ti. Advertisement Note that this will not work on an older GTX 1080 with 10Gbps memory, but will brick it instead – you have been warned. With this simple trick, it means that a GTX 1080 Ti can be had for just $500 rather than the full $700 that they normally go for, a cool $200 saving for loyal NVIDIA customers. Related GameStop Leaks Destiny 2 Expansions Schedule and more As if competing with NVIDIA wasn’t difficult enough for AMD, they will now have a very tough act to follow if they are to establish graphical dominance over NVIDIA with their upcoming Vega-based graphics cards, or to just compete with them on a reasonably level playing field, like they managed to do with Ryzen against Intel. Wccftech will be buying one of these cards and trying this out with an article on this soon, complete with benchmark performance results. Finally, we have heard rumors that NVIDIA are planning something similar with Founders Edition GTX 1060 “9 Gbps” cards really being GTX 1080s with just a BIOS flash required to unlock them. We’re currently investigating this and will let you know soon, so look out for a forthcoming article about these on Wccftech.

John McCainJohn McCainMcCain: Trump is nothing like Reagan Trump makes little headway filling out Pentagon jobs McCain: Nunes 'killed' opportunity for bipartisan investigation into Russian interference MORE (R-Ariz.) on Sunday slammed Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), saying the House Intelligence Committee chairman "killed" a bipartisan effort to investigate Russia’s interference in the presidential election. “If we're really going to get to the bottom of these things, it's got to be done in a bipartisan fashion. And as far as I could tell, Congressman Nunes killed that,” McCain told host Martha Raddatz on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” Nunes caused an uproar last month when he publicly announced that a source had revealed intelligence documents to him that suggested information had been incidentally collected from Trump transition members during a broader intelligence probe. Nunes made this announcement before briefing his committee or its top Democrat, and then he proceeded to the White House to brief President Trump on his findings. Last Monday, it was revealed that Nunes went to the White House for a meeting the day before he met with Trump, leading some to allege Nunes is attempting to cover for the president by justifying his unsubstantiated claims that the Obama administration "wiretapped" Trump Tower. ADVERTISEMENT McCain on Sunday emphasized the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on congressional intelligence committees to get to the bottom of security-related investigations. “[T]he fact is that these committees, especially intelligence committees, and armed services committees, we work closely together as Republicans and Democrats. We have to. It's for the good of the security of the nation and the men and women who serve us,” the Arizona senator, a frequent Trump critic, said. McCain praised Sens.

McCain, however, lamented that the parties are divided over the investigation. “This is obviously a schism between the Republicans and Democrats, let alone the odd fashion in which all of this happened,” McCain told Raddatz.  Tags Richard Burr John McCain Mark Warner Sunday shows   View the discussion thread.

The Sunshine State is ground zero for transmissions of the mosquito-borne virus that happen on American soil. While the vast majority of people infected with Zika caught it while traveling abroad, all but six of the 222 confirmed cases acquired within the United States have been in Florida. The other six cases were acquired around Brownsville, Texas. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) visited Miami-Dade County officials on Monday to evaluate preparations in the weeks and months leading up to Florida’s balmy rainy season, when mosquito populations boom. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, has an incident manager coordinating the federal response from the agency’s Atlanta headquarters.  ADVERTISEMENT The Zika virus first made landfall in the United States last year in the Miami-Dade area, where infections were traced to four neighborhoods in Hialeah and Miami Beach. Local, state and federal officials sent hundreds of people to the city to monitor and contain the mosquito-borne virus, which died down as the winter months took hold.  “We learned a lot last year. The Florida experience in particular was very helpful in learning how to deal with local transmission,” said Denise Jamieson, chief of the CDC’s Women’s Health and Fertility Branch and the official in charge of the CDC’s Zika response. “We learned a lot about how to designate and communicate about areas of risk.”  Preparations for this year’s mosquito season have involved a dramatic expansion of the Miami-Dade County Public Works and Waste Management Department. Gayle Love, a senior division director at the department, said her agency is in the process of hiring 42 new employees, including a medical entomologist.  “After we responded to the Zika challenge, we just kept going,” Love said in an interview. “After last year, we saw the level of intensity that was required for our response.” The department last year hired 200 temporary employees and contractors to spray chemicals meant to kill mosquitoes around the Miami-Dade area. This year, they will hire more contractors, and the agency is already monitoring 130 traps set up throughout the county. If those contractors find any more than 10 female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in a trap, they will spray the area to contain the population. “Mosquito season has peak activity in summer and rainy months,” Love said. But now, she added: “We consider it a year-round problem.” Public health officials say they expect Zika to spread more broadly in Florida this year, where only a small number of cases occurred last year. There are likely to be fewer cases in Puerto Rico after the island was hit hard last year, when more than 38,000 people were infected. Once someone contracts the Zika virus, they are immune from contracting it again.  “We expect fewer cases in places like Puerto Rico because a proportion of the population was infected and is less susceptible,” Jamieson said.  Miami officials said fighting the Zika outbreak had already cost the county more than $23 million. The state of Florida has reimbursed the county for $18 million in costs. The Florida Department of Health said last week it had tested more than 13,000 people for the Zika virus throughout the state. State legislators added $2.6 million in funding for mosquito control programs around Florida. Those programs are seeking another $3.8 million in state funding. Sens. Marco RubioMarco RubioMeet the actors in the Russia drama Health officials brace for return of Zika Democrats go for broke in race for Tom Price's seat MORE (R-Fla.) and Bill NelsonBill NelsonHealth officials brace for return of Zika Conservative group targets red-state Dems ahead of Supreme Court vote Overnight Regulation: Senate panel approves Trump's Labor pick MORE (D-Fla.) have introduced federal legislation to give small businesses access to federal disaster relief money if they are impacted by Zika’s spread. The bill would also fund a Department of Health and Human Services program to respond to public health emergencies.  The CDC and Florida officials say they will work to let pregnant women know of any Zika hotspots that pop up, like the four that emerged last year. And CDC is working to speed laboratory testing times, while adding capacity to registries that track those already infected by the virus. Those registries are mostly populated by people infected abroad. So far this year, Miami-Dade officials have identified 29 new Zika cases. Officials said only two of those cases were contracted through local transmission in Florida, both of whom were likely infected last year. Tags Bill Nelson Marco Rubio   View the discussion thread.

Prepared by the NPO Development International (DI), the study rated the legal compliance, affirmative practice, and transparency of 1,909 companies’ anti-human trafficking and slavery-related disclosure statements of 2016. The law in focus: the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (CA-TISCA). The companies subject to this law include U.S. as well as foreign companies with a combined global revenue of $48.4 trillion in 2016. In the interactive webinar, DI’s principal investigator Dr. Chris Bayer and DI’s analyst Jesse Hudson are joined by former UN Goodwill Ambassador Julia Ormond, founder and president of the Alliance to stop Slavery and End Trafficking (ASSET), which was instrumental in passing the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act (2015).

Flynn's initial disclosures, which he submitted in mid-February, were made public as part of a White House release of financial disclosures of 180 White House officials. However, Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner said that his client had only just commenced the financial disclosure filing process at the time he was leaving the White House. "He filed a draft form explicitly listing his speakers bureau contract, and he expected to engage in the usual process of consultations with the White House Counsel's Office and OGE (Office of Government Ethics) regarding what he was expected to disclose. That process was suspended, however, after he resigned. When the White House asked him this week to complete the process and to itemize the specific speaking events, he did so," CNN quoted Kelner as saying. The disclosure forms revealed that Flynn had made earned about USD1.5 million last year and received USD 827,055 in salary and bonus from his firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. He had disclosed a speaking engagement for a Russian TV network in the form but did not specify the amount he got received for it. U.S. President Donald Trump has urged former national security advisor Michael Flynn to "ask for immunity" in the investigation into his Russia links, saying the probe is a witch hunt by the Democrats and the media. "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!," the President tweeted. Flynn is reportedly seeking immunity from prosecution in exchange for agreeing to testify about alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump's Presidential campaign. Flynn, who played a crucial role in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was asked to resign after it became public that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence on conversations he had before moving into the White House, regarding sanctions on Russia with Sergey Kislyak, the Kremlin envoy in Washington. Flynn, in his resignation letter, wrote that he "inadvertently" briefed top officials with incomplete information regarding his call with the Russian ambassador. He had initially denied discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador Kislyak during the transition, and Vice-President Pence also defended him in front of the media.

File photo of Michael Flynn. Reuters The first form, which he signed in February before he resigned, does not directly mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia, the New York Times said in the report citing the disclosure forms released on Saturday. The second, an amended version, lists the names of the companies that made the payments under a section for any non-government compensation that exceeds $5,000 "in a year". That list appears to include all of the work that Flynn, a retired three-star Army general, has done since leaving the military in 2014, without providing compensation figures for any of it. No reason was given for the discrepancy between the two forms. The Russia-linked payments were detailed in a letter released in March by congressional investigators, and included a $45,000 speaking fee from RT news network, for a speech in 2015 in Moscow. During the same trip, Flynn attended the network's lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting near Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, the disclosure forms showed income of nearly $1.5 million, a sizable amount for a man who left the military less than three years ago, the New York Times reported. Flynn reported an income of $1.37 million to $1.47 million.

Flynn's initial disclosures, which he submitted in mid-February, were made public as part of a White House release of financial disclosures of 180 White House officials. However, Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner said that his client had only just commenced the financial disclosure filing process at the time he was leaving the White House. "He filed a draft form explicitly listing his speakers bureau contract, and he expected to engage in the usual process of consultations with the White House Counsel's Office and OGE (Office of Government Ethics) regarding what he was expected to disclose. That process was suspended, however, after he resigned. When the White House asked him this week to complete the process and to itemize the specific speaking events, he did so," CNN quoted Kelner as saying. The disclosure forms revealed that Flynn had made earned about USD1.5 million last year and received USD 827,055 in salary and bonus from his firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. He had disclosed a speaking engagement for a Russian TV network in the form but did not specify the amount he got received for it. U.S. President Donald Trump has urged former national security advisor Michael Flynn to "ask for immunity" in the investigation into his Russia links, saying the probe is a witch hunt by the Democrats and the media. "Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!," the President tweeted. Flynn is reportedly seeking immunity from prosecution in exchange for agreeing to testify about alleged links between the Kremlin and Trump's Presidential campaign. Flynn, who played a crucial role in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was asked to resign after it became public that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence on conversations he had before moving into the White House, regarding sanctions on Russia with Sergey Kislyak, the Kremlin envoy in Washington. Flynn, in his resignation letter, wrote that he "inadvertently" briefed top officials with incomplete information regarding his call with the Russian ambassador. He had initially denied discussing sanctions with the Russian ambassador Kislyak during the transition, and Vice-President Pence also defended him in front of the media.

And that could open the door for Apple, which according to a new report, is readying a major upgrade for the iPhone 8 that could catapult it into the lead. 3D sensors in the iPhone 8 could enable killer AR apps. Credit: Gabor BaloghMore 3D sensors in the iPhone 8 could enable killer AR apps. Credit: Gabor Balogh According to Barron's Asia, a Morgan Stanley report says Himax Technologies will be supplying 3D sensing components for the iPhone 8. By creating a sense of depth, the device would be able to deliver augmented reality experiences. MORE: iPhone 8 Leak Reveals Surprising Design, New Name The sensors could enable all sorts of applications, wrote Morgan Stanley's Charlie Chan, including facial recognition, gesture sensing 3D modeling and photo shooting enhancements. But he said that 3D modeling has the greatest potential, as it can be used for AR and VR apps like gaming and virtual social networks. The key difference between Himax's wafer level optics and bulkier cameras like Intel's RealSense 3D camera is that the former is small enough to more easily fit in smartphones. Another report in Business Insider in early March said a 3D component in the iPhone 8's camera would allow the device to interpret distance. That would help the phone determine where to overlay virtual elements on your real-world view. More recently, Bloomberg reported that an AR-equipped camera on the iPhone would let you snap a photo and use depth sensing technology to alter the depth of the captured image; you would also be able to change the depth of specific objects in photos. You might also be able to isolate and tilt objects in a photo or overlay virtual objects onto photos. The iPhone 8, which could be called iPhone X or iPhone Edition, likely won't be unveiled until September, but other rumored features to look forward to include wireless charging and an overdue OLED display.

The first form, which he signed in February before he resigned, does not directly mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia, the New York Times said in the report citing the disclosure forms released on Saturday. The second, an amended version, lists the names of the companies that made the payments under a section for any non-government compensation that exceeds $5,000 "in a year". That list appears to include all of the work that Flynn, a retired three-star Army general, has done since leaving the military in 2014, without providing compensation figures for any of it. No reason was given for the discrepancy between the two forms. The Russia-linked payments were detailed in a letter released in March by congressional investigators, and included a $45,000 speaking fee from RT news network, for a speech in 2015 in Moscow. During the same trip, Flynn attended the network's lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting near Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, the disclosure forms showed income of nearly $1.5 million, a sizable amount for a man who left the military less than three years ago, the New York Times reported. Flynn reported an income of $1.37 million to $1.47 million. The bulk -- $827,055 -- came from the Flynn Intel Group, the consulting business he founded after being pushed out as the chief of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014.

Follow @UPROXX Follow UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In Comey's Terrifying Testimony On Russia And Trump The Senate Intelligence Committee Has Rejected Michael Flynn’s Immunity Bid In The Russia Investigation Kimberly Ricci 03.31.17 3 days ago 8 Comments Facebook Twitter EMAIL Getty Image On Thursday, Michael Flynn made a shameless bid for immunity in exchange for his testimony on Trump-Russian ties. Friday morning saw President Trump back up one of his Top 3 bad-hire decisions, but Flynn still hadn’t received a bite from either the FBI or Congress on his offer. That is, until now. The Senate Intelligence Committee has rejected the immunity offer, via a senior official who spoke with NBC News. So, Flynn will still undoubtedly be called to testify, but it’s probably gonna have to happen under subpoena. At least where the Senate is concerned, Flynn won’t have the benefit of immunity, which (sadly for him) is a concept that he heavily criticized in light of a Hillary Clinton aide’s partial immunity during the private email server probe. Here’s the word from NBC: The Senate Intelligence Committee turned down the request by former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s lawyer for a grant of immunity in exchange for his testimony, two congressional sources told NBC News. A senior congressional official with direct knowledge said Flynn’s lawyer was told it was “wildly preliminary” and that immunity was “not on the table” at the moment. A second source said the committee communicated that it is “not receptive” to Flynn’s request “at this time.” No dice from the Senate, although the House Intel Committee may feel differently — god only knows what madcap Devin Nunes will do, especially since he’s likely colluding with the White House. Then again, Nunes says he’s already arranged for Paul Manafort to testify with no mention of immunity, and Manafort’s woes are just as bad (if not worse) than that Flynn’s facing. How will the FBI decide on Flynn’s bid? He’s not likely to get a deal there, especially because he already lied to the FBI once about discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Director James Comey could always surprise, but with the Turkey lobbying news, the paid speeches in Russia, and plenty of other Flynn-associated dirt rolling around, the odds don’t look to be in his favor.

Profile By: ak3647 03.31.2017 @ 2:18 PM Looks like both Flynn and Manafort’s only hope might be to fall on their swords and hope Trump is grateful enough to pardon them in exchange for their loyalty. If it ends with just Flynn and Manafort going down in flames, maybe Trump can survive this. If the investigation turns up solid dirt on Kuschner or others, it’s going to be very very very difficult to argue that it’s just a coincidence that so many members of Donald Trump’s inner circle were secretly working with the Russians totally independently of each other and without him knowing anything about it.

See Offers News Posted Yesterday at 4:00 AM increase font size Flynn disclosures amended to clarify consulting income An earlier draft did not reveal payments tied to Russian entities. By Matea Gold, sari horwitz and Rosalind S. HeldermanThe Washington Post Share Comment Read Article Before resigning under pressure as President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn submitted a personal financial disclosure form to federal ethics officials that failed to note speaking fees he received from Russia-related entities in 2015, new filings show. Flynn later noted the payments on an amended form he signed Friday that listed among his sources of income the Russian government-backed television network RT, a U.S. air cargo company affiliated with the Volga-Dnepr Group and the U.S. subsidiary of Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab. Michael Flynn Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The White House released both sets of the forms Saturday as part of a broad release of documents detailing the financial holdings of top administration officials. Flynn’s initial form was submitted to the Office of Government Ethics and the White House on Feb. 11 – just days before he was forced to leave his post amid controversy over his contacts with Russia’s ambassador. On the document, he noted that he received fees through a speakers bureau, but he did not detail the names of the organizations that paid to have him as a speaker. A person familiar with his filing said Flynn’s initial form was a draft that would have gone through the usual process of review and revision in consultation with the White House Counsel’s Office and the Office of Government Ethics. However, that process was suspended when Flynn resigned. In recent days, White House officials asked him to finish the process and advised Flynn that he needed to itemize each organization that paid to have him as a speaker, the person said. Flynn first acknowledged in a July interview with Yahoo that he had been paid for the December 2015 RT event in Moscow, where the retired Army lieutenant general sat with Russian President Vladimir Putin during a celebration for the network. He later confirmed to The Washington Post that the network provided his payment. The U.S. government has said that RT, which receives Kremlin funding, is part of an array of propaganda outlets that help popularize a pro-Russian perspective through the media. It was not until earlier this month that Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, disclosed new documents showing that Flynn had also been paid in 2015 for speeches in Washington by Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Kaspersky Government Security Solutions. In all, Flynn earned at least $1.3 million in the past year, including more than $827,000 through his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, his disclosure shows. Flynn’s amended filing included a dollar figure for an October speaking engagement paid for by Ibrahim Kurtulus, a former official with the Assembly of Turkish American Associations, a U.S.-based nonprofit. In his original form, Flynn included Kurtulus on a section of the form that requires officials to name all their sources of income exceeding $5,000 over the previous two years. He omitted Kurtulus, however, in another section of the form requiring more specific disclosures for income sources in the last year. In the amended form, he disclosed that he was paid a $10,000 speaking fee by Kurtulus in October 2016. The Daily Caller reported that Flynn met with Kurtulus and another activist, Hilal Mutlu, a cousin of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, that same month. At the time, Flynn’s firm was also being paid by a Dutch company owned by a Turk to undertake efforts favorable to the Turkish government. The amended form details several other speaking engagements, including a $15,000 speech delivered to conservative activist David Horowitz’s Freedom Center and a $22,500 speech to Randall-Reilly Publishing Company. Flynn also reported that he was paid $14,454.20 to deliver a speech to BlackDuck Software in October, just weeks before the election. BlackDuck’s website shows that Flynn spoke about the government’s vulnerability to computer hackers. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

According to documents released by the White House on Saturday, the former official listed speaking engagements to Russian entities, including the Kremlin-funded RT TV and Volga-Dnepr Airlines. A financial disclosure form signed by Flynn on March 31 revealed this information. An initial form was submitted to the Office of Government Ethics and the White House in February and just days before Flynn was ousted from his post amid controversy over his contacts with Russia's ambassador. However, the process of review and revision of the first form in consultation with the White House Counsel's Office and the Office of Government Ethics was suspended when he resigned. In those documents, he noted that he received fees through a speaker’s bureau, but he did not state the names of the organizations that paid to have him as a speaker. In recent days, officials at the White House asked him to finish the process and advised him to itemize each organization that paid him. Early in March, Rep.

The disclosure forms show that Flynn earned at least $1.3 million in the past year, including more than $827,000 through his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group. Flynn was forced to resign in February from his position as Trump's first national security adviser after it was revealed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the US in late December. The conversation, which took place before Trump’s inauguration, centered around lifting then-President Barack Obama’s sanctions against Russia. Any discussion of sanctions at that time would have amounted to a breach of US law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy. The FBI, as well as the Senate and House intelligence committees, are investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and any possible ties between Trump's associates and Moscow. Flynn has been in discussions with congressional investigators on receiving immunity from “unfair prosecution” in exchange for agreeing to testify about ongoing probes into possible contacts between Trump's election campaign and Russia.     KeyWords White House Flynn disclose   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News US will tackle North Korea alone if necessary: Trump Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner makes surprise visit to Iraq South Korea, Japan, US start 3-day joint exercise on Korean Peninsula China, Germany urge US to respect int’l trade rules Arkansas to rush executions due to expiring lethal drug Judge to Trump: No protection for speech inciting violence 86% of Trump counties earn less per year than 27 White House staff Flynn failed to disclose income from Russian entities: White House US-Russia relations possibly worse than Cold War: Kremlin Trump grants Pentagon greater warfighting control amid more deployments in ME war zones Most Visited 86% of Trump counties earn less per year than 27 White House staff Trump grants Pentagon greater warfighting control amid more deployments in ME war zones Flynn failed to disclose income from Russian entities: White House Judge to Trump: No protection for speech inciting violence Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner makes surprise visit to Iraq South Korea, Japan, US start 3-day joint exercise on Korean Peninsula Arkansas to rush executions due to expiring lethal drug US will tackle North Korea alone if necessary: Trump www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0649 sec

Shortly after tweeting about a Fox News story that he felt supported his claim that Barack Obama had him under surveillance during the 2016 election, Trump tweeted his approval for the Times report, despite calling them a 'failing' publication. 'The failing @nytimes finally gets it - 'In places where no insurance company offers plans, there will be no way for ObamaCare customers to… use subsidies to buy health plans.' In other words, Ocare is dead. Good things will happen, however, either with Republicans or Dems,' Trump said in a pair of tweets. He was referring to the Times story, Obamacare Choices Could Go From One to Zero in Some Areas, according to The Hill. Shortly after tweeting about a Fox News story that he felt supported his claim that Barack Obama had him under surveillance during the 2016 election, president Donald Trump tweeted his approval for a New York Times report on Obamacare Despite calling the Times a 'failing' news publication, Trump seemed to have approved of an article that detailed the struggles of Obamacare Trump was referring to the Times story: Obamacare Choices Could Go From One to Zero in Some Areas. The article highlights areas in the US that may eventually have no insurers that would offer Obamacare health plans as soon as next year The article highlights areas in the US that may eventually have no insurers that would offer Obamacare health plans as soon as next year. 'Humana announced that they'd be leaving the markets altogether next year. That means there are parts of Tennessee that will have no insurance options unless another insurer decides to enter,' the report said. But Trump also hinted at the possibility of working with Democrats to fix Obamacare in the future, which comes a week after the Republicans failed to repeal and replace Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Earlier this week, Trump lashed out at the Times and threatened to change libel laws in order to prosecute the newspaper for 'getting him wrong'. Trump was referring to a New York Post opinion piece alleging that the Times was biased against him and 'ethically challenged'.

Now worse!' But the Times immediately responded on Twitter, saying that the company never apologized.  'We stand by our coverage & thank our millions of subscribers for supporting our journalism,' the Times said.

Carolyn Kaster, AP Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Michael Flynn, President Trump’s first National Security Adviser who resigned after 24 days on the job, failed initially to disclose payments he received from Russian-linked firms, financial disclosure forms released by the Trump administration on Saturday reveal.  In the initial filing submitted in February, Flynn does not list payments from RT, the Russian state-owned television station or other Russian-backed firms. In an amended disclosure filed Friday, Flynn lists a number of Russian-backed companies - including RT - and notes he received speaking fees.  What is congressional immunity? In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn’s lawyer told the Associated Press that the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Play Video CBSN Lawmakers want Michael Flynn to testify without immunity Former national security adviser Michael Flynn is facing mounting pressure to testify about what he knows about possible connections between the ... Flynn has long been dogged by allegations of receiving money from Russia. In March, Democrats on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released documents in mid-March revealing Flynn was paid a fee $45,000 by RT for a speech in Moscow in 2015. At the GOP convention in July 2016, Flynn had denied Moscow had funded the RT speech, telling Yahoo’s Michael Isikoff that he “didn’t take any money from Russia, if that’s what you’re asking me.” “Well then, who paid you?” inquired Isikoff. “My speakers’ bureau,” Flynn said. “Ask them.” However, a speakers’ bureau is just an agency, a conduit for payments by parties interested in . Russia would have paid the speakers’ bureau, which would have taken its cut, and then passed on the rest of the payment to Flynn. Flynn attorney Robert Kelner told the Associated Press that Flynn’s first filing was a draft that normally would have been revised through a consultation between the White House counsel’s office and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. “Because he resigned, that usual consultation process was suspended. When the White House contacted him this week, and asked him to complete the process, he did so,” Kelner said, noting the second filing is the finalized version.

Flynn also disclosed a speaking engagement from a Turkish businessman. Since his high-profile departure from the Trump administration, Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., filed paperwork with the Justice Department formally identifying Flynn as a foreign agent and acknowledged his work for a businessman with close ties to the Turkish government. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said he didn’t believe Flynn’s lobbying work was known by the Trump administration during his tenure there. The bulk of Flynn’s income comes from his consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, Inc., where he is listed as the chairman. Upon joining the Trump administration, Flynn had said he would dissolve his companies, and his lawyer said he did shut down Flynn Intel in Nov. 2016. His financial disclosure forms reveal he had positions at 11 companies. Flynn also listed work as an FBI consultant. Flynn has been back in the headlines this week as the Senate intelligence committee has begun to hold hearings in its investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election. Flynn’s lawyer said Thursday that Flynn would be willing to testify if he was offered immunity - and Mr. Trump seemed to implicitly back that idea, calling the investigations a “witch hunt.” © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

The new disclosures contained two filings, one made last February and a second dated Friday. The earlier disclosure omitted payments to Flynn for three speeches that he made to Russian companies, while the second filing disclosed those payments. In response to questions about the differences in the filing, Flynn’s lawyer said the first filing included the speaking fees in bulk. He noted that the initial filing was a draft and was not followed by consultations with federal ethics officials because Flynn left the administration just days after turning it in. Flynn’s recent financial history, made available Saturday by the White House, comes amid his effort to win immunity from congressional probers in exchange for his cooperation with official inquiries into contacts between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016. The disclosures detail Flynn’s business and financial activities dating back to 2014, including 2015 payments from Russia’s state-supported television network and paid speeches to two other Russian companies. The filing includes the activities of Flynn Intel Group Inc., a consulting firm that he and partners set up in 2015. The company filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department, acknowledging that its lobbying work last year likely benefited the government of Turkey even as Flynn was advising Trump’s campaign. Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The two filings came more than a month after Trump asked Flynn to resign as national security adviser, saying he had misled the vice president about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition.

Imperial Valley News Heart of the Matter Imperial Valley News President Trump Restores Confidence in the American Economy Washington, DC - President Trump Restores Confidence in the American Economy: “We’re going to win economically; we’re going to win with the economy.” – Donald J. Trump BUILDING CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY: Since President Donald J. Trump’s election, economic indicators have responded with record confidence to his pro-growth agenda. Today, the National Association of Manufacturers released its Manufacturers’ Outlook Survey showing the highest level of optimism in 20 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up over 12 percent since Election Day 2016. The Weekly Gallup Economic Confidence Index turned positive shortly after the President’s election and has remained positive for 19 consecutive weeks. The Business Roundtable’s CEO Economic Outlook Index recently jumped 19 points, the largest jump since 2009. The National Association of Home Builders Confidence Index currently is at its highest level in 12 years. The Gallup Small Business Index reflects the most optimistic small business owners have been since July 2007. The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index recently soared to its highest level in more than 16 years. The American Dream Index recently rebounded to 100.5, up from a 12-month low point in December, the final full month of the Obama administration. EARLY PROGRESS: In just the first full month of President Trump’s Administration, the United States economy has already made promising strides in the job market. In February, the President’s first full month in office, the U.S economy created 235,000 new jobs. 58,000 new construction jobs were created. 28,000 new manufacturing jobs were created. In February, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent. In February, the U.S. labor force participation rose to 63 percent. In February, long-term unemployment in the U.S. fell by 49,000. IMPLEMENTING JOB CREATING POLICIES: President Trump is executing an agenda that favors the American worker. President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum creating the White House Office of American Innovation, which will implement policies and scale proven private-sector models to spur job creation. President Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and negotiations. President Trump initially signed a Presidential Memorandum to clear roadblocks to construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and recently his Administration formally approved the project. President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum declaring that the Dakota Access pipeline serves the national interest and is being prepared to be put into service. President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to help ensure that new pipeline construction and repair work uses materials and equipment from the United States. CUTTING GOVERNMENT RED TAPE: President Trump has quickly taken steps to get the Government out of the way of job creation. President Trump signed an Energy Independence Executive Order to help eliminate burdensome regulations on America’s energy industry. President Trump directed each agency to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to identify costly and unnecessary regulations in need of modification or repeal. President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated. President Trump directed the Department of Commerce to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers. President Trump signed legislation, House Joint Resolution 38, to prevent the burdensome “Stream Protection Rule” from causing further harm to the coal industry. President Trump ordered the review of the “Clean Water Rule: Definition of Waters of the United States,” known as the WOTUS rule, to evaluate whether it is stifling economic growth or job creation. PARTNER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR: President Trump has worked hand-in-hand with the private sector to get companies re-investing in America. Exxon Mobil Corporation announced a $20 billion investment in the United States, which will create more than 45,000 jobs. Charter Communications announced a $25 billion investment in the United States, and that it will hire 20,000 American workers in the next four years. Accenture announced the creation of 15,000 new high skilled jobs in the next four years and a $1.4 billion investment in training its own employees. Intel announced a $7 billion investment in a new factory in the United States, supporting over 10,000 jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced a $1 billion investment to modernize two plants in the United States, creating 2,000 jobs. General Motors announced plans to invest $1 billion in the United States, creating over 1,000 new jobs. Ford announced the cancelation of a plant in Mexico, while adding 700 jobs in Michigan. FOLLOWING THROUGH FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump campaigned on jumpstarting the economic engine of America so businesses could grow and Americans could get back to work. As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised “I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country.” As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised “we will make America the best place in the world to start a business; we’ll hire workers, and we’ll open factories.” As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised “we will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations, which are destroying our job-creation capacity.” Prev Next You are here:   Home News President Trump Restores Confidence in the American Economy Main Menu Imperial Valley News News About Us Copyright Infringements Privacy Policy Contact Us Sitemap Web Links Latest News Assemblymember Eduardo Garcia Introduces Breaking Barriers to Employment Legislation NetSpend Settles FTC Charges American Guild of Organists Agrees to Eliminate Rules that Restrict Competition among Members FTC Approves Final Orders Settling Charges That Used Auto Dealers Touted Inspections Without Disclosing That Some Cars Were Subject to Unrepaired Safety Recalls Imperial County Assessor Reminds Business and Personal Property Owners that their Annual Property Statements are Due Soon Most Popular News Chicken Noodle Soup product recall Latin American authors reshaping world literature Governor Brown Issues Proclamation Declaring Harvey Milk Day The President and First Lady’s Call to Action on College Opportunity President Obama on the Confirmation of Sarah Saldaña as Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Back to Top © 2017 Imperial Valley News

Ong also said that American firms based here would be affected if the administration led by US president Donald Trump were to punish Malaysia for its low production costs, The Sunday Star reported today. “Perhaps US president Donald Trump does not know there is a huge presence of American manufacturers in Malaysia such as Intel and Western Digital due to the low production cost here,” he was quoted saying. Ong said that 53 per cent of exports to the US were electronics produced by American companies based here, adding that the semi-finished products are then taken back to the US to be assembled there. “If Trump were to punish us for this, the American firms will be the ones dealt a severe blow,” he was quoted saying. It was recently reported that the Trump administration wants to find out countries and goods that are responsible for the US’ US$50 billion trade deficit. Malaysia was named as one of the countries that was “potentially involved.”                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysians unapologetic about joining Asia's Next Top Model Dr Vida confirms marriage over after three years McD’s spicy fried chicken runs out Siti Kasim vows legal action amid uproar over remarks on God Forest City’s Chinese buyers in limbo over developer’s penalty clause You are not our appointed moral guardian, Nazri tells Censorship Board MCA: Cabinet never discussed BN’s plan to take over RUU355 Pakatan to register as official coalition Despite false 'Allah' claim that cost half million, Bata to issue fresh shoe design WSJ: Former MP, navy chief among Malaysians who had stakes in North Korean firm Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Star-studded lineup in 'War Machine' Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles US backs out of Latam development fund in sign of policy shift Manhood in the age of Trump Trump touts Supreme Court pick Gorsuch in weekly address (VIDEO) Ferrari F430 once owned by Trump sells for US$270,000 Donald Trump’s parrot ― Roger Cohen Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

He dropped out of school to play video games — it worked out okay in the end. Follow him on Twitter and Instagram! Well, it's no longer looking like we'll have to wait until E3 2017 to find out what's in the box. A major gaming outlet recently visited Microsoft to take a look at Project Scorpio's internals, ahead of a planned exclusive blowout of coverage. Forza Motorsport 7 was utilized to showcase Scorpio's power, which we revealed recently has been planned for some time as a headline title to exemplify the power of the next Xbox. Forza Motorsport 7 will run at a 4K resolution on Project Scorpio, and if our information is to be believed, it'll look truly stunning. It looks as though Project Scorpio's specifications could be revealed as early as next week, potentially putting an end to long-standing debates over whether it would be using the latest Ryzen CPU tech from AMD, or something a little older. Specifically, we have heard Thursday could be the day all of this comes to pass, but take that with a pinch of salt for now. It looks as though Project Scorpio's specifications could be revealed as early as next week. Either way, Project Scorpio is slated to run at 6 teraflops (TF), putting it at a significant GPU advantage over the Xbox One, and its chief competitor, the 4.2 TF PlayStation 4 Pro. Project Scorpio ditches the Xbox One's ESRAM, picking up 12GB of GDDR5 memory, vs. the Xbox One's 8GB DDR3 and 32MB of static ESRAM. Developers will still have to optimize against the Xbox One's ESRAM, however, as games are not allowed to be exclusive to Scorpio by policy. All titles arriving on Scorpio (save for VR) will also be available on Xbox One, albeit with lower resolutions. We've also heard that Project Scorpio will sport an incredibly "compact" design, owing to advances in cooling. Considering Microsoft is known for cramming powerful hardware into small packages from its Intel-powered Surface tablets, it should come as no surprise that Microsoft is leveraging the full breadth of its industrial design team to make Scorpio as impressive as possible. For instance, we recently outed the fact that Scorpio will also sport an internal power supply, ditching the clunky power bricks of yesteryear. If you're anxious to find out what's next in store for team Xbox, the wait is almost over. Until then, hit the link below for a collection of every scrap of information we've gathered on Project Scorpio so far. Oh, by the way, it's April 2nd where I am, so no, this isn't an April Fool's joke!

Thats my main question i bet around 499USD or will they hit 599? :O the second question is, when will Sony realease its new console? Because Scorpion is too fast vs. Neo a.k.a. PRO so they will need to do something 1 11 hours ago Reply treymok I personally don't think they'll need to do anything this late in the generation. They have a two to one install base and are killing it with exclusives. Add in the fact that any exclusives Xbox gets will also be on PC and Scorpio being more for die hard Xbox fans without a PC and I doubt Sony is worried at all. -1 10 hours ago Reply peachy001 Agreed. Way to far ahead to care. -1 9 hours ago Reply frank pik This generation is already too far along to have a 3rd hardware revision this soon. I think we can expect a cheaper slim eventually but no "Pro" Pro. This may work even better because it will mix up timelines for full console releases so that MS and Sony aren't trampling on each others toes and give consumers more of a reason to buy both I think 0 9 hours ago Reply Zybch Frank Pik - Scorpio is basicallya new generation.  Its essentially the same 5x speed bump from the One, as the One was from the 360 (0.24tflops for the 360 to 1.3 for the One). 0 9 hours ago Reply Zybch What Day One goodies did you get other than a logo screenprinted onto the controller and an avatar thing? -1 9 hours ago Reply DJCBS *This isn't an April's. Missed the isn't ;) The Scorpio is shaping up to be quite appealing... What a pity the software experience has become utter sh*t in the last two major updates. -20 1 day ago Reply Avatar of Apathy Does anyone else not like missing the preview tile of the last app that was running anymore? I was trying to close a game last night and couldn't even tell it was still running in the background. 5 1 day ago Reply DJCBS That's exactly the thing that annoys me the most in the update. I had my cable box connected to the Xbox and several times I'd "minimise" the active tile to check the time or other info. Now not only I can't do that, I get no info whatsoever on the status of that tile, the f*cking ads are even bigger and the amount of wasted space grew even more. Then the Xbox app that had the ability to be used as a controler no longer has it. And then clicking the Xbox button not taking me immediately home but to that stupid side panel.   The people incharge of the Xbox UI are clueless on what they're doing and if they're using the "Beta testers" feedback for it, it's a good example of how terrible a job is done when you get a bunch of fanboys designing things for you. -10 1 day ago Reply Cryio Give feedback or upvote current feedback 3 20 hours ago Reply DJCBS Already did but as you might imagine, I don't have any faith that that pseudo-feedback works. 1 16 hours ago Reply Zybch I'm totally sure it makes no difference.  If it did  that god-awful NXOE UI update would never have happened. 1 9 hours ago Reply Paul Kinslow That definitely doesn't work for Windows mobile. Many heavily upvoted features or problems are ignored for months or years, even extremely basic ones, like blindly white background in quiet hours when phone is in dark mode, along with a hundred or more other things that would be easy to fix and the problem wasn't present in 8.1 0 1 hour ago Reply Loaf It Except with that live preview thing it's a laggy mess... You really don't even to know much about the app running..It's practically only 1 game can run at a time and maybe 1 or 2 apps alongside that.. You can always clock start on the app to see if it's open as well.. And the side panel is much better and quicker...Than going home... There is literally no reason to go home..It's much slower than just having the side panel... -1 15 hours ago Reply SilverSee That "stupid side panel" is the functional equivalent of the Xbox 360 Guide, which many of us missed terribly with the Xbox One. You can access it anywhere in game, instantly, with virtually all of the features that you used to have to go to the Home screen for.    2 14 hours ago Reply DougB541#CB Not at the cost of resources. I  barely go home now with the new guide and only manual close a game if its frozen or glitched. 1 1 day ago Reply Avatar of Apathy I think your resources comment just made the point of needing to see what is running in the background essential. I did like the fact that I could have an Edge in kind of a Windowed mode watching a video while looking at my home screen for things, but needing to see if a game that is online is closed and not using band with is a must for some. Hopefully it doesn't do this and I worried for nothing. I don't mind the new menu too much, though they should gave had the ability to double tap to go home and reversed the shortcuts instead of just taking one away. 0 1 day ago Reply mrpuny I'll play devil's advocate here.  Let me start with your last comment.  I suspect that the reason that Microsoft didn't just switch the behaviors (double tap on Xbox button to go home) is that for any gamers already used to bringing up things like the game DVR controls with the double tap, it would now be bringing them home.  I think Microsoft really had to break this behavior.  Now, to go home it takes the following taps: "Xbox button" -> "A" -> "A" (or left thumbstic to the right in place of the 1st "A").  Takes relearning if you want to go home, but that's by far the less time sensitive act. Second, once you're home, I think you can use the usual controls to see recently running apps and quit them if necessary, more or less like before. A third thing.  In regards to snapping, I think Microsoft has really had to rethink this in the context of being able to bitstream audio to support object based audio systems like Atmos.  Currently, the main focus is on supporting Blu-Ray audio, but I believe these object based audio codecs are working their way into streaming video,and in the future games and eventually new broadcast TV standards.  The thing is that these object based audio streams need to be bitstreamed directly to audio receivers, and that's fundamentally incompatible with how the Xbox One used to work;  it used to have a sound mixer in settings (gone with latest update) where it would decode the game/app/blu-ray audio streams, mix them together, re-encode if necessary and then output the combined audio.  However, that doesn't appear possible with these advanced audio codecs.  At least I'm not aware of any devices of any sort that can decode, mix, and reencode true advanced audio.  I don't know if that's a hardware limitation or a licensing limitation.  But without the ability to do that, it really negates snapping, and also limits the applicability of the current overlay tech.  So I can see why at least some of that has gone away - at least for the time being. 2 23 hours ago Reply Avatar of Apathy Ah, your first point makes perfect sense why they couldn't do it. I can see it being more of a pain to those who already used the double tab function. Like I said, I don't mind the new shortcut that much, it will just take some getting used to. On the snapping point, I wasn't actually taking about snap mode. I was referring to the app showing its preview mode when it is still running in the background. In the case of a Edge video, this would still be playing as you scrolled through the rest of your home screen. Still not a big deal to not have it, I just liked having it. I would love to have something to show me all current running apps in the background, like when I hold the back button on my WP or do the function on PC to show Windows open. 0 22 hours ago Reply mrpuny I misunderstood about the preview window.  Yes, I'm not quite sure why that's gone.  In part it seems like they wanted to modify the presentation to show things related like the games hub.  But I wonder if it also has to do with similar issues to the snap situation.  I'm trying to remember now - the audio would keep playing for the previewed app, wouldn't it?  If so, it's like a special case of snap mode where the system would have to be able to mix the audio with other sources, even if it's just the system sounds as the selection box moves around. (I'm focused on this issue with bitstream audio because last year when it was first talked about, there was a discussion on one of the AV podcasts I listen to about it, and one host in particular picked up on the fact that it would potentially have wide ranging effects on how the Xbox would work since it wouldn't be able to mix audio when outputting the bitstream.) 0 14 hours ago Reply steve anderson5 After all that it's pointless cos the lag is terrible gets worded each alpha ring are kids making the updates -1 20 hours ago Reply Chris Turek Just tap the guide button then double tap A. Super simple. 0 21 hours ago Reply Zybch And super redundant.  Being forced to press 3 times instead of once is frustrating and just makes stuff more different and difficult compared to the home buttons of EVERY smartphone and tavblet out there, you know, the ubiqutious devices people use everyday. All it does is make it more difficult to activate the MAIN function of the guide button, you know, the think its used the most for. 0 9 hours ago Reply Chris Turek Dude you're so upset over something so unbelievably trivial. If this upsets you this much, I don't think you should be playing video games in general. You might throw your controller at your TV 0 8 hours ago Reply Giddora The main function for the guide button has always, since the inception of Xbox, been to open the guide. 0 43 min ago Reply Chris Turek It still does that.

It pretty much guarantees that they dominate the news media between now and then. 3 1 day ago Reply onysi Not really. They did that with the first Xbox One and all went to *******. I blame that idiot who's now working for zynga. -1 12 hours ago Reply Zybch I think you're confusing the sneak peaks to the actual E3 reveal. That reveal was what sank the xbox one, with the TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, TV, games TV, TV, TV, DRM thing, and sony capitalized on it amazingly.  TV. -1 9 hours ago Reply Keith Wallace They can't seriously stick with pre-Ryzen cores, can they? For starters, the arch was a giant failure, and its cat cores are part of why this fast hardware refresh is needed. That, and it is not a well-cooled arch, so it makes a lot of sense that Ryzen's vastly improved TDP would be present in a compact device. I don't see how a low profile cooler and a Bulldozer-based CPU run cool. On top of that, going with pre-Ryzen (Kaveri?) would mean a CPU bottleneck no one wants to see. A compromised console sold as the "premium" device would be met with a lot of negative press, I imagine. Personally, Ryzen 3 at the heart would be sensible. Though early announcements are always fun, this might be risky as well. If MS hasn't secured some magic, unknown games for E3, not having Scorpio to unveil could lead to a pretty light conference. 2 1 day ago Reply Giddora Or, they could leverage the increase in GPU power to accelerate the calculations and not need a faster CPU. 0 19 hours ago Reply Keith Wallace If it were as easy as just "oh, make the GPU do it," then PGU computing would be the default act of developers. It's not, and expecting them all to just jump at the first thing MS says is not rational. 0 16 hours ago Reply Giddora It is not hard to put more of a games mechanics on the GPU... Almost all games are more dependant on the gpu than the cpu today and that will only continue, so the difference in getting a faster cpu is NOT the big differentiator here. -1 16 hours ago Reply Keith Wallace It's certainly not the end-all, be-all, but it will matter. Threading is becoming more and more heavily used in games as well, but it doesn't make it universal--plenty still have some struggles on Ryzen because it osn't clocked as high as Kaby Lake (or even Skylake). However, one thing that Ryzen tests sure showed is that onc you get up to 4K resolution, the strain is MUCH greater on the GPU than CPU, so that's obviously where the majority of the hardware commitment needs to be. I am really interested to see what the setup is on his console though. Does it have a dedicated graphics card? Is it a high-end Raven Ridge chip? Is it Excavator or Ryzen? Is it Polaris or Vega? 0 15 hours ago Reply Giddora Of course, but what I am saying is a lower powered cpu will not hinder the gaming prowess of the machine. 0 15 hours ago Reply Keith Wallace Rather, it MIGHT not. It depends on how cut down that CPU is. Like I said, it SHOULDN'T be a problem for 4K gaming, but given how compromised the Xbox One hardware is (as evidenced by the development of Scorpio and presence of things like variable resolutions and unstable framerates on the current hardware), I'm not going to assume anything on the console hardware front. Really, I just hope they allow for internal drive swapping, SSD support, and don't sell it with a 5400 RPM laptop HDD like they sadly do with the XB1 and PS4. 1 12 hours ago Reply Zybch And it needs a 4-6Tb option.  2tb like the top model One S simply is too small for serious gamers, espeially when 4K textures start being used (4 times the size of 1080 ones). 0 9 hours ago Reply Sin Ogaris That's not exactly how textures work, you don't have "4k textures". Merely different sizes, generally in ratios of 2. So 1024x1024, 512x512, etc. You are right though, larger textures are going to take up more space. 0 8 hours ago Reply Sin Ogaris Actually no, if you are into PC gaming at all you would know that they state on the box (or steam page) whether they are more CPU dependant or GPU dependant. We are on a time where physics processing is getting more and more advanced and this is a function that is handled by the CPU. 0 8 hours ago Reply I Switch from PS4 to Scorpio Another article on this site states that Scorpio is capable of streaming 4K/60fps gameplay, playing a game while streaming in 4K is heavy on the CPU, that's something the Jaguar CPU won't manage. I'm sure it's going to be Ryzen, but obviously we only know for certain when the Scorpio specs are revealed. 0 18 hours ago Reply treymok I read 4K DVR. That's not the same as 4K streaming. 0 9 hours ago Reply I Switch from PS4 to Scorpio You should learn how to read. 4K streaming is mentioned in the article, more than once. 0 8 hours ago Reply Antonio Ponton1 AMD and Microsoft have worked together to create custom Ryzen,Vega silicon. 0 14 hours ago Reply Keith Wallace Source? 1 12 hours ago Reply kenzibit Damn! this is as solid as my ****! -6 1 day ago Reply Telling the truth It would explain the use of Vega and Ryse and the incredibly compact design, since Vega is also about to be fully revealed next week, very soon...

It is not a new console generation.  Like Sony has said form the very beginning with their own PS4 Pro,  Phil (Microsoft) has also reiterated so many times my head hurts, the Scorpio is a Premium device and part of the current generation of consoles.  So, if a PS4 Pro is still accepted as this generation (with it's  more memory, faster CPU, 2.5 times the graphics processing, etc..) than just because the Scorpio just ups the ante even more than the PS4 Pro doesn't make any more next gen (whatever that means now).  0 1 hour ago Reply Guest_aotf 3 - PS4 has more games, way more exclusive and upcoming exclusives announced. 4 - More diversity in games -1 7 hours ago Reply CarolinaChief Well of cousre it will start out high b/c there are obviously people out there that will buy it at maximum retail when it first comes out, while the smarter ones wait 6 months or so for the price drop!  I'm happy as anyone else is for Scorpio, but if X1 will still have all the same games there should be no urge to splurge if you already own the X1, right?  Just wait for it to come down in price, then go for it! 0 5 hours ago Reply Paul Josephson Problem is it will be a lot longer than 6 months before it drops in price.  Thinking otherwise is wishful thinking. Premium devices like the Elite controller didn't see any speical price change off list for a year and that was rare sighting even then and still is . And now at 18 months you can find places like Amazon that will sell it for a few bucks off but no big drop.  Expect the same here for a Premium device like the Scorpio. More likely you will see the Xbox One S drop over the next year.  If this new  console is a loss leader you are definitely going to have a longer wait and Microsoft knowing that this device is for particular set of gamers will keep an extermely tight control on inventory and not flood the market like PS4 and Xbox One S. Besides, if you are looking forward to 4K gaming why would you spend $60 for a 4K enabled game like COD 2017, Red Dead Redemption 2, Forza 7, Battlefront 2, etc... and worry about saving a few bucks much later on a device.  Seems silly.  Now if you aren't into 4K or hving higher quality 1080 games than waiting a year shouldn't be a problem. 0 36 min ago Reply Paul Josephson 1.   $499 or 467€​ is expected.  It true that is not that big of a price jump, especially for all around bump in the power and a 4KUHD drive included. 2. The majority of people are in the Windows ecosystem (which includes Xbox). 56 million PS4 vs over 460 million Windows 10 devices + 28 million Xbox Ones. Many of the current PS4 had a Xbox 360 (something like 35% current PS4 owners only owned a 360 last time).  So the jump to a Xbox if 4K interests you (especially if you a one of those 35% with BC involved). Not to mention the ease of getting 100+ game catalog with the new Gamers Pass subscription. Speaking for my own personal experience I know of at least 3 PS4 only guys (never owned any Xbox consoles)  excited to get their hands on a Scorpio (that is if it lives up to its promises)   0 51 min ago Reply Ron-F Ideally, the reveal would be done by a technical oriented site. More likely, it will be in an enthusiastic press site where editors will be drooling after whatever Microsoft show them without the critical point of view needed to really inform the readers. 1 19 hours ago Reply Bob Sled The readers need to know at what resolution their games will be rendered at (roughly) and the software surrounding the new console. They don't *need* to know what manufacturer of GDDR5(X) chips are on the GPU or really what processing power it has in floating point ops/interval. Specs are usually meaningless when games are optimized to play well for the platform. 0 18 hours ago Reply Ron-F I agree that most customers don't need to know the technical specs of their eletronics appliances. However, Scorpio is aimed first to the graphic oriented crowd, which Microsoft believes will be the first adopters. These guys appreciate to know those specs and, if they are impressive as I believe they are, Microsoft should release them as early as they can. 0 14 hours ago Reply Pappale those guys need will be fighting in the comment section. The main question will be 60FPS stable or not... do i need more? 0 11 hours ago Reply Apfel Schorle I'm not a fan of the internal power supply since it's after the APU the hottest part in the console. 1 18 hours ago Reply Bob Sled I have my doubts about the Scorpio having Zen arch... Ryzen was only launched Q1/17 and dev kits have been in developers' hands for well over a year at a guess; unless they had like for like performance chips internally then you'd probably see older chips. Nintendo was ridiculed for having 12 month old hardware in their Switch but dev kits must reflect what consumers will buy (else what's the point?) -2 18 hours ago Reply Paul Josephson That isn't exactly how early developer kits work for any console.  Both Microsoft and Sony release kits early that will run at relatively similar specs as planned not the expected SOC. Since the final spec are not really known for a device until 4-5 months out (when production begins) Early released devkits are more bout getting the API and other programming containtments ironed iron than having an exact copy of the device.   Kits are usually under powered PC equivlants devices. In fact, current developer kits (that were released recently) are still under powered compared to the final kit. And they will not be bumped to final specs until May/June.  0 1 hour ago Reply Wyther I'm very hyped about the new console.

Ivanka Trump and her husband, senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner, collected about $195 million in income, according to a new financial snapshot of about 180 of the men and women serving in Donald Trump’s White House. Other Trump aides with lucrative histories include Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn, the former president of banking giant Goldman Sachs, who netted up to around $75 million in the previous year. White House chief strategist Steve Bannon made up to $2.5 million. The financial backgrounds of Trump aides are detailed in new forms that disclose the assets that those aides held when they walked in the doors of the White House — before administration counsel advised them to resign from various postings, divest certain holdings or recuse themselves from future decisions. But the documents will nevertheless offer a portrait into the lives of several key White House aides, especially those who came from Wall Street or have other ties to the financial industry. Kushner, like Trump, a prominent real estate titan, held a position in 267 separate entities, ranging from the Trump transition team to dozens of property holdings in New York and New Jersey. Ivanka Trump, who just this week formally said she would join the West Wing after serving as an informal adviser to her father, has yet to file her own disclosure forms. But the White House said earlier on Friday that her documents would look largely similar to her husband’s. Bannon’s forms reveal numerous ties to various conservative organizations and sources funded by the family of influential Trump donors Bob and Rebekah Mercer, such as Breitbart News, which he led, along with Cambridge Analytica, a data firm used by many Republican clients. Other income sources for him are Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consultancy firm valued at as high as $25 million, along with Affinity Media Holdings, which could have awarded him capital gains of as high as $1 million last year. Bannon is also in the process of selling some of his stake in Cambridge Analytica and Glittering Steel, another Mercer-backed entity, according to the forms. Former national security adviser Michael Flynn made as much as $1.5 million last year. According to his financial snapshot, Flynn received $827,055 in salary and bonus from the firm, Flynn Intel Group, alone. The retired lieutenant general listed a speaking engagement for “RT TV” under “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” but does not specify the amount. CNN previously reported that Flynn, according to a top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, was paid more than $33,000 by RT, formerly Russia Today, Russia’s state-funded broadcaster, for a speech in Moscow in December 2015. The US intelligence community has long assessed RT to be a propaganda tool of the Kremlin, writing in its January report on Russian interference in the US election that the organization had participated in disinformation campaigns aimed at the US. The forms say Flynn received “compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year” from Russia-based air cargo company Volga-Dnepr Airlines and Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc. for speaking engagements in the US. The White House acknowledged in March that Trump’s transition team was aware Flynn engaged in work that would likely require him to register his consulting firm as a foreign agent before Flynn was tapped to serve as national security adviser. Flynn’s Justice Department filing last month raised questions when it revealed that Flynn’s firm worked on behalf of a Turkish-owned company, Inovo BV, to improve US confidence in Turkey’s business climate. Flynn Intel Group received $530,000 in payments from the company and acknowledged in its registration as a foreign agent that the work may have benefited the Turkish government.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 3 April 2017 by satprnews satprnews Research Report Covers the Microserver IC Market Forecasts and Growth, 2017-2027   A microserver is a small server appliance which is based on a system on a chip (SoC). Most of the server motherboard functions are integrated on a single microchip, except DRAM, boot FLASH and power circuits. Thus, the main chip contains more than only compute cores, caches, memory interfaces and PCI controllers. Microservers offers benefits such as low power and space consumption, distributed resources and scale out workloads that use large numbers of lightweight server nodes. Major application areas of microservers include media storage and Internet data center, especially for applications such as lightweight web serving, simple content delivery nodes, and low-end dedicated hosting. Request Report Sample@  http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-gb-2936 Market Overview: In recent years, microservers have emerged as a popular choice for small- to medium-sized businesses that need a server but not necessarily a full-scale rack or tower server. Additionally, microservers are adopted by enterprises that operate with minimal IT staff at local or branch offices. Presently, microservers are well positioned across an array of business sizes along with data centers and cloud companies, especially for those with specific functional or application requirements. Microservers market is in the nascent stage of growth and the current trend towards adoption of software-defined datacenters is expected to open potential opportunity for low-powered simple servers in large quantities. Market Dynamics: Major factors responsible for fuelling the demand for microservers are — growth of the web and online services, and increasing demand for computer systems that excels only some at specific tasks Visit For TOC@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/toc/rep-gb-2936 Currently, media storage is the biggest application area in terms of microserver adoption. Therefore, growth of microserver IC market is driven by factors such as continuous growth of digital content increasing popularity of video-on-demand (VOD) content, propagation of high-definition (HD) videos and various other interactive applications and the growth in user-generated content. Additionally, factors such as growth of cloud computing, big data, single application and dedicated high-scale consumers will boost the microserver IC market growth during the forecast period. Enterprises are allocating significant share of their budgets for microservers and an appreciable portion of these investments are expected to flow into the Microserver IC market. However, the growth of microserver IC market is expected to be hampered by factors such as limitations related to moderate computing capabilities, lack of standards, high cost and ambiguity about workload capacity and management. Limitations notwithstanding, microservers have made significant inroads in certain fields as their advantages have solidified. Market Segmentation: Microserver IC market is mainly classified on the basis of components, processor type, application area and regions.

Malaysia, which is also one of the countries that may be affected by the orders, said yesterday it was not responsible for any abuses that led to US’ trade deficits. In a speech over the weekend, an unidentified spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce said any American trade enforcement measures should comply with generally accepted international trade rules and differences between the two countries should be handled properly. “China is willing to cooperate with the United States on a basis of equality and mutual benefit,” the spokesperson added, in the speech released on the ministry’s website. Mr Trump signed two executive orders on Friday aimed at investigating possible abuses causing large US trade deficits and stopping import duty evasion. The move comes as Mr Trump prepares for his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this Thursday and Friday in Florida, where trade issues are set to be a central talking point, as well as North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had said that the executive order would result in analysts going “country by country, and product by product”, reporting back to Mr Trump within 90 days. Mr Ross alleged that the China is the “number one source of the deficit’’. ‘‘Needless to say the number one source of the deficit is China,” Mr Ross said, before listing more than a dozen other countries that are “potentially involved”, including India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. However, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang maintained the trade imbalance was mostly due to differences between the two countries’ economic structures, noting that China had a trade deficit in services. Malaysia yesterday also refuted the suggestion it had somewhat contributed to US trade deficits, with its International Trade and Industry Minister II Ong Ka Chuan saying Putrajaya is neither responsible for nor taking advantage of the matter. He cautioned that American firms based in Malaysia would be affected if the Trump administration were to punish the South-east Asian country for its low production costs. “Perhaps US President Donald Trump does not know there is a huge presence of American manufacturers in Malaysia such as Intel and Western Digital due to the low production cost here,” The Sunday Star quoted him as saying. Mr Ong said that 53 per cent of exports to the US were electronics produced by American companies based in Malaysia, adding that the semi-finished products are then taken back to the US to be assembled there. “If Trump were to punish us for this, the American firms will be the ones dealt a severe blow,” he added. mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most World READ COMMENTED ﻿From Trump’s Mar-a-Lago to Facebook, a national security crisis in the open ‘Zombie’ birds fall from sky in Moscow ‘You’re fat’ card prompts London police action ‘Wrong way down the highway’ driver arrested after US crash that killed six ‘Worst is over’ for Brazil’s meat scandal: Minister ‘Trouble’ if Dr M-Nazri debate proceeds: Malaysian police ‘Napalm Girl’ photographer retires after 51 years ‘Monster’ cyclone Debbie batters northeast Australia Yemen says it captures senior al Qaeda leader With US backtracking, China seizes chance to lead on climate Will New York City invite the ‘fearless girl’ to stay on Wall Street?

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: April 2, 2017 6:07 pm CPU RAM is an important component for a computers to store and retrieve data quickly. DDR5, the next-generation of RAM, promises twice the speed of the current-gen DDR4 memory. This has been revealed by JEDEC, the organization responsible for setting the standards of computer memory. Basically, the DDR5 (Double Data Rate 5) RAM should offer double the bandwidth and density of DDR4 RAM. It will also be faster and more power efficient due to improved channel efficiency. “As planned, DDR5 will provide double the bandwidth and density over DDR4, along with delivering improved channel efficiency. These enhancements, combined with a more user-friendly interface for server and client platforms, will enable high performance and improved power management in a wide variety of applications”, says JEDEC in a statement. Also read: Apple’s next-generation iPhones to include iPad-like True Tone displays JEDEC said work on the DDR5 standard is “moving forward rapidly”, and a final version of the standard is forcasted for 2018. So, consumers shouldn’t expect to get their hands-on DDR5 RAM until the year 2020.In contrast, DDR4 RAM was finalized in 2012, but didn’t become widely available until 2015. JEDED is also developing NVDIMM-P (Non-Volatile Dual Inline Memory Module Persistent), which “will be a new high capacity persistent memory module for computing systems.” This standard, too, is expected  in 2018. JEDEC will release more details about DDR5 RAM and NVDIMN-P in June at the Server Forum in California. CPU RAM is an important component for a computers to store and retrieve data quickly. However, SSDs are now slowly and gradually reaching the performance and latency of conventional memory. Intel recently released first-generation Optane drives that have about 10 times higher latency, they really aren’t quite there.

The first form, which he signed in February before he resigned, does not directly mention a paid speech he gave in Moscow, as well as other payments from companies linked to Russia, the New York Times said in the report citing the disclosure forms released on Saturday. The second, an amended version, lists the names of the companies that made the payments under a section for any non-government compensation that exceeds $5,000 “in a year”. That list appears to include all of the work that Flynn, a retired three-star Army general, has done since leaving the military in 2014, without providing compensation figures for any of it. No reason was given for the discrepancy between the two forms. The Russia-linked payments were detailed in a letter released in March by congressional investigators, and included a $45,000 speaking fee from RT news network, for a speech in 2015 in Moscow. During the same trip, Flynn attended the network’s lavish anniversary dinner and was photographed sitting near Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, the disclosure forms showed income of nearly $1.5 million, a sizable amount for a man who left the military less than three years ago, the New York Times reported. Flynn reported an income of $1.37 million to $1.47 million. The bulk — $827,055 — came from the Flynn Intel Group, the consulting business he founded after being pushed out as the chief of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2014. The rest included speaking fees and income earned for doing consulting work and sitting on corporate boards, such as that of Adobe Systems, which paid him $125,250. –IANS ksk/vt Tags forms network released report CanIndia New Wire Service Related Posts S.Korea, US, Japan set for joint drills Apr 3rd, 201703 Seoul, April 3 (IANS) South Korea, US and Japan will hold a combined naval exercise this week against...

Digital Trends Home > Computing > The Asus Zenbook UX370 is on its way, according to… The Asus Zenbook UX370 is on its way, according to recent FCC documents By Mark Coppock — March 29, 2017 2:54 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Your choice of Windows 10 2-in-1 will get just a little more difficult in the near future, if a recent FCC certification filing is any indication. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can be a hotbed of information on new and often unknown devices. Every gadget that utilizes the airwaves and might interfere with other gadgets has to make its way through the FCC eventually for testing and certification, and sometimes products hit the FCC before much else is known about them. One such machine appears to be the Asus Zenbook Flip UX370, an upcoming Windows 10 2-in-1 device that would replace the UX360. It appears that the Zenbook UX370 hit the FCC certification process and some interesting information has been uncovered, Liliputing reports. More: Asus may reveal a refreshed ZenBook Flip UX300-Series 2-in-1 in late February Up to now, we’ve known that the UX370 was going to be a “hero” device for Asus, taking its place as the company’s top 13.3-inch 360-degree convertible device. Judging by the specs of the current UX360, the next model is likely to offer a low-power seventh-generation Intel Core Y processor and will sport up to a QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) resolution display. We reported on the UX360 specs previously and here is a refresher to aid in speculation on what might arrive with the UX370: Screen size: 13.3 inches with Touch Screen resolution: 1,920 x 1,080 at 60Hz 3,200 x 1,800 Operating system: Windows 10 Home Windows 10 Pro Processor: Intel Core m3-6Y30 Intel Core m3-6Y54 Intel Core m3-6Y75 Intel Core i5-7Y54 Graphics: Intel HD Graphics 515 (integrated) Intel HD Graphics 615 (integrated) System memory: 4GB LPDDR3 at 1,866MHz (up to 8GB) Storage: 128GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD 256GB SATA 3 M.2 SSD 512GB SATA 2 M.2 SSD Webcam: HD web camera (facing) HD camera (back) Connectivity: Wireless AC (2×2) Bluetooth 4.1 Audio: 2x 1.6-watt speakers Digital array microphone Asus SonicMaster technology Battery: 54 Watt-hour Ports: 1x Micro SD card reader 1x Microphone/headphone combo jack 2x USB 3.0 1x USB 3.1 Gen1 Type-C 1x Micro HDMI Size: 12.71 x 8.66 x 0.54 inches Weight: 2.86 pounds with battery Some details apparently uncovered by the FCC documentation help to flesh out the machine. Interestingly, the machine would reduce the battery capacity from 54 watt-hours to 39 watt-hours. The machine might incorporate a fingerprint reader for Windows 10 Hello support. A second USB Type-C connection could be added for additional support of future peripherals. In addition, Asus should offer its battery-powered pen for Windows Ink support. A mini-dock could be provided with some configurations providing HDMI, USB 3.0, and additional USB Type-C connections. Intel’s Core U-series processors could also be on hand rather than the low-power versions, but that might cause some concerns if the battery capacity is indeed significantly reduced. There is no additional information on when Asus will release the Zenbook UX370. However, the fact that the machine is going through the FCC certification process implies that it could be arriving sooner rather than later.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Sen. Lindsey Graham Saturday faced down a hostile crowd of mostly Democrats and independents at a South Carolina town hall as he backed Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court. "There are Democratic members of the Senate who want to filibuster this guy," the third-term Republican said amid boos during the session at Trident Technical College in North Charleston. "You are taking the Senate down a very dangerous path. "Don't do it." The jeering grew louder as Graham continued. "So I will vote to report him out — and if I have to, I will vote to change the rules, because I am not going to allow President [Donald] Trump to be denied the same opportunity that every president has had for 200 years because you're mad and you can't accept the outcome of an election." By then, Graham could barely be heard over the crowd, which NBC News estimated at several hundred. He also vowed that the Senate would conduct a "bipartisan and fair" investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election, even though he admitted that recent developments surrounding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn were "getting weirder by the day." "We're going to follow the evidence and not let politics get in the way," Graham said. "We're going to talk about the Flynn deal," he then added. "It's getting weirder by the day, isn't it? Yeah." Graham said he wondered how Trump officials "missed" Flynn being a registered foreign agent for Turkey during the campaign — even poking at Flynn's comment in 2016 that those connected to Hillary Clinton who were seeking immunity were admitting their guilt to crimes. "Flynn said himself, 'If you want immunity, you must, you know, be guilty,'" Graham quipped. Regarding the House Intelligence Committee and its Russia investigation, he said: "Nunes. The House. They're off in a ditch." Graham was referring to Republican Chairman Devin Nunes, who was shown intelligence information privately on the White House grounds — data that the Trump administration apparently already had — but he told the president what he saw and not others on his committee. Democratic Vice Chairman Adam Schiff, as part of the committee, was also not shown the information. Both congressmen represent California. "I don't know who invited him to look at the evidence in the White House," Graham said, speaking of Nunes. "All I can say is, 'Why do you show it to the chairman of the Intel Committee if you've got it yourself?' "That never made sense to me. "Schiff and his buddies seem to be prosecutors about every other day on TV," he added. "I hope they can get their act together and start interviewing witnesses. "Whether or not it can be salvaged, I don't know. "But opening up the files to Schiff — whatever Nunes saw, Schiff should see — it should have been that way in the beginning. "So, I don't know if they're going to get their act together." Related Stories: 5 Weeks Left For Republicans to Roll Back Obama-Era Regulations Top Trump Aide Calls for Primary Challenge to Rep.
