But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the one gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 per cent to US$152.56 (RM650.29) in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top US wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of one gigabit speeds. Apple used two modem suppliers — and the same technique to mask performance disparities — for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers. The carriers will be able to boast about one gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic Co.’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year. Apple’s decision to introduce new technology when it wants, rather than chase whatever the market dictates, isn’t new. The original iPhone launched in 2007 without support for 3G networks, and it was still wildly successful. It wasn’t until 2012 that the iPhone supported LTE technology that’s the basis of 4G networks — a year after Samsung Electronics Co. added that capability to its smartphones. Still, Apple is dealing with a market that’s crying out for innovation to revive growth. Last year, the company’s revenue from iPhones, which generates more than 60 per cent of Apple’s US$216 billion annual sales, fell for the first time. Smartphone total market growth was just 2.5 per cent, breaking a run of double-digit annual surges, according to industry analyst IDC. Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. Achieving one gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world. Nonetheless, the first carrier to claim such network capabilities will get bragging rights and an edge at selling the promise of instantaneous movie downloads and high-quality live video. It’s one area where service providers can’t afford to be seen as laggards. Luring customers The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that’s 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first one gigabit data service available in the US this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started one gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of one gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of one gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three one gigabit capable phones available this year — with the exception of iPhones. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week E3 2017: Nintendo’s showcase — how to watch, what to expect Marissa Mayer fades out as Yahoo ends its run Microsoft challenges Sony with powerful new Xbox One X SGSecure app downloaded more than 550,000 times New iPhone said lacking tech to match rivals’ data speed (VIDEO) Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with borderless display could land by summer’s end Cracked screen woes?

Solar technology will destroy coal and oil as energy sources even if President Donald Trump stamps his feet, holds his breath and refuses to play with the rest of the world. Solar is on the same kind of Moore’s law–like path that has made computing power so cheap. Solar tech isn’t improving at computing’s breakneck pace, but it’s on a predictable, sustainable and impressive trajectory toward cheaper and better. By about 2030—13 years from now—solar will be able to produce electricity at half the cost of coal and lower than the cost of any carbon source. In that sense, the Paris Agreement on climate change is almost meaningless, addressing something technology and economics will take care of anyway. The big questions then become: Which part of the globe will emerge as the advanced-energy Silicon Valley, and which companies will be that industry’s version of Intel and Microsoft? If Trump’s decision to exit the Paris accord does anything, it will help ensure that those superpower regions and companies are not in the U.S. We’ll just end up being really good at mining coal nobody wants. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Cheaper, Cleaner The process of making solar panels shares traits with making microprocessors. In 1965, Intel’s Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors that could be crammed into the same-sized chip would double every 18 months. Essentially, it meant that manufacturers could relentlessly cram more capability into smaller spaces, so now the total amount of computing power that NASA relied on to get Neil Armstrong to the moon can fit in your Apple Watch. A similar dynamic makes solar panels better and cheaper: Technologists can constantly reduce the thickness of solar cells and use less silicon per watt, driving down manufacturing costs while increasing each cell’s efficiency. Engineering organizations have plotted solar technology trends since 1980, and the curve of improvement, as with Moore’s law, has not wavered. The U.S. Department of Energy—at least before Trump installed an anti–climate-science regime—showed that the price per watt of solar modules dropped from $22 in 1980 to under $3 today. When a utility builds a massive farm of solar panels in the desert—like the Topaz Solar Farm in California, with its 9 million photovoltaic modules—the cost gets down to just over $1 per watt. In late 2016, the cost of producing electricity with solar in ideal environments for the first time became cheaper than producing electricity by burning coal, according to the World Economic Forum. “Electricity cost is now coupled to the ever-decreasing price of technology,” notes scientist and author Ramez Naam. “This is profoundly deflationary. It’s profoundly disruptive to other electricity-generating technologies and businesses.” Of course, solar is also clean. You’ll cheer that if you believe burning carbon is contributing to climate change. If you don’t believe in climate change, who cares? You’ll still want the cheapest energy. Insisting on carbon-based energy will become as dumb as buying your music on CDs. A worker from Wuhan Guangsheng Photovoltaic Company works on a solar panel project on the roof of a 47-story building on May 15 in Wuhan, China. Harnessing sunshine is a high priority for China, which will pump $360 billion into advanced-energy technology over the next few years. Kevin Frayer/Getty Plus, solar won’t run out until the sun dies in about 5 billion years, and by then the species will be living on Planet Bezos in the Musk Solar System. About five days of sunshine provide as much energy as is contained in all proven reserves of oil, coal and natural gas. All we have to do is capture a smidgen of it, and we can power the world. Solar power raises the question of reliability—like, what happens when it’s dark? This is where battery technology comes in. Supersized batteries have also been on a constant price-reduction curve. This is a big reason electric cars have become so viable that just about every automaker is now developing them. In January, Elon Musk’s Tesla installed industrial batteries in California to help keep power flowing when the local utility had to deal with a leak in a natural gas storage facility. The cost and capability of the battery power surprised the state. “I had relatively limited expectations for the battery industry in advance of 2020,” Michael Picker, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, told The New York Times. “I thought that it would not really accelerate and begin to penetrate the electric grid or the transportation world for a while to come. Once again, technology is clearly moving faster than we can regulate.” Energy's Inevitable Future Add it up, and technology and raw economics—not policy or treaties—will soon make carbon replaceable. The sun will shine, solar panels will convert it to electricity, and excess power will get stored in batteries for nights and cloudy weather. On some days, California already gets 80 percent of its power from clean energy. Solar-generated electricity will fill up the batteries of ever more electric cars, reducing demand for gasoline. Carbon barons like the Koch brothers will face a demise not unlike the mustachioed railroad tycoons in the jet age. All of this will happen as surely as your hair will grow back after a close shave. So what’s the impact of Trump bailing out of the Paris thing? Probably that the advanced-energy Silicon Valley will be someplace where most people speak Mandarin. The Trump administration is betting on old energy. In January, China’s National Energy Administration said it would pump $360 billion through 2020 into advanced-energy technology. Already, the three biggest solar-makers are based in China. If advanced energy is where the money and jobs will flow, the U.S. already has some catching up to do—and our government just said we shouldn’t bother. Yes, these are profoundly difficult times for people and regions that have long depended on coal. But unless you’re Kim Jong Un or the Huli wigmen of Papua New Guinea, progress can’t be wished away, especially when the rest of the world goes on without you. The best thing that could happen to coal country is for the government to invest in creating advanced-energy jobs in those regions, much as it put NASA’s rocket-making facility in Huntsville, Alabama, in the 1960s, forever transforming that city. After Trump said the U.S. will get out of the Paris accord, Tyler White, the president of the Coal Association in Kentucky, commented, “This is a step to fulfilling some of the promises that he made." Maybe, but economic reality means Trump’s promise to coal country is like telling a kid that Santa Claus will keep showing up forever.

A penalty in the shopping-search probe could come within weeks and many expect it to exceed a $1.2 billion fine on Intel Corp. in 2009. That would be another show of strength by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who slapped Apple Inc. with a 13 billion-euro ($14.5 billion) tax bill in August. Google is a top priority case for her as European politicians and publishers push for action against the Mountain View, California-based company that’s come to dominate online advertising. “If there’s going to be a fine, it has to be the biggest ever,” said Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represents companies that have complained to the EU about Google. “The European Commission has strongly signaled that if there is going to be a fine it would need to be at a level that would have deterrent effect.” Timing on a decision could slip and Google representatives and the commission both remain tight-lipped, declining to talk about it. The company hasn’t yet met with regulators to discuss a potential EU order or how it might implement any changes, according to a person familiar with the probe, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Major Rulings But the EU has a long tradition of issuing major rulings just before officials quit Brussels for their summer break. Last July saw more than $3 billion in fines for truckmakers including Daimler AG and Volvo AB. With one eye on the impending decision, some Google officials have been getting ready, moving vacation dates or making sure they are close to the action, other people familiar with the probe said. Vestager “has a keen eye to maximizing the impact of any announcement on a case and July sees a slowdown in the news cycle,” said Christopher Bright, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels, who’s not involved in the Google probe. “Together with the advanced state of preparation of the case, this points to a July announcement for Google.” Vestager isn’t afraid of big numbers, setting records with the tax bill for Apple — which it’s appealing — and the cartel fine for truck companies. Facebook Inc. may have got off lightly with a mere 110 million-euro penalty for not providing correct information in the WhatsApp merger probe. Top Spot Intel holds the top spot for a monopoly abuse with a fine of 1.06 billion euros. That represented more than 3 percent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. As Alphabet Inc. pulled in $90 billion in revenue last year, any fine would be capped at $9 billion. But within that limit, the actual size of the fine would be calculated from sales in the market under investigation. Alphabet’s Google division generated $79 billion in ad revenue in 2016. While it doesn’t break out sales for shopping search advertising, ads from search provide most of its revenue. The EU also factors in how many years the illegal conduct lasted. Regulators say the systematic promotion of Google’s own shopping search started in 2008, allowing Google Product Search and Google Shopping grow more quickly than rival comparison-shopping services. A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. The Android investigation goes to the heart of what Google does in the mobile-phone space, questioning the strict terms Google places on phone makers and app developers to use the software it provides for free. Cash Pile While money matters, Alphabet has a cash pile of more than $92 billion as of March 31 and any changes to its business model ordered by the EU may “probably be of more significance,” said Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at Loyola University in Chicago. “I doubt this is going to hamstring the company but the commission is going to order what it thinks is necessary to give competition a chance,” he said. EU’s claims that Google Shopping results harm competition “are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,” general counsel Kent Walker wrote in a blog post last year. The EU’s case “rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online” because price comparison sites aren’t the only way to shop around. Google can appeal, which could take years. Microsoft only won a 4 percent cut to its fine. Intel has been waiting eight years for a final ruling. Vestager’s move against Google is sure to attract further criticism that she’s unfairly singled out U.S. companies. Transatlantic tensions are already on the rise after President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, adding to concerns over global trade. “We’re entering a period in the States where foreign competition enforcement against U.S.-based companies is going to be a matter of more public comment and criticism,” said Waller. “I think you’ll hear similar things” to the outcry over the Apple tax bill when the Google probe wraps up, he said. On the other hand, Vestager is under pressure in Europe from companies and politicians eager to see her punish Google. Complaints about Google continue to pour in to the EU, most recently from publishers about Android software. And new fronts could open; Vestager tweeted recently that she’d be playing close attention to Google’s new ad-blocking feature. For Google, there could be more summers like this.

Motherboard CMOS problem?   (#1) BigBlockTowncar Maha Guru     Videocard: Evga GTX970 SC Processor: Core i7 920 4.0ghz Mainboard: EVGA X58 Memory: Corsair Vengeance 12gb Soundcard: Asus Xonar ST PSU: Corsair TX850 SSD Failure? Motherboard CMOS problem? - Yesterday, 01:46 | posts: 1,782 | Location: USA So last night I was playing PUBG and I had got one of those load screen errors which is a known bug. I am unable to alt-tab or bring up the task manager so I did a reset. The computer boots up, POST, then got to the screen where it says "Verifying DMI pool data" then it tells me "Disk boot failure insert system disk and press key". I thought at that point that my SSD was having a problem. I reset the computer again and went into the BIOS. I noticed that my OS drive (Intel 520 SSD) was not even listed. I then powered down and restarted and went into BIOS again......the Intel SSD was listed as the 4th priority in the boot devices. Bringing the SSD back up to priority 1 allowed the system to start normally. This entire thing happened again today (with PUBG). Same results and fixes. I downloaded the Intel SSD toolbox and everything is at 100% (drive life SMART, etc....I also did the quick analysis and it appears to be fine). I do not suspect the drive to be having problems. Why would the BIOS continue to "forget" the boot disk order? Could this be a problem with the CMOS or possibly the SATA controller? I have experienced no other problems running anything else but I don't see how one application could cause this sort of crash.     BigBlockTowncar View Public Profile Find all posts by BigBlockTowncar     (#2) CalculuS Maha Guru     Videocard: 6950 Asus DC2U Processor: I7 920 4.1ghz 1.3v Mainboard: Asus P6T Deluxe Memory: 8GB DDR3 1600Mhz/CL8 Soundcard: Xonar DX PSU: EVGA 500W Yesterday, 02:24 | posts: 2,725 | Location: Netherlands I may be completely going on a limb but wasn't there an issue on x58 boards with not remembering settings?

Comey's hearing was the most dramatic testimony on Capitol Hill in years, featuring an ousted FBI chief accusing the sitting president's administration of lying about him and his former bureau. The hearing dominated discussion on television and in Washington this week, which the Trump administration planned to use to focus on its infrastructure agenda. Multiple House and Senate Intelligence committee members will take on the Sunday news show circuit this week to weigh in on Comey's bombshell testimony and the news that has unfolded since.  Sen. Dianne FeinsteinDianne FeinsteinDem: We need to investigate whether Lynch gave cover to Clinton campaign Feinstein: Sessions should come before Judiciary Committee Feinstein: Comey is not going to lie MORE (D-Calif) and Sen. Susan CollinsSusan CollinsSenate GOP sees path to ObamaCare repeal Republicans worry Trump too vocal Collins: Trump should give clear answer on Comey tapes MORE (R-ME) of the intelligence committee, and Rep. Louis Gutierrez of the House committees on intelligence and the judiciary will appear on CNN's "State of the Union." Feinstein has called for investigations into potential obstruction of justice after the testimony and Collins hasn't shied away from being critical of her own party or President Trump. Other lawmakers who will make appearances Sunday include Sen. Lindsey GrahamLindsey GrahamRepublicans worry Trump too vocal Schumer invites Trump to testify before Senate Graham: Trump could 'go down' because he can't stay quiet MORE (R-S.C.), who will likely defend Trump from accusations of obstructing justice with his conversations with Comey. On Thursday, Graham told CBS that if Comey was testifying, it means that special counsel Robert Mueller had decided against prosecuting Trump for obstructing justice. “Unless Mueller is a complete idiot, which he is not, he’s concluded there’s no obstruction of justice case because if he had concluded otherwise, Comey wouldn’t be testifying,” Graham said. Trump said Friday he is "100 percent" willing to testify under oath about his interactions with James Comey in order to dispute the fired FBI director’s claims. “One hundred percent,” Trump said when asked if he would give a sworn statement to Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russia’s election interference. "I would be glad to tell him exactly what I told you,” the president said during a press conference in the White House Rose Garden. In his first comments since Comey's dramatic testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, Trump accused the ousted FBI chief of making false statements about their private conversations. Senate Minority Leader Chuck SchumerCharles SchumerSunday shows preview: Senate Intel members talk Comey testimony Senators debate bringing in Comey for Round 2 Dems play hardball on Russia sanctions MORE already criticized the president's response to the testimony and will be appearing on "Face the Nation" Sunday.  Schumer on Thursday criticized Trump for saying Comey lied under oath, and said that if Trump wanted to dispute the testimony he should release his purported recordings of his meetings with Comey. "It's awfully curious that no one from the president's team will either confirm or deny the existence of the tapes when the tapes are the only way to prove that Mr. Comey's testimony, which came under oath, are false or misleading," Schumer said Thursday. Another critical voice of the president making the rounds Sunday is fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. His appearance on ABC's "This Week" is one of his first since being fired and it would not be a surprise if he weighed in on the legal case for obstruction of justice.

But that won't be the case for Apple Inc.'s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company's most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device -- in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple's suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won't be ready for the iPhone's introduction, according to people familiar with Apple's decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent to $152.56 in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm's chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it's seeking to loosen Qualcomm's grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That's why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won't enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn't public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple's decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers -- Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. --- The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that's 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year -- with the exception of iPhones. <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 워싱턴포스트 다른기사 보기 페이스북 이메일 웹출판 :   2017-06-11 10:30   관리자 입력.편집 :   2017-06-11 10:27   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 유시민 황교익 '김무성 노룩패스' 풍자 합작 [사설] ‘현중 노사협상’ 촉구 나선 전국시도의장협의회 '46억원 배임 혐의' 유섬나 구속 이상우♥김소연 결혼식 사진 공개 6·10 기념식 간 文, '이한열 사진' 선물 받고 '광야에서' 열창 유시민 황교익 '김무성 노룩패스' 풍자 합작 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

A penalty in the shopping-search probe could come within weeks and many expect it to exceed a $1.2 billion fine on Intel Corp. in 2009. That would be another show of strength by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who slapped Apple Inc. with a 13 billion-euro ($14.5 billion) tax bill in August. Google is a top priority case for her as European politicians and publishers push for action against the Mountain View, California-based company that’s come to dominate online advertising. "If there’s going to be a fine, it has to be the biggest ever," said Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represents companies that have complained to the EU about Google. “The European Commission has strongly signaled that if there is going to be a fine it would need to be at a level that would have deterrent effect.” Timing on a decision could slip and Google representatives and the commission both remain tight-lipped, declining to talk about it. The company hasn’t yet met with regulators to discuss a potential EU order or how it might implement any changes, according to a person familiar with the probe, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Major Rulings But the EU has a long tradition of issuing major rulings just before officials quit Brussels for their summer break. Last July saw more than $3 billion in fines for truckmakers including Daimler AG and Volvo AB. With one eye on the impending decision, some Google officials have been getting ready, moving vacation dates or making sure they are close to the action, other people familiar with the probe said. Vestager “has a keen eye to maximizing the impact of any announcement on a case and July sees a slowdown in the news cycle,” said Christopher Bright, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels, who’s not involved in the Google probe. “Together with the advanced state of preparation of the case, this points to a July announcement for Google.” Vestager isn’t afraid of big numbers, setting records with the tax bill for Apple -- which it’s appealing -- and the cartel fine for truck companies. Facebook Inc. may have got off lightly with a mere 110 million-euro penalty for not providing correct information in the WhatsApp merger probe. Top Spot Intel holds the top spot for a monopoly abuse with a fine of 1.06 billion euros. That represented more than 3 percent of Intel’s $37.6 billion in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10 percent of yearly sales regulators can impose. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up As Alphabet Inc. pulled in $90 billion in revenue last year, any fine would be capped at $9 billion. But within that limit, the actual size of the fine would be calculated from sales in the market under investigation. Alphabet’s Google division generated $79 billion in ad revenue in 2016. While it doesn’t break out sales for shopping search advertising, ads from search provide most of its revenue. The EU also factors in how many years the illegal conduct lasted. Regulators say the systematic promotion of Google’s own shopping search started in 2008, allowing Google Product Search and Google Shopping grow more quickly than rival comparison-shopping services. A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. The Android investigation goes to the heart of what Google does in the mobile-phone space, questioning the strict terms Google places on phone makers and app developers to use the software it provides for free. Cash Pile While money matters, Alphabet has a cash pile of more than $92 billion as of March 31 and any changes to its business model ordered by the EU may “probably be of more significance," said Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at Loyola University in Chicago. "I doubt this is going to hamstring the company but the commission is going to order what it thinks is necessary to give competition a chance," he said. EU’s claims that Google Shopping results harm competition "are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics," general counsel Kent Walker wrote in a blog post last year. The EU’s case "rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online" because price comparison sites aren’t the only way to shop around. Google can appeal, which could take years. Microsoft only won a 4 percent cut to its fine. Intel has been waiting eight years for a final ruling. Vestager’s move against Google is sure to attract further criticism that she’s unfairly singled out U.S. companies. Transatlantic tensions are already on the rise after President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, adding to concerns over global trade. "We’re entering a period in the States where foreign competition enforcement against U.S.-based companies is going to be a matter of more public comment and criticism," said Waller. "I think you’ll hear similar things" to the outcry over the Apple tax bill when the Google probe wraps up, he said. On the other hand, Vestager is under pressure in Europe from companies and politicians eager to see her punish Google. Complaints about Google continue to pour in to the EU, most recently from publishers about Android software. And new fronts could open; Vestager tweeted recently that she’d be playing close attention to Google’s new ad-blocking feature. For Google, there could be more summers like this.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Intel Intel is preparing to spoil everyone else’s fun Chris Mills @chrisfmills June 10th, 2017 at 12:00 PM Share Tweet Intel, comfortably the largest manufacturer of desktop processors, is no stranger to throwing its weight around to protect its core business. It has spent years fighting a massive $1.2 billion fine from the EU for violating anti-trust law to shut out AMD, its only real competitor. Now, in a new blog post, Intel seems to be quietly warning companies like Microsoft and Qualcomm not to even think about using emulation to run proper Windows 10 on mobile-style processors. Don't Miss: Elon Musk goes full Trump to defend Tesla’s fake founding myth Intel published a blog post that’s meant to celebrate 40 years of x86, the Intel-designed architecture that powers Intel’s CPUs, and allows Windows to run. Buried deep in the post is a not-very-veiled threat to any company thinking of making an emulator, which would let x86 software (like Windows 10!) run on a non-x86-processor, like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon mobile CPUs: “Intel carefully protects its x86 innovations, and we do not widely license others to use them. Over the past 30 years, Intel has vigilantly enforced its intellectual property rights against infringement by third-party microprocessors…However, there have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel’s proprietary x86 ISA without Intel’s authorization…we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel’s intellectual property rights.” This is a direct response to an announcement that Microsoft and Qualcomm made at Computex two weeks ago. In the announcement, the companies said that support for Windows 10 on the Snapdragon 835 would be coming later this year, using emulator software. Asus, HP and Lenovo have all agreed to make devices using Qualcomm’s chipset, so this is no joke. In theory, a Windows 10 PC running on Snapdragon would have much better battery life and efficiency than an x86 processor, which is why phones can last all day on a comparatively tiny battery. Intel knows this, and rather than trying to build a product to compete, it just wants to sit in the way and roadblock everything. Aren’t patents fun!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Future Intel Corporation Xeon Processors to Include Machine Learning Acceleration Chipzilla's machine learning strategy is quite broad. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 10, 2017 at 12:00PM At a recent investor conference, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich offered significant insight into the company's view of -- and strategy to win in -- the market for chips that handle artificial intelligence/machine learning workloads. Krzanich started by noting that artificial intelligence and machine learning (I'll refer to these as simply "machine learning" from here on out) represent a relatively small part of the overall data center market today, but acknowledged that it's the quickest-growing data center workload. Moreover, Krzanich even said that, over the long term, Intel expects it to be the largest workload within the data center. Image source: Intel. "Where will it end [up]? Will it be 25% of the workload? 50% of the workload? There's debate, there's debates out there; it's going to be large, so we get it," Krzanich said. With that background in mind, let's dig into what Krzanich had to say about the company's approach to this market. Casting a wide net "We don't think one solution is going to solve this problem," Krzanich said. He then went on to point out Intel's strategy vis-a-vis machine learning based on the different markets/applications. For the automotive market, Krzanich indicated that the power envelopes that chips targeted at this market need to operate in are right and power efficiency is critical. "In a car, you need to be three, four, five watts, and you need to have -- you know, the holy grail is a 1 teraflop-per-watt type of application," Krzanich explained. Teraflop is short for "trillion floating point operations per second." Generally speaking, the larger this number is for a given level of power consumption, the more efficient (and thus better) the chip is. For the automotive market, the company is betting on its recent acquisition of Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) to produce products capable of exceeding 1 TFLOPs/watt "faster than [its] competition." On the theme that one-size-doesn't-fit-all, Krzanich pointed to the company's acquisition of a company called Movidius to handle machine learning/computer vision in applications where power consumption is measured in the "milliwatt range." "So, if you're a robot or a drone or something like that, we have those solutions," he said. Although Intel's machine learning strategy with respect to the automotive, drone, and robot markets is certainly interesting, investors are certainly going to be most interested in the company's data center-oriented machine learning strategy. Another wide net With respect to data center-oriented machine learning solutions, Intel is -- as it is doing for machine learning more broadly -- casting another wide net. Krzanich highlighted the broad portfolio of solutions that the company hopes to bring to bear in this market, including its standard general-purpose Xeon processors, its FPGA technology, and the machine learning-specific technology that it got with its purchase of Nervana. While Intel seems to be quite interested in building specialized chips for these workloads, Krzanich made it clear that the company plans to integrate specialized silicon designed to accelerate machine learning workloads into its bread-and-butter general-purpose Xeon processors. "What you're seeing is because machine learning and artificial intelligence is just linear algebra, you're seeing things like [tensor processing unit] come into play -- those are accelerators," Krzanich said. "They're basically little [application specific integrated circuit] engines that allow you to do this math in a very fast way." Krzanich then said that there are "many accelerators" and noted that investors will see Intel "start adding those [accelerators] into [its] basic Xeon processor[s]." Foolish takeaway Intel is clearly taking the market for machine learning applications seriously, as evidenced by the company's rush to build a broad portfolio of technologies to properly address it. We'll see in the coming years whether Intel's strategy of casting a wide net allows it to maintain its dominant positioning within the machine learning market works and capture a large part of the growth that comes in the future.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Science & Health Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones iPhone 8 will miss this important feature you probably won't notice until it's too late We've been hearing so many great things about the iPhone 8, but it looks like it will miss a key feature to stay ahead of the trend. Sami Khan   June 10, 2017 16:54 IST Apple's iPhone 7 as seen on its official websiteApple It is a tough battle for smartphone makers, especially the ones on the top as their dominance is threatened by several newcomers. Apple is placing a lot of faith in its iPhone 8's success considering the amount of research and money spent on its development. You won't be wrong to think the tenth-anniversary edition iPhone will be flawless, but here's something you really need to know. Everyone's talking about the visible upgrades the iPhone 8 will bag, such as the OLED display with integrated Touch ID sensor, revamped design, wireless charging and more, but little do they know about the core specs, which translate towards better performance of the phone. As the reliance on mobile devices increases, people want to do everything on their smartphones and OEMs are making sure that works just fine. It is important to stay connected to the internet to perform most tasks, so chip makers Qualcomm and Intel are ahead of their game to bring high-speed networks on the phone. Qualcomm has succeeded in a way to deliver maximum download speeds of 1Gbps with its Snapdragon X16, while Intel is lagging behind with its XMM 7480's 600Mbps limit. Apple has a partnership with both chip makers and it is fair to think that the iPhone maker will choose the best for its flagship smartphone this year. But if you've been following Apple's courtroom battles lately, (no, not with Samsung or Nokia), then you'd know about the brutality of the legal quarrel over royalties. If you haven't already guessed, there's a high possibility the iPhones coming this year won't use Qualcomm's X16 modem entirely and also procure some of the Intel XMM7480 modems to follow its strategy to never rely on a single supplier. Like last year, Apple will likely throttle the speeds of Qualcomm modems to match that of Intel modems, inside sources told Bloomberg. This means users won't experience the high-speed downloads on their brand new iPhone even though rival phones like Samsung Galaxy S8, Sony Xperia XZ Premium and HTC U11 readily offer them. Owing to the ongoing differences between Qualcomm and Apple, the Cupertino tech giant is reportedly planning to cut ties with the chip maker. Intel is keeping up with Qualcomm as it recently announced its new XMM 7560 modem in February, which matches the gigabit speeds of Qualcomm. But as Bloomberg sources pointed out, Intel's new chips won't be ready in time for iPhone 8's production. In reality, achieving 1 Gbps is only possible in ideal conditions with LTE Advanced and compatible towers. Apple's reason behind ditching Qualcomm's chipset could be the lack of an appropriate setup. But U.S. carriers – Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint – have declared 2017 as the year of 1 Gbps speeds. So, there's a good chance iPhone 8 will not be a part of any wireless telecom marketing stints this year. A gigabit modem, as irrelevant as it may be for consumers, is a crucial addition to a flagship smartphone. If Apple is going after its rival Samsung with full force, it better make its armour impenetrable. We can already imagine the kind of mockery Apple will be subjected to by the likes of HTC and Samsung for lagging behind their flagships. For now, we can simply assume Apple has some trick and pulls a rabbit out of its digital hat to surprise everyone. There's still time. Stay tuned for updates.

The company detailed various new products set to launch in 2017 which compete against CPUs and graphics cards from Intel and Nvidia respectively. Following the launch of its Ryzen desktop platform, AMD has gained market share among desktop users due the price-to-performance ratio of the processors. It plans to continue its growth with more products aimed at a wide range of consumers, from gamers to professional users. Threadripper and EPYC AMD’s latest addition to its high-end desktop CPU line-up is the “Threadripper”. Based on the company’s Zen architecture, the Threadripper boasts an impressive 16 cores with 32 threads. The Threadripper chips should be priced lower than 10-core Intel chips like the Core i7 6950X. The company also previewed its upcoming EPYC processor for data centres. These CPUs are primed for enterprise applications and features four 8-core chips on a single package, connected using AMD’s Infinity Fabric technology. This amounts to an enterprise processor with 32 physical cores and support for 16 DDR4 channels. Intel is also looking at updating its high-end desktop CPU line-up with rumoured Core i9 processors. These chips could boast up to 12 physical cores with 24 threads, according to reports. Ryzen Pro mobile chips In addition to its new desktop processors, AMD also revealed a new Ryzen Pro processor line-up aimed at mobile and commercial markets. AMD’s commercial desktop Ryzen Pro chips will launch in the second half of 2017, while its mobile Ryzen Pro chips will release in 2018. Ryzen mobile processors will aim to provide superior performance while decreasing power consumption and improving laptop battery life. Desktop Ryzen chips currently do not have integrated graphics, but AMD announced that its mobile processors will include integrated Vega graphics. The company said its Zen-based mobile chips would boast a 50% increase in CPU performance and 40% improvement in graphics performance over Intel’s 7th-gen mobile chips. Intel’s HD Graphics currently offer users with 6th-gen and 7th-gen processors high-end video playback features and support for lightweight gaming. Vega graphics Desktop graphics cards based on the Vega architecture are also set to launch this year, and the company has already released a professional card based on the new technology. The Radeon Vega Frontier Edition is a Radeon Pro GPU aimed at professional consumers. The card boasts 13 TFLOPS of single-precision floating point performance and 16GB of HBM2 memory. It is aimed for use in intensive applications like deep learning, ray tracing, and video processing. Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 10-series graphics cards use GDDR5X VRAM, while AMD’s upcoming Vega cards are expected to use HBM memory – which boasts higher bandwidth. AMD has gained back some fans with the launch of its Ryzen processors, and it is looking to build on that momentum with its new processor and graphics products.

The iMac Pro was perhaps the most impressive announcement at WWDC this year; it promises to be the most powerful computer Apple has ever made when it arrives in December. The $4,999 starting price will leave many eyes watering, but the iMac Pro is packed with extremely powerful hardware and sports a beautiful display. Because of its design, size, specs, and price, it will go head to head with the Microsoft Surface Studio, the most comparable Windows PC. The most expensive Studio configuration (which is what PCMag reviewed) comes in at $4,199, so even the base iMac Pro is a pricier proposition. Which one is best for you? Operating system is the obvious difference, and you'll have to wait to get your hands on an iMac Pro, but there are several other key differences between the two to consider. Name Apple iMac Pro Microsoft Surface Studio   Lowest Price %displayPrice% %seller% $4999.00 MSRP %displayPrice% %seller% $2999.00 MSRP Editor Rating   Processor Name Intel Xeon Intel Core i7-6820HQ Processor Speed 4.5 GHz 2.7 GHz Operating System Apple macOS High Sierra Windows 10 Pro RAM 32 GB 32 GB Storage Capacity (as Tested) 1 TB 2 TB Graphics Card AMD Radeon Pro Vega 56 Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M Screen Size 27 inches 28 inches Resolution 5120 x 2880 4500 x 3000 Storage Type SSD HDD, SSD   Read the Review Read the Review Examining the specs, Apple's desktop does have a power advantage, with more recent (and generally faster) components. We dinged the Surface Studio for not having the most cutting-edge components at the time of launch, and the iMac will already had an advantage by coming out after the Studio. On the other hand, the Studio's innovative design—namely the reclining touch-screen display—might be more to your liking, and offers new avenues to creatives for systems of this type. To get more specific with the specs, let's first take a look at the most visible aspect—the displays. They make up almost the entirety of both machines, and the Studio was clearly inspired by the design of past iMacs. Both have extraordinary, better-than-4K resolutions, albeit at different aspect ratios. The Studio's 28-inch screen features a 4,500-by-3,000 resolution, while the iMac Pro's 27-inch screen is 5,120 by 2,880 (the same as the 2015 27-inch iMac). The brightness has improved on all new iMacs, and it now supports one billion colors. Quality-wise, the screens are just about a wash, as you'll hardly be left complaining about the resolution on either device, and they both support the P3 color gamut. That said, there's a huge departure when you consider the Studio's touch capability, which is an area Apple simply refuses to go with its computers. Touch—combined with ability to recline the Studio like a digital canvas—gives the Studio much more versatility for content creation, as discussed in depth in our review. If you only draw or design in programs with a mouse, touch may not be needed—but the inclusion does expand your future options. Streamlining the creative process from separate (and expensive) drawing tablets into one device can be very appealing if you're a digital artist. In terms of computing power, though, the iMac Pro has the Studio beat. Apple is positioning the iMac Pro as a true workstation, and its Xeon CPU backs up that claim. The base model includes an 8-core processor and 32GB of memory, which will be lighting fast. As stated, the Surface Surface Studio was slightly behind at launch—it lacks a newer Kaby Lake chip, though its Intel Core i7-6820HQ Skylake CPU is still fast. Compared side by side, though, the iMac Pro will be much more capable at quickly crunching through data, encoding video, and general multitasking. The iMac's powerful AMD Radeon Vega graphics really set it apart, as well: These (still somewhat mysterious) cards from AMD are meant to compete with Nvidia's top Quadro cards, so there should be tremendous 3D capability packed within the iMac Pro. The Studio does have discrete graphics, but its Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M, while capable, is not on the same level. The iMac Pro has a leg up in gaming, where these cards typically come into play the most, but that's not the target iMac Pro buyer. As a workstation, high-end graphics cards are for video and photo editors, animators, graphic designers, and more, as they accelerate rendering and load times in many of these processes. The Vega card will also be VR capable, something Apple pushed at WWDC, while the Studio's card is not. The two desktops are fairly similar in terms of port offerings—they both include USB 3.0, SD card slots, and Ethernet—but the Studio offers mini DisplayPort for video output and lacks any USB-C connectivity. The iMac Pro doesn't include mini DisplayPort, but USB-C is more versatile with adapters and is generally more useful for transferring media and other files. Related Buy a New Apple iMac or Wait for iMac Pro? Buy a New Apple iMac or Wait for iMac Pro? An important note is that the Studio configuration we tested comes with 2TB of storage, while the base iMac Pro only has 1TB. Overall, there's no doubt the iMac Pro packs more powerful, newer hardware than the Studio. It does so at a higher price, and is launching about half a year later, but the advantage remains nonetheless. That said, the Studio offers a whole realm of options the iMac does not thanks to its touch screen, making it more than just a speedy desktop. It can streamline the process of separate drawing tablets and other devices into one product thanks to its pen, the Surface Dial, and touch screen. The operating systems are of course another major distinction, but if that's not a restricting factor, the iMac Pro is the choice for pure power, while the less expensive Surface Studio can be your desktop and digital creation tool in one.

But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device -- in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent to $152.56 in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers -- Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Apple used two modem suppliers -- and the same technique to mask performance disparities -- for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers. The carriers will be able to boast about 1 gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic Co.’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year. Apple’s decision to introduce new technology when it wants, rather than chase whatever the market dictates, isn’t new. The original iPhone launched in 2007 without support for 3G networks, and it was still wildly successful. It wasn’t until 2012 that the iPhone supported LTE technology that’s the basis of 4G networks -- a year after Samsung Electronics Co. added that capability to its smartphones. Still, Apple is dealing with a market that’s crying out for innovation to revive growth. Last year, the company’s revenue from iPhones, which generates more than 60 percent of Apple’s $216 billion annual sales, fell for the first time. Smartphone total market growth was just 2.5 percent, breaking a run of double-digit annual surges, according to industry analyst IDC. Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. Achieving 1 gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world. Nonetheless, the first carrier to claim such network capabilities will get bragging rights and an edge at selling the promise of instantaneous movie downloads and high-quality live video. It’s one area where service providers can’t afford to be seen as laggards. Luring Customers The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that’s 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast: Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year -- with the exception of iPhones. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The “world’s most popular open source robot for education and research” has received a major upgrade with two modular TurtleBot3 models from Open Robitics that run Linux and Robot Operating System (ROS) on a Raspberry Pi 3 (“Burger”) SBC or Intel Joule COM (“Waffle”). The dual-wheel Turtlebot 3 is smaller, cheaper, simpler, and more powerful than the discontinued TurtleBot 1 and still available, Clearpath Robotics built TurtleBot 2. The latter runs on a Linux- and Intel Core i3-4010U based HP netbook instead of a compute board. TurtleBot3 Burger (left) and TurtleBot3 Waffle (click image to enlarge) The TurtleBot3 was built by Robotis, and the project is maintained by Open Robotics, a taxable subsidiary of the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF). Open Robotics also maintains the open source ROS stack that runs on the other TurtleBots as well as scores of other robots and drones. Other collaborators include Intel, which contributed the Intel Joule module and Intel RealSense cameras, and Onshape, which supplies its “full-cloud” 3D CAD editor for working with the TurtleBot’s open source 3D CAD files. The TurtleBot3 is “the most affordable robot among the SLAM-able mobile robots equipped with a general 360-degree LiDAR,” says Open Robotics. The TurtleBot3 Burger kit sells for $549, including the Raspberry Pi 3, and the larger TurtleBot3 Waffle kit sells for $1,799 including the Intel Joule. The TurtleBot2 sells for $2,115 fully assembled.

LiDAR is the advanced pulsed laser location technology that enables SLAM. Both models integrate 360-degree HLS-LFCD LDS planar LiDAR systems, enabling autonomous navigation. The Waffle’s Joule module also offers Intel’s RealSense depth-finding camera, providing an alternative visual approach to SLAM.

The actuators can be operated by one of four operating modes using the Dymamixel XL420 model used on the Burger, or six modes using the Dynamixel XM430 model on the Waffle. The Dynamixels provide velocity control for the wheels and torque or position control for the joints. OpenCR control over Dynamixel actuators (click image to enlarge) Both TurtleBot3 models run on a Robotis OpenCR board for controlling the Dynamixels and sensors, such as the board’s built-in IMU, as well as touch, IR, color, and others. The board can run Arduino IDE code on its 216MHz, 32-bit Cortex-M7 STM32F7 MCU. The high-end STM32F7 includes an FPU, and is said to offer 462 DMIPS performance. OpenCR control board detail view (click image to enlarge) The open spec OpenCR control board has 18 GPIO pins, 32 Arduino pins, and 3.3V, 5V, and 12V power supplies. There are three RS485 and three TTL interfaces for controlling the Dynamixels. Other peripherals include three UART, five ADC, four 5-pin OLLO, and single CAN, SPI, and I2C connections. A micro-USB port lets you connect with a PC, and various LEDs and buttons are available. The TurtlBot3 is further equipped with an 1800mAh battery and a 100-240V, AC 50/60Hz power adapter. Tools, cables, and other parts are also available. Fully assembled, the 138 x 178 x 192mm (L/W/H) TurtleBot3 Burger model is about a quarter of the size of the TurtleBot2, and the TurtleBot3 Waffle measures 281 x 306 x 141mm. TurtleBot3 mechanical and performance specs (click image to enlarge) TurtleBot3 can be teleoperated by an Android app, as well as wireless devices such as a keyboard, PS3 and XBOX 360 joysticks, the Robotis RC100 controller, the LEAP Motion controller, and more. The open source navigation software runs on Ubuntu 16.04.2 with-ROS Kinetic. An Ubuntu Insights announcement of the robot notes that both the Raspberry Pi and Joule support Ubuntu Core, giving robot designers “security, transactional updates, and even an app store.” According to a hands-on story last month in IEEE Spectrum, assembling the Burger took “an hour or two,” while the Waffle took about four hours due to additional parts, including 192 screws. The software setup of ROS on the Burger’s Raspberry Pi took another “few hours,” while the setup on the Joule took much longer due to the need to update the BIOS with the help of a Windows PC. Overall, however, hardware and setup were said to be well documented. The modular, completely open source TurtleBot3 design, which includes open 3D CAD files, as well as schematics, PCB Gerber, and BOM, is available with optional parts. These include different sensor and chassis components, as well as a variety of Robotis arms and grippers. With a bit of work, you could even swap out the Pi or Joule for another compute board. Raspberry Pi 3 (left) and Intel Joule (click images to enlarge) The Raspberry Pi 3 SBC runs on a Broadcom BCM2837 with four 1.2GHz Cortex-A53 cores and a VideoCore IV GPU. Other features include 1GB RAM, Fast Ethernet, WiFi/Bluetooth, four USB ports, and a 40-pin expansion interface. The Intel Joule 570x — the higher-end of the two Joule computer-on-modules — provides a quad-core Atom T5700 SoC (1.7GHz clock; 2.4GHz burst) similar to Intel’s Apollo Lake models. The Joule ships with up to 4GB RAM and 16GB eMMC, plus WiFi/Bluetooth, 4K video, CSI/DSI, GPIO, USB, and UART I/O. The module offers built-in support for Intel RealSense.

Peter Bright (US) - Jun 10, 2017 9:11 am UTC Enlarge Qualcomm reader comments 245 Share this story In celebrating the x86 architecture's 39th birthday yesterday—the 8086 processor first came to market on June 8, 1978—Intel took the rather uncelebratory step of threatening any company working on x86 emulator technology. Intel's blog post offers a rundown of all the investments that the company has made in extending and improving the x86 instruction set, with features such as SSE, AVX, TSX transactional memory, and SGX secure enclaves acting as a demonstration of how the company has transformed this ancient instruction set into something cutting edge and forward-looking. But the second part of the post takes a more sour note: Intel notes that many of these developments are patented and that it has a history of using patents to protect its x86 innovations  AMD, Cyrix, VIA, and Transmeta are all named as victims of this defence. Further ReadingARM-based Windows 10 PC from Asus, HP, Lenovo are comingThe post doesn't name any names, but it's not too hard to figure out who it's likely to be aimed at: Microsoft, perhaps with a hint of Qualcomm. Later in the year, companies including Asus, HP, and Lenovo will be releasing Windows laptops using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor. This is not the first time that Windows has been released on ARM processors—Microsoft's first attempt to bring Windows to ARM was the ill-fated Windows 8-era Windows RT in 2012—but this time around there's a key difference. Windows RT systems could not run any x86 applications. Windows 10 for ARM machines, however, will include a software-based x86 emulator that will provide compatibility with most or all 32-bit x86 applications. This compatibility makes these ARM-based machines a threat to Intel in a way that Windows RT never was; if WinARM can run Wintel software but still offer lower prices, better battery life, lower weight, or similar, Intel's dominance of the laptop space is no longer assured. The implication of Intel's post is that the chip giant isn't just going to be relying on technology to secure its position in this space, but the legal system, too. The full details of Windows 10's x86 emulation are unknown; critical to Intel's patent threat will be questions of precisely which x86 extensions are supported. The core 32-bit x86 instruction set is more than 30 years old (it made its debut with the 386, released all the way back in 1985) and as such it's not going to be patent-encumbered. Microsoft's emulator could also safely ignore the very latest x86 extensions such as TSX, SGX, and MPE because software that uses the extensions is so rare. Some extensions, such as the VT-x virtualisation features, are irrelevant to running Windows applications, so they can similarly be skipped. Intel has filed a ton of patents to cover the various x86 extensions that have been developed over the years. Intel This leaves the extensions with widespread application adoption that are new enough to still be covered by patents. For the most part, these extensions all fall into the same category: they're the various SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) instructions that have widespread use in certain kinds of number crunching, video and image processing, and gaming, among other fields. The newest of these instructions, the AVX family, is probably recent enough that developers do not blindly assume that AVX is available. Rather, they will include both AVX code and equivalent non-AVX code so that if AVX is not available, they can fall back to slower but equivalent routines. But AVX's older predecessor, the SSE family, is much less likely to have such fallbacks. AVX needs fallbacks because developers can still reasonably expect that their programs will be run on machines that don't support AVX, but that's not the case for SSE: AMD made SSE2 a mandatory part of its 64-bit AMD64 extension, which means that virtually every chip that's been sold over the last decade or more will include SSE2 support. As such, developers don't need to bother including a non-SSE2 fallback path just in case SSE2 isn't present. Instead, their software will simply break. That's a problem, because the SSE family is also new enough—the various SSE extensions were introduced between 1999 and 2007—that any patents covering it will still be in force.  If Intel has patents on the SSE family that are applicable to a software emulator (and not merely to hardware clones), it's hard to see how the Windows emulator will be able to avoid these patents while also offering sufficient compatibility with x86 applications. Of course, this may just be tough talk from Intel, and until the software actually ships, it's hard to know precisely what exposure the emulator has. That x86 is patented is also widely known, so it would be a little surprising if Microsoft had not considered patent liability when developing the emulator. And Intel's business health continues to have a strong dependence on Microsoft's business, which has to make the chip firm a little wary of taking the software company (or its customers) to court.

By Agamoni Ghosh June 10, 2017 11:09 BST Windows  firewall seen at riskMicrosoft Hackers may be able to use Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT) to bypass Windows' built-in firewall rendering it completely useless in detection of malware and ransomware. AMT allows remote access to networks or computers enabling administrators to easily install programs like an operating system on a remote computer. A hacking group known as PLATINUM has reportedly figured how to use AMT's low-level firmware for injecting potential malware into Windows systems. Reacting to the discovery Microsoft said: "We have shared information with Intel, and the two companies collaborated to analyse and better understand the purpose and implementation of the tool. The tool did not expose vulnerabilities in the management technology itself, but rather misused AMT SOL within target networks... to keep communication stealthy and evade security applications." As of now, only a handful of computers within organisational networks in Southeast Asia have been targeted by the vulnerability. However, the hacker group is known to modify its hacking tools based on the network architecture of targeted organisations, indicating it could hit many more systems. For the attack to take place the AMT has to be enabled to connect to the remote network so in case it is switched off, there is no way hackers can exploit it. Microsoft says the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection is enough to detect such malicious injections and reiterates that the PLATINUM tool does not expose flaws in Intel's AMT, but exposes an already compromised network to evade security monitoring tools.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel issues veiled threat to Qualcomm’s… Intel issues veiled threat to Qualcomm’s plans to run Windows By Brad Jones — Updated June 9, 2017 4:21 pm Subscribe Share Here are the top 25 games that made the SNES, well, super Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Windows 10 devices powered by Qualcomm chips are due later this year, but Intel's saber-rattling suggests that there might be an attempt to block their release. Update 6-9-2017 2:00PM Pacific: Added official comments from Qualcomm and Microsoft. Earlier this year, Qualcomm took a shot at Intel with the unveiling of its Snapdragon 835 chip, which the likes of HP, Asus, and Lenovo are already confirmed to be using in their production of Windows 10 PCs. Now, Intel has issued something of a response, stating an intention to “carefully protect” its innovations. The dispute revolves around the x86 architecture, which is the basis of most laptop and desktop PCs on the market at present. Qualcomm will seemingly use emulation, built in partnership with Microsoft, to run x86 apps on ARM-based systems. And that doesn’t seem to sit too well with Intel. The company lays out a brief history of its continued attempts to defend its intellectual property related to x86, including legal action against the likes of AMD, Cyrix, and the Transmeta Corporation. The latter receives a particularly pointed write-up, which notes that it was the last company to attempt to produce a compatible x86 processor via emulation, before its failure led to the firm’s exit from the microprocessor business. “Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel’s x86 ISA will meet a different fate,” reads the post on the Intel website, which starts off as a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the 8086 processor, before taking a more combative turn. It’s worth noting that Qualcomm and Microsoft aren’t mentioned by name anywhere in the text. Neither are any of the PC makers that have announced plans to build Qualcomm-based PCs. It’s theoretically possible that Intel is referring to its broader efforts to defend x86 from being used improperly by other entities — but given recent events, it seems likely that Qualcomm and Microsoft are the intended target. Microsoft stands to lose out almost as much as Qualcomm if Intel can successfully block x86 emulation. Windows 10 on ARM is a priority for the company, and any legal action taken by Intel could potentially thwart its progress. That said, it remains to be seen whether Intel can follow up on its strongly worded warning. Qualcomm had the following to say about Intel’s post in this statement from a spokesperson that was supplied to Digital Trends: “Given our recent announcement with ASUS, HP and Lenovo, we found the blog that one of our competitors published on June 8 very interesting. We look forward to the launch of the always connected Windows 10 PC powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform later this year. As showcased at Computex 2017 in conjunction with Microsoft, the Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform brings a true [emphasis Qualcomm’s] always connected PC experience with support for up to Gigabit LTE connectivity and all-day battery life for sleek, thin and fanless designs. This will change the future of personal computing.” Meanwhile, Microsoft offered up a more diplomatic statement on the matter: Customers have told us they want Always Connected PCs, which will deliver great productivity at a great price, and we are confident in our ability to bring these compelling devices to market working with a wide range of partners. At this point, neither side seems ready to back down from this dispute.

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Upcoming Apple iPhones may miss out on higher-speed data links June 10, 2017 - 12:32 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Verizon Corp., AT&T Inc. and the rest of the U.S. wireless industry have a big boast for this year’s crop of smartphones: thanks to network upgrades, devices will be able to download as much as a gigabit of data in a single second -- speeds 100 times faster than before. But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones, Bloomberg reveals. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device -- in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent to $152.56 in New York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers -- Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. -- have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Apple used two modem suppliers -- and the same technique to mask performance disparities -- for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers. The carriers will be able to boast about 1 gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic Co.’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year. Related links: Bloomberg.

Original Story: Intel spent most of a recent blog post celebrating the 40th anniversary of the launch of the first x86 microprocessor, but it was the path that the company chose to go down at the end of its post that has raised eyebrows. In wrapping things up, Intel fired off a warning shot at companies seeking to emulate the x86 architecture, potentially foreshadowing some legal troubles for Qualcomm and Microsoft over their efforts with Windows 10 on ARM. From Intel: There have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel's proprietary x86 ISA without Intel's authorization. Emulation is not a new technology, and Transmeta was notably the last company to claim to have produced a compatible x86 processor using emulation ("code morphing") techniques. Intel enforced patents relating to SIMD instruction set enhancements against Transmeta's x86 implementation even though it used emulation. In any event, Transmeta was not commercially successful, and it exited the microprocessor business 10 years ago. Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel's x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel's microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel's x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences, consistency across applications, and a full breadth of consumer offerings, full manageability and IT integration for the enterprise. However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights. Strong intellectual property protections make it possible for Intel to continue to invest the enormous resources required to advance Intel's dynamic x86 ISA, and Intel will maintain its vigilance to protect its innovations and investments. Neither Microsoft nor Qualcomm are actually mentioned by name in Intel's post, but, given the proximity to recent announcements from Microsoft concerning Windows 10 on ARM, it's hard not to form a connection. ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley reached out to Intel to clarify whether the post was directed towards Qualcomm and Microsoft's efforts, but its response isn't particularly clarifying: Intel respects intellectual property rights and we expect others to do the same. x86 technology is both proprietary and central to our business, and we're concerned any time it appears that others may be copying it inappropriately. We will thoroughly evaluate any products that claim to emulate x86 technology, and vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights if we believe they are infringed. Recently, at Computex, Microsoft announced that the first Windows 10 on ARM PCs will come from the likes of Lenovo, HP, and ASUS. Running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, a platform typically used for smartphones, Windows 10 on ARM will be able to run full Windows and emulate full Win32 legacy applications. That's different from Microsoft's last ARM effort, Windows RT, which could only run Windows Store apps. Compared to x86 laptops, Microsoft claims that Windows 10 on ARM devices should provide up to 50 percent better battery life, up to gigabit LTE, and four to five times longer standby times. There's currently no specific date for Windows 10 on ARM PCs to hit the market, nor have we even seen any hardware designs just yet. However, with the implied threat of a protracted legal battle out there, it will be interesting to watch and see how this plays out over the coming months. A Qualcomm spokesperson provided Windows Central with the following statement concerning Intel's blog post: Given our recent announcement with ASUS, HP and Lenovo, we found the blog that one of our competitors published on June 8 very interesting. We look forward to the launch of the always connected Windows 10 PC powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform later this year. As showcased at Computex 2017 in conjunction with Microsoft, the Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform brings a true always connected PC experience with support for up to Gigabit LTE connectivity and all-day battery life for sleek, thin and fanless designs. This will change the future of personal computing.

That decision forced MS to build full Windows for ARM because MS need to deliver their OS on mobile devices while not doing another RT. This made MS even more dependent on their non Win32 store, and equally more committed in building the UWP ecosystem further. This move is dangerous for Intel.   0 1 day ago Reply gnomagico Intel has not introduced nothing interesting in the last decade, still the same old crap they are 20 years behind. I remember they introduced hardware video decoding in their motherboards ages after video cards. And now they want to stop innovation. Intel should be relegated to the server market.

Tell me, how are all those Wintel programs, x86 software gonna work on a platform that is not able to fully emulate that?

TBH, I have no idea, if the dynamic patching shown there qualifies as an emulator. This step is not needed, if apps are compiled for ARM. Which is why Win32 calls should be already native on ARM.

The situation is a lot more complicated than that.   0 7 hours ago Reply noirsoft not a good analogy. Intel is not claiming to own "English" Intel is claiming to own something that they did invent and thus do actually own. AMD x64 is similarly not "Engligh" but an extension to it, and AMD owns only those extentions. The analogy completely breaks down if you try to make it accurate. Instead, I will try to just point out the situation in simpole terms. Intel created X86 for 32-bit programs. They do own this completely. They also created IA64 for 64 bit programs, but that failed. classic Win32 programs written in C or similar languages become a combination of raw X86 instructions and calls to the Windows libraries. AMD created X64 which runs 64-bit programs, but is compatible with X86 based 32 bit programs. Then there is ARM which can run 64 bit programs, but is completely incompatible with x86 or x64. Win10 on ARM will have Windows itself and UWP programs natively running on ARM. But, it will also run older Win32 programs originally made for x86 or x64 via emulation. The Windows routines will be in ARM, but the non-WIndows parts will be emulated. Note also that the statement from Intel referred specifically to patents related to SIMD, which is an extension to the X86 set of commands, and not part of the core instruction set. It appears from that that there is no legal hurdle to emulating basic X86, only to emulating certain extensions to the original set of instructions. I do not believe it is currently known by the general public whether Microsoft's WOA technology conflicts with those patents. 0 7 hours ago Reply John Zetterman It's the 40th anniversary of x86, 20 years past the life of a patent.

Making Microsoft not interested to the gight as the fee for the permission to use Intel's IP is pocket lint. 2- In the U.S, if I am not mistaken, if you do a contract of such nature, money needs to be exchanged, and the minimum is 1$. Doing such agreement, would allow Intel to do an exception. Meaning, Microsoft does its thing, Intel saves money by not going to court (this would be a huge case, where both companies will fight hard), and they keep their intellectual properties, and avoids having to deal with new competition that will come via using their technology or the use of hardware/software emulation. Such agreement wouls results that Intel and Microsoft are both happy. Intel won't have the biggest smile in their face, but at least they can focus on fighting ARM based CPUs only in the PC space, which would, perhaps, be able to enter the mobile space and have intresting offerings. If Intel looses, then expect: AppliedMicro, Broadcom, Cavium, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Samsung to join the party in full force.

I doubt Intel dare to do anything which can make themselves leave the x64 platform too. 7 2 days ago Reply KickAssLumia I don't think that's a good parallel. X64 is a natural extension to x86 developed by an x86 license holder. However, since Qualcomm is not the one implementing the x86 -> ARM translation, I don't think they are the ones being targetted by this announcement. In-fact, none of the hardware in the ARM space is doing this....its all done by Microsoft's API intercepting the x86 calls and translating them to compatible ARM instruction. They are also the ones with the money to fight this off without going bankrupt.   However, I don't see any way Intel comes out of this shining. Microsoft has very real capability of tilting the odds against Intel by funding and supporting AMD tuned compilers more. I bet they already do this on the XBox side of things. This is going to be real interesting to see. I am hopeful one of the editors here at WC is already pouring over the x86 agreement between Microsoft and Intel/AMD to see what the real real restrictions, if any, are here. 11 2 days ago Reply KelvBlue We are not talking about hardware here. It will be perfect case for Intel if Microsoft or Qualcomm is making a hardware processor that infringes their patent buy this is not the case here. You cannot inherently run a x86 program on a x64 Windows. You can do so seamlessly now is because MS using an emulation process WoW (Windows on Windows), in this case Windows 32 bits on Windows 64 bits. The same concept is on the Windows 32 bits on Windows ARM. 0 2 days ago Reply KickAssLumia If I'm not mistaken, the x86 IP was shared with AMD after a long legal battle and even then, it was only granted as non-transferrable. Meaning, no bigger company could buy AMD and dare to compete with Intel at its own game. Not to mention, even morph the x86 instruction set and its extension to something beyond what Intel considers main-stream. AMD and Intel are cross-licensing partners, which is how they got access to the X64 IP. Microsoft and Apple share a similar agreement. Overall, the odds are stacked pretty high against any company that dare cross Intel. That is the simple fact of the matter. 5 2 days ago Reply Emi Mimo Hey mate, I would not stake so much in a bet for Microsoft.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Intel hints at potential patent infringement by Qualcomm and Microsoft over Windows on ARM’s x86 emulation Last month at the Computex 2017 Qualcomm announced that ASUS, HP and Lenovo will be the first OEM to develop mobile PCs powered by the ARM-based Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform with X16 LTE modem. This came after Microsoft failed to bring Windows to ARM chips in the form of Windows RT with Surface with Windows RT and Nokia Lumia 2520. Intel in a blog post earlier this week announcing the fast-approaching 40th anniversary since it introduced the first x86 microprocessor, the Intel 8086, said that it invests enormous resources to advance its dynamic x86 ISA, and therefore it must protect these investments with a strong patent portfolio and other intellectual property rights. It said that it has deep and dynamic patent portfolio with over 1,600 patents worldwide relating to instruction set implementations and said it protects its x86 innovations, and do not widely license others to use them. Intel also said that it has enforced its patent rights against various companies including Transmeta Corporation more recently. This seemingly hints of potential patent infringement around x86 emulation on ARM by Microsoft and Qualcomm. Regarding this Intel said: There have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel’s proprietary x86 ISA without Intel’s authorization. Emulation is not a new technology, and Transmeta was notably the last company to claim to have produced a compatible x86 processor using emulation (“code morphing”) techniques. Intel enforced patents relating to SIMD instruction set enhancements against Transmeta’s x86 implementation even though it used emulation. Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel’s x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel’s microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel’s x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences, consistency across applications, and a full breadth of consumer offerings, full manageability and IT integration for the enterprise. However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel’s intellectual property rights. In reply Qualcomm said: Given our recent announcement with ASUS, HP and Lenovo, we found the blog that one of our competitors published on June 8 very interesting. We look forward to the launch of the always connected Windows 10 PC powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform later this year. As showcased at Computex 2017 in conjunction with Microsoft, the Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform brings a true always connected PC experience with support for up to Gigabit LTE connectivity and all-day battery life for sleek, thin and fanless designs. This will change the future of personal computing. Microsoft said: Customers have told us they want Always Connected PCs, which will deliver great productivity at a great price, and we are confident in our ability to bring these compelling devices to market working with a wide range of partners Intel doesn’t name Qualcomm or Microsoft, but it just said that the x86 technology is both proprietary and central to its business and it will thoroughly evaluate any products that claim to emulate x86 technology, and vigorously enforce its intellectual property rights if they believe they are infringed. Both Qualcomm and Microsoft doesn’t directly respond to Intel’s claims and said that it is keen on bringing PCs based on Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform to the market later this year. We should wait till later this year to find out what will happen.

Macs & Mac OS X | 06 Jun 2017 | Print  | Comment (21) Apple Beefs Up iMac and MacBook Lines, Teases the iMac Pro by Adam C. Engst At WWDC 2017 today, Apple devoted a non-trivial segment of the keynote to new Mac hardware, showing off improved iMacs and performance-enhanced MacBook Pros and mentioning a speed bump to the MacBook Air in passing. After running through all the changes to today’s models, Apple gave a sneak preview of the iMac Pro, a workstation-class version of the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display that’s scheduled to ship at the end of the year. No mention was made of the Mac mini or Mac Pro, though Apple has already said that the Mac Pro is in the middle of a major redesign that won’t be done until 2018 at the earliest (see “Maca Culpa: Apple Admits Mac Pro Missteps and Promises More Transparency,” 4 April 2017). iMac -- The workhorse of Apple’s desktop line has long been the iMac, which Apple continues to offer in three basic models: a 21.5-inch non-Retina version, a 21.5-inch iMac with 4K Retina display, and the 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display. On the CPU front, each model receives a speed bump thanks to Apple using Intel’s 7th generation “Kaby Lake” processors and increasing clock speeds. You can see the specifics on Apple’s Tech Specs page, but the summary is that Apple is focusing more effort on the 21.5 Retina iMac, offering just a single configuration of the non-Retina model. Benchmarks will show how much faster the combination of new CPUs and higher clock speeds will be, but I suspect purchases will mostly be based on price. Although the iMac Retina displays are already gorgeous, Apple claims to have improved them even more in both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch sizes, increasing brightness 43 percent to 500 nits and supporting display of up to 1 billion colors. The non-Retina iMac model drives its screen with the integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, but all the Retina models now take advantage of Radeon Pro GPUs, the 555 and 560 for the 21.5-inch models and the 570, 575, and 580 models for the 27-inch models. The notable win here is for the 21.5-inch Retina models, which were previously limited to integrated Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Apple has made the Fusion Drive standard in more configurations, and the company claims that the SSDs available in 256 GB, 512 GB, and 1 TB capacities are up to 50 percent faster. You can also configure the top-of-the-line 27-inch iMac with a 2 TB SSD for a whopping $1400. When it comes to RAM, all base models still ship with 8 GB. The non-Retina iMac and low-end 21.5 Retina model remain limited to 16 GB, but the high-end 21.5-inch Retina model can now take 16 GB or 32 GB, a welcome improvement. Similarly, the low-end 27-inch model still maxes out at 32 GB, but the two higher-end models can take 16 GB, 32 GB, or 64 GB. RAM in the 21.5-inch iMac models cannot be upgraded by the user, but you can install memory in the 27-inch model yourself. Unsurprisingly, Apple replaced the previous models’ Thunderbolt 2 ports with a pair of Thunderbolt 3 ports that support DisplayPort for external screens, Thunderbolt at up to 40 Gbps, USB 3.1 Gen 2 at up to 10 Gbps, and various other protocols via adapters (see “Explaining Thunderbolt 3, USB-C, and Everything In Between,” 3 November 2016). All these changes are welcome for anyone in the market for a new iMac. I doubt they’re significant enough to warrant trading in an existing Retina iMac, unless Thunderbolt 3 is a necessity. The most interesting changes are actually in the 21.5-inch models, which move past the RAM and graphics limitations of the previous configuration while introducing a cheaper config. The 21.5-inch non-Retina iMac remains priced at $1099, with the two Retina configurations starting at $1299 and $1499. The 27-inch model comes in three configurations: $1799, $1999, and $2299. They’re all available now. Perhaps I’m just boggled by the number of changes Apple announced in the WWDC keynote, but I couldn’t see how to give more context for the changes in relation to previous configurations because the matrix of what models get which build-to-order options was just too complicated. If you want to price out different possibilities, I recommend opening several browser windows so you can compare the configurations side by side. MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air -- As with the iMac, Apple updated the processors in the MacBook and MacBook Pro with new Kaby Lake processors running at higher clock speeds. That should improve performance, although likely not by that much. The MacBook Pro models also get improved graphics processing, with the 13-inch MacBook Pro models using Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 and 650, and the 15-inch models switching to Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs on top of Intel HD Graphics 630 and 640. You can now buy a MacBook with 16 GB of RAM, up from the previous limit of 8 GB, and Apple claims that the MacBook’s onboard SSD is up to 50 percent faster. That might make the MacBook a more attractive option, given that lackluster performance was one of its main disadvantages. Despite rumors to the contrary, the MacBook Air lives, but it sees the least change, replacing its stock 1.6 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a 1.8 GHz model. It remains upgradeable to an Intel Core i7 running at 2.2 GHz. Although these changes are all positive, they do nothing to simplify the difficulty of choosing between the three models. Each falls into the three-dimensional graph of price, performance, and size in a different spot. You’ll have to decide what’s most important to you — cost, speed, or portability — and figure out which of Apple’s notebooks best fits your needs. As with the new iMac models, these updated notebooks are all available now. iMac Pro -- During the private media meeting in which Apple executives confessed to the company’s sins with regard to the Mac Pro, mention was made of pro-related announcements about the iMac coming this year. Apple has now revealed more of what that means, pulling back the curtains on the iMac Pro. Due in December 2017, the iMac Pro retains the same form factor of the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display, but swaps the brushed aluminum look for a space gray finish that extends to the Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, Magic Mouse 2, and an optional Magic Trackpad 2. The goal of the iMac Pro is to provide workstation-class performance within the iMac design. The hardest part of that is dealing with heat, because the iMac Pro will feature Intel Xeon processors in 8-core, 10-core, or 18-core configurations. Also playing into the necessary thermal architecture redesign is Apple’s use of a new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, which reportedly features a next-generation compute core and up to 16 GB of on-package high-bandwidth memory (HBM2). Apple says that the iMac Pro with Vega GPU delivers up to 11 teraflops of single-precision compute power for real-time 3D rendering and high frame rate VR. For half-precision computation that’s reportedly ideal for machine learning, the iMac Pro can deliver up to 22 teraflops of performance. (No, we don’t really have a sense of what that means, either, but Apple PR did a good job of making it sound impressive.) The iMac Pro will come with 32 GB of RAM by default, but for a machine in this class, the fact that it’s configurable to 64 GB or 128 GB is more important. A 1 TB SSD is also standard, with 2 TB and 4 TB SSDs as options. Unsurprisingly, the iMac Pro sports four Thunderbolt 3 ports, which enables it to drive up to two 5K displays and two high-performance RAID arrays at the same time. Other connectivity options mimic what’s on the 27-inch iMac with 5K Retina display now, with the exception of Ethernet. Instead of gigabit Ethernet, the iMac Pro will include 10 Gb Ethernet, which could be a big deal when transferring huge amounts of data between machines. How much will all this cost? A lot, with the base iMac Pro configuration starting at $4999. Apple claimed that a comparable workstation would cost about $7000, without a 5K display. Even still, given the high price of large SSDs and RAM, we anticipate that a loaded iMac Pro will easily meet or exceed that $7000 mark. But that won’t stop the audience for the iMac Pro. If you need the maximum performance from a Mac, the iMac Pro will provide it. At least until a new Mac Pro makes its debut, and many of those who live and die by the teraflop won’t want to wait.   Make friends and influence people by sponsoring TidBITS!

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Receive comments via RSS Add a comment Michael E. Cohen   2017-06-06 10:48 And if anyone out there thinks the iMac Pro means that a Mac Pro ISN'T also coming, Apple's press release on the iMac Pro puts that misconception to rest: "In addition to the new iMac Pro, Apple is working on a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest-end, high-throughput system in a modular design, as well as a new high-end pro display." Reply Mackay Bell  2017-06-07 20:38 It seems that part of the reason they revealed that they were working on an expandable Mac Pro (and apologizing for the trash can version) is they wanted people to get excited about the iMac Pro, and not suck up all the air complaining about the lack of an expandable system. By getting that story out before the release, they could get a little more excitement going for the coming of the iMac Pro. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:49 I think you're spot on. Reply Alan Forkosh   2017-06-06 11:09 It's noteworthy that Apple didn't mention anything about the Touch Bar. As it stands now, Touch Bar is an orphan, present on only on the MacBook Pro line. It strikes me as something that can't really be considered a standard until there is a desktop version of it also--either a new keyboard or a standalone item to be paired with a keyboard. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-06 12:00 In fact, it turns out that Apple did release a new wireless Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad. But not with a Touch Bar. Boo! http://techcrunch.com/2017/06/05/apple-has-a-new-wireless-magic-keyboard-with-a-full-numeric-keypad/amp/ Reply Paul Ellis  2017-06-06 13:53 The Touch Bar is a gimmick. It breaks all the rules of ergonomics and focus. It might possibly make some sense when positioned close the the screen, and therefore point of focus, on a laptop, but makes little sense for a desktop. If I were a developer, which thankfully I'm not, I wouldn't be wasting any time developing for it, and certainly not if I'd previously been stung by OpenDoc, QuickTime VR, etc. etc. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:57 I like what Apple is doing with the iMac and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assuming they'll make things right with the new Mac Pro once it finally arrives. The MBP seems fine. I still don't see what TouchBar is supposed to accomplish - I also think it's mainly a gimmick with poor ergonomics. Apple didn't spend any time on it at this WWDC. Does anybody think it might disappear during the next overhaul? I don't really get why Apple is keeping the MBA around instead of just trying to make an inexpensive entry-level MB instead. Since there is no inexpensive entry-level MB, I assume that means the MB is targeting the middle/high-end of the compact/light market. So with that in mind, why in the world did they not replace that USB-C with TB3? If this were a budget Mac at $999 targeted at schools and students, fine. But since this is a midrange Mac we're talking about, why leave it stuck with USB-C? Nothing TB3 offers can't be done with USB-C, but TB3 is just more versatile and it is no doubt the new standard across Macs - well almost, sigh. Reply Simon  2017-06-06 14:59 (cont.) My only real gripe on the Mac side is the Mac mini. How can Apple just let it sit there to die? Either kill it off already (so people know they'll have to go Hackintosh) or update it. But just leaving it sit there without a clear plan makes we wonder what message Apple is trying to send. It reminds me of the Mac Pro situation before pressure from pros and tech journalists forced Apple to take a stand. I see a lot of potential for the Mac mini, from cheap servers to simple office computers, offering a low-price entry point to the Mac universe, schools, home media servers, etc. I'm afraid all of that is "too techy" and not sexy enough for the new Apple. I really hope I'm wrong. I'm holding onto my trusty Core i5 Mac mini, but with its 4 GB of RAM (could be upgraded) and 500 GB HDD (could also be upgraded, but is that worth it?) its days are numbered even as my home media server. Reply Bertrand Morin  2017-06-06 19:27 Is the memory (RAM) upgradable in the iMac 27in. by the user, as it wad older iMac… Reply James  2017-06-08 07:58 Did you read the product page for the 27" iMac? If not, go back and read it again. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-09 09:48 Yes, it is in the 27-inch model. But RAM in the 21.5-inch model is not user-upgradeable (although it's not soldered to the motherboard either). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-07 01:08 Is there any indication yet if the new iMac models (both 21.5" and 27") have user upgradable RAM? There is some wording on the Apple page that you can upgrade the 21.5" RAM after purchase through Apple or an authorized dealer, but it not 100% clear. And the page for the 27" is completely silent. Reply Adam Engst   2017-06-07 09:59 The 21.5-inch models are NOT user-upgradeable, but the 27-inch model is. See http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201191 Reply Bob  2017-06-08 18:02 Scott, MacRumors reports "iFixit has published a teardown of the new 4K 21.5-inch iMac, which reveals that – surprisingly – Apple's smallest all-in-one desktop machine has both removable RAM and a Kaby Lake processor that's not soldered onto the logic board." Note though, updating is an involved process. Certainly not user-replaceable by the average owner. But at least users aren't irrevocably locked in to what they originally purchased. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:28 I guess that I should have been a little more accurate with my question. I was more trying to determine if the RAM in both the 21.5" and 27" is upgradable, whether user upgradable as officially supported by Apple or even just upgradable but only officially by Apple or an Apple ASP (which means a user can do it if they are afraid to open up their Mac and maybe end up having Apple not provide support under the warranty if there is a problem). Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 02:32 Good to know. I am not afraid to open up a Mac even for supposedly no user upgradable items at least officially in Apple's eyes. On my original 2006 MBP, I replaced a fan that was squealing due to the bearings and also upgrade the WiFi card, neither of which was consider user upgradable by Apple (certainly not the fan at least...not sure about the WiFi card). It likely would not matter as if I were in the market for an iMac (I am currently not), I would be going for a 27" model anyway. I am kind of used to the 27" Thunderbolt display that I have, so going back to what would seem like a freakishly small (to me) 21.5" screen would not really be an option. Reply Henrik Munster  2017-06-09 10:46 There is "not user upgradeable" and then there is "not user upgradeable". I have myself opened a few MacBooks and even PowerBooks, but opening an iMac seems to me to be quite frightening. My suggestion would be to at least take a look at the instructions at iFixit before attempting to do anything. Reply Scott M.   2017-06-09 22:00 Always do. When I am going to crack open any Mac (or any other Apple product or even some non-Apple products these days although they tend to cover every Apple product but not so much for non-Apple products), iFixit is the first stop when I even start to think about it. It was their guides that helped me replace the fan on the 2006 MBP and upgrade the WiFi card for that same Mac. iFixit is an excellent source for determining what kind of trouble I might get into. ;-) Reply Simon  2017-06-08 18:20 I wonder if the non-retina 21.5" iMac will have the same SO-DIMM slots? I guess the replaceable CPU is a given because apparently Intel does not offer desktop Kaby Lake with BGA (i.e. soldered). Reply Scott Randell  2017-06-09 15:13 Hey Adam, the hardware part of the announcements were of little interest to me. Mostly because of the price points. The average user will not need an iMac Pro, nor could they justify paying for it. The price points on the regular iMac are ridiculous. The 27 inch with 512 GB SSD is a much better value than the 21 inch with the same add ons. Especially when you consider you can install extra 8 GB of ram yourself for about $60.00 vs the $200.00 Apple charges. With the same add ons the 27 inch is only $260.00 more than the 21 inch. Unless space is a consideration the 27 inch is a much better value, and you can add more ram down the road. I personally hope they come out with a reasonably priced user upgradable tower you can buy as much or as little as you need. Regards to all Tidbits staff.

As part of the announcement-heavy WWDC keynote, Apple has revved the iMac line with Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, higher performance graphics, brighter screens, and faster SSDs. The MacBook and MacBook Pro also get new CPUs, the MacBook becomes more expandable, and the MacBook Air receives a small speed bump. The most unexpected news, however, was the announcement of the iMac Pro, due in December 2017. Add a comment  Search   Cached. Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Adam C.

However starting with last year’s iPhone 7, Apple started to use Intel’s modems as well, so depending on your region, your iPhone could either be sporting an Intel or Qualcomm modem. It is expected that this mixture will continue with this year’s iPhones, but there’s some bad news. According to a report from Bloomberg, it seems that Apple’s decision to use both Intel and Qualcomm modems will result in iPhones that won’t be able to achieve gigabit download speeds, which apparently is due to Intel’s modems being incapable of achieving those speeds. It is because of that Apple is expected to “limit” Qualcomm’s modem in order to ensure a uniform experience across the board, or so the reports claim. Now you might have heard that Intel has been working on a new modem that will be capable of reaching 1 gigabit download speeds, but the report from Bloomberg claims that it will not be ready in time for this year’s iPhones, so for now iPhone users won’t be seeing too big of a difference in download speeds. As Bloomberg points out, this could clash with the marketing plans of carriers who are touting faster network speeds in 2017. It remains to be seen if this will really be the case so take it with a grain of salt for now. Filed in Apple >Cellphones >Rumors. Read more about Intel, iPhone, iphone 8 and Qualcomm.

The next iPhone won't be the absolute fastest phone for downloading files or streaming music, because it will likely lack a gigabit LTE modem, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Apple sources its modems from two different suppliers, Qualcomm and Intel, and while Qualcomm's latest modems can take advantage of gigabit-per-second download speeds that some mobile carriers are now offering, Intel's gigabit modem isn't quite ready yet. Rather than use Qualcomm's modem exclusively for its next iPhone, Apple will continue to use Intel's modems in some models even though they are slower, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with Apple's decision. The decision is not entirely unexpected, since Apple has varied its modem suppliers for many previous iPhone models. But it is particularly noteworthy now because of two recent developments: Apple is locked in a legal battle with Qualcomm, which it accuses of monopolistic and illegal business practices, and one of the iPhone's chief competitors, the Samsung Galaxy S8, has a modem that already supports the gigabit speeds that several carriers are now advertising. Related Need to Fix Your iPhone Screen? That's About to Get Easier Need to Fix Your iPhone Screen? That's About to Get Easier Neither Apple nor Intel immediately responded to a request for comment, and Qualcomm declined to comment. For its part, Apple portrays its smartphones as better than Samsung's, and judging by the queues of eager customers outside Apple stores following a new iPhone announcement, the market for high-end handsets doesn't seem to care much about the device's innards. Those who do care might be able to divine the type of modem in their handset based on which mobile carrier they use. The Intel 7480 modem, one candidate to show up in the next iPhone, doesn't support Sprint or Verizon's CDMA technology, so it's likely that it will power the GSM iPhones for AT&T and T-Mobile, while Qualcomm modems will power the CDMA version. The modem kerfuffle could all be sorted out next year, when Intel's new 7560 gigabit modem is ready. The 7560 supports both GSM and CDMA, which puts it in the running to take over from Qualcomm as the iPhone's only modem.

And like last year, this means the company will resort to throttling Qualcomm's modems in order to ensure that they perform at the same level as Intel's. While Qualcomm already has a modem that can theoretically reach gigabit LTE speeds (and this is included in the Snapdragon 835 chipset that powers 2017's Android flagships), Intel isn't there yet. It's reportedly working on a modem with similar capabilities, but that part won't be ready in time for the iPhone 8, iPhone 7s, and iPhone 7s Plus that Apple will launch this fall. Apple doesn't want to depend on just one supplier for such a crucial hardware component, and especially not Qualcomm - with which it's embroiled in a lawsuit where it alleges the chip maker is engaging in monopolistic practices. Apple's solution for this entire conundrum is to do what it did last year: throttle Qualcomm's higher-performing modems to the same level as what Intel's part is able to achieve. Thus there will be no performance difference between iPhones sporting the two parts. This might however create a marketing issue for Apple. The big US carriers have all promised to make gigabit LTE networks a reality by the end of the year, and when those launch the newest iPhones won't support them. On the other hand, Samsung's Galaxy S8, S8+, and Note8 all will, along with other Android handsets powered by the Snapdragon 835. As the carriers are expected to push this advancement a lot in their ads, Apple's image could suffer.

But that won't be the case for Apple Inc.'s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company's most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple's suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won't be ready for the iPhone's introduction, according to people familiar with Apple's decision. Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm's chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it's seeking to loosen Qualcomm's grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That's why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won't enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn't public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple's decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that's 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing. T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the U.S. this year and has already started making network upgrades, Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities. Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year — with the exception of iPhones.

The upcoming meetings are described as “tech week,” by sources familiar with the White House. Read: Emmanuel Macron, Trump Feud: French President Trolls With Make Our Planet Great Again Website Leaders from companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Intel and Oracle will get together with Trump’s team. Other firms invited were Adobe, Akamai and Qualcomm, which is in a legal battle with Apple. Trump transition team adviser Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, will also attend the meetings. The main event will be on June 19 for Trump’s new American Technology Council meeting. The companies’ chief executives will meet with the administration in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to modernize government and the services it offers to Americans and will touch on policies like immigration, the report said. Later in the month, tech experts and the Trump team will discuss drones, the internet of things, autonomous cars, investments in emerging markets and the future of the country’s workforce. Trump’s Rocky Relationship With The Tech Industry The planned meetings come after the tech industry expressed its disappointment over Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement last week. Trump ditched the Paris agreement saying it “disadvantages the United States” and would “undermine” the country’s economy. After the president announced his decision, elected officials, business leaders and tech companies spoke out against the decision. Parties, including Google, Lyft, Adobe, Tesla, Apple, Amazon and Yahoo! signed a “We’re Still In” statement vowing to work “together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions.” Read: Internet Spy Law: Trump Administration, Intel Leaders, Republican Senators Want To Make FISA Section 702 Permanent Apple CEO Tim Cook said Trump made the wrong decision regarding the Paris climate agreement. “I think it’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided,” Cook told Bloomberg. “My view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it. The country eclipses politics.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who worked as an advisor for the Trump administration, left Trump’s business advisory councils after the president announced his decision. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said when he announced his departure. Trump previously met with tech leaders last December before he took office. Musk, Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and other tech leaders attended the summit at Trump Tower.

Photo: Reuters The main event will be on June 19 for Trump’s new American Technology Council meeting. The companies’ chief executives will meet with the administration in Washington, D.C., to discuss ways to modernize government and the services it offers to Americans and will touch on policies like immigration, the report said. Later in the month, tech experts and the Trump team will discuss drones, the internet of things, autonomous cars, investments in emerging markets and the future of the country’s workforce. Trump’s Rocky Relationship With The Tech Industry The planned meetings come after the tech industry expressed its disappointment over Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Agreement last week. Trump ditched the Paris agreement saying it “disadvantages the United States” and would “undermine” the country’s economy. After the president announced his decision, elected officials, business leaders and tech companies spoke out against the decision. Parties, including Google, Lyft, Adobe, Tesla, Apple, Amazon and Yahoo! signed a “We’re Still In” statement vowing to work “together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions.” Read: Internet Spy Law: Trump Administration, Intel Leaders, Republican Senators Want To Make FISA Section 702 Permanent Apple CEO Tim Cook said Trump made the wrong decision regarding the Paris climate agreement. “I think it’s not in the best interest of the United States what he decided,” Cook told Bloomberg. “My view is that first and foremost things are about, can you help your country and if you can help your country and you do that by interacting, then you do it. The country eclipses politics.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who worked as an advisor for the Trump administration, left Trump’s business advisory councils after the president announced his decision. “Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,” Musk said when he announced his departure. Trump previously met with tech leaders last December before he took office. Musk, Cook, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and other tech leaders attended the summit at Trump Tower. At that time Trump praised the tech sector, promised to do "anything we can do" to help the industry and even told executives to call him or his people directly if they needed anything.

Bret Kenwell InvestorPlace June 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A few weeks ago, we said that it was “Do or Die Time” for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). At that time, shares took a dive from earnings, rallied on rumors of a deal with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and fell when doubts came along. At that point, AMD stock was just above support and we weren’t sure if it would hold. View photos AMD Stock: Is Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock on a Comeback?More Source: Matthew Rutledge via Flickr From our perspective, the bulls were still in control, but barely. If the $10 level were to fail, bears would seize control. That didn’t happen though, as AMD stock put together a more than 13% rally over the past three days. So what should investors do? We’ll get to the technical outlook in a moment, but first, let’s touch on the fundamentals. Inside Advanced Micro Devices Why did AMD stock get such a strong bounce in early June? Two reasons really drove it higher. The first, it became known that Advanced Micro Devices’ RX 500 graphic chips can be used to “mine” cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This product launched in April and is still sold out at many online retailers. This has investors optimistic that revenue will be strong and demand will continue once retailers are able to restock. Given Bitcoin’s bubble-like rise, the mania certainly looks set to continue for some time. Additionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) just held an enormous event, its WWDC conference. Aside from big announcements regarding the HomePod speaker, a new iOS and everything here, there was something else for AMD. Investors are cheering for AMD’s RX Vega GPU. Specifically, that the iMac Pro will use one of two types from the Vega lineup, the Radeon Pro Vega 56 or the Radeon Pro Vega 64. Both are quite powerful and will be the driving computing force in Apple’s new devices. The effort likely comes on Apple’s part of trying to boost its virtual reality capabilities. Advanced Micro Devices’ recent additions bode well for its business moving forward. Management is returning the company to profitability in 2017, which is a lot harder than it sounds. Over the past nine months, debt has fallen 37% and its valuation (compared to Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel) is attractive. Trading AMD Stock AMD stock, AMD, Advanced Micro DevicesMore Click to Enlarge Source: Stockcharts.com So where does that leave AMD stock? I’m a levels-guy first, meaning I look for historic areas of support and resistance. I like to keep it simple. In Advanced Micro Devices’ case, that level comes into play around $12.25. On Tuesday, AMD made it to $12, but it was unclear if it would climb above it. On Wednesday, AMD stock flew past it, up to $13 at one point. AMD stock is now above the 50-day moving average too. And even though it gave up the bulk of its gains on Wednesday with that instant pullback from $13, it was a constructive move. Finally, there’s the relative strength index and the MACD. The RSI (blue circle) tells us if a stock is overbought when the reading is above 70. Fortunately, AMD stock is not in this territory yet. MACD tells us momentum. For AMD, momentum is positive, but appears to be nowhere near running out of gas. Both of these indicators are bullish. Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is Heading to $170 So are there negatives? Yes, a few. Although not pictured, AMD has not gotten above its 100-day moving average. Additionally, the two red stars on the chart mark where AMD stock has struggled, failing to clear $13. Given the strong volume the past few days, it is more likely the stock trades higher rather than lower. A move below $12 and the 50-day moving average may change that. But like we said a few weeks ago, for now, AMD stock is still running with the bulls. Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell. As of this writing, Bret Kenwell held no position in any stocks mentioned.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why Intel Corporation Is Doing Something Strange With Coffee Lake Intel's upcoming chipset strangeness may be explained by the company's manufacturing plans and capabilities. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 10, 2017 at 11:45AM In August, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is expected to release the first of what appears to be two waves of its eighth-generation Core processors (code-named Coffee Lake) for the desktop market. The first wave is expected to consist of four- and six-core processors targeted specifically at the enthusiast/gaming market -- a market that Intel has repeatedly said is growing at a double-digit percentage rate. Image source: Intel. These Coffee Lake-S chips will work with motherboards that use a platform controller hub (PCH) chip branded Z370. What's interesting is that after the initial wave of Z370-based motherboards come out, the company is reportedly planning to launch a second wave of PCH chips for the Coffee Lake-S platform coincident with the broader rollout of the processor family in the desktop personal computer market. The Z370 chip, according to ASMedia president Lin Che-Wei (via DigiTimes), "will not natively support USB 3.1." This seems to corroborate the rumor that's been floating around that Z370 is basically a rebadged version of the Z270 with the "real" 300-series PCH chips (with additional features) coming in the first half of 2018. Why is Intel planning to do this? Let's take a closer look. The Coffee Lake pull-in Intel had originally planned to launch the Coffee Lake desktop processors in the first quarter of next year, but it appears that competitive pressures in the enthusiast/gaming processor market are pushing Intel to try to refresh its offerings here as soon as practicable. Transitioning from seventh-generation Core processors (Kaby Lake) to eighth-generation Core processors likely doesn't have a significant impact on the company's manufacturing plans. The Coffee Lake-S chips are expected to be manufactured in the company's 14nm++ technology, which is a derivative/enhancement of the 14nm+ technology that's already being used to build the Kaby Lake chips. Switching over a relatively small portion of the company's overall processor volumes from 14nm+ parts to slightly larger 14nm++ parts shouldn't pose much of an issue from a capacity perspective (particularly as Intel usually keeps some capacity on a given manufacturing technology unused as "whitespace" to account for upsides in demand). However, transitioning from manufacturing the Z270 chipset to the "true" 300-series PCH chips early would likely pose some issues. A full-node transition The Z270 PCH, and almost certainly the Z370 PCH, are manufactured using Intel's 22-nanometer technology. Intel indicated at its recent Technology and Manufacturing Day that it plans to transition its PCH chips to its 14-nanometer technology in the first half of 2018. I expect, then, that the "true" 300-series PCH chips will be manufactured in some flavor of the company's 14-nanometer technology. While I suspect that the various 14-nanometer derivatives are manufactured using largely the same manufacturing infrastructure, 22-nanometer chips are manufactured using distinct equipment and capacity. So, if Intel had planned for its 22-nanometer factories to be busy building the bulk of the company's PCH chips through 2017, then it'd be hard to change course midway through the year for a couple of reasons: Ending Z270 production on 22-nanometer could lead to underutilized 22-nanometer factories, which would negatively impact the company's gross profit margins. Starting 300-series PCH production on a 14-nanometer derivative could require incremental 14-nanometer capacity that just isn't there (Intel may have, for example, planned to gradually transition the 22-nanometer capacity to 14-nanometer capacity over the course of the year), leading to product shortages and lost sales. To deal with this product pull-in, it therefore makes more sense for Intel to "rebadge" Z270 as Z370 to allow it to work in motherboard designs intended for the true 300-series PCH chips and then transition to those 300-series PCH chips when the Coffee Lake chips were originally planned to launch.

Aaeon has launched a line of OMNI-500 All-in-One panel PCs in three models with 12.1-, 15-, and 21.5-inch capacitive touchscreens. The two smaller models offer an Intel “Bay Trail” Celeron J1900 with four up to 2.0GHz cores and a 10W TDP, and the 21.5-inch model uses a dual-core, up to 2.4GHz Core i5-6300U or optional dual-core Celeron 3995U. Both of these 15W processors belong to Intel’s 6th Generation “Skylake-U” family. The systems have back-mounted computers that are very similar, but not identical, to Aaeon’s recent OMNI-BT and OMNI Skylake standalone panel PCs. OMNI-5125-BT (click images to enlarge) The three systems are as follows: OMNI-5125-BT — 12.1-inch — Celeron J1900 OMNI-5155-BT — 15-inch — Celeron J1900 OMNI-5215-SKU — 21.5-inch — Core i5-6300U; optional Celeron 3995U The OMNI-5000 systems run Linux (2.6x and above) or Windows 10/8.1/7, and are designed for “smart industrial manufacturing” applications including HMI, quality management, integrated factory automation, manufacturing execution systems, and data-driven service management, says Aaeon. Compared to Aaeon’s earlier AIO panel PC systems, the new models are touted for their “newly enhanced thermal management system” and new aluminum casing, including a IP65-protected front panel that “prevents acid corrosion, water infiltration and panel abrasion.” OMNI-5155-BT (click images to enlarge) Other highlights are said to include “foolproof voltage protection,” as well as a “unique” All-In-One back cover, and a “state-of-art heatsink.” There’s also wide-range 9 to 30V DC input, and a “personable and nimble Panel Mount Bracket” touted for its ease of installation. Earlier OMNI-BT (left) and unnamed Skylake-based OMNI (click images to enlarge) The OMNI-5125-BT and OMNI-5155-BT are based closely on the OMNI-BT system. The main differences are the addition of more serial ports, and the lack of vibration resistance and Aaeon’s proprietary OMNI expansion interface. Instead of using the OMNI format, the new systems provide dual full-size mini-PCIe slots, which offer a rough equivalent. A SIM card slot is also available The two new Celeron-based systems are almost identical to each other except for the screen size and their slightly different temperature ranges: -20 to 60°C for the 12.1-inch OMNI-5125-BT and -10 to 60°C for the 15-inch OMNI-5155-BT. Both the OMNI-5125-BT and OMNI-5155-BT have backlit screens with 1024 x 768 resolution, with luminance of 500 and 450 nits, respectively, and viewing angles of 160°/160° and 160°/140°. Standard features on the OMNI-5125-BT and OMNI-5155-BT include up to 8GB DDR3L-1333 RAM, dual GbE ports, a SATA 2.5-inch bay, and a CFast storage socket. There are 3x USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0, and HDMI and VGA ports. Other features include 3x DB9 serial ports (2x RS-232/422/485, 1x RS-232), audio line out, and a 3-pin terminal block for the 9-30V DC input. Detail view for the OMNI-5125-BT (similar to OMNI-5155-BT) at left and OMNI-5215-SKU detail (click images to enlarge) The Skylake-based OMNI-5215-SKU closely resembles the unnamed Skylake based OMNI panel PC system that was unveiled in March with the OMNI-BT. The biggest difference aside from the lack of an OMNI interface and vibration resistance is the inclusion of 3x GbE ports instead of one. OMNI-5215-SKU (click images to enlarge) The OMNI-5215-SKU supports up to 8GB of DDR4 and offers a SATA bay, but there’s no CFast slot and only one mini-PCIe slot. Other features include 4x USB 3.0 ports, 2x RS-232/422/485 ports, an HDMI port, a SIM card slot, and a 3-pin terminal block for the 9-30V input. The 21.5-inch screen can display 1920 x 1080 pixels, and has 250 nits luminance and 178°/178° viewing angles. Panel and VESA mounting are available, and the system can withstand -20 to 60°C temperatures.   Further information No pricing or availability information was provided for the new OMNI-5000 AIO systems. More information may be found at Aaeon’s OMNI-5125-BT, OMNI-5155-BT, and OMNI-5215-SKU product pages.   Related posts: Rugged panel-PC runs Linux, offers piggy-back add-ons Compact, rugged box-PC has four GbE ports, runs Linux 3.5-inch SBC features Intel Skylake CPUs, dual GbE,… Newborn Mini-ITX twins run Linux on Bay Trail SoCs Rugged 10.1-inch panel PC has quad-core CPU, dual GbE Linux-friendly Celeron based 3.5-inch SBC has four GbE ports Rugged, expandable touch panel PCs come in Skylake… Tough box-PCs support dual GbE, dual displays, wireless Rugged, fanless Skylake box-PC has triple GbE and dual HDMI Rugged, 3.5-inch SBC expands upon Skylake (advertise here) PLEASE COMMENT BELOW Please comment here...

Digital Trends Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 review The Matebook X is proof Huawei can build world-class PCs Share The Matebook X is a superbly engineered laptop that puts Huawei’s competitors on notice. The Matebook X is a superbly engineered laptop that puts Huawei’s competitors on notice. The Matebook X is a superbly engineered laptop that puts Huawei’s competitors on notice. Highs Precise design Excellent keyboard Color-accurate display Lows Too expensive for its hardware So-so battery endurance DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Laptop Reviews > Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 review By Matt Smith Posted on 06.09.17 Research Center: Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 Huawei is a name that you’ve probably heard of, though if you’re not deep into smartphones, you may not know from where. The Chinese giant has earned a small following in the west, built on the back of its affordable yet feature-rich smartphones. The Huawei Honor 8 Pro, which recently received a Recommended award from us, is the perfect example. It packs the latest hardware and a dual-lens camera, yet sells for hundreds less than an iPhone 7 or Galaxy S8. The company doesn’t want to be limited to smartphones, however. It’s eyeing the PC, and launched its first efforts in North America last year. It put the brand off to a rough start. The original Matebook tried to serve as a budget alternative to Microsoft’s Surface Pro, but terrible hard drive performance and a small battery left it unable to compete. Huawei hasn’t backed down. It’s returned this year with several new products, one of which is the MateBook X. Don’t be fooled by the name. Instead of targeting the Surface Pro, the MateBook X is going after Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, and Asus’ Zenbook 3. To do so, it equips the usual set of hardware for a high-end, super-thin PC. That means an Intel Core i5-7200U processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB hard drive. Frankly, internal components won’t make-or-break the MateBook X. Huawei’s notebook competes in a category that’s all about attractive design and long battery life. Does it have what it takes to make it out on the open road? Similar, but not a clone It’d be easy to dismiss the Matebook X as a MacBook clone. The two systems look very similar, right down to all-metal unibody design and Huawei’s suspiciously spacey take on the color gray. The two systems even place the speakers in the same location. There are subtle differences, however. The MateBook X has thinner display bezels, which gives it a smaller overall footprint, and helps it retains an upscale feel. Despite that, Huawei found room to squeeze in an extra USB Type-C port (the MacBook only has one). Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Admittedly, it does lack the precision refinement found in the 12-inch MacBook. Apple’s industrial design is famous for a reason, and as a result, the MacBook feels more robust. This is present in subtle touches like the overall balance of the chassis, and the smooth action of the display hinge. Even so, the MateBook X is well crafted. It seems solid no matter how it’s held and resists even purposeful attempts to flex the chassis. In fact, we prefer it to the Mac’s design – while not quite as refined, its thinner bezels and extra port add functional benefits. We do think it a step behind the Asus Zenbook 3, however, which is still the slickest laptop we’ve laid hands on. Thin on ports, of course Aside from the two USB Type-C ports previously mentioned, the MateBook X also has a headphone jack. And that’s it. There’s no card reader. Wireless connectivity includes 802.11ac Wi-FI and Bluetooth 4.1. Huawei Matebook X WT-W09 Compared To Lenovo Yoga 720 13-inch Origin EON17-SLX Acer Chromebook 15 Asus VivoBook V551LB-DB71T Acer Aspire V7 Sony Vaio Pro 13 Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (2013) HP Pavilion 14 Chromebook HP Spectre XT TouchSmart ASUS Zenbook UX51Vz Acer Aspire S3 Apple MacBook Air 13.3-inch… Sony Vaio S Series Apple MacBook Air (11.6-inch) Sony VAIO C1MW PictureBook Huawei says some markets will receive a small MateDock 2, which adds extra ports, and/or a USB-C to USB Type-A adapter. Our review unit didn’t ship with either accessory. A surprisingly superb keyboard Ultrathin laptops like the MateBook X look good, but they often have problems when it comes time to use them, with the keyboard at the heart of the issue. A thin profile means limited room for each key to move, and that can seriously annoy touch typists. We prefer the Matebook X to the Mac overall. Apparently, no one told Huawei about the problem. It simply isn’t here. The keys boast 1.2 millimeters of travel, which is slightly limited compared to devices like the Dell XPS 13, but superior to the MacBook’s 0.5 millimeters, and the Asus Zenbook 3’s 0.8 millimeters. In fact, the Huawei’s keyboard felt great. Blindfold us, and we’d never know it belongs to a laptop less than half an inch thick. Keyboard backlighting is standard. The lighting looks even beneath each key, and there’s minimal light leak. However, only two brightness settings are available. While that is not uncommon, we prefer to see more choice in brightness selection. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends A large touchpad can be found under the keyboard. It supports all Windows Precision Touchpad features and proved responsive in day-to-day use, including multi-touch gestures. That’s good, because a touchscreen is not available, even as an option. Clicking the touchpad produces a slightly hollow sound, so Huawei could do more work to tune that action – but that is a minor complaint. Above the keyboard is a fingerprint reader which serves as the power button. It’s Windows Hello compatible, and worked incredibly well – better than any Windows-compatible fingerprint reader we’ve tried in years. It’s a convenient extra that shaves a few seconds from the time between when you open the notebook and when you start using it. Great to look at… Huawei ships the Matebook X with a 13-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 display with a 3:2 aspect ratio, which means it’s taller relative to its width than the more typical 16:9 notebook screen. Its pixel density works out to about 200 pixels per inch. That’s a bit behind the 12-inch MacBook, which boasts 2,304 x 1,400 resolution, and quite a bit better than the Asus Zenbook 3, which is stuck at 1080p. Though it’s at a slight pixel disadvantage against the MacBook, it’s hard to tell the difference in normal use. The display looks extremely sharp in all situations. Better still, it also looks vivid and bright. High-resolution photos appear crystal-clear and look just as they should in real life. While the Macbook looks every bit as vibrant, the Zenbook 3 is at a disadvantage, as red and blues look dull on its screen. Our tests confirmed what our eyes told us. We found it offered excellent color accuracy, hitting an average color error value of just 1.25. Lower is better in this test, and anything below one is difficult to notice with the human eye, so that’s a great result. We also saw a solid brightness of 377 nits and a color gamut that covers 100 percent of sRGB. Both figures are right in line with top-tier competitors like the Zenbook 3, or even Dell’s XPS 13. There’s just one weakness – contrast. Our test showed a contrast ratio of 660:1, while most competitors exceed 900:1. It didn’t make a noticeable difference in most situations, but the background of a dark movie can often look rather gray, instead of inky black. The category standout in this area is Samsung’s Galaxy Book, which has an OLED display, and boasts deeper black levels than any other laptop or 2-in-1 we’ve tested. …and great to listen to Audio is another place Huawei doesn’t follow the ultrathin notebook script. The MateBook X features Dolby Atmos branded speakers that put out surprising oomph. While it obviously can’t compete with a decent pair of desktop speakers, the notebook’s tiny sound system serves up serious volume and even a hint of bass. Push the volume up far enough, and the limits of the system break down into distortion and an ever-present hiss. But the audio becomes more than loud enough before it reaches that point. The Core i5 performed as expected Our review unit arrived with a Core i5-7200U processor and eight gigabytes of RAM. That is, at this point, a completely normal loadout, even for a laptop this thin. Yet thermal design can impact performance, as shown below. All the systems in the graphs have some form of Core i5 processor. The benchmark scores are tight in Geekbench 4 single-core testing. Huawei’s Matebook X comes in at the bottom with a score of 3,703, but that’s only 8 percent below the fastest system, Dell’s XPS 13 with Core i5-7200U. Geekbench 4 multi-core, scores are similarly closed, but the Huawei gained some ground here with a mid-pack performance. Again, though – the differences are minor. Blindfold us, and we’d never know the keyboard belongs to a laptop less than half an inch thick. Handbrake, our most strenuous test, put the Matebook X in front of the Asus Zenbook 3, but behind larger peers like the Dell XPS 13. This test, which involves transcoding 4K video from h.264 to h.265, took over 20 minutes to complete. That’s enough time to start seeing the thermal limitations in each notebook, and the scores spread as a result. With that said, though, the Matebook X is not ideal if video transcoding or encoding is task you’d often perform. The Core i5-7200U will do in a pinch, but a quad-core processor would be preferable, and that’s not available in any half-inch thick laptop. What about the MacBook? We did not test it in Geekbench 4 at the time we reviewed it, and it’s been updated since then. However, it’s fair to say all 12-inch Macbook models would prove slower if we tested them today. They use variants of Intel Core processors that draw less power than most, and run at lower clock speeds. A fast hard drive Huawei has smartly decided on a solid state hard drive that connects over PCI Express, and that results in strong performance. In fact, the Matebook X performed very well next to similar systems. It beat them slightly in read speeds, and significantly in write speeds. This is not a difference that’s noticeable in day-to-day use, but it would matter when moving large files. It also helps the Matebook X boot in less than ten seconds. Again, the Macbook is not part of our graphs as it’s been revised since our last review. Hard drive performance is a strong point for Apple, though, so we’d expect it to beat the Matebook X. It might even do so by a wide margin. Don’t buy this for games – of course If anyone says the Matebook X is a gaming laptop, call a doctor – they’re suffering from a serious fever. Still, we run every notebook through 3DMark’s Fire Strike test to see how they compare. The results aren’t inspiring, but they are reliable. These systems run Intel HD 620 graphics, so they all perform almost the same – except the Asus Zenbook 3, which falls behind. The Matebook X can load and play many 3D games, but it won’t be able to play at high detail, even at 1080p resolution. To provide an example, we loaded and ran the benchmark in Civilization VI at 1080p resolution and minimum detail. The game turned in an average of 16 frames per second, which is technically playable, but certainly not enjoyable. As for the Macbook – while the test systems in our graph aren’t good, the 12-inch Macbook is truly hopeless. It runs an even less powerful version of Intel HD graphics (Intel HD 615). Even games that are several years old will prove a major challenge. Small laptop, small battery The Matebook X is, alongside the Asus Zenbook 3, one of the lightest and most portable 13-inch notebooks we’ve ever seen. Its weight, at 2.31 pounds, is slightly heavier than the Macbook and Zenbook 3, both of which weigh about two pounds. Still, it’s not a PC that’ll burden you when it’s thrown in a bag. Huawei has squeezed a 41.4 watt-hour battery into the notebook’s thin frame. That’s on par with its competitors, but smaller than notebooks like the Dell XPS 13, which has a 60-watt hour battery. Reducing capacity is necessary to keep the Matebook X thin. So, what does that mean for a battery life? As shown in the graphs above, it means compromise, though the compromise is not too severe. The Matebook X lasted almost five hours in the Peacekeeper web benchmark loop, and just over nine hours in a 1080p video loop. These results are likely enough for many users, but they do come in slightly behind most competitors. The Asus Zenbook 3 lasted just a few minutes less in Peacekeeper, and about a half-hour longer in the 1080p video loop. What about the MacBook? Again, our test results are no longer representative of the current model, so we can’t say for sure. However, Apple also claims to use a 41.1-watt hour battery, and boasts up to 12 hours of movie playback. We have found in past reviews that MacBooks last longer than Windows laptops with the same battery capacity, so the newest MacBook is likely to beat the MateBook X. Barely there software There’s no reason to worry about bloatware here. Our review unit came only with the MateBook Manager, a utility to adjust various settings and also update the laptop’s firmware, including the BIOS. It also supports an “instant online” feature for tethering to a smartphone’s Internet, but this requires a Huawei ID, and we did not have chance to use it. Warranty information Huawei ships the Matebook X with a one-year warranty, as is typical for the category. Our Take Huawei’s Matebook X is a wonderful second try at making a beautiful, high-end PC. Sleek, light, and fast, it’s simply a great day-to-day system. Battery life is only ok, as is true of its peers, and comes behind thicker laptops that can hold more juice. However, there is one potential problem. The price. Huawei did not quote us a final U.S. price in time for this review, forcing us to fall back on the European price of 1,400 Euros. That currently works out to about $1,560 dollars, which is way too much. Even $1,400 would be pushing it. We hope that Huawei will drastically slash the U.S. price, and asked for clarification during this review. Huawei was not able to provide the U.S. price, but we will update this review that information becomes available. Is there a better alternative? The Razer Blade Stealth is an alternative for gamers, but will require the purchase of an external graphics dock. Asus’ Zenbook 3 is a bit more attractive, but it’s keyboard and display aren’t quite as good. The MacBook is smaller and lighter, but not as powerful. We prefer using the Matebook X to these systems, but at its current target price, it’s hard to recommend it over any aside from the 12-inch MacBook. The Asus Zenbook 3, for instance, can be purchased with almost identical hardware for only $1,000. How long will it last? We thought the Matebook X felt sturdy in our tests, and its hardware is up to date. It should last three years without issue, and may even still be useful after a half-decade. Should you buy it? Not at its current expected price. We must assume it will be expensive until told otherwise, and the fact it currently seems more expensive than competitors is a major issue. It’s a great laptop, but it’s hard to imagine paying $500 more for the Matebook X over an Asus Zenbook 3, when the two systems offer similar performance and battery life. We will update this review when Huawei releases U.S. pricing.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder Bloomberg News Jun 9, 2017 at 3:33 pm | Print View Verizon, AT&T and the rest of the U.S. wireless industry have a big boast for this year’s crop of smartphones. Thanks to network upgrades, devices will be able to download as much as a gigabit of data in a single second — speeds 100 times faster than before. But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc.’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones. The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device — in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network. One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc., sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp., is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision. The shares fell as much as 1.6 percent, to $152.56, in New York on Friday, the biggest intraday drop since May 17. Apple in theory could use Qualcomm’s chips. But it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others. Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment. Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top U.S. wireless carriers — Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp. — have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds. Like what you're reading?

But today one report is focusing on a feature that the next iPhone might lack. Apple’s next iPhones won’t include support for gigabit LTE speeds, claims sources speaking to Bloomberg. That’s because while Qualcomm currently offers a modem with support for 1 gigabit LTE download speeds, Intel doesn’t yet have such a modem available. Apple has been using both modems in its devices, and the company reportedly doesn’t want to rely on a single supplier for parts in its flagship device. Apple and Qualcomm are currently in the middle of a legal battle, with the former company claiming that the latter one has been abusing its position as a manufacturer of important cellphone chips to ask for unreasonable patent licensing terms. So Apple will likely end up using modems from both Qualcomm and Intel in its next iPhones. And while those Qualcomm modems may be capable of 1 gigabit LTE download speeds, Apple probably doesn’t want to end up offering one version of iPhone that can achieve gigabit LTE speeds and another version that can’t. All four major US carriers are working toward offering gigabit LTE speeds, with some claiming that we could see this service launch in 2017. We’ll have to wait and see if that pans out for the carriers and if Apple does end up shipping its new iPhones without gigabit LTE support, but even if those things happen, the lack of gigabit LTE may not be a huge deal for Apple’s new iPhones.

Photo: Molly Riley/AFP/Getty Images Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced that he will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday in order to address issues brought up by former FBI director James Comey’s Senate testimony on Thursday. Sessions had already been scheduled to appear before the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees about the budget on Tuesday, but has opted to send Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to that hearing instead. The reason for the change, according to a letter that Sessions sent Senate Appropriations Subcommittee chair Richard Shelby on Saturday, was that he learned some members of that committee had announced that they would question him about the Justice Department’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. “In light of reports regarding Mr. Comey’s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,” Sessions wrote, adding that the Senate Intelligence Committee “is the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information.” It’s not yet clear if the Senate Intel hearing on Tuesday will be open or closed. Sessions, who was a member of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign last year, was forced to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in March after it emerged that he had twice met with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak last year despite having previously told lawmakers in January, under oath, that he hadn’t had any contacts with Russians during the campaign. On Thursday, Comey testified that he had expected Sessions to recuse himself weeks before he actually did, explaining that the FBI was “aware of facts that I can’t discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.” Later that day, it was reported that Comey testified during a subsequent closed session that Sessions may have had a third undisclosed meeting with Kislyak, according to intercepts of Russian communications. The Senate Intelligence Committee then requested documents and an interview from Sessions, while Democratic lawmakers starting calling for Sessions to resign and/or be prosecuted for perjury — if the third meeting with Kislyak did indeed happen. Two weeks ago, it was also reported that Sessions also neglected to disclose his meetings with Kislyak in his application for security clearance at the Justice Department, though a DOJ spokesperson later tried to explain that Sessions had been instructed not to list such meetings — if they happened as part of his normal activities as a senator. Despite recusing himself from the Russia investigation, Sessions later participated in the firing of James Comey, a move which Trump eventually acknowledged was because of his unhappiness with Comey over the Russia investigation. It’s still not clear exactly what role Sessions had in the firing, or the debate over the firing, but that is another issue which may come up at the hearing on Tuesday. Also this past week, it was reported that Sessions’s relationship with President Trump had soured to the point that Sessions had offered to resign if Trump no longer wanted him to serve as attorney general. Trump has reportedly remained furious with Sessions over his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation, especially since leadership of the investigation then fell to Rosenstein, who eventually appointed former FBI director Bob Mueller as a special prosecutor to take over the investigation last month.

Marc Kasowitz, Trump's reported pick, is a partner at Kasowitz, Benson, Torres and Friedman. That happens to be the firm where former Sen. Joe Lieberman currently works. And Lieberman  is rumored  to be Trump's top choice for FBI director. SEE MORE: Trump Reportedly Asked Intel Chiefs To Deny Evidence In Russia Probe Kasowitz has represented Trump several times in the past. During the campaign, he sent an angry letter to The New York Times  demanding it pull  down its coverage of sexual assault claims against Trump. The White House already has a lawyer on staff, but his job is more focused on defending the office of the president, not the individual. A personal lawyer can also invoke attorney-client privilege to keep legal advice confidential; federal employees don't have that luxury. Trump might not be alone, either —  Politico reports  that some West Wing employees are searching around for affordable private legal help in case they get caught up in an investigation.

Sessions’ press release states that he will appear before the committee in order to respond to what the former FBI director said about him and the investigations into Russia’s 2016 election-meddling. Sessions was supposed to go before the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees this week, but his statement says that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will take his place for those hearings. NEW: Sessions accepts invite to appear before Senate Intel Committee; Dep. AG Rosenstein to take his place before Appropriations committees. pic.twitter.com/EesQAjXfQT — ABC News (@ABC) June 10, 2017 “In light of reports regarding Mr. Comey’s recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is important that I have an opportunity to address these matters in the appropriate forum,” Sessions said. “The Senate Intelligence Committee is the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information.” Sessions recused himself from the ongoing Russian investigations, due to two undisclosed meetings he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the election. On Thursday, Comey said in his testimony that Sessions had a third meeting with Kislyak over the course of last year. Sessions’ appearance will take place on June 13.

For over a decade, Rakesh and his wife worked on a technical communication outsourcing company they founded called The Writers Block, which has worked with high profile companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Oracle. However, financial success only proved that money truly doesn’t buy happiness. The happiness heart craved finally came into being in 2009, when a Golden Retriever he named Kavyla came into his life. According to Oddity Central, “When we got home, she went and hid in a corner. I got down to her level on the floor and I was calling out to her. She was looking at me, she was scared, but I could see she wanted to trust me,” Rakesh recalled,  “And that’s when the moment happened—it was a physical feeling, my hair was tingling, I could feel a warm glow. And I’ve never needed to ask myself that question—’why am I here?’—again after that.” His love for his new canine companion inspired him to adopt another dog three months later, a stray he would name Lucky. Over the next few weeks, he found himself adopting more and more dogs until his wife could no longer bear it. Fortunately, his prior business success meant that Rakesh could afford to take care of his dogs, and he converted the top floor of his building into a dog shelter. This alone was not enough for Rakesh. He eventually founded the Voice of Stray Dogs, or VoSD. “VoSD rescue is essentially my private infrastructure that I opened to the city to save its dogs. Dogs that are my love. To do so I created the most automated and tightly managed rescue in the world,” Rakesh wrote on social media, “My vehicles & people are GPS tracked. Each dog has a reference and exhaustive database entries and more. You get SMS’, emails, online access. There is no rescue app like the VoSD Rescue App in the world. There is no enterprise CRM like the VoSD CRM in the world. There is no individualised tracking like VoSD provides in the world.” Afterwards, he eventually bought land in the neighboring Doddballapur town and converted it into another dog shelter. As of the last time he counted, he had a whopping 735 dogs in his care. While it might seem excessive, he might be their only hope. “I’m the last stop for these dogs. They are no longer cute and cuddly. Many are sick and no longer wanted,” Rakesh told the BBC. After spending millions of dollars to rescue thousands of dogs over the years, Rakesh has been forced to start charging people who want stray dogs to be rescued. “Earlier, we entertained all calls, where many turned out to be fake. After a spate of bad experiences, we have decided that whoever wants to have a dog rescued has to register online and pay a nominal amount of Rs 2,500 per dog, ” Rakesh explained, “This way , we will know that they are serious about what they want to do.” While he has been praised by many for is efforts in Bangalor, not everyone is happy about his venture. He said he has, at times, received complaints of public unrest for his keeping so many dogs, has been sabotaged in the past by people claiming to be animal activists and demanding access to his facilities, and some have even tried to get his shelter shut down. However, this is a small price to pay to protect these beloved Canines. “I’ve made a pact with my dogs,” he said. “We will part only when one of us kicks the bucket.” Editor’s Picks Colleges Funnel Millions Into On-Campus Startups The Dark Origins of Communism: Part 3 of 3 Trump’s Air Traffic Reform Looks to the Future Receive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter Important stories from around the world, in your inbox daily.

NEWS & ANALYSIS: Big Data Algorithms, Languages Expand News & Analysis EC Refs Whistle Qualcomm-NXP Deal Qualcomm's increased isolation in the world is palpable Junko Yoshida 6/10/2017 05:50 PM EDT 1 Comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet MADISON, Wis. — The European Commission Friday (June 9) threw down a gauntlet by officially opening an in-depth investigation into the proposed acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm. The move is a monkey wrench in the two chip companies’ merger, adding at least four months to the resolution process. The Commission has “until 17 October 2017, to take a decision” on this matter, according the EC. It’s uncertain to judge the impact on the eventual merger. Qualcomm and NXP had announced expectations to close the deal at the end of 2017. Since last October, when the Qualcomm-NXP union was revealed, a lot has happened. Qualcomm, embroiled in lonely legal battles in different parts of the world, operates today in a very toxic business and legal environment. Qualcomm’s legal fights involve not only competitors but also with its own customers and customers’ customers. These disputes have left Qualcomm with very few allies in the industry. A case in point is an upcoming FTC hearing in San Jose (scheduled on June 15). Both Intel and Samsung filed amicus briefs in support of the FTC’s complaint against Qualcomm. The same goes for Europe. Preliminary concerns raised by the Commission speak volumes about how the European industry views Qualcomm. The San Diego-based company has become a major concerns for the EC and Qualcomm’s rivals on the European market, due to its perceived anti-competitive behavior (“bundling or tying”) and the company’s hardball tactics over IP licensing practices (“increased royalties” and “exclusion of competitors”). Three worries Which specific areas of semiconductor technology and products did the Commission -- in initial investigations – find problematic in the Qualcomm/NXP merger? The three areas over which the Commission raised a red flag are NFC, mobile devices and emerging V2X (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure) automotive technology. Here’s what the Commission spelled out: -The merged entity would hold strong market positions within both baseband chipsets and NFC/SEs chips, and would have the ability and incentive to exclude their rival suppliers from these markets through practices such as bundling or tying. -The merged entity would have the ability and incentive to modify NXP's current intellectual property licensing practices, in particular in relation to NFC technology, including by bundling the acquired NFC intellectual property to Qualcomm's patent portfolio. The Commission will investigate whether such conduct could lead to anticompetitive effects, such as increased royalties for customers and/or exclusion of competitors   -The merger would remove competition between companies active in the markets for semiconductors used in the automotive sector and, in particular, in the emerging Vehicle-to-Everything ("V2X") technology, which will play an important role in the future development of "connected cars". It’s unclear whether Qualcomm saw this EC backlash coming. It had until June 1 to propose concessions that might allay competition concerns about the NXP acquisition. Instead, the company oozed confident, banking on its ability to sell regulators on the proposition that the deal is not anti-competitive. The EC clearly did not bite. In April, relatively lenient antitrust forces in the U.S. cleared the Qualcomm-NXP merger without conditions. But now, on top of the EC’s in-depth investigation, Qualcomm faces negotiations with China’s Ministry of Commerce – historically the toughest refs in the global game.

The Asus Chromebook Flip C101 is a consumer-oriented thin and light model that weighs 2 pounds and features a Rockchip RK3399 processor and a 10.1 inch  display. But Asus also quietly added a bigger, heavier, education-oriented model to its lineup as well. The 2.8 pound Asus Chromebook Flip C213NA has an 11.6 inch display, a rugged design, and an Intel Celeron N3350 processor. And it looks like the Chromebook Flip C213 is coming soon for about $350. Amazon has a product page for the laptop, and the retailer is taking orders for $349, but the notebook is described as “temporarily out of stock.” CDW and Promevo are showing similar prices. While this Intel-powered model isn’t quite as compact as the version with a Rockchip processor, it has a few nifty features including a 1600 x 900 pixel display, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, two USB 3.0 Type-C ports, two USB Type-A ports, and a camera above the keyboard that lets you snap pictures or make videos when the computer is in tent mode. The system measures 12.1″ x 7.8″ x 0.8″ and features a 45 Wh battery that’s estimated to be good for up to 12 hours of battery life. via Chrome Unboxed Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Zotac’s latest fanless mini PCs now available for $160 and up (barebones) 06/09/2017 at 4:30 PM by Brad Linder 7 Comments Zotac is updating its line of fanless mini desktops with new models sporting low-cost, low-power Intel Apollo Lake chips as well as new models with higher-power (and price) Kaby Lake processors. Now the first of those new systems are available for purchase. You can pick up a Zotac ZBOX CI327 nano with a Celeron N3450 quad-core processor for as little as $159. Prices for a CI5127 nano with a Core i3-7100U start at about $325. A CI547 nano with a Core i5-7200U chip will set you back about $392. Note that all of those prices are for barebones models. You get the case, power supply, processor, 802.11ac WiFI, Bluetooth 4.2, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, and a set of ports that include USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and USB 3.0 Type-C. But you’ll need to supply your own memory, storage, and operating system. So the final price for a complete system will depend on how much you’re willing to spend on those components.   Each computer in the Zotac ZBOX C-series lineup features passive cooling, which means there’s no spinning fan inside the case and there’s plenty of ventilation to help hot air escape. This could make the little computers ideal for use as media centers or in work or home environments where you want a system that will operate without making any noise. I’ve been tempted for a while to pick up something like this for use in my makeshift home recording studio, since it’d save me the trouble of trying to eliminate fan noise emanating from my computer from recordings. But I should probably put acoustic paneling up before I spend money on a new PC. via FanlessTech Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 7 Comments on "Zotac’s latest fanless mini PCs now available for $160 and up (barebones)" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Guest roni Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

It has been very reliable with Debian Jessie, and snappy enough for desktop use even when its been on for weeks with dozens of firefox tabs open. And it powers 3 different monitors with VGA, HDMI & Display Port.

The press is "facing a massive credibility crisis," Hannity said on his Fox News show Friday night. ADVERTISEMENT "Yesterday the former FBI director James Comey, 'J. Edgar Comey,' told the Senate Intel Committee that many of the media's Russia collusion stories are 'just dead wrong,'" Hannity continued. During his testimony, the former FBI director said that "many, many stories purportedly based on classified information about, well, about lots of stuff but especially about Russia, that are just dead wrong." Comey was specifically asked about a The New York Times report titled “Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence” that he said was "not true." The paper was forced to defend their work. Hannity targeted MSNBC's Chris Matthews as a top Trump critic who had been silenced by Comey's testimony. "Even 'Mr. Thrill-up-his-leg' himself, Chris Matthews came to this stunning conclusion," Hannity continued, playing a video of Matthews saying that Trump's critics' theory "came apart" on Thursday. "I was even shocked," Hannity quipped. "They've been lying to you, the American people," Hannity said of the media. He pointed to corrections at CNN and ABC that were made after the hearing when, counter to some predictions, Comey confirmed Trump's claims that he told the president he wasn't personally under investigation. Hannity has been criticized recently for promoting debunked conspiracy theories about a murdered DNC staffer on his show. Advertisers fled his show last month after he refused to stop pushing the debunked stories.   View the discussion thread.

Beginning at $999, Dell’s upgraded model has better battery life, a cooler processor and an improved graphics card. The 2017 Dell XPS 15 is stuffed with hardware changes to address the original laptop’s problems. A high-capacity battery gets users a boost in battery life. Its upgraded graphics card has more RAM for gaming and video editing. The 4K display that dominates its design is still gorgeous. It almost always runs whisper quiet thanks to 7th Generation Intel Core processors. Dell has made a great laptop even better. Read: Dell XPS 15 Equipped for the Amazing 2017 Dell XPS 15 Review: Design & Internals The lid and bottom of the Dell XPS15 are covered in polished aluminum. A Dell logo sits in the center of the lid. Air vents and pads on the bottom let the notebook’s processor and graphics card breathe. With a solid-state drive and a high-capacity battery, the new XPS 15 weighs 4.5-pounds and is 0.66-inches thick. Models without a touchscreen and high-capacity battery weigh just 4 pounds. Opening the laptop reveals the soft-touch keyboard deck, spacious trackpad and fingerprint reader. Each backlit key feels the same as the last generation. There’s less friction as you run your finger across the spacious trackpad though. New technology inside the trackpad lets users switch programs and manage what’s on their screen with two- and three-finger gestures easily. The fingerprint reader is new for this model. It’s an option available to every configuration of the 2017 Dell XPS 15. The 2017 Dell XPS 15’s most striking feature is the 15.6-inch display. There are two versions of this display available online, and both have 5.7mm of bezels on three sides. One is a 15.6-inch 1080p model without touch. The other is a 15.6-inch 3840 x 2160 4K display that has touch. Gotta Be Mobile’s review unit had high-end internals. It came with the 4K display, Intel Core i7-7700HQ processor, 512GB of solid-state storage, 97Whr battery, 16GB of DDR4 RAM. It had the optional fingerprint reader for Windows Hello. An NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics card with 4GB of dedicated RAM was inside, too. Getting features costs shoppers $2174. Shoppers can add as much as 32GB of RAM online. Intel’s Core i3 and i7 processors are available there, too. Buyers worried about weight can replace the 97Whr battery with a 56Whr battery. Doing that drops the notebook’s weight by half a pound. Every 2017 Dell XPS 15 has an HDMI port, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a headset jack and an SD card reader. Its Thunderbolt 3 port can handle up to two 4K displays and dozens of accessories with just one cable. 2017 Dell XPS 15 Review: Experience This notebook makes a good case for why PC buyers should wait for hardware refreshes if they can. I own the last generation Dell XPS 15 with the 4K display. I love the laptop, but I have some qualms with it. Even in the most basic of programs, the previous version’s fan spins loudly. The keyboard gets very warm when playing games or rendering video. The trackpad buttons are loud and multi-touch gestures don’t always work the first time. Its lack of Windows Hello login forced me to adopt a passcode rather than type my complicated password into Windows 10. It can’t last a day on a single charge. The 7th Generation Intel Core processors run cool and quiet in the new XPS 15. Only when attempting to push the notebook with games did I hear the fan come on. While browsing the internet, writing, editing photos and watching videos, I never heard the exhaust pick up. Adding 4GB of dedicated video RAM allows the XPS 15 to meet the recommended settings for most modern video games, too. I tested the laptop out with Halo Wars 2, Planet Coaster and Gears of War 4. I noticed no stuttering or drops in frame rate on any of these games. The new precision trackpad has better palm rejection and a slicker surface than the last model. Multi-touch gestures like zooming in on web pages or closing all apps work the first time, every time. As for the fingerprint reader, I’m just glad to have it. I thought its small size would make using it a chore, but it wasn’t. The notebook didn’t ask me to shift my finger or try multiple times. The laptop’s 4K touch-screen display is so vibrant and bright that it still puts my Surface Pro 4 display to shame. Even setting the display to 0% brightness gets you a screen that’s bright enough to work on in a room filled with light. The panel’s contrast makes the colors in video and pictures pop. I watched the latest season of House of Cards with 100% brightness in 4K and hated to go back to my HD television for the last few episodes. The 2017 Dell XPS 15’s speakers are fantastic. New MaxxAudioPro software puts you in control of their bass and levels. They can fill any room with sound. Creating on this PC is enjoyable. When working in Adobe Photoshop, you know that the colors you’re seeing on your screen are what they’ll be for your final project. The display has a 100% Adobe RGB rating and powerful software to get the tones and color your project requires. You’ll never need a dongle to connect to get pictures off your phone or DSLR. It has USB 3.0 and a media card reader. Music makers, photographers and videographers can easily add more storage space and room to multitask through the Thunderbolt 3 port. Dell tells users to expect around 19 hours of battery life from the XPS 15 with FHD HD display and 97Whr high-capacity battery. The company says that the same configuration lasts for 12 hours of Netflix streaming. My real-world tests confirm that battery life is spectacular on the 4K model with the high-capacity battery. With 25% brightness, a web browser and Slack open, it managed 9 hours. The laptop lasted 11 to 12 hours of battery life with 50% brightness. 4K displays are big power hogs, which accounts for the differences in battery life between the two models. I’m confident that you’ll worry a lot less about finding a wall outlet with the new XPS 15 than some other laptops. A picture I took with the XPS 15 on a desk. Only the 720P web camera on the front bezel disappoints. Video looks grainy. Count on adjusting the display to avoid video calls with more of your hand than your head. 2017 Dell XPS 15 Review: Specifications Processor & Graphics 3.8 GHz 7th Generation Intel Core i7 processors (Core i3 and Core i5 Options) Intel HD Graphics 630 NVIDIA GTX 1050 Graphics with 4GB of RAM Option Memory & Storage 16GB of DDR4 2400 MHz RAM (Up to 32GB of RAM Optional) 512GB Solid State Drive (256 SSD, 1TB SSD and Hybrid Drive Options) Display 15.6-inch 3840 x 2160 UltraSharp 4K UltraHD Touch Display 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080p FHD Display without Touch Ports & Extras ·       Killer 1535 Wireless AC (Intel 8265 Wireless AC Optional) ·       Thunderbolt 3 ·       HDMI 1.4 ·       2 USB 3.0 Ports ·       Headset Jack ·       Memory Card Reader ·       Kensington Lock Slot ·       Stereo Speakers ·       720 Web Camera ·       Backlit Keyboard (Optional 97Whr High-Capacity Battery) Battery Life 19 Hours of Battery Life for Model with FHD Display and High-Capacity Battery 12 Hours of Battery Life for Model with 4K Display and High-Capacity Battery Dimensions & Weight 0.66-inches x 14.06-inches x 9.27-inches 4.0-lbs with Standard Capacity Battery 4.5-lbs with High Capacity Battery   2017 Dell XPS 15 Review: Should You Buy? Upgrading the graphics processor, putting an end to the fan noise and bumping up battery capacity has made this great laptop an amazing laptop. The 2017 Dell XPS 15 has no clear pitfalls. It’s sturdy and highly configurable. The new graphics card makes it an obvious choice for creators and PC gamers than last year’s model. Great speakers and the amazing display help it to keep its crown as a best-in-class way to watch videos and listen to music. Unless its $999 minimum price tag is a concern, there’s no reason why anyone looking for a premium laptop shouldn’t consider the 2017 Dell XPS 15 as their next Windows PC. It’s a terrific laptop.   Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Dell Dell Inspiron 27 7000 is a Future Proof, VR Ready All-In-One The Dell Inspiron 27 7000 offers an ultra-sharp display, virtual reality gaming and a micr… 05/30/2017 5 min read Dell Latitude 14 5480 Review: Solidly for Business What if a laptop didn’t offer you incredible looks, but did deliver a best-in-class experi… 03/14/2017 18 min read Dell Canvas Packs Surface Studio Experience, Looks Fresh from the Future The world of PCs just keeps getting more exciting these days.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Boston Angel Investors → Seattle Week in Review: The A.I. Driver/Psychiatrist Will See You Now Benjamin Romano June 9th, 2017 @bromano @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Seattle —  If the TV show Frasier, which aired from 1993 to 2004, were rebooted and set in Seattle of, say, 2037, Dr. Frasier Crane would be an artificial intelligence avatar that would pick you up in a driverless, all-electric luxury sedan, and, after confirming your destination, inform you in an approximation of Kelsey Grammer’s dulcet tone: “I’m listening.” The reboot would be called FrAIser, of course. That’s one potential future suggested by this week’s mobility-as-a-service news flurry. We’ll explore why below, and review other Seattle-area tech developments including: partnerships for Kymeta and Cray; expansions for Crowd Cow and Coding Dojo; the University of Washington’s 2016 patent performance; and a look ahead to events next week including Tech Inclusion Seattle and Xconomy’s own What’s Hot in Cancer Immunotherapy 2017 conference. —Washington state added its square to the emerging patchwork quilt of state-level regulations encouraging development of the autonomous vehicles industry this week. Gov. Jay Inslee signed an executive order authorizing pilot programs, among other things, for self-driving cars on state roads. Our coverage included Intel’s new market forecast of a $7 trillion autonomous transportation industry by 2050. That represents not just the consumer and business shift from vehicle ownership to a model of mobility as a service, but also new services. You won’t just order a Lyft, you’ll order a lift with onboard fast-casual dining options, short films tailored to the length of your ride, and perhaps a quick A.I.-mediated mental-health screening. Some of this is already happening, as a tweet from Textio CEO Kieran Snyder illustrates. Lyft driver advises: Go with the flow, do what you can, leave the rest to God, case closed. Even if you’re an atheist, guy has a point. — Kieran Snyder (@KieranSnyder) June 8, 2017 Of course, taxi drivers have been dispensing on-the-go advice forever. Maybe all this time they should have been marketing it as a modern value-added mobility service. —And the mobility service business is only getting more competitive. ReachNow—which rents BMW vehicles on-demand in Seattle; Portland, OR; and Brooklyn, NY—has launched a beta version of its ReachNow Ride service in parts of Seattle, using some of the same vehicles it rents. A competitor to on-demand transportation providers such as Lyft and Uber, ReachNow touts VIP features such as premium vehicles, advanced scheduling, controls over the vehicles entertainment and climate systems, and a “Do Not Disturb” button—in case you don’t want any advice from your driver. The company offers fixed pricing—as compared to the supply-and-demand driven “surge” pricing of its competitors—but, as the premium pitch suggests, it’s not exactly cheap transportation. Passengers are charged 30 cents a minute and $1.80 a mile, plus a base fare of $1, and taxes and fees. —Washington is looking beyond just autonomous cars. In his executive order, Inslee tasked an interagency work group with developing policies to explore autonomy in a number of other modes of transportation, including aviation. Boeing (NYSE: BA), naturally, is on it. The company is researching pilotless commercial passenger jets, reports The Seattle Times’ Dominic Gates. Of course, the term autopilot has pilot in it for a reason. Computers take the controls during the cruising phase of many long flights, and even auto-land in certain circumstances. A looming pilot shortage and the maturation of A.I. and automation technologies provide the impetus to explore a move from autopilot to pilotless, but the Boeing executive in charge said that autonomous jets will happen only “if we can do that with the same level of safety,” adding, “That’s a really big if.” Inslee signed the executive order at the headquarters of Echodyne, a company making metamaterials radar systems for autonomous vehicles including cars and drones. —Speaking of Echodyne, its metamaterials sister company, Kymeta, announced a major distribution partnership with e3 Systems, a Spanish company, focusing on the yacht market. Redmond, WA-based Kymeta—like Echodyne, a spinout from Intellectual Ventures, backed handsomely by investors including Bill Gates—makes flat-panel satellite antennas to provide global connectivity to vehicles. —Seattle-based supercomputer maker Cray (NASDAQ: CRAY) signed a sales, marketing, and development deal with Virginia-based technology services provider Leidos (NYSE: LDOS) aimed at security-conscious customers in government and industry. The deal focuses on Cray CS supercomputers and multi-level security features that can allow teams with different levels of security clearance to use the same systems while limiting access to data, the companies said in a news release. —Crowd Cow, the Seattle-based startup selling beef portions from sustainably raised animals, expanded its market to the entire U.S. It opened a distribution facility in Lancaster, PA, to ship to customers on the East Coast. —Coding Dojo, the Bellevue, WA-based coding school, will open its seventh location, in Tulsa, OK, with support from the George Kaiser Family Foundation. “Tulsa is a unique city as the shortage of skilled tech workers is large in comparison to the market,” Michael Choi, Coding Dojo’s founder and CEO, said in a news release. —Datapoints: The University of Washington ranked 22nd on the 2016 list of universities worldwide granted U.S. utility patents with 83. The UW’s partner in the Global Innovation Exchange, scheduled to formally open its doors in Bellevue later this year, is Tsinghua University (sometimes referred to as the M.I.T. of China) which ranked fifth on the list, with 181, the highest position for a non-U.S. university. As we’ve reported, the Global Innovation Exchange, an innovation and entrepreneurship-focused international graduate program, is pursuing some novel intellectual property arrangements. Meanwhile, the M.I.T. of the U.S.—M.I.T.—ranked second with 278. The National Academy of Inventors and the Intellectual Property Owners Association compiled the list (PDF). —We profiled BridgeCare Finance, a fintech startup taking a novel approach to a challenge for middle-income families that has direct impacts on women’s participation in the work force: paying for childcare. The company is setting up to make unsecured loans to families to help them through the pre-school years, when average annual childcare costs can match or exceed college tuition. BridgeCare is also one of the startups scheduled to pitch Wednesday afternoon at Tech Inclusion Seattle, produced by Change Catalyst, Galvanize (which is hosting the conference at its Pioneer Square location), Include Seattle, and Tech Inclusion. —Also coming up on Wednesday, Xconomy’s What’s Hot in Cancer Immunotherapy 2017 event here in Seattle. The lineup for this event is, once again, fantastic, assembled by Xconomy’s national biotechnology editor Alex Lash, who introduced his weekly news roundup with this: “The biomedical world was like a postprandial python this week.” Speakers include Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ: JUNO) CEO Hans Bishop, and other luminaries from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center—where the event takes place, beginning at 1:30 p.m.—Eli Lilly, Oregon Health and Science University, the Institute for Systems Biology, University of Washington, Seattle Children’s Research Institute, Alpine Immune Sciences, and many more.

Librem 13 v2 Support Lands In Upstream Coreboot Written by Michael Larabel in Coreboot on 9 June 2017 at 01:44 PM EDT. Add A Comment For those following the progress on Purism's new inventory of Librem 13 v2 and 15 laptops shipping with Coreboot, the Librem 13 v2 laptop code is now in upstream Coreboot. Developers working for Purism have had Coreboot working on the Librem 13 v2 with all test-cases passing for a few weeks while now they have managed it in a state for upstreaming to Coreboot. It does still, however, rely upon the proprietary Intel Management Engine, so it's not blob-free but they have mentioned they may explore more reverse-engineering later in the year. The upstreamed Librem 13 v2 support can be found in Coreboot Git.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft confident about Windows on ARM initiative but fails to reassure -15 by Surur  @mspoweruser Jun 10, 2017 at 8:33 GMT2 days ago Microsoft’s effort to move their Windows installed base onto Qualcomm’s ARM-driven hardware relies heavily on emulating Intel’s x86 processors. Intel, who of course has a very real interest in preventing this move, has already made some noise, saying in a statement “x86 technology is both proprietary and central to our business, and we’re concerned any time it appears that others may be copying it inappropriately.” Now Microsoft has released their own statement, trying to reassure watchers that the initiative is still on track. In the  full statement they say: “Customers have told us they want Always Connected PCs, which will deliver great productivity at a great price, and we are confident in our ability to bring these compelling devices to market working with a wide range of partners.” While the statement identifies the demand and Microsoft’s apparent confidence in bringing the technology to market it fails to address the issue of IP concerns by Intel, suggesting this is a far from a settled issue. Intel would presumably prefer that Microsoft’s OEMs use their own LTE chipsets to meet the demand for “Always Connected PC” Microsoft identified, and I suspect the first of the ARM PCs, which were aimed for Holidays 2017, will not quite make it this year.

The growth of the small-form-factor PC continues, and where once you'd probably have to go for a barebones kit or a pretty low-powered option, this is no longer true. Thanks to advancements in the PC hardware industry, it's now possible to squeeze an awful lot of performance into a tiny box. Enter the latest ASUS VivoMini. Beneath its diminutive exterior lies hardware that can give some much more expensive laptops a run for their money. This is one of the beauties of the mini PC. If you don't need, want or have space for a large desktop machine, you have plenty of choices and you don't have to make many compromises. See at Amazon ASUS VivoMini tech specs (as tested) Category Spec OS Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Processor Seventh Gen (Kaby Lake) Intel Core i5 7200U Internal storage 128GB solid state drive (SSD) RAM 8GB DDR4 Graphics Intel HD 620 Ports four USB 3.0 ports, SD card, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI, DisplayPort, combined 3.5mm headset and microphone Wireless 802.11ac and Bluetooth 4.0 Dimensions 131 mm x 131 mm x 42 mm Weight 0.6 kg Price $349 ASUS VivoMini: Inside and out Unlike some of the larger gaming rigs out there that come in bizarre cases that scream to be looked at, the VivoMini is basically just a box you're probably going to tuck out of sight. That's not a sleight on its appearance, but it's also not really a big deal. On top you have ASUS's trademark concentric circle pattern, broken only by the company logo. Otherwise, it's just a very dark blue box with rounded edges. It looks smart, at least, so if you're going to have it on show somewhere it won't look out of place. There's not a lot more you can say about it. It may be small but it's packed with ports. Most of the stuff you'll be using to connect various items to the VivoMini is hidden around the back, including ports for USB, HDMI and SD cards. There's a front-facing USB, most useful for plugging in a keyboard, and the power button is also on the front side rather than hidden away. The power button shuts the PC down properly rather than just turning it off, which is a nice touch. Given that a PC like this would be great for a home theater setup, being able to just prod the button and get a proper shutdown is convenient. What's inside of our review model is the sort of hardware you'd expect to see in a decent laptop. The lineup has been refreshed to add the latest seventh-generation "Kaby Lake" processors from Intel, and this one is running a dual-core i5. For something this small, that's very good, especially because in the past you may have expected an Atom processor in some of these types of PCs. That's backed up by 8GB of DDR4 RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. ASUS uses an m.2 size drive, but it's probably not the best thing to upgrade because there's no immediately obvious way to get inside it. The included VESA bracket is a great touch. Inside the box, you get a VESA mounting kit, which means you can easily attach the VivoMini to the back of a PC monitor or a TV, making yourself a makeshift all-in-one. This kind of PC is ideal to do just that with, and it's great to see ASUS thinking out of the box. The bracket attaches to the bottom of the PC by a couple of screws, and then there are the standard four screws to fix the whole thing to the mounting points on your display. As it's just a flat bracket, it doesn't impede access to any of the ports or the power button. It's a nice touch, and we give extra points to ASUS for throwing it in. There is but one mild critique of the overall hardware package: there isn't an optical drive. On this type of PC where there could be some serious home theater (HTPC) thought, there will be plenty of folks who would have preferred to have a Blu-ray drive included. The software is ... bloaty The VivoMini sadly suffers from the standard ASUS PC problem of being loaded up with far more crapware than anyone should ever have to look at. Getting a popup for McAfee isn't a good experience on any PC, especially one you've literally just set up. Yes, it's worth money to ASUS but I still feel like it sells out some of the user experience. That's sad, because the hardware is top notch. Otherwise, you're looking at Windows 10 Home 64-bit, and our review unit updated to the Creators Update at setup. It also came loaded with the Windows 10 upgrade assistant, which if carried over to the retail units is a handy thing to include. ASUS VivoMini performance A gaming PC this is not, nor will it ever be, because there's no chance of using it with an external GPU; it doesn't have Thunderbolt 3. It does have Windows 10, 5GHz Wi-Fi and Ethernet, so it could be a companion device for streaming your Steam library, or even your Xbox One games. This is a desktop PC for normal desktop PC things, so the bar for performance is somewhat lower. That said, the VivoMini doesn't disappoint, especially considering that it's really quite affordable. Let's look at some benchmark and performance numbers. The SSD performance isn't anything outstanding, but it's substantially better than you would get from an HDD. In reality, it boots quickly and for the sort of computing you're doing on a unit like this, more than ample. For a Core i5 processor the Geekbench numbers call where you'd expect, and if you compare in the table below to some of the best ultrabooks out there, you'll see you're getting quite a lot out of this $349 box. Geekbench 4.0 Benchmarks (Higher is better) Category Score ASUS VivoMini Single core: 3,460 | Dual core: 6,200 Surface Book Core i7 Single core: 3,948 | Dual core: 7,415 Spectre x360 Core i7 Single core: 4,100 | Dual core: 7,469 XPS 13 Kaby Core i7 Single core: 4,120| Dual core: 7,829 It's also worth commenting on how quiet the VivoMini is, even during stress. It's impossible to put a large fan inside, but even so, you're not going to sit there pulling your hair out because it's driving you mad with noise. There's an audible fan noise, but it's nothing heavy. It also stays fairly cool on the top and front, with the excess heat ventilated out of the back of the PC. If you're mounting it to the back of a display, presumably the vents will face down, but be aware that there's a fairly strong amount of heat kicked out. ASUS VivoMini review: Bottom line This type of PC won't appeal to everyone, but it's more appealing than you may have thought. This little box is a huge step up from some of the super-cheap, low-power PCs you might find browsing the pages of Amazon. This is a perfect option for a HTPC in the living room. What the VivoMini is, is a proper PC in a little box. There's no corner cutting. You get a good processor, plenty of RAM and storage, and a PC that performs well, is fairly efficient, and takes up very little room. It's a perfect option for those tight on space, particularly those looking for a HTPC in the living room. OK, there's no optical drive, but the included VESA mount helps take away the sting there. It's pretty easy to recommend. If you want a smart desktop PC that takes up almost no room, doesn't cost the earth at $349 and performs well, buy one of these. And then quickly remove the bloatware, of course.

Being able to mount it to the back of the TV / Monitor is a great touch 1 2 days ago Reply SvenJ I have too many monitors/TVs that wouldn't work for this. If you mount this thing to the VESA holes, you no longer have VESA holes to put the stand back onto, or the VESA wall mount hardware. Lots of Dell monitors have it where the stand clips over the VESA holes, to access them you remove the stand and there is no way to put it back if you use the holes for this. I o have some where you could mount this and still keep the stand, but it isn't the predominant configuration in my house. Just a PSA, if you are looking to build something around this. 3 2 days ago Reply digitaldd Over kill for a media streamer but interesting as a mini desktop. $350 for a Core i5 with *GB RAM and a 128GB SSD is pretty good. 0 2 days ago Reply Awhispersecho Anyone here recommend anything different?

KODI etc. 0 2 days ago Reply LIEBER This Asus VivoMini looks like an upgrade of the PC I use as media PC... (mine has Skylake, and Windows 10 home). Some comments on the article... * Does it come with HDMI 1.4, or 2.0 (with support for 4k TV?) * On my computer, every now and then the HDMI output (connected to a 55 inch 4k TV) locks up, and then the only thing to do is to restart the machine. * Some of the HDMI ports don't work for all types of equipment, e.g., with the USB plug for the Logitech keyboard. I don't know why... I seem to recall that only 2 of the 4 ports work on my computer. * Connecting the Logitech keyboard via the USB plug/transceiver... at times the response is sluggish...; the Bluetooth connection works better. * HOWEVER... sometimes at Win10 upgrades, the Bluetooth connection is turned off. Problem: then the keyboard (with mouse pad) doesn't work. Because I need a keyboard to log into the computer upon restarts, it is vital to not misplace the USB plug -- which is needed in order to log in so that I can turn on Bluetooth connection with the keyboard. It is still tricky to connect the keyboard; connecting the keyboard via Bluetooth at the same time that it is connected via USB transceiver doesn't work well. So my procedure is... 1. plug USB transceiver and log in using my Logitech keyboard. 2. turn on Bluetooth. 3. pair the computer with a Bluetooth mouse. 4. unplug the USB transceiver, pair the keyboard via Bluetooth. 5. when connected, turn off Bluetooth mouse. 6. make sure that I don't misplace the USB transceiver nor the Bluetooth mouse until the next time I need to connect. All in all, a somewhat clumsy procedure... When I upgrade the media PC, I will probably consider a more powerful computer. One possibility is the Asus VivoPC X. Or perhaps one of the more powerful AMD processors. (And possibly use it as a "workstation" which I can log into remotely, e.g., using a less powerful "always on" PC...). Mine came with Windows 10 Home edition. I would buy the Pro edition next time, and I would at least have 16 GB RAM (but that depends on the use, I guess). 0 2 days ago Reply gabrielsfarias How should I remove the bloatware ? Revo uninstaller or clean install ? What do I lose in terms of drivers, in a clean install ? 0 2 days ago Reply fdruid See, I'd love to have a light gaming capable PC in this form factor. Something like that Skull Canyon NUC from Intel. I don't think that's so hard to do. Intel Iris graphics is pretty powerful. I wouldn't use it to play the latest games, though it's pretty capable. 0 12 hours ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Shorts Attack NVDA, TSLA and RLGT Brian Bolan Zacks June 9, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share It was bound to happen.  Stocks that soar high as the sky will end up bringing out the naysayers and of course the shorts.  Their reports are filled with promises of a demise.  They are filled with charts about how we have seen this before when people overpaid for tulips or some other type of flower. At the end of the day, their reports almost always are focused on one main thing, the valuation of the target. The valuation argument is one that investors actual already had when they chose to buy the stock, or not buy the stock or short the stock.  When an investor chooses to buy the stock they do so with the expectation that the company will be worth in the future. How much more it will be worth and when is up to the individual investor.  When the investor chooses to not buy the stock (and not short it) as most investors do, they are making the statement that they don't believe in the prospects for the stock or would rather a better price.  Finally, those that short the stock believe that prospects are not to be believed and that investors are paying too much for what is to be expected down the road Shorts are an important part of the market.  They give us a reality check when euphoria takes over and they often do a little more homework than most as they accept unlimited upside risk when taking a short position against a stock. Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1 Recent Short Call Citron Research came out with a short call on Nvida (NVDA) as they see a 20% downside to the current price.  Andrew Left noted that he has been a fan of the company but the last few days have seen the market cap increase by the amount of a competitor (AMD).  The short seller says that the company is not a fraud or a scam but the stock simply got ahead of itself.   One of the reasons the stock became overvalued is that Citi put out an "irresponsibly bullish" target price of $180 on the stock. The stock was trading below $150 the day before the target price increase from Citi and it rallied as high as $168.50  today.  Left noted that volumes were also extremely high suggesting that day traders and investors were using the stock as a "casino stock" and asked does the stock need to go up every day to be a great company. While the short-term impact is hurting the stock, the reality is that the stock might have gotten ahead of itself.  Does this mean that the shorts and their target of $130 is next for the stock?  I sincerely doubt it, but a pause for the cause will be a great thing.  The thing that got me was that on a recent TV appearance, Left suggested that the stock price for Intel told him how the business was performing and that is simply not correct.  As noted on the segment, the stock price and the performance of the company are not linked at the hip. Prices tend to move based on supply and demand, but emotions play a role as does overall sentiment in a particular stock.  At the end of the day, a professional investor focuses on the earnings and future cash flows of a company more than the movement of the stock on a minute to minute basis.  Right now NVDA is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as analysts have not adjusted estimates (up or down) over the last seven days.  You can see the movement in earnings estimates on the detailed estimates page at this link (https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/NVDA/detailed-estimates).  My take is that NVDA has a long road ahead and AI is only just getting started.  Investors that have a long term focus should consider adding NVDA to their portfolios. In a recent podcast I discussed the prospects for NVDA here (https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/263279/game-changing-stocks-you-must-own). Follow Brian Bolan on Twitter: @BBolan1     NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus View photos Read More NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus | NVIDIA Corporation Quote   Tesla Shares Jolted You can add independent research firm Hedgeye to the list of market participants that believe that Tesla (TSLA) is a short.  It was reported earlier today that the firm known for making snap calls and taking quick gains called the stock their best short idea. Sellers quickly overwhelmed buyers with shares after the call was made public but it appears to have found a bottom. David Einhorn, a noted short seller, has been short the stock for some time but was feeling the pain again today as the stock reached another new 52 week high of  $376.87 before word of the Hedgeye call slammed the stock.  Einhorn and Hedgeye are not alone in saying that the shares of the automaker are overvalued.  Just as the analyst at Barclays who has been unwaveringly wrong on the stock and even noted that the recent earnings from TSLA (which were disappointing by most measures) would still be a catalyst for another leg higher in price. My view on TSLA, despite it being a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is that shares will reach $450 and probably more.  Let's go back in time, when the stock was far below the recent highs.  April 12 saw the stock trade in a range from $296-$308 -- and it closed that day at $296.84, but that was the day that I published why I believed that it was headed to $450 (https://www.zacks.com/commentary/110024/ride-tesla-to-450-and-beyond) in my article "Ride Tesla to $450 and Beyond." Following a poor quarter, analysts dialed back some estimates and that caused the Zacks Rank for this stock to slide to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  With fresh auto sales numbers coming out around the start of July, I would not want to be short the stock.  Keep in mind that the Model 3, which is primary demand driver for the stock is also set to begin production in that month and those two factors alone should send the stock higher.

Quote   Shorts Of All Sizes Finally, there was a short piece on a Radiant Logistics (RLGT) the other day penned by a group that also saw huge problems with Burlington Stores and Wix.  I am not going to detail this one out much more to say that the prior missives on BURL and WIX were disastrous to investors if you followed their lead, so why is anything going to be different this time around with RLGT?  These "short and distort" type publications often scare investors out a perfectly good stock like RLGT.  At the same time, they offer wonderful buying opportunities for informed investors who realize the surge that all the transportation and transportation dependent stocks have been seeing of late. Radiant Logistics is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a steal at current prices of just over $5.  The company sports a growth style score of "B" and is among my favorites. Radiant Logistics, Inc.

Apple began accepting online orders for the new MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac models on Monday, but delivery estimates currently range between June 12 and June 22 in the United States, so customers looking to purchase a new Mac earlier than next week may have better luck visiting an Apple Store. Users can use the in-store pickup tool to see which MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac models are in stock at assorted Apple Store locations in Canada. Still, it’s recommended that you call ahead to your preferred retail location to see if the computer you want is still in stock.

President Trump's relationship with Silicon Valley may have reached a crossroads following his decision to leave the Paris Agreement, as giants of the technology industry prepare to gather at the White House while bucking the administration's position on the deal. Trump announced he will withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement in a speech in the Rose Garden in early June. In exiting the climate accord, the president followed through on a campaign promise and rallied his base. The decision was swiftly praised by Republican lawmakers and conservative groups. But Democrats and tech giants quickly admonished Trump's move, and some worried the administration's decision could sour the already fragile relationships the White House is attempting to forge with Silicon Valley. "It's become increasingly clear that this administration's continued retreat from the global community will hurt its relationship with the technology industry, which understood the tremendous opportunity the Paris climate agreement created for our economy," Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. "This was a chance for the U.S. to lead the clean energy revolution, and President Trump walked away." Connolly, co-chairman of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, backed the climate accord and is a key player on efforts to modernize the government's technology systems. Along with Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, Connolly co-authored a bill to improve the federal government's IT systems. The legislation passed the House last month and has earned the backing of the technology industry. Like Congress, the White House is looking to Silicon Valley to assist in its efforts to make government more effective. The technology industry is expected to play a major role in the Trump administration's efforts to modernize its technology systems, and the president will huddle with the heads of leading technology companies at the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council this month. The group, which is under the umbrella of Jared Kushner's Office of American Innovation, is expected to meet June 19 and will reportedly include executives from Apple, Facebook, IBM and Google, among others. According to a copy of the meeting agenda obtained by Recode, the White House believes the "American people should be able to interact with the government the way that they do with the best private sector companies — through intuitive digital experiences that effectively solve problems." But the president's decision regarding the nation's exit from the Paris Agreement has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the meeting. Already, Trump's Rose Garden announcement caused at least two CEOs to resign from the White House's various advisory boards. "Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said on his Twitter account. Disney CEO Bob Iger followed suit. Others expressed their discontent with Trump's decision, but have yet to announce any decisions about their future participation in White House gatherings. The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group based in Washington, called the exit from the climate agreement a "setback for America's leadership in the world." The trade group counts tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Google among its members and reiterated its commitment to combating climate change in spite of Trump's move. "Despite this, the tech industry's determination to innovate and problem-solve for the threats posed by climate change and generate clean energy opportunities that create jobs and grow our economy remains unchanged," Dean Garfield, ITI's president, said in a statement. Many of ITI's members echoed that sentiment. Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Intel, among others, all pledged to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement despite Trump's exit. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities, businesses and investors, representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the tech companies, along with businesses, elected officials and higher-education institutions, said in an open letter. The White House has yet to announce details on the gathering, but a White House official said the meeting is moving forward. Still, despite opposition to the president's decision on the climate agreement, the technology industry stands to benefit from the Trump administration's commitment to modernizing the federal government. The White House is looking to improve how it buys products, including those related to the $80 billion spent on IT systems, and wants to use its private-sector relationships to improve government technology. So far, at least one industry leader is pledging to remain engaged. "IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration — as we do with governments around the world," an IBM spokesperson said.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 11 June 2017 | MYT 12:00 PM Apple product updates you missed at the WWDC Apple demonstrates the new Macintosh operating system macOS High Sierra at the WWDC 2017 developers conference in San Jose. — dpa Most of the excitement after Apple's WWDC summit came from the launch of the HomePod, a louder, fatter and pricier version of smart speakers already on the market.  But the Cupertino-based company is doing far more than just copying Amazon and Google hardware, as an overview of developments announced at the conference shows. Apple watch powered by Siri Just like Google does at its events, Apple sought to use its developer conference to highlight the leaps it has made in artificial intelligence and autonomous learning. Among the products to profit from better AI is the Apple Watch, which is getting more proactive with the information it displays thanks to a new Siri-powered watch face. Siri is also being upgraded with natural language to help it adjust to the individual user. At the same time the data will be secured and can only be called up by the devices used by a particular user, Apple executive Craig Federighi said. VR and better hardware for the iMac For the first time, Apple's iMac computer is being made compatible with virtual reality. Hollywood special effects studio ILM demonstrated how a user wearing special glasses can dive into a VR scene from the Star Wars universe on an iMac desktop. At the same time, Apple has updated the entire range of MacBook notebooks and iMacs with more rapid Intel processors and improved graphics. For those users demanding particularly high-performance computer - video professionals for example – there will be an iMac Pro at the end of the year, said to be "the fastest Mac to date." The company has recently faced criticism that it has neglected professional users, as the model aimed at this market segment – the Computer Mac Pro – has not been updated since 2013. Make payments to Apple users on a new iPad Pro For the iPad tablet there will be a new Pro model with a 10.5in screen, up from the current 9.7in. The iPad version of the iOS mobile system will be upgraded with a number of new functions, for example easy moving of contents and files between apps using drag-and-drop. Text written by hand with the Apple Pencil will be searchable, using machine learning for the user's handwriting. The notes app will get a scanner for documents that can then be changed using the pencil. Meanwhile the iOS photo app is also being improved with new effects backed up by learning capacity. And, as expected, Amazon's video streaming service will be on the Apple TV digital media player. Apple says it will begin setting up obstacles to the online advertizing sector in two ways: Apple's web browser can block the automatic launch of videos, and tracking can be blocked when the user gets the feeling that an advert on a particular theme is following them to all websites. Finally, Apple users can soon delete the PayPal app from their iOS. Apple Pay will enable payments between users, effectively challenging PayPal and other competitors. — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Apple product updates you missed at the WWDC Stepping to a great future Breath of fresh air: 4 ways to improve air quality at home 10 last-minute IKEA styling tips for Raya Reasons why mums are our heroes 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Khan takes three wickets but Windies beat Afghanistan Sarawak withdraws rep from Malaysia Tourism Board Ride for Team Malaysia advertisement Latest News Nissan's X-Trail goes semi-autonomous Super Nintendo World theme park concept seen in new trailer E3 2017: Devolver Digital June 12 – how to watch and what to expect Ultra Street Fighter 2: Fighting for relevance Moto G5 Plus: The G force Most Viewed in Tech E3 2017: Devolver Digital June 12 – how to watch and what to expect Nissan's X-Trail goes semi-autonomous Ultra Street Fighter 2: Fighting for relevance Super Nintendo World theme park concept seen in new trailer Moto G5 Plus: The G force Android 7 Nougat for just US$100: Lenovo's new Moto C smartphone OnePlus 5 launches June 20, pop-up events in several cities Sweden beckons for investors seeking to bet on next Candy Crush Facebook’s Detroit status: Feeling determined to build auto ties Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Reports coming out of securities firms showed market consensus for a very strong performance for the world's No. 1 smartphone and memory chip manufacturer, with keen interest even being shown on operating profits surpassing the 13 trillion-won mark. The South Korean tech giant reported its largest operating profit ever in the third quarter of 2013, when numbers reached 10.16 trillion won. In the first quarter of this year, its profits stood at 9.9 trillion won, the second highest tally for a three-month period. Market researcher FN Guide said estimates compiled as of last week showed analysts were predicting Samsung sales reaching 58.2 trillion won, with operating profits forecast at 12.99 trillion won in the three-month period ending in June. The estimate, if met, will represent a 14.3 percent increase in sales and 59.5 percent surge in operating profit vis-a-vis the April-June period of 2016. Eo Kyu-jin, an analyst at eBEST Investment & Securities, claimed that even a figure higher than 14 trillion won is possible, judging by overall sales that could have reached as high as 58.9 trillion won. Experts have said a rise in semiconductor prices, as well as demand for organic light-emitting diode screens, is helping the company. Samsung is also likely to benefit from strong sales of its latest Galaxy S8 smartphones. Others like Lee Se-cheol, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said Samsung is expected to topple Intel as the largest chipmaker in the world, which will help the company's profit. Intel has been the global leader since 1991. Market observers, predicted at the present pace, Samsung's operating profit could even surpass the 50 trillion-won level on an annual basis and set another record for the electronics giant. yonngong@yna.co.kr (END) Most Viewed Seoul to ban smoking at cultural asset sites (4th LD) Park apologizes over alleged sexual misconduct by ex-spokesman Ssangyong says resumption of overnight shift turning point of normalization (2nd LD) N.

Exclusive: Google is planning a 'Pixel 3' laptop running the 'Andromeda' OS for release in Q3 2017 David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/09/26 7:02am PDTSep 26, 2016 358 Plus 1 on G+ 1117 Share on Facebook 412 Share on Twitter Total Shares1887 Exclusives Google Leaks News Rumors Two independent and reliable sources have confirmed to us that Google is planning a new Pixel laptop to be released in Q3 2017. The project, known internally as 'Bison' and by the informal nickname 'Pixel 3,' will likely be the first brand-new device to showcase Google's combined Android / Chrome OS 'Andromeda' operating system in a laptop form factor. Bison, then, would be the culmination of years of work by Google's Pixel team and Google's Android and Chrome OS teams. We are extremely confident Google plans for the device to run Andromeda. We are also confident that Andromeda is a completely distinct effort from Google's current campaign to bring Android apps to Chromebooks, and that Bison would not be marketed as a Chromebook. Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. As such, it would be more accurate to say Bison will run Android than Chrome OS, and could finally be Google's internal commitment to releasing Andromeda. (This lines up with the narrative The Wall Street Journal presented in its exclusive about the merge effort last year, in which laptops were specifically singled out as the merged OS's first big target.) But before we get into details, let's discuss our confidence in this rumor. Unfortunately, this one is tricky. We are unable to share any primary source materials, including renders of any hardware. We also believe Bison's specifications, while we will provide them, are very much subject to change. Given it's a year or more from its planned release, Bison could evolve substantially or even be cancelled - so we want to be absolutely clear when we say that specifications are not set in stone. Let alone Bison's release being a certainty, especially if Andromeda runs into delays or the OS project sees a change of direction. But we're going to share what we can today, because it's just too interesting not to. And despite all of our asterisking in regard to future uncertainty, we are exceptionally confident that the information and sources we're working from are legitimate and trustworthy. As such, we're not assigning a number to this one - it's just not a good fit for that system. So, let's dive in. Bison is planned as an ultra-thin laptop with a 12.3" display, but Google also wants it to support a "tablet" mode. It's unclear to us if this means Bison will be a Lenovo Yoga-style convertible device, or a detachable like Microsoft's Surface Book, but I'm personally leaning on the former given how thin it is. Powering it will be either an Intel m3 or i5 Core processor with 32 or 128GB of storage and 8 or 16GB of RAM. This seems to suggest there will be two models. It will also feature a fingerprint scanner, two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm jack (!), a host of sensors, stylus support (a Wacom pen will be sold separately), stereo speakers, quad microphones, and a battery that will last around 10 hours. The keyboard will be backlit, and the glass trackpad will use haptic and force detection similar to the MacBook. Google plans to fit all of this in a form factor under 10mm in thickness, notably thinner than the aforementioned Apple ultraportable. Given the MSRPs of past Pixel laptops, you might expect this is shaping up to be one costly little device, and while not cheap, Google's planned pricing is still competitive: Bison is pegged to start at $799. As I said, the Wacom stylus would be sold separately, and Google is aiming for a retail launch in Q3 2017. And by the time Bison launches, Google wants to be ready to showcase Andromeda running a variety of enterprise, developer, and stylus-driven apps on the device - a way to argue that Bison and Andromeda will create a laptop experience that is truly attempting to rival Apple and Microsoft. So, if you were wondering why there wasn't a fresh Chromebook Pixel for 2016 (and we have no reason to think one is coming on October 4th), this is probably the reason. Chromebook Pixels may well be dead as of next year - Andromeda is the way forward. What do Bison and Andromeda mean for Android, and for Android phones and tablets? Well, right now: probably not much. Google will announce its Pixel smartphones on October 4th, and they will be running Android 7.1. Google may well tease Andromeda at this event. But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day, even if an Andromeda demo manages to steal the show. Here in 2016, Google is attempting to paint a vision of a united hardware front inside the company - to legitimize the idea that Google can build consumer hardware products to compete with the likes of Apple and Samsung (at least hypothetically). Andromeda will still be off on the horizon, but there's no doubt it's a huge piece of Google's long-term strategy puzzle. But this same time next year? I think it's likely we'll see Google show us the first laptop with the power of Android and the best of Chrome OS, a truly watershed moment for Android and Google. Whether the resultant operating system, even if it is largely powered by Android underneath, will still be called Android isn't something I could hope to guess at. Maybe Google doesn't even know. But as to what it means for Chromebooks? I think the Journal had it dead on a year ago: Chrome OS and Chromebooks (perhaps with a new name) will continue, but Android with Chrome OS features baked-in, aka Andromeda, is the new hotness, and will mark a major shift in Google's OS strategy. All I can say is I really hope we get a taste of what that future looks like next week.

What i do understand that Google aims to give people with android phones the ability to Use Continuity the same way Apple does with their devices. The question is, can Google compete with true OS computer with their price tag? Aaron Given how rotten the Windows store is, I'd say it's chances are good. I have a Windows 10 convertible now and should have just saved my money. nirmitlamed I think that we should first look at the price tag. Right now Chrombook Pixel cost 1299$. With that kind of price tag most people would choose Macbook air which start at 899$ price tag and it has better OS and good support. You can even go with 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display at the same price tag (1299$). Now If we talk about PC laptops it has even more variety. For my opinion if the price tag remains high don't see how people will prefer Android+ChromeOS over true OS like Apple OS and Windows. Greyhame Their plans are to demo it with enterprise software. In other words, in their minds, it would be a "true OS". Aaron With a starting price at $799, I would give it a shot. What it can do as a productivity device is yet to be seen, of course, but even before being properly announced it's already better than Windows 10 as a 2 in 1. And iPad Pro is just iOS blown up to tablet size, which I only mention because there are no 2 in 1 MacBook options. Tl;dr If done right Andromeda could be big. It won't overthrow Windows or MacOS, but it could take a nice piece of the pie. deppman Just curious, how do you define a "true OS"? Is it one that allows complete control of your hardware? Too bad OSX, Windows, OS2, and virtually every OS ever released doesn't make the cut. Is installed user base important and number of applications? If they are, then Android far outpaces all other OS's on both fronts. Maybe its the ability to recompile the kernel and write optimized device drivers? Whoops, none of these commercial OS's allow that. Maybe its the fact that "real" OS's don't try to lock you into an ecosystem? Except, of course, Apple and MS are definitely guilty of that with iOS, OSX, Windows 10, and Windows phone. Maybe a "real OS" doesn't phone home and send keystrokes back to company servers? Oh whoops, there's Windows 10 again. According to these criteria the only "true OS's" available are various *nix distributions. So what precisely IS the criteria for a "real OS" that you are referring to? shadowx360 Not of that matters for the consumer and business that wants to get work done. I think he means a versatile OS that can run on at least laptops, desktops, and maybe servers with full featured third party software support. Basically macOS, not iOS. Something you can run a full version of Word and Photoshop on, something you can take to work and do everything you can do on a Windows or macOS machine. I can see Andromeda only really succeeding if it gets third party support or finds a way to run full featured Windows or Linux apps. Otherwise it's just the equivalent of a glorified iPad Pro. nirmitlamed You already knows what i mean you just stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. What i mean about "True OS" is the ability to do the most simple tasks and in the same time to have the ability to do a more complicity tasks for power users. I am sure you can figure out yourself what is the difference between Android+Chrome OS and Windows or Mac OS. deppman My point is there really isn't much of a difference between Android+ChromeOS vs. W10 or OSX. And what little difference exists is being systematically removed by Apple and MS respectively. They're all OSs locked into curated ecosystems. At the same time, Android and Chrome, both being OSS, have a vibrant community that allow Android to do many things that OSX and Windows can't, even without rooting or stepping outside of the Google store. My Pixel C, for example, is in many ways more capable than a MacBook Air. What you haven't figure that out for yourself yet is that your criteria for what constitutes a "real" OS are nebulous, quaint, and out of date. nirmitlamed First of all i would very love to hear about what you can do better with your Pixel C that you can't do on MacBook Air for example. About the criteria "real" OS, again don't be stuck on maybe wrong choice of words. I don't, so neither should you. For my opinion Chromebooks are for specific kind group of people and not for everyone. There are a lot of apps missing that were built over the years in Windows and MacOS from video player to editing to games and download managing and so on. Android OS is great but please don't compare its apps ecosystem to Windows and MacOS apps. Every company that has its app on different OS, build its android app to match the main idea how would one use its app on the way in the palm of their hand. There is a different between sitting on a chair in-front a computer than using your small mobile devices on the couch, bathroom and on the way. That is one of the reasons why you won't find all the same features in every OS. Surely what google is planing to its computer line is very interesting but could it really compete with Windows and Mac? i doubt that. Since you own a ChromBook computer i would love to hear your thoughts on that. Can ChromeOS do every task Windows and MacOS can? Mayur Gondhalekar I agree with you that Chrome OS is a limited OS with a specific usecase. I own a chromebook since 2 years and its my go to device for simple tasks like websurfing or streaming and even light stuff like creating word documents or excel etc. (Google docs works with conversion to MS word or excel in the end). Where it trumps Windows is its always on nature and simplicity. I never have to deal with slow moving OS or a update pop up every now and then. Especially on some new budget Win PCs you have only 32GB storage and that Win 10 update keeps killing these devices. Now if with a new OS designed for laptops, Google can create the experience of MAC then it can surely ba a hit. I dont ever see windows as competition when it comes to performance. But in terms of app availibilty, it would have to match Windows and Mac. But if it does then who knows...Honestly for stuff like playing videos or music etc most people are moving to streaming services where you do not really need native apps. What remains is work related apps and media editing apps. Skunky As you said, chromebooks are designed for certain people, or maybe even as a secondary "grab and go" computer for Mac or Windows users. the main people that will use chrome os are perhaps students (depending on what their needs are), older people who need something simplistic, people who just want to type documents, browse the web, play web based games (and future android games), facebook video chat (and use other messengers when android apps become available), photo editing (there are some pretty nice photo editors in the web store, and soon to be with android), for people who don't need all of the extras that Windows or Mac comes with. I don't know why some people have to be 1 sided, why can't people learn to evolve and find ways to use a new OS without bashing it- challenge yourself to do what you normally do on your Mac or Windows 'but on a different platform' in an alternative way. (i've learnt how to do some neat things on my chromebook and with computers in general that i wouldn't have learnt if i would have just stuck with Windows and hadn't challenged myself). VAVAMk_2 We can define what a real desktop OS isn't at least: iOS Keith Earns I second this. Criticizing google for not licensing windows or mac OS on their new laptop is ridiculous. They have an OS based off a linux kernel, linux I would classify as a "TRUE OS". Chromebook linux support has been decent, I have no reason to believe the new pixel would not support linux, and for that price it pouts some nice hardware. "Productivity" arguments are still being made? Docs/sheets/slides is really comparable to office, and if you're an editor you're probably using WP anyway so whats the problem? Glaiket Anne Clyde The burning question as to what constitutes a True OS is a subject fraught with perplexity and often extremely difficult to discern. At present my thoughts on this often controversial subject are mine and mine alone, however, for the sake of whatever i offer the following. Take any clean OS then inject with say that old favorite of theirs the sasser virus, disinfect to a certain degree, then lay back and listen to the sound it makes as it crashes through a neighbors sunroof from your penthouse geek caves. Smoke a fag, tweek ,twerk eat repeat. In no time at all you will be listening to the pitter patter of tiny zx81's romping all over your once blissfull lives. Dale Upton Wow, he meant like a laptop dude not a tablet, somthing robust enough to compete with mac os and windows, I can help you off that high horse is you like? Comment_Cop None of these things define an OS but yeah I get it, you want more control. So do I when it comes to Windows. Drew Ciccotelli I remember when people didn't pay less than 2000 for a new MacBook Pro. Drew Ciccotelli Why anyone has a Windows 10 machine now is beyond me. I'm on an XP at work and it's running the Chrome browser like a champ. Aaron I wanted a 2-in-1 so I would only have to carry one device when I travel, as opposed to a laptop and tablet, and I still needed Windows' software compatibility. Money not well spent. I would have been happier with two devices. I wanted to give 10 a chance, and 10 has been a headache. Drew Ciccotelli 10 is just them wanting to be Google but still having that Mircosoft pay to play bug up their ass. Drew Ciccotelli It's too ad heavy and Internet reliant. James Briano Oh, c'mon. We all know you're typing on one right now. Chris Why? What will this do that a surface can't? Run some android games? Nicholas Conrad Surface Pro 3 (i5) was such a disappointment it's what convinced me to try a Chromebook in the first place. Chris That's funny I went the opposite direction. I loved my chromebook but it hit a wall in usability so I switched to surface and it's been amazing. Charlie I almost can't think of any reason I'd prefer a Chromebook over a tablet with a very good add-on keyboard/sleeve/case/stand with a Bluetooth keyboard (and mouse). Except for price? Because there are some extremely cheap Chrome books out there. Drew Ciccotelli You mean a Pixel C then. Charlie For $499, it ain't bad. But I still feel like it won't be beating Android when it comes to apps and versatility. But I do like the design, yes. That hardware plus Android, I'd be willing to at least test that out for a couple of months. Definitely. Nicholas Conrad It was too big and heavy to use as a tablet for any length of time, and the type-cover kickstand combination made it precarious at best as a laptop substitute. The type-cover itself was a pretty terrible typing experience, and the offset trackpad, while probably comfortable for right-handers, was incredibly cramped and awkward to use as a left-hander. The SP4 type cover improved in those areas somewhat. Windows 10 has gotten a lot better over time, but at launch there were several driver issues with it that were super frustrating being MS hardware. Not least of which was it would often go completely dark when removed from the dock, requiring a hard reset to wake again. With no status LEDs, even performing a reset on it was oddly difficult and frustrating. The only thing that was genuinely awesome about it was the pen, but that only ever really worked in onenote. And all of that comming in at several hundred dollars more than an equivalently speced mac, which I used to mock for being so overpriced.... Yeah, I bought a $200 redurb Dell Chromebook, and have been much happier with a real keyboard and which I can actually use on my lap. I gave the surface back to work and just used the Chromebook instead. It works as well as, or better than Windows for 95% of everything I need to do. Occasionally I run into CrOS limitations, but I have an old Windows box I can boot up when needed. Drew Ciccotelli What did the Chromebook cost and how much was the Surface? Charlie How about just run Android in general. With the ease of use and versatility of all that Android has to offer: not only things like the Play Store support with all it's apps but maybe also more manufacturers willing to take the plunge and invest and make these type of devices? And how about price? Some people are also just done with Windows. And all it's iterations/versions. I'm one of them. I'll go with Android (Remix OS for instance) and Ubuntu any day over WIndows 10. But that's a matter of taste, even so, still means I'd prefer Andromeda over Windows 10. Chris You're sick of all the different versions and you're going to android...not the best choice. I don't see myself being able to use android for work in the foreseeable future. I used a chromebook for 75% of my master's degree until it just literally was not possible to use anymore and I got a cheap SP3 and man that thing is just amazing. Charlie But... Things might be looking a bit different in a year, when this comes out? Which is why they might be developing it? Plus, it depends on what your needs are. I have a work PC at work. Which will either be Windows or macOS. I know some companies that have been trying Ubuntu though. It depends on what type of job you have, if Windows is really necessary. But for personal use. I think I could get by fine on Android. Chris For sure android will do everything for personal use for me also. I dunno. We've been told so many times the updates would get better I've given up. Remember the update alliance? hahaha Charlie That's true. But Pixel does indicate Nexus, which means with this specific device... You might be alright. Plus Google could try and pull an Android Wear/Auto on us... Hardware (with minimum requirements) left up to device manufacturers, but software updates are handled by (mostly) Google. juanjeremy2012 why not just a plain laptop Deckard_Cain Just wish they would also include a dedicated GPU. :( AMD's open-source drivers for Linux are even in great shape. xsilas43 AMD does not develop for the mobile platform, so for the laptop maybe but not in the width they are going for. Dan Gul Zen platform might change that. We might see AMD in these in the second iteration of these machines. Who knows. Depends on how well AMD executes on Zen. Kian Ronald Grey LOL Thats a joke. Jay T Intel's iGPU's are now pretty fast and efficient. My current laptop has an i5-6200U with a HD520 GPU, and it can play fairly intense games at 1080p without breaking a sweat. Also, when not doing anything intense I get 6-10 hours of battery life. techfreak243 it's never outdated. PVL_93_RU It's too good to be outdated Evan Nope!

No I haven't read the Article yet, but I want it! aliablow It's been a while since Google managed to spark genuine interest and anticipation. But this... What a time to be alive, indeed! So much hype for the 4th! Ash At this rate, I'm convinced Google is going to stop sending you invites to press events if you keep leaking their major plans like this. Rita El Khoury That's one option. The other is that Google secretly hates to love AP or loves to hate it. John Doe It is not the AP, the problem is with Google. The WSJ already leaked this a while back so Google needs to control their employees. Bewear I know this might sound pointless, but I hope you can install the OS of your preference on it. John Doe Will Andromeda be the next version of Android? Meaning, will the Pixel phones and other devices will be upgraded to it and have all the devices under one OS or like Apple (macOS, OSx, etc.)? aliablow If Android becomes Andromeda, I can only imagine the level of fragmentation. Perhaps Google found a way to tackle that issue once and for all with seamless updates similar to Chromebooks. One can only hope. Just_Some_Nobody Google needs to drop the Java runtime and go with something else. This might be a good time to do it. They could keep the old java runtime as a backwards compat. layer, but kill it for all new development. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I'm just wondering when you guys are going to rename to Andromeda Police. Todd At least they won't need to change the AP logo. L3Chiffre Domain name "andromedapolice.com" was registered yesterday... devilfriend lol seriously though, I wonder how many XDA-Developers users know what an XDA is. PVL_93_RU Well it derived from PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) so I guess the XDA has a same meaning? JL Maybe Andromeda is Android 8. Leonard Wong Getting poor @ 2017 Rita El Khoury You're waiting until 2017 to get poor? I'm getting poorer way before. SimonSaid 8 days, to be precise. bdbplatano That seems like forever away, can't wait. 😬 SimonSaid Does AP have any idea whether this is solely a laptop OS or whether it is ultimately destined for phones and tablets too? David Ruddock It's hard to know without having a much more detailed understanding of Google's vision, and we just don't. If I were to speculate, I'd say that there'd be a single OS Google will push commercially (maybe still called Android), and that certain devices like laptops and large tablets would be able to use certain features that would particularly benefit their form factor (like Chrome OS's windowed operation). Even if it this stuff would be baked into every Android device, some of it would only be exposed for certain hardware / interfaces. This could also allow for Continuum style functionality a la Windows 10, where your phone could "project" a desktop operating environment. But again: that is complete speculation. I doubt even Google fully understands where they want to go with this yet. SimonSaid Thanks, David. I suppose what everyone wants to know is whether this will finally solve Android's 'Update Problem'. Hopefully we'll soon learn enough about Andromeda's architecture to answer this question. All aboard the hype train! Alex I personally hope the codename Andromeda lives on to production. Such a cool name. Roger Siegenthaler And that google doesn't know yet is scary, MS knew over 10 years ago when they started minwin and dropped development of CE that they wanted to get one OS/Kernel on all devices and it still took them so long and numerous restarts to get there. Now how many restarts and how long does it take a company without a plan now to achieve this. David Ruddock I'm not a developer or engineer (obviously), but I think the smartphones of today are a lot more like laptops than the smartphones (and proto-smartphones) of 10 years ago. Microsoft was trying to solve a much harder problem there - bringing an ancient OS never designed for mobile to mobile. Android already does x86 and ARM, and it uses the Linux kernel. I don't think there's much to stop Android from running on a laptop (hell, Android laptops, crappy ones, exist), so much as there hasn't been a good reason to run it on a laptop. I don't really think the projects are comparable - Google's is much more a question of "why" than "how." Roger Siegenthaler That's assuming Linux is really capable of what NT is now, which I have serious doubts about considering google's public dumping of linux for embedded/IoT tech and is trying to replace it with fuchsia on every platform. I have the feeling if the world's largest user of a kernel says (paraphrased) "this kernel does not scale well" you're going to believe them and not just say that linux can do so with no problems. It's definetely easier for google then for MS but not so much that the engineering part is "easy" Syukri Lajin that is why google work on more than 1 projects at the same time :P no actual direction, just see which work the best, kill the others, start new projects with slightly different objective, and repeat. Justin W So, Honeycomb vs. Gingerbread. Got it. On a serious note, I'd love some continuity features. Google seems to be going in the wrong direction with that when it comes to their messaging app (Allo), but I'm hoping they're truly working to better that and the overall continuity features in Android. Defenestratus RIP Android? demarcmj Probably just those RIP to those Android quasi-laptop, tablet-with-keyboard things that like 10 people ever bought anyway. Defenestratus Yeah I'm a kickstarter backer of the superbook which has real appeal for me. Not so sure anymore. philosopher_Mk More like RIP Chrome os, this is Android for laptops. Suicide_Note Maybe. Just maybe. bdbplatano I wonder how this all fits in (if at all) with fuchsia ConCal RIP Jide Carson Saldanha Lol yep 😂 Google coming directly at Remix OS.

Office is still the king especially in business. jesuguru He forgot the /s ConCal I mean those are a bit different. Jide isn't Microsoft or Facebook. Jide just got off the ground this year.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio This shall now be called - "MAJOR BISON" http://www.sumthing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SF13.png person Likely what the name is referring to in the first place :P Good_Ole_Pinocchio No no no... Don't take my credit away! I coined the term... Now i shall collect my 10 cents for every mention. PVL_93_RU It's Master, not Major Qbancelli I have a hard time getting excited about something that won't launch for at least a year. bort118 I don't!! AHHHH!! bdbplatano Especially when dealing with Google thartist Maybe not everything is about GETTING EXCITED. But yeah, it might be that far because Andromeda needs some time yet to reach 1.0 Diego Opazo SV-Cross ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ This is going to be amazing!!!! Dmitriy Romanov These leaks are going really out of hand. There is no surprises anymore just because someone from google leaks all shit to AP. Nayners People want leaks, then don't want leaks. Your comment type gets old. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You do realize that AP is in the business of providing news/leaks? And news they have brought. Thanks, AP! aliablow Actually for me, these leaks actually pique interest cause a lot of the details are unknown. Think of these as a teaser or a trailer for a movie. Dmitriy Romanov Yeah. Nowadays movie trailers can tell everything about movie and even main plot. Thats what AP is doing with these exclusives Jarrett Lennon Kaufman How awful of them to dare release news that, if they didn't, someone else would. Awful of them to do their jobs. Dan It will then be discontinued in Q1 2018 when Google pivots to a new strategy of running [insert new software here] on [insert new device here]. Such is the experience of those who buy Google's consumer devices thinking, "No, really, this time Google is really committed to this product line!" Defenestratus Yes. So much this. PerhapsNever But, there are actually quite a few of their products that they are still supporting (and enhancing)... Chromecast, for instance. Nope.jpeg What did the Chromebook say to the Pixel 3? "Bison." Cod3rror I have to agree. One thing that Apple has that neither Google nor Microsoft (new MS) has is that Apple comes up with a long term plan and sticks to it and so far their long term visions setup by Steve Jobs have been on point. With Google everything is in beta. And with Microsoft, it's always "wait for the next version, that one will be great!". Sk0ly The one thing Apple has is users that will literally buy any piece of crap they roll into their apple store showcase. Cod3rror What a foolish thing to say. Whether you like to admit or stick your hand in the sand and deny, is that Apple makes very good products. iPhone is still the gold standard for quality. The same with Mac, the same with Macbook, iPad (Android tablets. Remember them?), watch (remember the beta version Android watches?). Sk0ly Apple makes good quality devices overall, I won't deny that but I wouldn't call them a "gold standard" at this point. They have had issues related to quality on the last three iPhones. Bendgate where your phone bends under normal use, antennagate where you are "holding it wrong". And yes, I think the use of gate in every issue is dumb. I actually disagree that the Apple watch is a superior product. The OS is really terribly thought out and yet it is the best selling. Why? Because it is Apple. Bottom line, Apple users will buy whatever Apple tells them to. That is a general statement but rings very true. The company was so arrogant that they thought they could sell a $15,000 Apple Watch. On the software front, it is a really bad situation. Apple Maps is absolute garbage (although it has improved) and Apple Music is still a way crappier service with Apps that aren't on par with Spotify or Google Music. The point I was making is that they force people to buy products, adaptors, accessories to stay within their ecosystem. They preach sustainability but use proprietary connectors and force people to buy overpriced adapters that add to e-waste globally. The Macbook is a nice piece of hardware but I'm sorry, OSX is not as good of an OS as Windows. It seems to have cornered a niche in design and editing but anyone who knows computers will tell you about its limitations. As far as tablets go you are correct. Android tablets have not delivered and the iPad ecosystem has flourished as a result. Bottom line, Apple is not perfect, far from it. Cod3rror Apple is not perfect, but it's the closest one to it out of three (Apple, Google, Microsoft). Apple sells expensive products, everybody knows that. You pay for tech + "luxury", they simply would not be able to sell cheap products, look at iPhone 5c. As for the ecosystem, you either go by Apple's ecosystem or you don't get an Apple product. If you use the product the way Apple intended it to be used, you'll really enjoy it and have a great time, that's what most people do and they are quite happy about it. I personally don't, so I don't use Apple products. But for an average person, Apple is the easiest, most seamless experience out there. Apple also provides the easiest backup/restore functionality, something that Google still does not properly do. Next, let's talk about support, if you buy an iPhone, you will get support for at least 4 years, this is something no Android or Microsoft phone can claim. Hell, Google does not even support Nexus properly, as I mentioned, everything is a beta with them. At any moment they might change their mind, or scrap it and do something else, there is no feeling of stability. As for services, Google has a huge lead on Apple on services, which are not Apple's strong point. But Google's own services work better and are better designed on Apple's products. I cannot comment about OSX itself, just the hardware, so I will take your word for it. Personally, I don't have much interest in it, and I too prefer Windows to OSX and even to Linux. However, most people that I know that tried OSX, switched. Finally, Apple innovates, even though many people don't like to admit it, they do push things forward. They pushed the retina screen, they pushed the fingerprint sensor, etc... Watch as future phones have pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback. Hrishikesh Bisen Well actually Android Watch OS is wrost in all Watch OS Sk0ly Let's try that again in English Charlie Well, Android is here for 8 years isn't it? And Nexus phones/Pixel products are also still being supported? No? AlRegals Google TV...... Sk0ly Bad example. Google TV was ahead of its time and the Cablecos were the ones who murdered that platform, not google. If we are doing a comparison, how about the Microsoft Courier or Windows Phone 7 or Apple with the Newton. PVL_93_RU Android TV is dead too though Sk0ly Hahaha you are joking right? You realize like 80% of television manufacturers this year are shipping TVs running Android TV right? On top of that, google is aggressively backing the Xiaomi mii box. I do wish for a pixel player one day though. Hrishikesh Bisen Where did you get this figures, Although I'm sure Samsung and LG doesn't support Android TV. Sk0ly Sony, Sharp, Philips, Vizio, RCA, Hisense, etc. I'll admit that stat was a bit overzealous when considering Samsung Smart TV and the recently purchased WebOS for LG. With that said, Sony, Philips, and Sharp sell a lot of TVs and Android tv is a way better experience. I love my Nexus player, albeit a bit buggy but would love to see a pixel branded Android tv box but I doubt that would happen. Sk0ly OK, maybe 80% was pushing it but the list of OEM's is very long. Sony, Sharp, Philips, Hisense, Vizio, TCL, RCA, Bang & Olafsen, Vestel, Arcelik Pretty much the only major manufacturers not on board are LG because they bought WebOS from HP and have invested in it, Samsung because they have years of investment into their platform, and Panasonic because they don't care about a decent smarttv platform. Of that list, the first three sell a lot of TV's (Sony/Sharp/Philips) and the smaller vendors are on the rise. https://www.statista.com/statistics/267095/global-market-share-of-lcd-tv-manufacturers/ Samsung & LG combined for about 30% of the market last year and are on the decline. Having used all three platforms, Android TV is by far the best experience. Android TV added a ton of OEM's this year and I expect that to continue as Samsung and LG will not be able to compete on developers. This is because A. There is already a large community of Android Developers so they don't need to learn to code for a new platform and B. It will be on more brands, reducing the need to create a variety of different apps for different platforms. Charlie So we agree that it can go either way? thartist You're quite right, but at least at this point it's not about branching into unnecessary experiments like ChromeOS, but converging OSs. And in the end it all aims to converge on Fuchsia, the one for all, like Microsoft did with Windows 8+. browngeek Port it to the Pixel C already! David Ruddock It's already been said to us that Google is using Pixel C as a test platform for Andromeda (as 9to5G said, they also used N9, but we think they've moved on), but before people go nuts: that doesn't necessarily mean anything in terms of Pixel C ever getting Andromeda officially. browngeek Juicy! Read on Android Authority that the N9 was being tested, but no mention of the Pixel C. Faheem Ahmed ONLY IF THEY MAKE ANDROID SO POWERFUL....THAT IT COULD RIVAL WINDOWS 10(AMAZING FEATURES AND SOOOO MUCH SETTINGS AND STUFF) THEN someone755 I think Microsoft crippled Windows 10 enough that you'd only need support for running Windows programs (Steam, Adobe CS, Office etc.) and enough drivers to support the majority of today's devices to take over people's computers with your own OS. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Crippled in what way, exactly? Windows 10's their best desktop OS yet. Andromeda will need to rival it for me to switch. someone755 For me, every way. There is nothing better in w10 than in w8.1. The Start menu is a mess, the updates are just horribly executed ("Hey, do you want this upda-- TOO LATE WE INSTALLED IT ALREADY AND REMOVED A PROGRAM YOU WERE USING"), the fact they're trying to force their mobile apps in a desktop environment by making a crippled Settings app etc. I miss Charms, the Start screen, and a less-shitty version of Windows Update, along with a better Control Panel. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Interesting. I've found it to be consistently better in nearly every way except for tablet experience, which I rarely use, and which has been improved dramatically anyway. You're literally the first person I've seen prefer 8.1. Normally everybody hates 8.x with a passion for irrational reasons. someone755 I really don't understand the hate. Compared to Windows 7, so little was changed, -- other than some minor design tweaks, the Start screen and Charms, very little was changed -- and it could easily be used as a desktop platform, without the silly apps and Store being shoved down your throat. And most of the Settings app's options were still available through the Control Panel and elsewhere. I don't get who dictates to these people what to like and what to religiously hate, but there has got to be a site or magazine that tells people what's popular right now. Because there is no reason why people would just unanimously agree that something sucks this much. Roger Siegenthaler Ignoring all the group policies and enterprise related stuff what you're suggesting is still a massive amount of work. Let alone the driver part is a massive issue. Lare2 All sound nice ..... But where's Allo .? someone755 Allo? You mean the already released and lame chatting app? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Allo? On the Play Store already? Lare2 I guess a "/s" was necessary .. LOL Suicide_Note https://media1.giphy.com/media/g1xNFWSvnnFJu/giphy.gif jesuguru ...for liposuction Suicide_Note Among other things. blindexecutioner What the pixel C should have been. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman And likely was supposed to be. Stevie_Wonder Teasing it the 4th, presenting it start of next year, telling us it will release soon at the end of next year, buying it in Q2 of 2018 and a year or 2 later the whole thing is abandoned. I really hope not, but one can not be a bit pessimistic with all the stuff Google is doing and not doing anymore. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman This is a touch different from some communications app. This sounds like the entire direction of the most successful software platform Google has, combined with the second most successful software platform Google has. Stevie_Wonder I totally agree. Wasn't referring to only the communication-app-maze Google is dropping it's users in. But with all the name changes (Nexus to Pixel, Chromecast to Cast) and the doubt around support (will the old Nexus get the new updates from 7.1 and the launcher the Pixels will get) and slow release of products around the world, Google isn't really strong in building a lifetime platform. Except, over time, with Android. Chrome OS still has to prove itself in my eyes and while I really hope this is going to work, I think they should've done this from the start.. and with announcing things way ahead of release, the hype train goes to another station. Yes, combining their most successful software platforms (do they have others?) sounds great, but they should've done it earlier and should already be able to bring it out, instead of a year later. Grimmjow Meh krazyfrog Hardware aside, what sort of third party app ecosystem are we talking about here? The laughable Android tablet apps? The utterly hilarious Chrome OS "apps"? Or something completely new? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The former, but with a push to make them actually happen. philosopher_Mk Probably Android apps + desktop version of Chrome browser. PVL_93_RU That's Chrome OS TedPhillips and GoogleTV alexg Yeah what about the watches?? Justin W Well, considering Chromebooks run Android apps and they look just fine (you'll recall that Android 7.0 added easy resizability, I'm sure), I'd expect Android appsand Chrome (with all it's extensions and apps) in a desktop-browser version. Andrew Bone And it's all built on Fuchsia... Right? bdbplatano That's what I was wondering too. Surely they have to have some kind of interplay philosopher_Mk Nope,have you read the article ? Andrew Bone Yes, Android is built on top of the Linux platform (as is Chrome OS). I was just wondering if they might swap that out for Fuchsia. David Ruddock No. It's built on Android. Andrew Bone So Linux (as the underbelly of Android) could not be swapped out with Fuchsia? I just presumed that would be the only reason google would start at the bottom and work their way up. Carson Saldanha He didn't read ur article lol Captain_Invisible That's IoT... right? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I would personally wager that a break from the Android name might come with this. Because if this is going to be a desktop-class OS, then the entire control of updates and other factors needs to shift to Google for the first time for ALL devices. That requires a fundamental rethinking of how the OS works with OEMs and how it's presented to consumers from them, which to me would justify a new name so people can confidently recognize the difference. Captain_Invisible Andromeda would be such a cool name, but I doubt it's going to be anything but a code name. Jared I dunno, if you squint real hard you can combine Android and Chrome to make And-rome-da or Andr-ome-da. Basically Android+Chrome?... Da (Russian for yes). jesuguru Chrandroid? _jsw_ Bison Savings Account: Activated! (if it's a dud, I can always buy the 2018 Pixel XXL) Yura Kazimirov Can it run Overwatch is the real question! David Prieto "Via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa" So, what type of features are we talking about? David McClellan I'm assuming this is multiwindow support, not just split screen. An application "dock" as opposed to a launcher, and extension support I would assume. Also having access to ChromeOS/Desktop Chrome API's would be awesome for webapp integration. David Prieto What API again? philosopher_Mk Desktop ui,desktop browser, seamless updates , better right click support, multi window . David Prieto Yeah, those seem to make sense and are already on their way to being implemented, or don't look like they'd be a lot of work But then it wouldn't be "merging" Android and Chrome OS, as much as turning Android into a usable desktop system and ditching Chrome OS. Would it? philosopher_Mk Yes, I guess they are just making Android more usable desktop system and ditching Chrome os. It makes sense , Android is their most successful product since Google search. David Ruddock We'd like to know, too! But at this point, we don't. David Prieto It can be fun to speculate tho :-P Jason Allen They already did the boot feature. Maybe the other features are security features like the chrome OS reboot to reset everything. David Ruddock Sure - seamless updates is definitely the first big one. Itchy_Robot Let us know if you hear anything about better security updates. I really love how my 8 year old Asus windows 7 (updated to Win10 for free) still gets security updates. I hope Google is trying to eventually move to that model rather than the "2.5 years and your out" model they currently have. The way the OS is structured now relies on 3rd parties implementing the security updates rather than Google pushing it directly to the user. I hope one day Google can get their OS in shape to handle 'direct to the consumer' security updates. Captain_Invisible Updates. Zaptor99 Google is exhausting !!!! Carson Saldanha I have a feeling it'll be like the Surface Pro's. It'll run full Android in tablet mode and Chrome OS in laptop mode. b_boogey_xl Is this how they plan on taking control of Android? By making another OS but this time they have full control over it… 🤔 J3R3MY_H Not sure what Andromeda does for me that Android apps in ChromeOS doesn't do. Hopefully I'll understand better next week. a.d.AM And why do I want this? What will it do that Android or Chrome OS hasn't done? I've never once said "oh, I have to pull out my Chromebook to take care of this task." This will flop just like Allo. Stephen Sharp People have been pushing for Android as a desktop OS since before it was even really a tablet os pfmiller It's never made sense to me why people have wanted that though. Neither the OS nor the apps are well suited to desktop use. Stephen Sharp How so? I grant you the chicken & the egg problem of scalable Android apps, but I believe that's what Android apps are for on ChromeOS - a trojan horse, or a red carpet, getting developers to get their apps ready for this But, how is Android not suited for a desktop besides UI (which will be solved when Google actually ships Android for a particular formfactor and not before) pfmiller It's just designed for a touch screen which does not make for a good desktop experience. Sure, you can rework the whole interface of the OS and apps to make them work on a desktop, but why? There are already desktop OSs and applications that do everything you need. Stephen Sharp Why have the same ecosystem for your Laptop, Phone, Tablet, Car, TV (Console for me thanks to Shield), and Watch, pay-once-run-everywhere? No no you're right I don't know what I was thinking :P Stephen Sharp That's still just UI. Nothing inherently wrong with the OS for Desktop use. And if Jide (the behemoth that it is) can make Android work nice on a desktop, surely Google can. As for why, buy-once-run-everywhere apps. Also, Android is awesome because reasons thats why mattcoz It will hopefully deliver a full-fledged desktop OS, that's what Android and Chrome OS haven't done. a.d.AM But what will it do that OSs have not been able to do previously? Combining them givess me more apps I guess, but I've never felt any lack of apps. If you're telling me it'll run apps that Android or Chrome could never run, that would be something! Being able to use apps like Paper, Traktor, and other iOS only apps would be huge. But i have a feeling it'll be another google fail. Combine 2 OSs with no additional benefits. Typical modern innovation. mattcoz Apps (ugh, I still hate that word) are not the issue here. Android and Chrome OS have never been viable alternatives to Windows or OSX or any decent Linux distro. Will Andromeda? Time will tell. Wes C >But the Pixel and Pixel XL, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View, and the new Chromecast Ultra will likely remain the focus on that day Have we forgotten about the smartwatches?? I really need to replace my OG G Watch... http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/11/exclusive-these-could-be-googles-upcoming-android-wear-smartwatches/ Chris Yessss I would love a nice replacement for my Gear Live thartist Smartwatches are a fad gone. br_hermon Flood of thoughts running through my head but 1st thoughts... "Android" as a beloved brand and I hope Google sticks with it to brand this going forward. Samsung must be prepping for full court press with Tizen right now and see the "writing on the wall" in terms of Google's current/past Android / OEM relationship structure. Cory Wilson I just hope as far as updates go, it's more chrome OS in those regards m0ritz They should just develop it for the Pixel C... This tablet was planned to run Chrome OS... And it's still the strongest tablet on the market. Stephen Sharp Maybe they will offer the option, who knows Captain_Invisible By then it will be about two years old, so I really doubt that. mattcoz They should just develop it for what would be 2 year old hardware? How does that make any sense? roberto.elena What a downer, I wanted to buy a chromebook (a decent one) later this year or early next year, as soon as the Android apps on Chrome OS became a stable option, but now... too many unknowns for the future of current chromebooks. Stephen Sharp Get a refurbed Chromebook Flip to hold you over roberto.elena Unfortunately the availability of Chromebooks is not so good in my country compared to the US. TigerMike901 Well, given the info, I guess I can't wait to see some kind of demo to see the real benefits of Andromeda. Right now I just can't imagine it could do more for me than ChromeOS with Android apps baked in. I mean honestly, I don't really see much of a difference in merging the two to form Andromeda. Stephen Sharp Well in a few years it will do one thing better than Android Apps on Chromebooks: it will still exist. If this is true, it makes more sense than Android Apps on Chromebooks, and Android on Chromebooks are either the trojan horses to get developers to finally make Android Apps that scale well for a laptop formfactor, or a swan song and a parting gift (or maybe both) Scott Miller Correction: Android apps on Chromebooks did not descend from the ARC project. They ditched that approach in favor of a full Android subsystem. This was actually a critical argument in court with Oracle recently. David Ruddock That's correct. The initial approach (ARC) wasn't utilized, but as you said, a new one then emerged. Sorry if the language there was inartful - I meant more that it descended theoretically, not technically. I was just trying to show that it had no relationship to the Andromeda project, not trying to imply that ARC itself powered Android apps on Chrome OS (this was also asked at I/O, where Google gave a similar answer about ARC being abandoned). Quentin SILVESTRE I think their comment is more about the general idea behind the two approaches. Sure the tech changed a lot, but it was still inspired by the desire to have android apps working on chrome os. Andromeda is a merger of two OSes and is a much bigger project. Meaning : Knowing andromeda was a long way off, they probably figured they should find a way to bring android apps to chrome os as we know it today. Plus it gives time and hardware for developpers to prepare for a version of android that would span acrosse multiple form factors. Rocco Augusto While Google did ditch ARC technology as an extension that could be loaded into Chrome, they still do refer to the Android subsystem/container as ARC in the Chrome OS code base. So technically, you're both right. :) JD I don't know. Based on how Google's past hardware undertakings have been I don't really want to pay premium dollars to be a beta tester. Announcements like this setup Surface level expectations. Looking at the Pixel C that was definitely not Surface level polished product. It was and still is a half finished work in progress, and with Google only promising 24 months of major releases I'm tired of paying to be a beta tester just to be abandoned with a half finished product. If they promised 3-4 years of support I might jump or if the technology allowed for a windows type experience where I could upgrade drivers(I know that's not how it works). At this point Google seems to be going in a paradigm shift, I'm going to sit back and wait till they settle in and head towards to polish phase (Which I don't think they'll ever head in). I'm just a bit tired of the throw everything at the wall and see what sticks approach, they need focus. Patrick Plante If they bake us a full compliant Android device that has a full Chome browser, I'm sold, that would the the exact thing I would want, best of both world. You could add real multi-window management and that would do the trick. Not talking about side by side here, while useful, I would like to get real window management. Stephen Sharp This + full access to Bash (maybe in a developer mode) and I wouldn't need anything else :P Patrick Plante Forgot that, you're right! Stephen Sharp I suppose the same people asking "why" now asked "why" in 2010* when Google first started beta testing Chromebooks, and this makes more sense than ChromeOS did back then. ChromeOS doesn't do anything that Android can't, merely things that Android currently doesn't do David Ruddock This is an excellent way to put it, and I've long thought something similar. Android has huge advantages over Chrome for hardware extensibility, content ecosystem, and developer support. One of those you could maybe, eventually replicate in Chrome OS. But two you could not. PVL_93_RU By content ecosystem - do you mean apps/programs? And is developer support an issue for ChromeOS when they're bringing over millions of Android apps and extensions aren't going away from Chrome? jesuguru Is running Android apps in a subsystem on ChromeOS the same as running natively on Android/Andromeda? PVL_93_RU good point, of course Native will be superior TedPhillips i would strongly disagree about 'hardware extensibility'. crOS's sane approach to hardware is exactly why there is no update lag, OEM churn, premature EOL of devices, or platform software fragmentation. android's approach to hardware is spaghetti meets wall, and first one to drop support after the sale - wins. Patrick Plante Someone knows if the october 4th event is livestreamed? If yes, someone has a link that will stream it and/or the exact time of the event, including UTC. Thanks. TigerMike901 Google usually live streams these things on Youtube....but the link probably won't be up until the 4th. sleepinlight So, there's really no news on what this means for phones? I'll be honest, this is cool and all, but this is probably the least interesting way that this news could have taken shape for me. I was really hoping this would be more about fixing problems with Android on phones (updates/fragmentation, poor way of handling background services, performance issues) than putting Android on a laptop. Duder12 Huh? They already are by ignoring the OEMs and doing their own thing. The pixel line will finally give them the control of the software/hardware they need. pfmiller The Nexus phones already gave them the control of the software they needed. He's talking about for devices that Google doesn't control. Stephen Sharp Why not both? They could be starting in a formfactor that OEMS haven't cared about, so "wrestling control" from them wouldn't be a problem. Google learns how best to do updates, then they come for the Android TVs, then the tablets, then smartwatches, then phones Antics Uh oh. Concern: will "Android" remain alive as available to anyone via AOSP but "Andromeda" is Google's proprietary fork (akin to the Nexus factory images) or new proprietary OS (as the article[s] suggest) and will only be available for Google's devices as to try to compete with Apple's other computing solutions? Meaning, "Andromeda" may never end up on other manufacturer's excellent hardware. Duder12 So the other manufacturers can ruin he operating system and the brand like they do now? No thank you! I dont need Andromeda Touchwiz Samsung laptops. Railwayman Other manufacturers can't 'ruin' anything if Google put certain rules in place. You should compare with Windows Phone 7 - it launched on devices from HTC, LG and Samsung - all of them running a similar OS with some small differences. You could also look at desktop Windows and Linux, which runs on several different computers despite being the same system (Ubuntu is always Ubuntu regardless of brand name of the computer). Andromeda will fail IF Google attempt to make it 'in-house' only but will be successful if they make it available for other OEMs - with strict requirements of allowed modifications (i.e. they can bundle with different apps and services but not touch the system itself). KChristainsen pass Adithya Pc Inb4 Andromeda Police comments Defenestratus I already checked the domain registrar and its been taken :P alexg None needs that grizzlyjon83 I just can't see ChromeOS sticking around for too long after Andromeda. It'll be the Windows RT of the Google world. Duder12 Yep I agree TigerMike901 Whether ChromeOS exists after Andromenda or not, Google has to support it for a few more years to come. ChromeOS saw a big adoption in the education space, and abandoning it would surely leave a sour taste for many after making the large investments. I think it will either be around or be supported for a while, and then Andromeda will fully take over. In Google's End of Life document on Chromebooks, many models are stated to be supported up to 2020, and some recent models through 2021. Stephen Sharp I don't see them abandoning it at all. Quite frankly ChromeOS already does all it needs to do for those who adopted it, and add Android apps to the mix and it does more than enough. It can live on on the backburner for a while merely getting Chrome browser and security updates, and hopefully, eventually, users of ChromeOS will see Andromeda doing everything they need and more, and switch over grizzlyjon83 That's a fair point about the education space. Regardless, it'll probably get phased out eventually, but it will make it more of a slow death. deppman ah, come on. ChromeOS isn't *that* bad :) PVL_93_RU I don't think they need to spend too much resources to support it though. They basically roll the updates out at the same time as Chrome for other platforms, since the software department is entirely on Google's part and the OEMs only provide the hardware (the Chromebooks), so the worst that can happen is it will slowly fade away as Andromeda takes over both mobile and desktop class of Google products Mix My dad told me his favorite animal before he walked out the door and something bad happened to him but I will never forget it, Bison...... I am hoping that the phone and 7" tablet are not $600+ CAD...fingers crossed PVL_93_RU inb4 no LTE capability David Ruddock That doesn't actually seem to be planned at the moment. But it could change. PVL_93_RU Well the Pixel C still doesn't have an LTE version either so... I'm not holding my breath :( Ace AP has pretty much stripped Google off from any surprises in Oct 4th, we know almost everything now...it'll now be like attending the event as deja vu Joris Griffioen Yeah, kinda sad really. Unless they come with some real surprises. Like non-fugly Pixel phones for instance... PVL_93_RU That's what always happens though. Still excited for the event, since we don't EXACTLY know how the whole Andromeda thing is gonna work or look etc Blac Chyna instagram Google is planning a new Pixel laptop to be released in Q3 2017. The project, known internally as 'Bison' and by the informal nickname 'Pixel 3,' will likely be the first brand-new device to showcase Google's combined Android / Chrome OS 'Andromeda' operating system in a laptop form factor. Bison, then, would be the culmination of years of work by Google's Pixel team and Google's Android and Chrome OS teams. wrkerr At first glance of the headline, I read a Pixel 3' laptop, and so I started imagining a laptop with a 36" screen. :) TJStrat Looks like Google is inspired by Microsoft. A PC OS which runs apps. This sounds like Windows 10 to me. Nick Interesting. Developer driven apps. Would be pretty cool to see a suite of android development apps on their new platform, but not sure the market needs to be skewed anymore like the messaging scene. Now if only I didn't have to have a mac to develop for iOS, sigh. Still is exciting though. jon I seen this coming years ago. i hope google releases the os in a iso format. but probably not Marko Šaric Cool, I guess. More expensive shit that I can't afford but would like to. Anyway, all I would be doing on that laptop would be refreshing Android police 8 times a day and watching YouTube. keithzg For that you could probably just hook a monitor and keyboard up to a Raspberry Pi ;) Madis After all this, why was the original article about Andromeda claimed to be wrong then? To discourage leaks? http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/10/29/wsj-google-reportedly-plans-to-merge-chrome-into-android-form-single-new-os-in-2017/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/11/02/google-refutes-rumors-of-chrome-os-merging-with-android-says-its-here-to-stay/ person Technically nothing has changed. They've said that Android and Chrome weren't merging but that they'd bring the best of each platform to the other. Design and apps are coming to ChromeOS though whatever will end up in Andromeda is yet to be known. Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Madis Both still exist and there is no 'merger'. Well, yes, because it's still 2016. They could "bring the best" from/to each other, but if Andromeda is real, I bet at least one of those OSs (Chrome OS) will still be discontinued eventually, ending up with a merge. Maybe if phones get better, they'll discontinue Android too and use Andromeda with wired full computer capabilities (you know, Continuum). person Potential has no bearing on intent or feasibility. Regardless of whether a merger could happen at some point in the indefinite future, as it stands now that is not the case. ChromeOS and Android coexist; there is no merger. Jordan L take my money. bugdroid Ok. Lawrence Q3 2017 ZzzZzzZz Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Is the Andromeda name confirmed for commercial launch? Or will it be Android Desktop a la Android Wear? TigerMike901 Android Desktop running Andromeda? :) Jamie Moore Q3 of 2017? Glad I got my Pixel LS... keithzg And I'm still choked that Google refused to sell me one, although admittedly I rarely use a laptop. 1pixel What a time to be alive Deckard_Cain Why no dedicated GPU??? Stephen Sharp For Android games? They aren't there yet bmlsayshi As a person who loves Android and finds it vastly preferable to the alternatives... I have to ask why? Why kill Chrome OS like that? It's different enough and single purposed enough. I don't wan't Chrome on Android. I don't even care about Android on Chrome. I LOVE Chrome OS but I don't foresee using it on Android. Charlie You don't even know HOW the products/OSD is designed , will be rolled out and/or in what sense it will be replacing Chrome OS. It's still a year away. Just relax, and see where this take us. It might be a smoother transition than you think. keithzg /me switches .com to .ca, sees price go up to $1,257.28 with another $100 in shipping, weeps Amit_N At $799, I can buy a laptop with 256 SSD and i7, that can power any damn linux distro along with Windows. Am I the only one that is not sold with this devices? Jaime I'm in the market for a new laptop, care to give me an example of which laptop can I get with the internals you mentioned? Thanks! Amit_N I have older version of this laptop with i5, I absolutely love this laptop. Total value for money. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015P3SKHQ Jaime Awesome, thank you! keithzg I have a first-hand Pixel, and it's the construction that has me still holding onto it instead of buying a newer laptop. The screen ratio is actually pretty fantastic and you don't find it anywhere else, and as someone who's allergic to branding (well, as allergic as people are to wifi, which is to say that it's all in my head but I'm rabid about it) the unadorned metal lid is a godsend. I dual-boot mine with ChromeOS and Kubuntu; if Google had ever deigned to sell the second-gen Pixel here in Canada I would've bought that too. warcaster Hopefully they make some $200-$250 ARM variants as well, not 100% Intel as they've been pushing so far with Chromebooks. Even Andromeda notebooks with Zen APUs would be a breath of fresh air. keithzg Huh? There's plenty if ARM Chromebooks. Or do you mean Pixel devices? 'Cause the most recent of those, the Pixel C, was also ARM. MJ My questions are.... Will I be able to install this Andromeda OS on a laptop I already own? Would I be able to install a different OS on this upcoming "Bison" aka Pixel 3 device (easily)? I get the feeling this is just another step down the road to turn desktop PCs into locked down smartphones with a monitor and keyboard/mouse. meijin3 Any news on the Pixel C running Andromeda? PVL_93_RU It'd be very weird if it didn't considering on the base system level it can theoretically at least dualboot Sarath Chandra Gullapalli Could Google unveil "Universal Apps" at the Oct 4th event ?? PVL_93_RU universal apps? person Insinuating that they aren't already? deppman This was so obvious in 2012; Google should have had a Jide-remix-like skunkworks project on this *then*, not in 2015. It's like captain obvious finally walked up to Sergey and slapped him in the face. I'm happy with this direction, and really look forward to the OS. I just wish they'd gotten on it sooner. TedPhillips bleh, I need to go reread the andromeda article.... as someone who's into both ecosystems from a technical angle, putting cros bits into android, instead of android bits into cros still seems like the much worse option... doesn't mean it won't be successful, but i think the world would be a better place with the reverse. keithzg Yeah, ChromeOS's guts are a much saner, much more standard stack. Android suffers from a lot of NIH syndrome under the hood by comparison. I suppose with how Google has been trending towards being more proprietary and locked-down recently it makes sense they'd go that direction, but it's still disappointing. drksilenc I read that as a 3' pixel laptop at first... Brian These sound a lot like Reef and Kevin chromebooks? keithzg So I wonder if it'll be available in Canada like the Pixel C, or weirdly unavailable here like the Chromebook Pixels. Although about a year out is admittedly too soon to be worrying about availability, heh. Luxferro If it doesn't have replaceable storage (m.2 SSD), then I'll never be interested in google's premium laptops. It was the reason I did not buy the previous Pixel laptop. Stephen Sharp I'd like to sign up for the giveaway, please :P Adal With all these exclusive Google article in AP, i have a feeling Sundar Pichai is directly working with AP. is he your primary source of leaks? :) Peterson Silva No, they just have someone hidden under his desk. Shhh, don't tell him :D PVL_93_RU that's because the AP crew are actually Google employees, but shhh, nobody should know this juanjeremy2012 man i just hope it doenst lose the slickness of chromebooks. chromebooks do 90% of what you do better than windows and if they added an off line office suite that number would jump to 97%. juanjeremy2012 i dont want these expensive aluminum ultrathin things. i just want a decent plastic design like what is on hp stream or dell latitude that doesnt flex for about $500 JohnCalla $800 for a 12" Android laptop. Not seeing much of a market for this. Jonathan Ramos Wait why 2017? Seems like a great time to release. I doubt anyone is rushing out and getting Pixel tablets running Android this Christmas. LewisSD Just sayin, I totally wrote a thread about this merger of Android and Chrome 4 years ago on androidandme. I'm stoked to see Google make it happen! Chris Johnston so the question is... will this gain market share and actually be viable? or will this be steam OS part 2? I know, different applications and all, but they are both built off of linux. Chris Skipper 9 reasons why Andromeda HAS to be a Chrome OS mode inside Android: 1. Google has said Chrome OS is here to stay and not only said that Chrome OS would continue to exist, a spokesperosn also confirmed to The Verge that BOTH Android and Chrome OS will continue to exist, which means they will continue to be offered as separate products. 2. Hiroshi Lockehimer, SVP of Andorid, Chrome OS, and Google Play has told JR Raphel that he made no sense of the rumors that first came out 3. Even though Hiroshi Lockheimer said he couldn't make sense of the rumor, the original Wall Street Journal report even though mentioned that Android remained as the dominant system, they said that Google would continue to maintain Chrome OS but the focus would be using Chrome OS to expand Android onto PCs. 4. Eric Schmidt in TechCrunch has said that you don't get rid of one or the other, but that technlogy moves forward when one can be wrapped into the other and mentioned how the environments can come together, but mentioned that the OS system attributes should be separate. 5. To make the two operating systems into one operating system, you would need to save both the advantages of using Chrome OS and the advantages of using Android. You can decide to merge Android into Chrome OS but that would require virtualization or dual booting. Then if you decide to do Andromeda without continuing to offer Chrome OS, you lose the advantages of Chrome OS. 6. Google wouldn't be building Fuchsia if they knew they could just merge Android and Chrome OS which means there would be no intention on writing a new OS and like Hiroshi said, if they thought about both of these on day one the foundation would've been built to have the best of both but Android and Chrome OS 7. There will not a "desktop version of Android" because the material design showcase does not show a desktop version of Android. It shows Chrome OS. That freeform mode is hidden deliberately because it's only there to create APIs so that way Android apps on Chrome isn't like the beta where there are fixed sizes and you can't resize your Android apps. 8. An AndroidCentral journalist claims that the Pixel C was made to run Android but with a desktop version of Chrome with ARM APIs even though the Pixel C was planned with Project Athena, Frankenboard, and then they decided to just flash Android. 9. AndroidPolice says Andromeda is Android and that Chrome OS will still be something else and now you see BOTH TABLETS AND PCs being tested with this new OS while Chrome OS has never been on anything else but a PC. What Google would have to do to build Andromeda as a mode within Android: 1. Take the Chrome browser from the Chrome OS client and make it an app inside Android. 2. Create a Quick Setting inside Android that opens this app when pressed. 3. Now you have a Windows 8 esquesqe functionality for Android (except that one environment wouldn't be used as a launcher for the other). 4. The utility used to tap into the container for Chrome OS would be used so that way it would tap into the same libs used in the Android System so that way Android Apps can function in the Chrome browser inside the Android System. 5. The utility also packages Android APKs into Chrome Packaged Apps but instead the utility would be tweaked to use redirects in place where the Android APK files would go, like your APK, saves, and states, with the redirects pointing towards the system/app or system/priv-app folders inside the root. The browser would also use the utility to write and delete in that same folder. 6. Finally, when you go into the browser the browser will start a clean new instance and then read the Android apps currently open on recent apps and then do a new instruction that does a call to launch the corresponding CRXs on the browser and then execute the states that are persistently saved as you use Android apps. When you leave the Webtop Mode via an option in the Chrome OS status area, the browser will make the same call to the Android System by having your apps cleared and then opening up the same apps that were opened on the browser and then also executing the states that are being persistently saved as you use your Android apps on Chrome OS. The final result is to create a hybrid operating system where you can use Android as a tablet like you always have been doing but now you'll be able to connect a mouse to your tablet and then be able to switch your UI between Android System UI and Chrome Ash Window Manager with zero interruptions. You would also be able to use your phone as a desktop by connecting it to a display using this same mode. MuleForRent Prevent owners from upgrading the SSD and you'll still sell a lot. Let us add serious storage and Microsoft/Apple will be in for a terrible shock MuleForRent One of the great possible outcomes here is an office suite application 'reset' that strips the crazy complexity and bulk out of native apps. I'd switch from Windows just to get nicely designed, simpler versions of Outlook and Word. Google Docs is great for lots of stuff, but native apps still have their place, and Gmail in all forms is still unpleasant to look at and use. TONY ALDO Q3 2017? ugh talk about cock tease. captainhurt chrome os is NOT about PROVIDING features or apps, but rather about BEING, as an os is defined, a platform to deliver features and apps. Chrome is ALL ABOUT being a platform that is an inherently secure, inherently up-to-date, inherently backed-up, simple, low-cost, lightweight, very fast, cloud-based easy-to-use thin-client. TheSpaceUnicorn The only thing that would make me interested in an Andromeda laptop is full Adobe CC being on it. That's my one requirement for any laptop. Quentin Menini Will Andromeda be called "pixel OS" ? mudi1 its hard incredibly hard to play and win in Microsoft's field, many tried but all lost. if google planning to give a worthy alternative of MS windows then its nothing less then going against titans . i go point wise - 1. AAA gaming is the shied of windows OS and if google wants to succeed they must target AAA gamer requirements. 2. google must start making deals with game devs to code their games on Vulkan API coz 95% AAA games code on DirectX which is MS proprietary . if they code on vulkan then they can be easily playable on google notebook. 3. GPU licensing can play a major role for ex just give amd 20-30$/chip as license and get their big gpu tech like 1024 core Polaris gpu, then couple that with ARM cpu cores ... this will allow google to cut cost like magic bcoz 8 core A73 core cpu built on 10nm node will require just 16 mm2 of die space so cost of soc will be much lower then intel offering hence google will have a price advantage and i choosed AMD polaris coz all console games developed on amd GCN arch. 4. give more support to ARM arch as there is more competition like qualcomm, mediatek, Kirin, imagination and more competition means much faster pace of performance/dollar. 5. fully flagged performance notebook should start with price tag of 400 dollar so that wide adoption will face no trouble . 6. last but most imp - add dedicated external gpu feature on notebooks yes i said external gpu , same way as razor core link - http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-core thats much needed feature and if google does that then it will sell like hot cakes. just do this and whole gaming community will make a shift to gogole. Hadrian Węgrzynowski > Android apps on Chrome OS descended from the ARC project, while Andromeda is a much larger, more ambitious initiative that is being pursued via merging Chrome features into Android, not vice versa. First part of this sentence is wrong. ChromeOS had experimental ARC (App Runtime for Chrome), but it went nowhere near to support all of Android apps. They abandoned this approach and went with separate Android container beside ChromeOS. You even written about it [1], it is mentioned in Wikipedia [2]. [1] http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/22/chrome-android-apps-show-stable-chrome-os-first-time/ [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS#Android_applications - second paragraph person A descendant as in they are both part of the same initiative--bringing Android apps to ChromeOS. Andromeda is not. indiandragon Lol, 'merging Chrome features into Android' Isn't that why chrome is there in Playstore already ? If at all something, this should be Android x86 running chrome as front end. Assuming that this is capable of running Android apps natively by design, I'm not sure how google plans of keeping Chrome OS project alive. Pixel Spot If Google uses the "Pixel 3" name for the laptops, what will they do then for the "Pixel 3" phones? Drew Ciccotelli What do you suppose Fuchsia is gonna run on? Andy Chow Not sure I'm happy about this. ChromeOS has been the perfect OS on a laptop so far. Those that say "for the same price I can get a MacBook pro" just don't get it, and probably never will. I didn't get the Pixel C because it wasn't ChromeOS. dontpanicbobby For as minute there I thought they were selling a 3 foot laptop. I had to re-read the title. Akash1NY Well this never happened... :-/ jet sky i wont waste any money on this os on my pc and even it is free os because of google ads alway sucks Dustin Mingo Any thoughts on whether this could be related to the Samsung Chromebook plus that recently came out? If not, is there any more recent information on this?

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Laptops HP EliteBook x360 is a stunning, practical laptop for work: review By Brooke Crothers Published June 09, 2017 Fox News Facebook Twitter Comments Email Print (HP EliteBook x360, Credit: Hewlett-Packard) Hewlett-Packard has built an amazing laptop that any business can bank on. HP has been making laptops for businesses for a long time and it shows. The 2017 EliteBook x360 nails all the essentials including design, construction, keyboard, battery life, performance, portability, and security. I’ve been using the 13.3-inch EliteBook x360 for the last month or so. Here’s my brief review. Design strikes a key balance  The all-metal design strikes the best balance of thinness (under 0.6 inches thick) weight (2.8 pounds), size, and sturdiness in any 13-inch laptop I’ve used to date. In short, it’s lightweight but built for MIL-STD-810G certification, which means it can survive hard knocks, drops and extreme temperatures. TIME TO GET A SMARTWATCH? HERE ARE 5 OF THE BEST FOR THE SUMMER Keyboard provides a great experience In my experience, HP has always built great keyboards and this is one of the best typing experiences yet with deep, comfortable clicks despite the laptop’s thin design. The one downside for me has been figuring out common, older key combinations for functions like “insert” or “print screen” on the modern 2017 HP keyboard, but that’s a minor gripe. Battery life  The EliteBook x360 has a ton of battery life, even besting MacBooks I’ve owned with good battery life. Your mileage will vary but I can use the laptop pretty much all day -- up to 10 hours of use -- with the display dimmed a bit and with an average workload (Web, light multimedia, Microsoft Office). HP rates the battery at “up to 16 hours and 30 minutes.” Performance  Part of the delicate balancing act is finding a happy medium between performance and battery life. The Intel 7th Generation Core i7 processor in my model is plenty fast, making it one of the snappiest laptops I’ve ever used. NEW SURFACE PRO KEEPS BEST OF PRO 4, IMPROVES WHERE IT COUNTS: HANDS-ON REVIEW Security The EliteBook x360 is packed with security features to make it as bullet-proof as possible for business. Features that stood out to me is the ability to sign in using either facial recognition (a very fast process) or a fingerprint scanner. Display The touch display has a 360-degree hinge, meaning you can configure it as a tablet or prop it up for a presentation in “tent mode.” The display is bright and offers good-enough resolution (1,920-by-1,080) for a business laptop. On a premium laptop, however, I would like to see a higher-resolution display as standard. A very-high-resolution display is also available as an option.  Ports A good selection of connectors, including one USB Type-C (the tiny USB connector that comes on most new laptops), two traditional (old-style) USB ports, one HDMI connector for use with an external display, and a micro SIM slot. Price: Good doesn’t come cheap. That said, at a starting price on HP’s website of $1,319, it’s close to the price of the newest low-end 13-inch MacBook Pro.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Chipmaker Ambarella Tumbles on Wretched Guidance It beat expectations for the last quarter, but the company’s key customer is GoPro, and its fears about where the action-camera maker is headed sent shares into a tailspin. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Jun 10, 2017 at 2:21PM In this MarketFoolery segment, host Chris Hill and Million Dollar Portfolio's Jason Moser talk about the multiple issues Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) has to overcome. It's not just that, as a key supplier of video-processing hardware to GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), it has hitched its wagon to a stone, but its system-on-a-chip (SoC) offerings require a level of constant refreshing and innovation that's tough to maintain. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on June 7, 2017. Chris Hill: We have to start with Ambarella, which is one of the biggest losers on the NASDAQ today. This is the chipmaker, key supplier to GoPro. Ambarella's first-quarter results looked OK, but their guidance for the current quarter is what sent Wall Street headed for the exits. Jason Moser: Yeah, I think you pretty much said it in a nutshell there, key supplier to GoPro. So that should probably have you running in the other direction on its own. Hill: Not key supplier to Apple. Moser: [laughs] And I think what we saw it with a company like InvenSense is that if you are a supplier to Apple, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be all sunshine and lollipops, either. But with Ambarella, we talk a lot about trying to learn from mistakes, learn from businesses past and see why history might not repeat itself. It certainly rhymes in some cases. I think we may be seeing that same sort of thing playing out here with Ambarella as we saw with InvenSense. We owned Ambarella for a time in Million Dollar Portfolio. it was an interesting company. We thought there was a lot of potential there because of this move toward video, because of the fact that they were such a key supplier to GoPro. And that story quickly changed once we saw GoPro falling off the cliff. Ambarella, really sort of the one-two punch there. Not only are they getting hit on that supply side as a provider of chips to GoPro, but the problem with this technology, they have these systems on a chip hardware that they're selling, they're constantly having to figure out ways to innovate and get better. There's always someone out there in this space that comes up with some sort of new technology that's a little bit better, a little bit faster, it produces a better picture, whatever it may be. So we sold in MDP, because we saw this picture where sales growth was starting to slow down. And typically, with a company like this, when sales growth starts to slow down, they're going to have to start conceding a little bit on pricing in order to get that product out there. And when you're conceding on your pricing in any capacity, and the company that you're supplying a lot of your product to is really seeing a major slowdown as well, those margins start getting squeezed pretty hard, too. And that's what has the market really down today on the stock. I think the biggest problem is the forward-looking picture. While the quarter itself wasn't all that bad -- I think they actually beat expectations on both fronts -- it's the picture going forward, and the market is starting to look at this and say, woah, maybe this is something where the path to success isn't quite as clear or as bright as perhaps we once thought? I really can't help but think this is going to be another InvenSense story. I don't know that it's a stock that I'd put up there as one I'd want to buy, because it's such a tough space. Scale is really the biggest advantage in this business. Ambarella, InvenSense, those are not companies that have that scale when you compare them to companies like Intel or Qualcomm. Hill: So we get this question a lot, about entry point, what you're going to pay for a stock. And a lot of times, the question comes in the form of, I really like company X, the stock keeps going up, should I buy now or wait for a pullback so I can get a better entry point? You don't look at Ambarella falling 10% today and say ... unless it's just a really small -- Moser: I think, if you want to look at it from that perspective, you need to be able to identify the catalyst that's going to take this thing in the other direction. The problem is, that's not so easy to recognize, especially when it comes to technology like this, because it's really difficult to see what new technology is coming down the pike. That's not really what we specialize in, and not a lot of people are so capable to see around the corner. So I tend to look at something like this and think, it's not even like it's that cheap of a stock still, when you look at the fact that sales are slowing down and margins are being squeezed a little bit. This is one of those where you think, maybe there's a value trap here where, yeah, it's nice to buy on dips, but make sure that when you buy on that dip that there's a catalyst that gets this thing going back in the other direction. I just don't know that we can identify the catalyst with Ambarella today.

You can buy a RISV-V based microcontroller right now. It is officially supported by GCC. The lowRISC project, founded by some of the same people responsible for Raspberry Pi, aims to provide a fully open source Linux system-on-a-chip. UC Berkeley has developed a (relatively) high performance, super-scalar, out-of-order RISC-V core. An ISA defines the interface between software and hardware. The two ISAs that dominate the space today are the x86 ISA developed by Intel, and the ARM ISA developed by ARM Holdings. With few exceptions, x86 dominates the desktop, laptop, and server segments, whereas ARM dominates the smartphone, tablet, and embedded segments. RISC-V's open nature is intended to make it a better platform for research, attractive to those concerned with privacy, and a lower cost option for commercial users who otherwise would have to license a core from ARM. The 6th RISC-V Workshop recently wrapped up in Shanghai. Slides and video available at the link, but here are a few highlights: History of Computer Architecture and RISC, 50 years of computer architecture history by computer architecture legend David Patterson, who was involved in the design of the first RISC processors in the 80s. Why RISC-V? "Instruction Sets Want to be Free", making the case for an open ISA. Impedance Matching Expectations Between RISC-V and the Open Hardware Community, a fascinating talk exploring how much openness and transparency can reasonably be created in an industry dominated by closed IP and closed processes. If you're hungry for more RISC-V info, the RISC-V workshops page has links to the proceedings of past workshops with slides and video for almost all talks. posted by jcreigh (38 comments total) 27 users marked this as a favorite   "RISC architecture is going to change everything." -- Acid Burn "Yeah.

Or from MIPS, which is still limping on as part of Imagination. Skimming the RISC-V ISA spec, it does feel like it has quite a lot of MIPS flavor -- although thankfully without the MIPS' annoying branch delay slots. (Also, vendor support is pretty important to commercial licensees of IP cores; that might be a major sticking point in adoption of RISC-V cores in commercial products. Hardware is a different world to software, in which we all happily depend on open-source tools like gcc. Software is patchable, but if your chip's tapeout goes bad you've just burned $1M on a batch of coasters.) posted by We had a deal, Kyle at 11:43 AM on June 10 [1 favorite] Is there a list of hobbyist projects one could do with one of these boards? posted by codacorolla at 11:46 AM on June 10 [1 favorite] Yes, but will it run AIX? posted by jferg at 12:41 PM on June 10 [5 favorites] Also, vendor support is pretty important to commercial licensees of IP cores Hell yes it is. I've been faced with choosing SoCs from a number of major companies, and I've been burned once too many by a vendors that promise a great feature set but have zero software support ready. If I need to spend 18 months writing drivers for the basic things, then it's not going to happen. Right now that means I go with Freescale and TI over anyone else. They at least have solid kernel trees on their Github servers and you can build a filesystem in a few hours. RISC-V got me excited until I realized that the ISA core isn't really what makes or breaks a product anymore, but the hardware blocks around it that do. A super-cheap RISC-V SoC means jack squat if nobody is willing to build up a software base around it. posted by JoeZydeco at 1:54 PM on June 10 [4 favorites] Online video will still chug even on RISC-V, tho. posted by slater at 1:57 PM on June 10 Why bother? The ISA is the least important part of a working product. CPU performance isn't an issue for most IoT "things". Sales come from low power consumption, good sensors, security, and a useable UI. It does look good for research, though. posted by monotreme at 2:03 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] Interesting thing I learned from when this came up on HN, SPARC is already fully open. Kinda neat. posted by yeahwhatever at 2:49 PM on June 10 Why bother? [...] It does look good for research, though. Pretty much my thoughts on the matter. Having an entirely open stack is going to be great for computer architecture experimentation, but it's hard to imagine a commercial user wanting to save the ARM license fee so badly that they would take on the risk of an unproven platform with (one assumes) worse software tooling. Maybe that equation will change as RISC-V matures. The main non-research interest I see is the (and I say this with love) tinfoil hat crowd who is worried that their processor has a backdoor from a three letter agency in it. posted by jcreigh at 3:13 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] I really want to get one of these Linux SoC's. It would be nice to not to have to run a full laptop to get some of the functionality on my LAN I use day to day (like Pihole and an external hard drive host/semi, but not really, NAS device.) posted by Samizdata at 3:19 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] It does make me sad to see that even though we now have a full compiler stack with umpteen languages at the top and LLVM at the bottom, which should mean that one should be able to compile anything and get it to run on anything, [*] we;re effectively stuck with ARM or 86. Coke or Pepsi. So I do hope this takes off, along with OpenSPARC [*] albeit only some processor stacks would run it well. posted by ocschwar at 4:01 PM on June 10 [2 favorites] Or from MIPS, which is still limping on as part of Imagination. By "limping along" you mean massive widespread adoption in the embedded market. Hell, PowerPC is even doing well enough to float another Amiga platform. Oracle's ruthless oversight managed to allow SPARC to finally find its legs as a firebreathing monster, and POWER has always been bad-ass. This is something different than merely the marvel that is RISC. This is a modern microprocessor architecture that is open-source, and tuned to run Linux. It's aimed at the embedded market... to begin with, sure. But RISC has this marvelous ability to scale. MIPS lives in cable modems and home wireless routers and set-top boxes, sure, but the same architecture was powering some of the most advanced and fast workstations, servers and supercomputers of the '90s. Only some corporate shenanigans involving Microsoft not worth retelling here unseated it from it's lofty place. (And even it wasn't jobbed as hard as the Alpha architecture was...) posted by Slap*Happy at 4:26 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] (like Pihole and an external hard drive host/semi, but not really, NAS device.) Wait, you're using a laptop to run Pi-hole, instead of e.g. a Raspberry Pi which it was originally designed for? :-) posted by effbot at 4:26 PM on June 10 By "limping along" you mean massive widespread adoption in the embedded market. Yes, that was harsh; they lost workstation and never got into mobile, but a lot of the unglamorous invisible embedded stuff is MIPS-based. posted by We had a deal, Kyle at 4:42 PM on June 10 I'm just excited to be able to play with an instruction set that makes sense again. I don't know if you've all taken a look at x86 lately, but the "instructions" are almost programs at this point.

Wait, you're using a laptop to run Pi-hole, instead of e.g. a Raspberry Pi which it was originally designed for? :-) Yeah. As I do NOT have a Pi, but I wanted the security features of Pihole.

Yeah, I am not exactly seeing that as a real deal breaker. Just sayin'. posted by Samizdata at 5:40 PM on June 10 It's like someone just said "fuck it, this is hard, let's just let the compilers write the microcode". I think Alan Kay takes it one step further, and says that the programmer should have access to add microcode :) That's a single comment from this larger back and fourth which brings up RISC-V. While I felt qualified to say this recently, I certainly don't feel qualified to comment at that much, much deeper level. That conversation seems to suggest that letting programmers control microcode is a bit dated, even just thinking performance wise? Turning the view over to OSs instead of CPUs for a second.. As a Windows power user and an engineer, I just remember back in the day being able to make QNX to do exactly what I wanted easily vs. how frustrated I am with Linux distros and Linux thinking every time I touch that stuff (examples omitted). Linux is a wonderful thing, to be sure! But, if all that work had been done around a micro-kernel, wouldn't we have even more utility from it today? Of course one of the main arguments pro Micro Kernel (I assume, I'm not up on the turf war) is security--only run the stuff you need, prove it's secure, profit. Exposing microcode to the programmer must have exactly the opposite effect, to wit some of the recent Intel vulnerabilities. Already well into the TLDR territory here of course, and it is feeling a little scattered and in need of editing too--If I had more time, I'd write a shorter post. I guess that's what happens when you try to take a deep vertical view of a big subject.. My point here is, I hope RISC-V people are thinking about this in an appropriately deep way to ensure that their contribution has maximal positive impact--as mentioned up thread, bad tapeout, $1 million etc.--any discussion at that level would be welcome! posted by Chuckles at 6:01 PM on June 10 [2 favorites] I really want to get one of these Linux SoC's Seriously, get a BeagleBone. Black, Green, or the new Black Wireless or one of the many derivatives showing up. They're great systems and yeah, they're going to cost a little more than an RPi but they're serious pieces of hardware. You can get all the documentation and source code you want from TI unlike some of those other vendors (cough cough Broadcom) posted by JoeZydeco at 7:02 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] Ditto on the BeagleBone. I have one in my house. All it's doing right now is getting my consumer NAS boxes to sync with each other and dedupe. BUt when I travel, I turn on a TOR-based SSH server, and despite having no static public IP, I can back up to those NAS boxes from anywhere. posted by ocschwar at 7:22 PM on June 10 [4 favorites] Is that via hidden services? I've been looking at those as an alternative to dynamic DNS... Been enjoying this thread - open vs closed, RISC vs CISC, microkernel vs kernel... ah, who says the state of the art in computer science moves quickly. One of the abiding memories I have from the dawn of ARM is the explicit recognition by the architects that they were offloading a lot of the hard work onto the compiler - and that they thought this was the right thing to do. The hardware/software demarcation line is really interesting - in the old days, that was microcode, and now in DSP/FPGA-land it's much broader - and has anyone attempted a formal description of that? I'm not aware of anything. You can't respin hardwired silicon in the field, but hardwired silicon can be enormously more efficient than reconfigurable. Where do you decide to decide? RISC-V is a really interesting experiment, not so much as some new ISA but in exploring what part an ISA plays in all the interlocking parts generating a complete stack worth developing on these days. Are there the right abstractions that enable the development of all the components in an SoC such that they're open enough to be safe but still create enough value for their creators that work will continue? posted by Devonian at 8:01 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] What about LLVM? That's probably as relevant, if not more, these days. There is an LLVM backend that you can use, but my understanding is that the gcc-based tooling is more complete at the moment. But my impression was definitely that LLVM is something they're working on. posted by jcreigh at 10:16 PM on June 10 I really want to get one of these Linux SoC's. It would be nice to not to have to run a full laptop to get some of the functionality on my LAN I use day to day For the last three years my home router has been a Beaglebone Black running Debian Testing, and it is indeed a lovely thing. I also have a couple of Raspberry Pis running OSMC, and I've recently acquired an ODROID-XU4 whose inbuilt gigabit Ethernet and USB-3 ports will let me turn it into a moderately high performance NAS some time soon. These little machines are a lot of fun, and seeing new generations of them come out with fully detailed hardware documentation and at even lower cost because unencumbered by proprietary CPU core licensing can only be a good thing. posted by flabdablet at 10:26 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] Linux is a wonderful thing, to be sure! But, if all that work had been done around a micro-kernel, wouldn't we have even more utility from it today? GNU Hurd will be ready for prime time Real Soon Now. posted by flabdablet at 10:31 PM on June 10 [1 favorite] Why bother? The ISA is the least important part of a working product. CPU performance isn't an issue for most IoT "things". Sales come from low power consumption, good sensors, security, and a useable UI. That very question is addressed on page 14 of the User-Level ISA Specification: A question we have been repeatedly asked is “Why develop a new ISA?” The biggest obvious benefit of using an existing commercial ISA is the large and widely supported software ecosystem, both development tools and ported applications, which can be leveraged in research and teaching. Other benefits include the existence of large amounts of documentation and tutorial examples. However, our experience of using commercial instruction sets for research and teaching is that these benefits are smaller in practice, and do not outweigh the disadvantages: • Commercial ISAs are proprietary. Except for SPARC V8, which is an open IEEE standard [2], most owners of commercial ISAs carefully guard their intellectual property and do not welcome freely available competitive implementations. This is much less of an issue for academic research and teaching using only software simulators, but has been a major concern for groups wishing to share actual RTL implementations. It is also a major concern for entities who do not want to trust the few sources of commercial ISA implementations, but who are prohibited from creating their own clean room implementations. We cannot guarantee that all RISC-V implementations will be free of third-party patent infringements, but we can guarantee we will not attempt to sue a RISC-V implementor. • Commercial ISAs are only popular in certain market domains. The most obvious examples at time of writing are that the ARM architecture is not well supported in the server space, and the Intel x86 architecture (or for that matter, almost every other architecture) is not well supported in the mobile space, though both Intel and ARM are attempting to enter each other’s market segments. Another example is ARC and Tensilica, which provide extensible cores but are focused on the embedded space. This market segmentation dilutes the benefit of supporting a particular commercial ISA as in practice the software ecosystem only exists for certain domains, and has to be built for others. • Commercial ISAs come and go. Previous research infrastructures have been built around commercial ISAs that are no longer popular (SPARC, MIPS) or even no longer in production (Alpha). These lose the benefit of an active software ecosystem, and the lingering intellectual property issues around the ISA and supporting tools interfere with the ability of interested third parties to continue supporting the ISA. An open ISA might also lose popularity, but any interested party can continue using and developing the ecosystem. • Popular commercial ISAs are complex. The dominant commercial ISAs (x86 and ARM) are both very complex to implement in hardware to the level of supporting common software stacks and operating systems. Worse, nearly all the complexity is due to bad, or at least outdated, ISA design decisions rather than features that truly improve efficiency. • Commercial ISAs alone are not enough to bring up applications. Even if we expend the effort to implement a commercial ISA, this is not enough to run existing applications for that ISA. Most applications need a complete ABI (application binary interface) to run, not just the user-level ISA. Most ABIs rely on libraries, which in turn rely on operating system support. To run an existing operating system requires implementing the supervisor-level ISA and device interfaces expected by the OS. These are usually much less well-specified and considerably more complex to implement than the user-level ISA. • Popular commercial ISAs were not designed for extensibility. The dominant commercial ISAs were not particularly designed for extensibility, and as a consequence have added considerable instruction encoding complexity as their instruction sets have grown. Companies such as Tensilica (acquired by Cadence) and ARC (acquired by Synopsys) have built ISAs and toolchains around extensibility, but have focused on embedded applications rather than general-purpose computing systems. • A modified commercial ISA is a new ISA. One of our main goals is to support architecture research, including major ISA extensions. Even small extensions diminish the benefit of using a standard ISA, as compilers have to be modified and applications rebuilt from source code to use the extension. Larger extensions that introduce new architectural state also require modifications to the operating system. Ultimately, the modified commercial ISA becomes a new ISA, but carries along all the legacy baggage of the base ISA. Our position is that the ISA is perhaps the most important interface in a computing system, and there is no reason that such an important interface should be proprietary. The dominant commercial ISAs are based on instruction set concepts that were already well known over 30 years ago. Software developers should be able to target an open standard hardware target, and commercial processor designers should compete on implementation quality. It's tempting to dismiss all that as essentially this, but RISC-V is, to the best of my knowledge, the first fully open architecture that actually has the potential to better x86 on performance and ARM on power efficiency at a lower build cost than either. x86 is the clear winner among currently available CPU designs on brute performance, but that's despite the ISA, not because of it. There's a hell of a lot of lipstick on the modern x86 pig, and putting some of that on a face that's rather more attractive to begin with might well yield quite a large win. posted by flabdablet at 10:57 PM on June 10 [5 favorites] If you want to mess about with real RISC V hardware now, there's the HiFive1. True, it's a very limited µc-class SOC.  → BeagleBone … serious pieces of hardware While the inbuilt PRUs are neat, the “¼ the speed, 2× the price” BeagleBone as compared to the Raspberry Pi makes it a really tough sell. That, and the BB licence preventing commercial use makes it a non-starter, open or not. The new BB Blue robotics platform looks pretty cool, though.

You can get all the documentation and source code you want from TI unlike some of those other vendors (cough cough Broadcom) I bought a few Cubieboards (the original one, and later the CubieTruck). They're based on Allwinner A-series SOCs, with generous sets of I/O pins and also SATA ports. The last point was particularly critical for me; I was looking for something to attach a SSD full of MP3s to and use as a tiny, power-sipping music server running MPD on Linux. With a SATA-less board like the Pi or BeagleBoard, I'd have been stuck with the extra layer of jankiness of a USB interface for my disk. The Cubieboard-based music box served me well for a few years, sitting in a corner, powered by the power brick from my old Sony PSP, but got replaced by a CubieTruck, largely because of its SPDIF audio output. posted by acb at 7:16 AM on June 11 Any of these ARM boards come with enough SATA interfaces to build a nice NAS? No but they're starting to come with M.2 interfaces where you can plug in an M.2 to four port SATA RAID adapter and run a NAS from that. posted by Talez at 7:26 AM on June 11 [1 favorite] I really want to get one of these Linux SoC's Why not a Pine64? 2 gig of dram @ under $30. $99 for a laptop. $1.99 for a 1/2 gig postage stamp sized device. On github there is what purports to be netboot code for the pine64. And the Pine64 is a tier 1 target for FreeBSD. If you want faster - there is the hardkernel 8 way processor for $60ish and it has a USB 3.0 port. posted by rough ashlar at 8:12 AM on June 11 [1 favorite] Linux is a wonderful thing, to be sure! .... GNU Hurd will be ready for prime time Real Soon Now. GNU/Linux may be nice but FreeBSD is the software stack for Playstation 4 and what powers Netflix along with being part of Apple's UNIX offering so that's alota bits being pushed by something that is not "a wonderful thing". It is also where a number of the developers of ZFS are using as a base and there is nothing better than a NAS where your data can auto-heal bad checksums AND do remote replications. The limiting DRAM factor for these SoCs seems to be Microsoft's $0 cost IoT Windows 10 offering. posted by rough ashlar at 8:19 AM on June 11 Why not a Pine64? As I recall, the Allwinner A64 that Pine uses is not well documented, and ends up depending on a lot of binary blobage. It's the sort of thing that can lead to sadness in short order. posted by wotsac at 8:31 AM on June 11 I bought a few Cubieboards (the original one, and later the CubieTruck).

With a SATA-less board like the Pi or BeagleBoard, I'd have been stuck with the extra layer of jankiness of a USB interface for my disk. I was pleased to find my CubieTruck as well, because I too wanted something small and cheap to make a little NAS out of and the CubieTruck, with both gigabit Ethernet and inbuilt SATA, looked like the business. However, the actual throughput of both those ports has proved extremely disappointing and even though I've got the supplied heatsink attached to the CubieTruck SoC and I'm not overclocking it, it still tends to lock up occasionally for no apparent reason. My BeagleBone Black, by contrast, has always been rock solid as have both my Raspberry Pi 2 model Bs. I haven't played with my ODROID-XU4 enough to get much of a feel for it yet. posted by flabdablet at 10:31 AM on June 11 « Older No Pain to Infinite Pain   |   The gorgeous line art abstractions of Andrew G....

One machine learning practitioner sees Core ML as analogous to the TensorFlow software Google released before introducing its TPU chip. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet Friday, 9 Jun 2017 | 5:14 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., speaks during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S., on Monday, June 5, 2017. Apple on Monday introduced Core ML, a set of tools that developers can use to incorporate machine learning techniques into their apps. The news was little noticed amid all the new hardware and iOS updates. But it's important. The capabilities of Core ML are a "dead giveaway" that Apple is preparing to introduce a new kind of processor, presumably just for iPhones at first, that could make trendy machine learning workloads run more efficiently. That's according to one person inhabiting the world of machine learning, Reza Zadeh, CEO of image recognition startup Matroid. A company would only release something like Core ML "if there's a really intense piece of hardware that it was going do compile down into," said Zadeh, who built the machine learning algorithms for Twitter's Who to Follow feature before starting Matroid last year. "All those converters and everything, it's a dead giveaway there's going to be some intense [processor] available down the line." Alphabet's Google introduced its TensorFlow open-source framework for machine learning in November 2015, and then unveiled a custom tensor processing unit, or TPU, six months later. Zadeh thinks Apple is doing something similar with the launch of Core ML. Meanwhile startups like Deep Vision and Mythic have been working on processors that could be plunked into smaller devices, as opposed to data centers, where Google's TPUs are located. Another startup, Movidius, which touts its vision processing unit for drones and other gadgets, was acquired by Intel in 2016. Bloomberg reported last month on Apple's plans to build a artificial intelligence (AI) chip. This would build on the inclusion of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for certain computations in the iPhone 7 last year. Core ML provides machine learning models that developers can drop right into iOS, macOS and tvOS apps, while also providing ways to use their own models. Apps drawing on Core ML will be able to recognize objects in images, follow the movement of things in video frames or just make smart calculations given a certain amount of previous data. These processes can run on current iPhones and iPads. But it's reasonable to think Apple wants to improve performance on future hardware, while also lengthening battery life. It could do that sending machine learning workloads to a dedicated AI chip, instead of devices' central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), which are not always optimized for those computing duties, Zadeh said. But that's not all. Emerging specialized processors like the rumored Apple AI chip could become the computational workhorse in the next few decades, Zadeh said.

Apple is widely expected to upgrade its iPhone this year, which marks the device's 10th anniversary, and suggestions that its technology will lag the performance of high-end smartphones running Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android system could hurt its sales. An Apple spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple supplier Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) sells modems capable of downloading data at cutting-edge 1 gigabit speeds, but rival chipmaker Intel Corp's (INTC.O) modem technology does not yet have that capability, according to the Bloomberg report. Since Apple is traditionally reluctant to rely on just one supplier, it is using modems from both companies, but capping download speeds of the quicker Qualcomm modems so that all of the new iPhones perform the same, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. Shares of the Cupertino, California company have surged 29 percent so far in 2017, largely in anticipation of the iPhone upgrade. The stock on Friday declined 3.5 percent to $149.60.

The annual event, the 12th of its kind, was held not only for the increasing popularity of running, but also for building a positive workplace environment with communication, health and charity. Wang Liqin, former Olympic champion of table tennis, also showed up as one of the pace makers, along with executives of enterprises, such as Volvo, Intel, SMG and Mitsubishi. In this way, the event also provided an opportunity for the white-collar workers to get closer to their bosses and celebrities. Each runner could get 20 yuan from China International Intellectech Corporation and donate to the charity programs on the site. The event also included an online competition carried out on a popular smartphone application called Joyrun, which enables teams to compete with each other with total running length of team members. More than 10,000 kilometers have been contributed by all teams between May 22 and June 1.

Preorders for the new notebook are set to kick off exclusively at Best Buy on June 11 ahead of its full launch on June 26. The big highlight of the Notebook 9 Pro is the inclusion of Samsung's S Pen. Powered by 4,000 levels of pressure, the S Pen works with Windows Ink on any device. Further, Samsung's own Air Command software is included on the Notebook 9 for taking notes and drawing. And when you're done, you can tuck the S Pen into a dedicated slot underneath the keyboard. Otherwise, the Notebook 9 Pro is available in two sizes: 13.3 inches or 15 inches. Inside, there's support for up to Intel's Core i7 processors and 256GB of SSD storage. RAM options come in at 8GB on the 13.3-inch model and 16GB on 15-inch model. Lastly, the larger model also gets a little extra graphical power thanks to an AMD Radeon card. If the Notebook 9 Pro is up your alley, you'll be able to get a preorder in on Best Buy's website starting June 11. Prices come in at $1,099 for the 13.3-inch model and $1,299 for the 15-inch model. Reader comments Samsung Notebook 9 Pro preorders kick off on June 11 2 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating besweeet So a 13.3" "Pro" laptop that maxes out at 8GB RAM? At least the RAM is DDR4. Hopefully the SSD isn't SATA3 via M.2, and is upgradable. And no resolution past FHD for the 15" model? Quite "pro." Lastly, still no word on Thunderbolt 3? I assume the USB-C port is just USB 3.0 at 5Gbps like on the non-"Pro" Notebook 9. 3 2 days ago Reply Glacius17 I wish it was a 3x2 aspect ratio like Samsung's Chromebooks that also have the pen and 2-in-1 design. I always prefer Windows but it seems Microsoft is the only company making 3x2 aspect ratio Windows laptops, and those are really expensive. 0 2 days ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

According to Nicholas Bloom, a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR) and co-author of a paper, so many game-changing inventions have appeared since World War II that it's become increasingly difficult to come up with the next big idea. And as a result, tremendous continual increases in research and development (R&D) will be needed to sustain even today's low rate of economic growth. "The thought now of somebody inventing something as revolutionary as the locomotive on their own is inconceivable," Bloom was quoted as saying in a recent news release from SIEPR. "It's certainly true if you go back one- or two hundred years, like when Edison invented the light bulb. It's a massive piece of technology and one guy basically invented it. But while we think of Steve Jobs and the iPhone, it was a team of dozens of people who created the iPhone." Bloom worked with SIEPR senior fellow Chad Jones, Stanford doctoral candidate Michael Webb, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor John Van Reenen as co-authors to examine research productivity at an aggregate national level as well as within three swaths of industry: technology, medical research and agriculture. They analyzed research efforts at publicly traded firms. Their paper followed a common concept that economic growth comes from people creating ideas. In other words, when there are more researchers producing more ideas, there is more economic growth. However, the team found a not-so-rosy imbalance. While research efforts are rising substantially, research productivity, or the ideas being produced per researcher, is declining sharply. Specifically, the number of Americans engaged in R&D has jumped by more than twentyfold since 1930 while their collective productivity has dropped by a factor of 41. The researchers found clear evidence of how exponential investments in R&D have masked the decline in productivity. The U.S. information technology (IT) industry's signature guidepost, Moore's Law, which marked its 52nd year in April, is a prime example. Introduced in 1965 by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of computer chip giant Intel, the theorem postulates that the density of transistors on an integrated circuit would double roughly every two years, doubling computing power. Moore's Law has played out, that the computing power on a chip today is remarkable compared to even a decade ago, but the study found that the research effort behind the chip innovations rose by a factor of 78 since 1971. Put another way, the number of researchers required today to maintain the innovative pace is more than 75 times larger than the number that was required in the early 1970s. "The constant exponential growth implied by Moore's Law has been achieved only by a staggering increase in the amount of resources devoted to pushing the frontier forward," the paper stated. Other industries also exhibited falloffs in idea productivity. For instance, the study's co-authors used crop yields of corn, soybeans, wheat and cotton and compared them against research expenditures directed at improving yields, including cross-breeding, bioengineering, crop protection and maintenance. The average yields across all four crops roughly doubled between 1960 and 2015. But to achieve those gains, the amount of research expended during that period rose "tremendously," anywhere from a threefold to a more-than-25-fold increase, depending on the crop and specific research measure. On average, research productivity in agriculture fell by about 4 to 6 percent per year, the study found. A similar pattern of greater-input-but-less-output followed in medical research. The authors analyzed R&D spending on new, federally approved U.S. drugs against life expectancy rates as a gauge of productivity, and examined decreases in mortality rates of cancer patients against medical research publications and clinical trials. The empirical findings on breast and heart cancer suggest that at least in some areas, stated the paper, "it may get easier to find new ideas at first before getting harder." About publicly traded companies, the study found a fraction of firms where research productivity, as measured by growth in sales, market capitalization, employment and revenue-per-worker productivity, grew decade-over-decade since 1980. But overall, more than 85 percent of the firms showed steady, rapid declines in productivity while their spending in R&D rose. The analysis indicated that research productivity for firms fell, on average, about 10 percent per year, and it would take 15 times more researchers today than it did 30 years ago to produce the same rate of economic growth. "It's getting harder and harder to make new ideas, and the economy is more or less compensating for that," Bloom said. "The only way we've been able to roughly maintain growth is to throw more and more scientists at it."

Home Contact Advertise About RSS @PowerPage @JasonOGrady iFixit posts teardown of 2017 21.5-inch iMac, finds user-upgradable RAM, modular CPU Posted by: Chris Barylick Date: Friday, June 9th, 2017, 05:33 Category: Hardware, iMac, News, Processors The pork has soared and it looks like Apple has finally released an iMac with a user-upgradable CPU as well as RAM. The cool cats at iFixit have just completed a full teardown of Apple’s new 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display. The unit features both removable RAM and a modular CPU, although Apple has yet to say if these components are user-replaceable. Accessing and replacing these components isn’t exactly easy, but it’s still possible. This is the first time Apple has had a 21.5-inch iMac with expandable RAM since 2013, and the first modular CPU since 2012. No one seems to know exactly why Apple has reverted to a socketed CPU, and perhaps there were lengthy discussions with Intel regarding it. iFixit offered the following comments regarding the teardown: Despite the upgradable RAM and CPU, we’re still giving this iMac a 3/10 for repairability. Here’s why: the iMac remains distinctly un-fun to open. Everything is buried under a finicky glass panel. It requires a speciality pizza-cutter-like tool to breach the adhesive before any repair. Plus the glass and Retina Display are fused together, fabulously increasing the cost of replacement. But hey, a 3/10 is triple the score of the iMac’s 2015 predecessor. Stay tuned for additional details as they become available.

The intention is to “deepen development ties” through the existing Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development fund, known as BIRD, which promotes projects of mutual benefit to both countries, he said in an interview. Eitan Yudilevich, executive director of BIRD, said the foundation hopes to add $50 million to its fund in the next five years, doubling its financing capability. The idea is to expand investment in all areas, including mobility, cyber security and manufacturing, he said. The foundation has invested in 948 projects since its founding in 1977 and its products have generated $10 billion in indirect and direct revenue for both countries and created tens of thousands of jobs, according to the Economy Ministry. Second-Biggest Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up The U.S. is Israel’s second-biggest export market after the European Union, and Israel has the second-highest concentration of startups after Silicon Valley, the ministry says. Israeli foreign direct investment in the U.S. totaled $25 billion in 2015, twice as much as U.S. investment in Israel, according to SelectUSA, the government program to promote business investment in the U.S. The software and services sector drew the most Israeli money. Israel’s strengths should allow it to do well even at a time of U.S. retrenchment overseas, said Eytan Gilboa, political scientist at Bar-Ilan University and director of its center of international communication. In his inaugural address, Trump promised to protect U.S. jobs and put the country’s interest above all others. “The kind of trade and economic cooperation that the U.S. has with Israel is not what Trump is concerned about,” Gilboa said. “Israel can benefit from it because of close collaboration, especially in cyber security, high technology, clean technology and startups where it can contribute to the U.S. more than the other way around.” With more than 3,000 small technology companies, Israel has the largest number of startups per capita, the Economy Ministry says. Cohen said Israel also wants to encourage U.S. companies to open manufacturing operations in Israel, following in the footsteps of Intel Corp., Applied Materials Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprises Co. and Perrigo Co. Its enterprising approach would be the draw, even if other countries would offer lower labor costs, he said. “We are expecting the relationship with Israel to be different,” Cohen said. “Our value is not in labor but in innovation.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Apple’s Bezelless Technology is Noticeably Different than those Offered by the Rest June 10, 2017, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Windows 10 Latest Build Reveals the Biggies of Fall Creators Update One Plus Poised to Raise the Bar with Flagship Model Yet Again Apple’s revelation of the iOS 11 last week made it clear that the upcoming OS will come heavily optimized for bezelless displays. That quite asserts the fact that iOS 11 will be shipping first on the upcoming iPhone 8 smartphone that is all set to be Apple’s first edge-to-edge display device. There are already more than a handful of renders that claims the look of the upcoming device. Add to that, we have a new render which interestingly holds a different take of the bezelless display. Unlike the rest, the latest render from iDropNews presents the render with a cut-out that expands inwards to the display. Accordingly, this cut-out at the top will be to accommodate the front camera and additional sensors for face and iris recognition. Earlier reports have suggested that these would be placed beneath the display. But the latest render designates a distinct spot on the top for these sensors inside the display. This would make it interesting as of how Apple would manage the top bar of its display. Apart from that, the render also confirms that the iPhone 8 will feature glass-embedded sensors, contrary to some of the previous reports that hinted for a rear fingerprint sensor on the device. If true, Apple will be ahead of its rival in the race to get embedded fingerprint sensors. But all doesn’t sound great with the iPhone 8, as there are other reports which suggest that Apple will be featuring Intel modems instead of the ones from Qualcomm due to the company’s  rift with the latter. That would mean that the iPhone 8 will arrive sans the fastest gigabit speeds offered by Qualcomm modems.
