Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 22 August 2016 | MYT 7:00 AM Intel showcases ‘merged reality' with Project Alloy headset Groundbreaking product?: Intel claimed that Project Alloy completely redefines what's possible from a VR device. — AFP Relaxnews At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, USA, the microprocessor maker demo-ed Project Alloy, a standalone virtual reality headset allowing wearers to explore and interact with a virtual world while keeping one foot firmly in reality. The headset was presented by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, who claimed that Project Alloy completely redefines what's possible from a VR device. In fact, Project Alloy offers a new immersive experience thanks to Intel RealSense technology, which notably monitors the various movements of the body. The headset is a completely standalone device, with no need to hook up to a computer or external sensors, so wearers can move around and explore virtual environments with total freedom. It is, however, equipped with several cameras that scan the surrounding environment so that wearers can also interact with real-world objects when the need arises. This could be climbing stairs or opening a door, for example, or raising a glass to toast with another person. Intel is calling this approach to VR "merged reality." Virtual and augmented reality Although Project Alloy won't necessarily end up being released commercially, it's a formidable showcase for Intel's RealSense cameras (short- and long-range), which are already found in certain hybrid PCs. In 2017, Intel plans to open up this ecosystem to developers looking to create their own headsets and/or custom environments. Note that Intel is still working in close collaboration with software giant Microsoft (who already caused a stir with their HoloLens VR glasses) in the fields of virtual and augmented reality. Two major new virtual reality headsets are due out this fall, with the Oculus Rift landing in Europe Sept 20, followed by the PlayStation VR on Oct 13.

Intel's New Joule IoT Development Board Is Powered by Snappy Ubuntu Core GO Ubuntu Snappy makes the device secure and up to date Aug 21, 2016 23:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  Canonical, through Amrisha Prashar, has had the pleasure of announcing that their popular Snappy Ubuntu Core operating system is now available for Intel's recently launched Joule development board. Yes, you're reading it right, Intel released an IoT (Internet of Things) single-board computer (see the attached image to see what's included in the retail package) and Canonical is always on top of things making its Ubuntu Snappy Core operating system compatible with the latest development boards and embedded devices. "The new Intel Joule is a powerful board targeted at IoT and robotics makers and runs Ubuntu for a smooth development experience. It’s also affordable and compact enough to be used in deployment, therefore Ubuntu Core can be installed to make any device it’s included in secure and up to date … wherever it is!" reads the announcement. Intel Joule-powered Turtlebot robot runs ROS on Ubuntu Snappy Core Of course, Intel Joule also supports ROS (Robot Operating System), which provides all the required tools and libraries a software developer needs to create robot applications for devices that are powered by the Intel Joule development board. Mixing ROS with Ubuntu Snappy Core makes the development process smoother than ever. On this occasion, we would also like to inform the reader that the Snappy Ubuntu Core operating system is a stripped down version of popular Ubuntu Linux distribution, and it's being targeted at autonomous machines, embedded devices and other internet-connected digital things (a.k.a. IoT devices), such as drones, home robots, and A.I. kits. You can find out more about the Snappy Ubuntu Core operating system via its official homepage, where you'll be able to download the latest version and install it on your new Intel Joule development board.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 21, 2016 at 11:05AM Image credit: Intel.  Website Coolaler recently leaked information about a few of microprocessor-giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) upcoming processors targeted specifically at the gaming market based on its upcoming Kaby Lake architecture. The highest end of these parts, the Core i7 7700K, will pack four processor cores running at a base clock of 4.2GHz and a maximum single core turbo speed of 4.5GHz -- a solid increase from its Skylake-based predecessor, which ran at 4GHz base and sported a single-core turbo speed of 4.2GHz. Although this part, which is part of the Kaby Lake-S family of processors, should be quite compelling for both gamers and enthusiasts, I can't help but be even more excited for another part that the chipmaker plans to release, known as Kaby Lake-X. Based on the leaks, Kaby Lake-X looks as though it'll be based on the same basic silicon as Kaby Lake-S, but it will plug into the company's upcoming high-end desktop motherboards rather than the mainstream desktop motherboards that Kaby Lake-S will. The leaks also show that Intel plans to rate these chips at a 112-watt thermal design power, up from the 95-watt thermal design power of the Core i7 7700K. Here's why Kaby Lake-X could be a big deal for gamers and PC enthusiasts. Freakish out-of-the-box speeds coming? The Kaby Lake-S based Core i7 7700K will already feature the fastest out-of-the-box single core speed that Intel has ever shipped in a consumer product, at 4.5GHz. This will beat out the Core i7-4790K that the company released back in 2014, which hit a maximum single-core turbo of 4.4GHz out of the box. Note that the i7 7700K is rated at a 95-watt thermal design power. By bumping up the thermal design power to 112 watts for Kaby Lake-X, Intel should have additional headroom to boost out-of-the-box speeds beyond what the company will ship with the 7700K. Now, 112 watts represents a roughly 18% increase in power budget. It might be too optimistic to expect frequency to scale linearly with the increased power budget, so perhaps a part that runs at 18% higher base/boost speeds might be too optimistic to expect. However, if Intel really wants to make something of a splash with this part -- and if we assume that the actual silicon can handle it -- a part that runs at 4.5GHz base/5GHz boost could potentially turn heads. More importantly, it's the kind of part that Intel could probably charge a significant premium for as games tend to benefit greatly from very high per-core performance. At the very least, we can expect base frequency in excess of 4.2GHz and a maximum single core turbo in excess of 4.5GHz. It's good to see Intel building enthusiast-targeted parts At the end of the day, it's important for Intel to be aggressive in building segment-specific products, particularly for segments that are growing, such as gaming. Based on what I'm seeing, it looks like the company understands this and is making a genuine effort to build such compelling, targeted products. If Intel is successful, these efforts should ultimately pay off in the form of increased unit volume shipments, as well as richer average selling prices. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Wann ja, wo und wie kann ich sie löschen. john23.08.1623:51 mit dem system legst du auf? mutig. cs5 installiert und 19 einträge in der etc/hosts? alles klar. die restlichen wesentlichen baustellen wurden ja bereits genannt. „biete support. kostenlos, kompetent und freundlich. wähle zwei.“ Von der MTN-App gesendet. dom_beta24.08.1600:06 john mit dem system legst du auf? mutig. Wieso ist das mutig? „..“ john24.08.1600:09 wie wieso? weil ihm ständig alles wegbricht, programme abstürzen, seine cpu durch launchd-dienste kocht und er allen möglichen crap da drauf hat. darum mutig. wenn ihm während seines sets sein traktor wegbricht, möcht ich die langen gesichter mal sehen auf dem floor. „biete support. kostenlos, kompetent und freundlich. wähle zwei.“ Von der MTN-App gesendet. Technobilder24.08.1601:42 Leider werden Dir hier die wenigsten Nutzer helfen. Für den Grossteil der hier kommentierenden (hast Du ja auch schon gelesen) gibt es nur eine Lösung - sobald die einen Virenscanner sehen, oder Startobjekte raten sie Dir am besten alles zu löschen - oder einen Clean Install - ach was kauf dir gleich einen neuen Rechner... Ich hab dasselbe Problem wie Du - komischerweise ist es zeitweise garnicht vorhanden, dann wieder einige Wochen extrem verstärkt. Ich hab dann auch alle möglichen Startobjekte gelöscht - nur meinen Virenscanner (Bitdefender) nicht denn der ist nicht die Ursache. Nachdem ich das Problemeinige Monate habe und beobachte kann ich für mich feststellen das es vermutlich mit Dateizugriffen zusammenhängt. Bei mir ist die Auslastung hoch wenn Programme die Disk indexieren (zB mein Backupprogramm) oder ich mit Lightroom arbeite und dabei auf die SSD zugegriffen wird. Im normalen Alltag habe ich seit Wochen keine Probleme - ich habe aber vor 2 Monaten mein MacBook Retina zur Reinigung gegeben damit es drinnen mal sauber gemacht wird. Vermutlich ist bei Deinem MacBook inzwischen auch Staub im inneren der natürlich die Wärmeabfuhr behindert und dann drehen die Lüfter höher. Ich habe mir deswegen auch iStatsMenu gekauft um mir die Lüfteraktivität anzeigen lassen zu können. Allerdings bisher ohne sichtbares Ergebnis - vermutlich dauert es einige Monate bis genug Staub im Inneren ist das es sich auswirkt (lach) sffan24.08.1603:33 Lockenheld Woran siehst du, dass tm backups vorhanden sind? Ich nutze kein tm? Wann ja, wo und wie kann ich sie löschen.korrekt tm lief nur kurz 2013. Ich hatte das Datum überlesen. Falls Du nix zum löschen findest, ist vielleichr die disk inzwischen einfach zu klein? Von der MTN-App gesendet. sffan24.08.1603:36 Technobilder Puhh. Der nick kommt mir irgendwie bekannt vor.. Ich bin dann mal weg.. Von der MTN-App gesendet. john24.08.1605:35 @technobilder dass du dich überhaupt noch traust hier zu schreiben. wolltest du nicht nicht fernhalten von - deiner meinung nach - all den idioten hier und dir ein forum suchen, was deiner grosskotzigkeit eher entspricht? wie undankbar kann man eigentlich sein? erst im eigenen thread mit der zugemülltesten maschine, die dieses forum wohl je gesehen hat, jeden (guten!) rat von erfahrenen menschen, die wissen wovon sie reden, ausschlagen und alles besser wissen und jetzt auch noch in anderen threads für stunk sorgen. an deiner stelle hätte ich mich schon alleine aus scham lange still verabschiedet. „biete support. kostenlos, kompetent und freundlich. wähle zwei.“ Lockenheld24.08.1609:22 Um die "Hardwarekomponente Staub" auszuschließen. Ich kann ja selbst das Macbook aufschrauben und Staub entfernen. Oder geht es um Stellen, die nur ein Techniker erreichen kann? adiga24.08.1610:06 john @technobilder erst im eigenen thread mit der zugemülltesten maschine, die dieses forum wohl je gesehen hat, Danke. Und ich dachte schon diesen Titel wäre meiner Maschine zugewiesen worden Dann war es damals doch nur "eine der zugemülltesten Maschine.." @Lockenheld: Ich kann Dich verstehen, habe damals ähnlich reagiert bei meinem ähnlichen Problem, als John (und andere) mir die gleichen Tipps gegeben haben. Habe ein bisschen ungehalten reagiert, glücklicherweise hat dies John nicht abgehalten mir zu helfen. Und so sehr ich davon zurückgescheut bin, habe ich (dank TM) den Clean Install durchgeführt, die Programme (oder neudeutsch Apps?) neu installiert und vom TM die Daten zurück geholt. Seitdem läuft das Ding perfekt. Bei der Musik würde ich mir überlegen, diese auf eine externe Festplatte auszulagern und dann diese zum Auflegen mitzunehmen. Mittlerweile gibt es 2TB Platten, welche kaum grösser wie ein Smartphone sind. Was die Adobe Produkte (host datei) betrifft, würde ich die löschen, wenn Du professionell auflegst. Und Avast und Little Snitch würde ich nicht mehr installieren. Letzteres nur wenn Du wirklich weisst, was Du damit tust. Und bevor Du die Kiste platt machst, natürlich zuerst ein Backup (mit TM) machen. Und was die Seriösität der Tipps betrifft, würde ich mich zu 100% auf John festlegen. Seine Tipps mögen manchmal hart tönen, sind aber korrekt. MikeMuc24.08.1610:10 Ale allerwichtigstes wird sein das du deine Platte aufräumst und Daten auslagerst. 7 GB freier Speicher sind des Systems Tod. Dann schau das du den Avast und die restlichen oben empfohlene Software deinstallierst. Das mit CS4 und den Kosteinträgen läßt tief blicken, ist aber dein Bier und schadet hier nicht. Aber wenn du die Software nicht wirklich brauchst dann deinstallieren die, das gibt auch ein wenig Speicher auf der Platte frei. Erst dann schraub das Ding auch wenn du unbedingt willst. Beim Staub "ausblasen" klemme den Lüfter ab oder blockiere ihn damit er nicht hoch dreht. Den jeder Motor ist im "Umkehrbetrieb" ein Dynamo und erzeugt Strom. Zuviel davon mögen die Bauteile auf der Platine gar nicht gern. Lockenheld24.08.1610:15 Also die Musik bleibt definitiv auf meiner internen Festplatte. Ich habe mich gestern noch von ein paar alten Sachen getrennt, somit sind jetzt 24 GB frei. Avast habe ich auch schon runtergeschmissen. Selbst während ich nur diese Zeilen hier tippe, läuft "launchd" wieder mit 70% mit und bringt die Lüfter zum Glühen. Jeronimo24.08.1610:19 Technobilder Leider werden Dir hier die wenigsten Nutzer helfen. Ach. Aber ellenlanges Geschwafel hilft? Und das dann resultierend im hirnlosesten Lösungsansatz ever – sich mit iStat Menus die Lüfteraktivität anzeigen lassen? Ich hab hier gar nicht so viel Wände, gegen die ich jetzt meinen Kopp hauen möchte. „For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't understand, no explanation is possible.“ Lockenheld24.08.1610:37 Also ich hatte das Macbook auch gerade auf. Da war so gut wie keinerlei Staub im Bereich der Lüfter. StefanE24.08.1610:42 Lockenheld Wie hast du denn Avast entfernt? Ist meines Wissens gar nicht so leicht, den komplett zu entfernen. daneben noch der erste Post von sffan. Ich persönlich würde die Liste noch um Java erweitern. Prüfe mal, was du davon unbedingt brauchst. Und Flash für den Browser ist mittlerweile meist überflüssig. Außer einige Seiten, die noch darauf bestehen. Achtung: Hier gibt es aber einen Deinstaller von Adobe(!) - nur mit dem wird der komplett entfernt. Dann checke noch all deine Launch Daemons und Agents sowie Login-Items. Alles was nicht unbedingt notwendig ist sollte hier am besten raus. Zu guter letzt: Neustart des Macs. Behebt auch manche Probleme. Wie immer gilt aber: Bevor du groß was änderst - mach ein Backup! „Wer die Freiheit aufgibt, um Sicherheit zu gewinnen, wird am Ende beides verlieren!“ adiga24.08.1610:48 Wenn Du Flash wirklich benötigst, dann installiere doch Chrome. Da laufen Flashfilme. Ich würde kein Add-In für Safari laden extra für Flash. Lockenheld24.08.1612:58 Silverlight habe ich auch schon runtergeschmissen. Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Also wenn ich zurückblicke habe ich in Firefox viele Seiten, die den Flash Player benötigen. Wenn ich mich recht entsinne, hatte ich vor kurzer Zeit irgendein "Programm" installiert. Seitdem läuft der Lüfter quasi auf Dauerschleife. Ich habe es aber wieder auf dem "normalen" Wege runtergeworfen (Papierkorb ziehen). Wahrscheinlich sind dort Reste dageblieben. Gibt es irgendeine Möglichkeit zu sehen, welche Programme/Tools wann installiert wurden? dom_beta24.08.1613:02 Lockenheld Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Nein. „..“ Jeronimo24.08.1613:05 Lockenheld Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Nein, nicht mehr. Hier mal eine vermutlich eher unpopuläre Idee. Dein System ist ja immer noch auf (einer frühen Version von) Yosemite. Sofern Du keinen hieb- und stichfesten Grund hast, El Capitan zu meiden, würde ich darauf upgraden. Und zwar frisch. Sprich: Komplettes Backup machen, Volume löschen, El Capitan neu installieren. Dann die Programme, die Du wirklich brauchst (gute Gelegenheit zum Ausmisten) von Grund auf neu installieren. Vor allen Dingen nicht mit dem Migrationsassistent die Daten vom Backup zurückholen, so fängst Du Dir den ganzen Schrott wieder ein, der Dir vorher das Leben schwer gemacht hat. Dauert das? Ja, tut es. Aber überleg mal, wieviel Zeit Du schon in das Troubleshooting (inkl. Postings hier) gesteckt hast, und wieviel Zeit Dir durch ein suboptimales System flöten geht. Wenn dann Sierra kommt und Du upgraden willst, geht das von einem frischen EC-Install wesentlich stressfreier als von einer jahrelang durch "Programme" (wie Du es nennst ) zugemüllten Installation. „For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't understand, no explanation is possible.“ StefanE24.08.1613:06 Lockenheld Silverlight habe ich auch schon runtergeschmissen. Doofe Frage, aber Youtube braucht doch auch Flash? Also wenn ich zurückblicke habe ich in Firefox viele Seiten, die den Flash Player benötigen. Wenn ich mich recht entsinne, hatte ich vor kurzer Zeit irgendein "Programm" installiert. Seitdem läuft der Lüfter quasi auf Dauerschleife. Ich habe es aber wieder auf dem "normalen" Wege runtergeworfen (Papierkorb ziehen). Wahrscheinlich sind dort Reste dageblieben. Gibt es irgendeine Möglichkeit zu sehen, welche Programme/Tools wann installiert wurden? Youtube braucht schon lange keinen FlashPlayer mehr. Es nutzt diesen nur noch, wenn er auf dem System vorhanden ist. Ansonsten HTML5. Entferne den Flashplayer doch einmal und dann gehe deine wichtigen und meistgenutzten Seiten (samt Funktionen) durch und schau, ob der Flashplayer unbedingt notwendig ist. Evtl. gibt es Alternative Seiten oder auch Apps dafür . Ansonsten nutze die Seiten wie bereits vorgeschlagen einfach im Chrome Browser. Falls du auch Amazon Video verwendest: Dieses greift nur in bestimmten Browsern auf den HTML5 Player zurück. ob Firefox dabei ist weiß ich nicht, Safari ist nicht dabei. Ich selbst nutze dafür den Opera Browser. zu deiner zweiten Frage: Ja gibt es: In den Systeminformationen Programme (oder so ähnlich) „Wer die Freiheit aufgibt, um Sicherheit zu gewinnen, wird am Ende beides verlieren!“ dom_beta24.08.1613:18 Jeronimo Sofern Du keinen hieb- und stichfesten Grund hast, El Capitan zu meiden, würde ich darauf upgraden. Es gibt meines Erachtens nach keinen Grund, nicht auf "El Capitan" umzusteigen. „..“ matt.ludwig24.08.1614:54 dom_beta Jeronimo Sofern Du keinen hieb- und stichfesten Grund hast, El Capitan zu meiden, würde ich darauf upgraden. Es gibt meines Erachtens nach keinen Grund, nicht auf "El Capitan" umzusteigen. Es gibt Leute die es einfach nicht möchten. Wann geht das endlich mal in deinen Kopf? Jeronimo hat schon recht, damit wirst du definitiv alle Altlasten los. Wenn ich mich recht entsinne, hatte ich vor kurzer Zeit irgendein "Programm" installiert. Seitdem läuft der Lüfter quasi auf Dauerschleife. Ich habe es aber wieder auf dem "normalen" Wege runtergeworfen (Papierkorb ziehen). Wahrscheinlich sind dort Reste dageblieben. Gibt es irgendeine Möglichkeit zu sehen, welche Programme/Tools wann installiert wurden? Ja im Terminal per: grep 'Installed' /private/var/log/install.log Lockenheld24.08.1615:32 Also Growl und Flash habe ich gerade per Deinstaller runtergeschmissen ... Ich update noch nicht, weil ich nicht weiß, wie es mit meiner DJ Software (Traktor) aussieht - ob sie problemlos läuft. Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... StefanE24.08.1615:41 Lockenheld Ich update noch nicht, weil ich nicht weiß, wie es mit meiner DJ Software (Traktor) aussieht - ob sie problemlos läuft. Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... Also ich kenne die Software nicht, habe aber mal schnell geschaut: Traktor Pro/LE 2 von Native-Instruments soll in der Version 2.10 kompatibel sein. Danach sollte einem Update doch nichts im Wege stehen. Aber immer ein Backup machen Du könntest El Capitan auch erst auf einer externen Platte installieren und es testen bevor du dich für das Update entscheidest. „Wer die Freiheit aufgibt, um Sicherheit zu gewinnen, wird am Ende beides verlieren!“ sierkb24.08.1615:45 Lockenheld: Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... Du hast Dich hier gemeldet, weil Dein system eben nicht mehr so runnt... Weil es total bis Oberkante Unterlippe zugemüllt ist. Kein Wunder, dass das System stockt und Atemnot hat bzw. bekommt und nicht so rund läuft wie es soll. Also solltest Du die Tipps hier beherzigen und es mal gründlich aufräumen und ausmisten oder vielleicht mal ganz frisch neu aufsetzen und dann nur das installieren und am Laufen haben, das Du zum Auflegen unbedingt brauchst, alles andere gehört auf so ein Arbeitsgerät dann nicht drauf, kann weggelassen werden, sollte zugunsten Luft und Raum für die eigentlich zu verrichtenden Tätigkeiten weggelassen werden, bläht und bremst nur unnötig auf. Zum Auflegen brauchst Du sicher nur die Hälfte von dem, was Du da alles installiet hast, wenn überhaupt. Mache das System mal rank und schlank, bringe es auf einen aktuellen Stand, und dann hast Du auch mit dem obersten und wichtigsten Prozess des Systems (launchd), der alle anderen Prozesse startet, steuert und in Gang hält, auch kein Problem mehr. Und bzgl. Backup: das sowieso haben und vorhalten und aktuell halten. Jeronimo24.08.1616:02 Lockenheld Wegen dem Auflegen bin ich immer ein bisschen bei "nver change a running system" ... Na Du bist mir ja ein Herzchen. Dann verschwende hier auch bitte nicht anderer Leute Zeit, wenn Dein system so super runnt und Du es never changen willst. „For those who understand, no explanation is necessary; for those who don't understand, no explanation is possible.“ Lockenheld24.08.1616:21 Nein, nein ... nicht falsch verstehen Bis vor ein paar Wochen lief ja auch alles gut. Da hatte ich keine Probleme. Erst seitdem der Lüfter durchdreht und "launchd" mir die CPU wegfrisst. Seitdem habe ich hier Probleme. Das bedeutet ja, dass es davor auch zugemüllt war - aber irgendetwas hat ihm den letzten Rest gegeben. Ich habe erst letzte Woche ein Backup mit "superduper" gemacht. Momentan fahre ich bei Traktor noch 2.0.1. Deswegen ziere ich mich so, das update aufzuspielen. sffan24.08.1618:28 Lockenheld Also die Musik bleibt definitiv auf meiner internen Festplatte. Ich habe mich gestern noch von ein paar alten Sachen getrennt, somit sind jetzt 24 GB frei. Tipp: Nicht neu, aber nützlich: Damit kann man graphisch aufbereitet nach Platzfresser suchen und so vielleicht noch Platz schaffen. 24 GB sind immer noch zu wenig. Lockenheld Selbst während ich nur diese Zeilen hier tippe, läuft "launchd" wieder mit 70% mit und bringt die Lüfter zum Glühen.Das ist nicht normal. evtl. sollte die "Datenbank", auf die lauchd aufsetzt, mal neu aufgebaut werden. sffan24.08.1618:45 Ein Schuss ins Blaue: Waren nicht unter Yosemite noch die Wifi-Probleme durch den neuen Netzwerkdienst präsent? Durch den Rollback auf den "alten Dienst" durch apple wurde es m.E. ab 10.10.4 zumindest wieder besser.. Lockenheld: Kanns sein, daß Du über WiFi ins Internet gehst, während launchd cpu zeit frisst? Ist das besser, wenn Du wifi ausschaltest und testweise mit einen guten alten Lan-Kabel am Router ins I-Net gehst? Wenn ja: wäre es ein gutes Argument noch mal aufzuräumen (Platz für update) und zumindest auf 10.10.5 zu gehen. Ein post eines neuen etrechk-logs könnte auch was bringen. Dann sieht man was inzwischen weg ist und ob sich nun neue Macken zeigen. Ein Blick in die Konsole-app könnte auch was bringen. Probleme mit launchd führen oft zu Einträgen in den logs ,die die Konsole aufbereitet darstellt. sierkb24.08.1619:54 Lockenheld: Was sagt die Aktivitätsanzeige sortiert nach %CPU? Welcher Prozess, welche App steht, wenn bei Dir die Lüfter auf Volllast drehen, ganz oben und verbraucht dann am Meisten? Lockenheld24.08.1621:35 Zum Aufäumen der Festplatte hatte ich "Omnidisksweeper" benutzt. Mit dem WLAN hat es nichts zu tun. Wenn ich auflege habe ich das WLAN aus und der Luft hat 8 Stunden Vollgas gegeben. Wenn die Lüfter durchdrehen und die CPU auf 100 steht, dann ist es launchd, der so viel frisst. @elias24.08.1621:54 @Lockenheld Lauchd ist das Management Framework das für das Starten, beenden und Verwalten von Prozessen zuständig ist. Es ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Systems und läuft so wie es soll. Die Last liegt bei dir an anderer Stelle und zwar hast du sehr viele Programme die in den LaunchDaemons und LauchAgents mit dem System gestartet werden und ständig im Hintergrund laufen. Firefox z.B. beansprucht sehr viel Speicher (weit über 1 GB) Avast und Adobe sind weitere Speicherfresser und darüber hinaus parentelcontrol (brauchst du das?) was die Prozesse überwacht. Speicher musst du frei machen 5 GB freier Speicher sind zu wenig. Wie du vorgehen musst da kann ich dir helfen aber wenn ich mir dein System so ansehe würde ich vorschlagen das du alle deine persönlichen Daten sicherst und das System neu aufsetzt. Wenn du das möchtest (oder Bereinigen) dann schreib kurz und ich werde dich Anleiten. sierkb24.08.1621:54 Lockenheld Wenn die Lüfter durchdrehen und die CPU auf 100 steht, dann ist es launchd, der so viel frisst. launchd ist Prozess Nummer 1 des Systems (PID 1), er startet das gesamte System nach dem Einschalten und mit dem Hochfahren, er hält das gesamte System am Laufen. Alle Prozesse, alle Programme, Daemons und Dienstprogramme, die das System am Laufen halten, werden von ihm durch nachgeordnete Kindprozesse gestartet und verwaltet. Oder andersherum ausgedrückt: jedes gestartete Programm, jede App, hat den launchd-Prozess mit der Prozess-ID 1 oder einen Fork davon zur Grundlage, der dann jene App, jenen Dienst, jenes Programm gestartet hat und steuert. Wenn also DIESER wichtigste und oberste Prozess, der alles am Laufen hält und steuert, bei Dir sowas zur Folge hat, dann scheint da irgendwas SEHR im Argen zu sein. Versuche mal rauszubekommen, welcher Folgeprozess, welche gestartete Applikation oder welcher Dienst via LaunchDaemon oder LaunchAgent launchd so auf Trab hält und beschäftigt. Was sagt ein Blick in /var/log/system.log? Entweder durch Blick in die Konsole (Konsole.app) oder zum Beispiel mit sudo tail -f /var/log/system.log oder sudo tail -n 200 -f /var/log/system.log (der Schalter -n 200 zeigt die letzten 200 Einträge an)? Zudem: brauchst Du wirklich ALLE Internet-Plugins, die da installiert sind? Das ist ja ein ganzer Zoo, und eines fragwürdiger als das andere. Brauchst Du das Java-Plufgin zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du Teamviewer zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du Office zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du meilenstein zum Auflegen? Brauchst Du die ganze Adobe Scheiße zum Auflegen? Etc. pp. Du hast 8GB RAM-Speicher. Knalle den mal nicht so voll mit unzähligen Hintergrundprogrammen (Daemons) und Plugins, die geladen werden. @elias24.08.1621:58 Wenn also DIESER wichtigste und oberste Prozess, der alles am Laufen hält und steuert, bei Dir sowas zur Folge hat, dann scheint da irgendwas SEHR im Argen zu sein. Blödsinn schau bitte hier sierkb24.08.1622:02 @elias: Ist schon richtig und kein Blödsinn, was ich da geschrieben habe. launchd , ersetzt seit Tiger vollständig den init-Prozess (PID 1) klassischer Unix-Systeme und tut noch Einiges mehr. Darüber müssen wir jetzt aber nicht streiten. Hier geht's um was anderes. @elias24.08.1622:07 Das ist doch richtig ist aber NICHT DER Prozess (wenn überhaupt) der für den Speicherhunger verantwortlich ist. Wenn du in die Lauch* Programme einfügst dann macht launchd genau das - es startet die Programme - sonst nichts. Ich habe zumindest noch nicht erlebt das launchd eine Meldung anzeigt das Programm xy sehr viel Speicher verbraucht. sierkb24.08.1622:19 @elias: Das ist doch richtig ist aber NICHT DER Prozess (wenn überhaupt) der für den Speicherhunger verantwortlich ist. Bitte lies mal von oben nach unten nochmal, was ich geschrieben habe. Weil ich das genauso sehe wie Du, frage ich da so gezielt nach und hab's erklärt. Weil es da irgendwas Anderes gibt, das diesen launchd-Prozess so auf Trab hält, der ist sicher NICHT die Ursache für das alles und nicht für die Prozessorlast, dieser launchd-Prozess, der da angeblich 100% zeigt, ist sicher nur Opfer und Folge eines anderen amoklaufenden Prozesses bzw. einer anderen Auslastung aber sicher nicht die Ursache. Deswegen mal ins Syslog reinschauen, was da drinsteht. Sehe ich doch eigentlich ganz genauso wie Du. Ich fühle mich von Dir grad' total missverstanden. Lockenheld24.08.1622:21 Aber "parentelcontrol" also die Kindersicherung habe ich doch gar nicht aktiviert?? Oder? Ich hatte oben doch geschrieben, dass ich vor kurzem ein Programm installiert hatte und dass es seitdem sehr viel schlimmer wurde. Das ganze war bartender. Ich hatte es manuell von der Platte geschmissen und habe jetzt gesehen, dass in den "launchdaemons" noch ein Eintrag dazu war. Die beiden launch Ordner kannte ich gar nicht, gescheigedenn deren Funktion. Habe dort jetzt auch mal aufgeräumt. Ich denke das wird man in der nächsten Auswertung sehen.

Du musst also damit beginnen einige Programme die du nicht mehr benötigst zu entfernen. Beginne mit Avast: ist zwar die 2015er aber der Prozess für die Deinstallation ist gleich. Leere die Caches von Safari und Firefox. Schau nach anderen Programmen die du nicht mehr benötigst - entferne diese. Starte in den gesicherten Modus und leere die Systemcaches.

Das Plugin wird von Google eh nicht mehr gepflegt und wurde von Google abgeschossen. Weg damit. Verbraucht nur unnötig RAM-Speicher, wenn Du den Browser laufen hast. Wozu brauchst Du ein SharePointBrowser-Plugin im Web-Browser? Zum Auflegen von Musik? Weg damit, verbraucht nur unnötig RAM-Speicher, wenn Du den Browser laufen hast. Gleiches zu sagen zum NP_2020Player_IKEA Plugin. Adobes PDF Viewer ebenso. Der Mac hat einen eingebauten PDF-Viewer (Preview/Vorschau), Safari nutzt diesen. Firefox hat einen eigenen eingebauten PDF-Viewer (PDF.js, Opera findet den übrigens so gut, dass sie ihn übernommen haben und ebenso nutzen), auch da brauchst Du keine Adobe Viewer Plugin. Das Adobe-Geraffel brauchst Du dazu nicht. Verbrät nur unnötig RAM-Speicher und ist eine zusätzliche Problem- und Fehlerquelle, erst recht, wenn veraltet. Und, und, und.

Follow @UPROXX Member Sign Up Sign In In Defense Of The Headphone Jack Dan Seitz 08.18.16 3 months ago • 6 Comments Facebook Twitter EMAIL Shutterstock UPDATE: Apple has announced the iPhone 7 and, as widely rumored, they’ve removed the analog headphone jack. Apple argues that it takes “courage” to do so, but a few weeks ago, we responded to that idea. You can find that response below. When it comes to modern life, there’s probably nothing more universal than a headphone jack. If something electronic has speakers, it has a headphone jack. Everyone has a pair of earbuds wrapped around their phone or tucked in a pocket, or perhaps a full-sized set of cans hanging around their neck. Still, major tech companies have decided the headphone jack is useless, and are campaigning to get rid of it. But their arguments are outweighed by the jack’s virtues. The Case Against The Headphone Jack Apple’s plans to get rid of the headphone jack are well known by this point. This isn’t particularly surprising, as Apple has both a tendency to strip out things it decides its customers don’t need, and a refusal to accept standardization. Nearly a decade ago, nearly every smartphone manufacturer came together and agreed to use USB as a common standard, ending the bad old days of proprietary chargers and data ports for everything. Apple was, and remains, the sole hold-out, part of its philosophy of retaining total control of both hardware and software. What’s surprising is that instead of treating Apple like the outlier that it is, the rest of the tech sector is siding with it. The Moto Z, Motorola’s latest phone, has no headphone jack, and Intel recently made a presentation promoting a new audio standard that makes USB-C, a type of port similar to Apple’s Lightning connector, as the jack of choice. Intel’s argument really boils down to two things: The headphone jack adds thickness to the phone, and consumers prefer thinner phones. And, more importantly, it’s a more efficient way of listening to audio. The headphone jack is analog, while music on your phone is digital, so not only does the port have to be wired into your phone in a relatively complicated workaround, that makes it impossible to incorporate digital effects like noise-canceling into the phone itself. Instead your headphones have to take on those jobs. Using USB-C will make for a less complicated, more straightforward listening experience. And these arguments are absolutely true, as far as they go. But there are problems Intel and Apple aren’t talking about, possibly because there aren’t any good solutions. The Case For The Headphone Jack The biggest, most glaring, and most obvious problem is simply that by throwing out the headphone jack, literally billions of headphones, earbuds, and other gear that rely on it are now suddenly obsolete. Apple alone has moved at least half a billion sets of those distinctive white earbuds boxed with every iPhone. And it, of all companies, should know how just how popular the minijack is: After all, Apple owns a company that built its name on $300 headphones. Consumers don’t seem excited about the switch, either. Already, images are going around of a small dongle to let you keep your headphones. Faced with headphones that will likely be an expensive upgrade or a $10 length of wire, it’s not hard to guess which option frugal smartphone users will opt for. Many see earbuds as something you buy from a vending machine or a drugstore, and that may be a difficult market to raise prices in. Another issue is that the fewer ports a piece of technology has, the less versatile it is. With no headphone jack, everything — from charging to listening to music — has to be done out of one port. It’s fair to argue that few people listen to music on their earbuds and charge their phone at the same time, but it’s also worth asking what the convenience is for the consumer, here. Not helping matters is Intel’s somewhat odd insistence that, thanks to USB-C, you can plug your phone into a display and watch movies on it, when that problem has already been solved by Google’s Chromecast.

When the only available output is DRM capable, the publishers are likely to push for it again. Profile By: mattyj2001 08.20.2016 @ 3:06 AM I’m not sure I get the versatility argument. The analog headphone jack does exactly one thing, and it does it poorly by 2016 standards. Having the ‘versatility’ of multiple specialized ports to do different things actually results in a cumbersome phone, not a loss of versatility. If you’re spending $500 or more on a phone you can afford another $90 for a decent par of bluetooth earbuds. Buck up, and just say goodbye to the 50 year-old technology in your 2016 phone already. Profile By: PositiveKDR 09.07.2016 @ 4:20 PM Came here from a newer article, but wanted to address “It’s fair to argue that few people listen to music on their earbuds and charge their phone at the same time”. I would think the most common case of using both jacks (at least for me) is in the car, charging the phone while also connected to the stereo system with an aux cord. Profile By: WittyPhrase 09.07.2016 @ 5:10 PM Except that aux jack is a pretty antiquated way of listening to audio from your phone on a car now. Most modern cars have bluetooth. I’m sure some don’t, and I certainly hate doing it for any length of time without the charger plugged in, but that’s probably a less common use case these days. Profile By: PositiveKDR 09.07.2016 @ 5:58 PM From a quick search, the average age of a car on the road in the US is 11.5 years (and getting older surprisingly), which is still a bit beyond when bluetooth integration became standard. Anecdotally, I can only think of two cars out of eleven in my extended family that have bluetooth. Profile By: WittyPhrase 09.07.2016 @ 5:19 PM So, I know this was written a few weeks ago, at which point I don’t think anyone knew that the dongle would be included with the phone. That does somewhat negate a lot of this. If they’d removed the 3.5 jack and then charged you $30 to basically be able to use your existing headphones again, that would be a pretty transparent attempt at getting another $30 per phone sale, which is not a paltry sum given how many phones they move. A dongle isn’t the most convenient thing in the world, and I don’t know what they’ll charge if (when, really) you lose it and need another one, but it seems to make sense that if you’re invested enough into Apple’s ecosystem that you’ll just clip the thing more or less permanently on the end of your headphones and forget about it (again, until you lose it or it breaks). It’s an imperfect solution. The big thing I hate about it, which is touched on a little bit above, but not necessarily w/r/t the headphones is it’s not like they decided to eschew the 3.5 jack in favor of a universal port. It’s proprietary to Apple. So now there’s always going to have to be some kind of dongle involved going one way or another. Either you’re adapting your standard headphones to use with an Apple product or you’ve bought into the ecosystem and you get a pair of dedicated lightning port headphones, and you want to use them with something else, so you’ll need that adapter. Is that even possible? I really like Apple products, but it’s kind of hard to support the company when you can see so many other companies listening to their customers. People have been bitching forever about the iPhone’s poor battery life compared to competitors, they’ve been screaming for new MBPs and more than one connector on the new MBs. Nada.

SAN FRANCISCO—Intel has long been known for the chips that bear its branding, but at this year's Intel Developer Forum (IDF), the company announced plans to give other manufacturers a crack at more easily using Intel technology in their products–and taking a bolder stand against competing processes from Samsung and TSMC in the foundry space. Through a new agreement between Intel Custom Foundry and ARM, Intel will provide 10nm physical IP as part of the ARM Artisan platform, thus making it the new de facto industry standard for physical IP and giving ARM's customers an additional choice when selecting a foundry for crafting 10nm-based products. The ARM Artisan platform is based on current advanced ARM cores and Cortex-series processors, and includes high-performance and high-density logic libraries, memory compilers, and core-optimized (POP) IP for designing future ARM mobile cores. //Related Articles Intel Lays Out its Vision for a Fully Connected World "The value of POP technology for an ARM core on the Intel 10nm process is tremendous, as it will allow for quicker knowledge transfer, enabling customers to lower their risk in implementing the most advanced ARM cores on Intel's leading-edge process technology," ARM's Will Abbey wrote in a statement. Additionally, POP technology enables silicon partners to accelerate the implementation and tape-outs of their ARM-based designs. "Having leading IP providers in our portfolio will accelerate ecosystem readiness while providing greater flexibility and time-to-market advantages to our customers," Zane Ball, vice president of Intel's Technology and Manufacturing Group and co-general manager of Intel Custom Foundry, wrote in a statement. So far, Intel has only announced that LG is slated to produce a platform using the 10nm technology. But although few other details have yet been provided as to the nature of the Intel-ARM collaboration, this move is certain to increase and extend Intel's involvement in the mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) spaces, where it has had difficulty making an impact in recent years.

The IDF 2016 dev conference in San Francisco included brand new technology such as virtual reality (VR) headsets, robots, drones, Raspberry Pi-like mini computers, 5G networks, and even DJ tables. It was also a big surprise when the chip maker announced it is willing to build custom ARM chips that could be used in mobile devices.   Advertisement Like Us on Facebook This year's three-day event started on August 16, Tuesday. The first day's keynote featured a wireless VR headset developed by Intel and Microsoft. Project Alloy combines the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR headsets with Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality (AR) headset. The device's RealSense 3D cameras show real-world objects in a virtual world. Intel will open-source the VR headset's design in mid-2017. The chip giant also announced that it is willing to build custom chips with ARM-based designs, according to PCWorld. This shows that the company has dropped x86-based mobile chips. Intel also introduced its development kit for drones called Project Aero. The dev kit includes a flight controller, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) communications, and RealSense camera. Project Aero can be pre-ordered for $400 although Intel CEO Brian Krzanich did not announce a shipping date.    Intel also showed off the benefits of USB-C digital audio over 3.5mm headphone jacks. Apple has reportedly removed the analog port from iPhone 7 devices likely to launch next month. The tech company also wants to turn entire smart homes into Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Small sensors would be added to the building's infrastructure including beams and foundations.   Intel also unveiled its future plans for self-driving cars. Intel is teaming up with automakers such as Germany's BMW and China's Baidu to develop on-board systems and data centers so cars and trucks can navigate together. The Silicon Valley company augurs that 120 million cars on the road will have some kind of autonomous vehicle (AV) tech by 2030. It wants to launch the first version of its driverless car platform by 2021.   In related news, a block away from the IDF conference Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced that its Zen processor exists and is set to ship early next year, according to Engadget. The target market of AMD's last few chips were budget builders yet the new processor is designed for state-of-the-art PC gaming. AMD's chips have already powered gaming consoles including Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One. They are also included in the new Xbox One S and future Project Scorpio.   Here's Intel's AR/VR headset:   Advertisement Tags:intel vr headset intel drone intel processors idf 2016 intel atom chip new intel chip Copyright 2015 en.yibada.com All rights reserved.

While companies like Apple, Google, Samsung and Facebook are curled up in their secret labs working on virtual and mixed reality platforms, Intel has come out in the open to showcase a sleek VR gear which will offer users a rich, immersive experience. Intel’s new VR gear will transport users to the sandy beaches of Caribbean or the deserts of Dubai. You could even take a peek at the Eiffel Tower or the Colosseum of Rome — without even being there. Intel now has a standalone VR Headset which doesn't require a PC – #ProjectAlloy #VirtualReality https://t.co/niXKZj76ZY — PhoneBunch (@PhoneBunch) August 20, 2016 Dubbed Project Alloy, Intel’s virtual reality goggles — also made compatible for so-called mixed reality — drags real-world objects into the virtual realm using 3D cameras. The new all-in-one virtual reality solution leverages Intel RealSense technology. Project Alloy will be offered as an open platform in 2017, the company announced. According to the company’s press release, Intel is focusing on two prime aspects, ease of use and immersive experience. In an effort to make the mixed reality experience hassle-free, Intel has made sure that its new gear is sleek and handy. This means no pesky wires hanging out of the device, which might ruin the user experience. .@Intel's CEO talks about #ProjectAlloy and ushering in the era of “merged reality.” https://t.co/srXqubFGOd #virtualreality — SpaceGamesFederation (@SpaceGamesFed) August 17, 2016 The headset uses Intel’s RealSense cameras, which have depth-sensing capabilities, to allow objects such as the user’s hands to be tracked and entered into the virtual world displayed within the goggles. It does not require additional sensors. “The computing power is located in the Alloy Head-Mounted Device (HMD), which allows the user to experience VR untethered. That means you can ‘cut the VR cord,’ allowing a free range of motion with six degrees-of-freedom across a large space. This, combined with collision detection and avoidance, enables the user to utilize physical movement to explore a virtual space,” the press release stated. The new merged reality is powered by Intel RealSense cameras attached to the VR headset and is not dependent on setting up any external sensors or cameras around the room. During the opening keynote of the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco on August 16, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said, “Merged reality delivers virtual-world experiences more dynamically and naturally than ever before – and makes experiences impossible in the real world now possible.” “Pick up your real-world tennis racket in your living room and step virtually on to the court at Wimbledon. Be the ultimate concert master – fully unplugged. Plan your virtual visit to the Sistine Chapel while never leaving the office. Experience a sporting event, a concert or a film scene from any point of view – and from any position,” he said, according to a report by The Guardian. Intel also intends to open source the Alloy hardware next year, alongside its RealSense application programming interface (API) so third-party manufacturers can develop headsets of their own that run on Windows 10 and tap into Intel tech. “Anybody can take the Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class virtual reality system with any manufacturer they choose,” Krzanich said, according to The Verge. “Merged reality goes beyond computer-generated content. It’s about bringing the real physical world into the digital world real time — and reimagining it with computing power,”said Krzanich in his blog on Medium. “Regardless of whether you’re seeking to experience augmented reality or virtual reality, your freedom in the world of your choice depends on how you merge your realities and the technologies that enable you to cross over from the physical to the virtual, and the virtual to the physical. We’re rapidly moving toward a world where the boundary between the digital and the physical is eroding, and merging in new exciting ways. It’s truly the best of all worlds — and there’s only more to come,” added Krzanich.

Nick Knupffer Why Intel's new Kaby Lake processors won't make your computer much faster 0 Laptops by Sean Hollister October 27, 2016 6:03 PM PDT @starfire2258 Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works Intel turns to Overwatch to show off seventh-generation core Intel's CEO put his company's new core processor to the test on stage by playing Overwatch. 0:57 Close Drag Apple's new MacBook Pro is an eye-catching new computer. So are Microsoft's new Surface Studio and upgraded Surface Book. But none of them use Intel's latest processors. Is that a big deal? Not as much as you'd think. Here's our explainer from August on what "Kaby Lake" really means for your next PC. Original story published August 17: The clock has stopped. The chips are down. Intel's seventh-gen Core processors, codename Kaby Lake, are now official -- but they aren't as big an upgrade as you'd expect from Intel. Sure, they're a little bit faster and a little bit more power-efficient. But the best thing about Intel new CPUs might actually be this: the deals you'll find on PCs with last year's chips. Here's why Kaby Lake isn't such a big deal. What's a Kaby Lake? Intel's seventh-generation Core processors, the latest and greatest CPUs the company has to offer. They're the successor to Intel's sixth-gen "Skylake" processors from 2015. But Kaby Lake isn't a true successor to Skylake. It's more like Skylake+. Usually, Intel creates a powerful new processor architecture, then the following year shrinks down the circuits for better efficiency. (Intel, much like Ke$ha, is industry-famous for that "Tick-Tock" product cycle.) Enlarge Image Kaby Lake isn't huge. It's about twice the size of California's Lake Tahoe -- a popular vacation spot for Silicon Valley residents. Photo by Google Maps But Kaby Lake doesn't do either of those things. The circuits are the same 14 nanometer size as Intel's earlier Skylake and Broadwell chips, and it's not a new architecture either. Intel had been trying to shrink down to 10nm with a processor called Cannonlake, but those chips were delayed. So for now, we're stuck at Tock. No, really, what's a Kaby Lake? Is "Kaby" a kind of fish? Oh. No, it appears to be an actual lake in Canada. Maybe the CEO enjoys hunting moose in his spare time? Is Kaby Lake any better than my existing computer processor? Intel thinks so! The company says its thin laptop chips are 12 percent faster than Skylake in raw performance, and far more efficient at decoding 4K video. In fact, Intel claims you could get 3 more hours of battery life while streaming YouTube 4K videos (7 vs. 4 hours) compared to last year's chips. And for gamers, the company even showed an incredibly thin laptop playing fast-paced shooter Overwatch reasonably well. That sounds great, no? Sure -- until you take a hard look at how Intel generated those numbers. It's not too surprising that Intel's Kaby Lake CPU ran 12 percent faster than the comparable Skylake -- because the new chip is clocked 12 percent faster anyhow! Which could be a problem, because faster clock speeds tend to generate more heat and consume more battery as well. Enlarge Image Intel shows performance gains of 12 percent. Perhaps it's because the chip is working 12 percent harder? Photo by Intel And while Intel's battery life numbers for 4K video are hard to ignore, Intel tells me that battery life should be "similar" -- not necessarily better than Skylake -- across other kinds of workloads. We could easily be in a situation like Intel's Broadwell vs. Haswell, where the company claimed better performance with the same battery life, but devices actually consumed a bit more battery in real-world use. I'm optimistic, though, and we'll need to test for sure. What about the gaming performance? I wouldn't get too excited just yet. We took a closer look at Overwatch on a Dell XPS 13 with the new Intel chip, and it ran pretty smooth...but with a few caveats. Judge for yourself: Also note that Intel may still have some more powerful graphics in the near future: we haven't yet seen how far the company's souped-up Intel Iris graphics have come. Are there any sleek new laptops or tablets coming with Kaby Lake, at least? Sure! Feast your eyes on the new Acer Swift 7: 9 An early look at the ultra-thin Acer Swift 7 laptop We also saw a sleek HP Spectre with a new OLED panel, a refreshed Dell XPS 13, and a 6.9mm-thick Asus detachable tablet -- the Asus T305 -- with a fingerprint reader built right into the power button. Intel says there'll be over 100 different slim computers with Kaby Lake chips by the end of the year. When will Kaby Lake start showing up in new PCs? Enlarge Image Intel CVP Navin Shenoy holds up a Kaby Lake chip. Photo by Sean Hollister/CNET Well, that's the other thing...we'll see the first Kaby Lake computers in September and October, but only the types of chips that go into thin laptops and tablets. Quad-core laptop chips (like you'd find in a MacBook Pro), laptop chips with Iris graphics, business-class laptop chips with vPro and desktop chips won't appear until early next year. On the plus side, rumor has it you won't need a new motherboard for Kaby Lake desktop chips. They'll allegedly use the same LGA1151 socket as their Skylake predecessors. Will they appear in the new MacBook Pro? Depends on Apple (and Intel), but there's a decent chance they won't. Apple typically uses the most powerful Intel laptop processors available -- the 28-watt ones with better Intel graphics -- and again, Intel says they won't be ready until early next year. That's not nearly enough time to get them ready for Apple's September 7 event. However, Bloomberg reports that Apple won't refresh the Macs until later this year, and it wouldn't be the first time Intel has given chips to Apple ahead of schedule. And if Apple decides to refresh the MacBook Air -- another Bloomberg rumor -- those thinner Intel laptop chips are now ready. Update, October 27: Apple isn't using them. Everything you need to know about the major MacBook Pro upgrade After 4 plus years we'll finally see an all new MacBook Pro laptop. We could see the Apple Watch 2 and an updated first-gen Apple Watch this year. New iPhone 7 details, plus Apple TV is now looking to be a TV Guide. Yikes. by Brian Tong 5:59 Close Drag Should I wait to buy a new PC or Mac until Kaby Lake is available? It definitely couldn't hurt. It's usually better to get the latest and greatest if you can afford it -- and Kaby Lake definitely sounds better if you watch 4K video. But as I've outlined above, most PCs probably won't get a big boost to performance or battery life with Kaby Lake silicon. The real reason to wait: you'll almost certainly find some excellent discounts on Skylake computers once Kaby Lake hits the market. What about AMD's Zen? The Intel rival's new built-from-the-ground-up chips sound promising, but you won't be able to drop one into a desktop till 2017. AMD's new laptop chips will take even longer -- expect them in the second half of next year. How will I tell Kaby Lake apart from previous processors when I'm computer shopping? In one important way, Intel's making it easier than ever before: it'll say "7th gen" right on the familiar Intel sticker you'll find on the palmrest of a new laptop. It's a change we've been asking for. Enlarge Image The new "7th-gen" Intel Core branding scheme. Photo by Intel Unfortunately, Intel also made another change that could prove even more confusing. Ever heard of Core M, Intel's line of ultra-low-power 4.5-watt processors for incredibly thin, fanless PCs? As of now, the company's Core m5 and Core m7 processors are part of the Core i5 and Core i7 family, respectively. That means if you purchase a laptop with a "Core i7" label, it may not offer nearly the same sustained performance as a Core i7 machine from last year. Of course, a thin laptop's Core i7 chip already wasn't as powerful as a thick laptop's Core i7 chip, and neither were as powerful as a Core i7 desktop chip, so perhaps we're just continuing that trend. These days, it's really the size of your PC that indicates its potential performance. Besides, you can still tell the M chips apart if you look at the full model number. If you see a Y (e.g. Core i7-7Y75), it's one of the lower-performance processors. I like specs and codenames. Which processors are actually being announced today? Only six: Intel Core i7-7500U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.7GHz base, 3.5GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7200U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.5GHz base, 3.1GHz turbo) Intel Core i3-7100U (15W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 2.4GHz, no turbo) Intel Core i7-7Y75 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.3GHz base, 3.6GHz turbo) Intel Core i5-7Y54 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.2GHz base, 3.2GHz turbo) Intel Core m3-7Y30 (4.5W, 2 cores, 4 threads, 1.0GHz base, 2.6GHz turbo) Is Moore's Law dead? How could you possibly suggest such a thing? We're simply waiting for the clock's second hand to remember how to tick.

Open source news roundup for August 14-20, 2016 Google building Fuchsia, a new open source OS Google is building an open source operating system called Fuchsia. It's based on the Magenta kernel, which is designed for embedded devices, mobile devices, and desktop computers. Tech blog Android Police thinks "it will have potential applications in the Internet of Things." You can find Fuchsia on GitHub. An interesting detail on Fuchsia, covered by the Inquirer, is that it will run on 64-bit ARM chips and Intel-based systems. And is also expected soon for the Raspberry Pi 3. "The key message here is universality. This could be an all-in-one solution." Intel's Alloy, the first open source HoloLens Intel will be the first third-party hardware developer to bring a HoloLens VR device to Windows 10. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich introduced Project Alloy at Intel's Developer Forum in San Francisco last Tuesday. Intel plans to open source the hardware and provide open APIs, allowing everybody to create their own branded products. Linux kernel 4.7 first point release This week, kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the first point release for Linux kernel 7.4, version 4.7.1. This comes a month after Linus Torvalds announced 4.7. With version 4.7.1., the kernel will move from the maintenance channel to stable. This release includes enhancements to ARM, MIPS, and x86 hardware architectures, as well as a variety of fixes for the EXT4 and FUSE filesystems. Greg Kroah-Hartman also announced the 4.6.7 kernel, the last of the 4.6 kernel to be released. He urged users to move to 4.7.1. Microsoft open sources PowerShell Microsoft announced it is open sourcing PowerShell, bringing it to Linux and OS X. Available on GitHub under the MIT license, Powershell is introduced as follows: PowerShell is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux and OS X) automation and configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets. So why did Microsoft open source PowerShell? You can read about that in detail at CIO.com.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 20, 2016 at 1:23PM Image source: Intel.  At its annual developer forum, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) talked about its next-generation Atom processor core, code-named Goldmont. Although the Atom family had primarily been interesting to investors because it was at the heart of the company's (failed) mobile applications processor efforts, the cores are still useful in a number of different markets including the Internet of Things, low-end networking processors, and even low-cost personal computers. To that end, it's important that the company keep making significant performance and power enhancements to its Atom processor cores. Intel's 2013 Atom core, Silvermont, was a significant improvement over its prior-generation Atom core, and allowed the company to build credible offerings in a number of segments. The company's 2014-2015 Atom core, code-named Airmont, was a very modest improvement over Silvermont. However, it looks as though with this year's Goldmont core, the company is bringing some hefty performance enhancements to the table. Massive jump in per-core performance Here is a slide illustrating the performance and power of the prior-generation Airmont core and upcoming Goldmont core in SPECint_base2000 (once an industry-standard test of CPU performance): Image source: Intel. According to the slide, a Goldmont core running at 2.4GHz offers 56% more performance than an Airmont core running at 2.24GHz. A quad-core Goldmont with all cores at 2.2GHz also offers 56% more performance than a quad-core Airmont running at 2.24GHz. This means that, at least in SPECint_2000, Goldmont is substantially faster than Airmont, implying that the new core is substantially enhanced from the prior-generation core. Looks good, but Intel can't let up The main problem with Atom processor cores is simply that Intel doesn't release chips in a timely fashion. Products based on the Goldmont CPU core were originally supposed to come out in the 2015 time frame, targeting smartphones, tablets, and low-cost PCs. Intel's Atom-based networking chips have also been neglected, with its current product line still based on the Silvermont architecture manufactured in the company's 22-nanometer process. Intel should be able to assemble system-on-a-chip products, which integrate CPU cores and other components to make a complete product, in a more rapid fashion. Clearly there is some issue within the company that it needs to remedy. What I would like to see is the company releasing products based on successive Atom cores at a yearly clip. That means products based on the post-Goldmont Atom in the second half of 2017, products based on the successor to that in the second half of 2018, and so on. If Intel can do that, then the company's businesses that rely on the Atom core should be in pretty good shape, particularly if the company continues to make significant generation-over-generation strides in core performance. However, if the company's product releases continue to be as unpredictable as they have been over the last couple of generations, then it may be difficult for those businesses to achieve the growth and profitability that the company hopes.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Project Alloy Is A Wireless VR Headset By Intel Posted: Aug 20 2016, 11:20am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 22 2016, 9:08pm CDT, in News | Technology News     Project Alloy is the new VR headset that Intel has been working on. This particular VR technology is wireless and has its own personal battery and processor. Don't Miss: Sam's Club Black Friday 2016 Deals Alloy is pretty cool as it locates rooms for you and keeps a track of your fingers so that you can interact with virtual objects. The camera which is part of Intel’s push around “merged reality” that lets you experience VR and augmented reality as a single unit allows you to see other objects as well as people around you. This former mentioned concept is similar to Microsoft’s "mixed reality" with HoloLens. This Holographic platform owned by Microsoft will assume an important position with the Alloy hardware. The Holographic platform will be accessible to all Windows 10 PCs from next year and Intel’s Alloy hardware specifications and APIs will become an open source from next year. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel made the following statement at the IDF keynote today, “"Anyone can take Alloy hardware, combine it with Windows Holographic, and build a world-class VR system.” A demo was given by a rep from Intel to showcase the Project Alloy headset. Whilst wearing this headset he was able to navigate through a virtual room while simultaneously move around on the stage. Although the headset took a few minutes to recognize the rep’s hand it was impressively able to do so when the rep made the move to a door in VR. This project by Alloys is significant when it comes to the future of VR as well as AR. This is the first set of technology that is not limited to the fact that it has to be connected to a PC or a phone with pest wires. Intel plans on pushing the boundaries of wireless VR with Project alloy.

Intel officials are ready to bring silicon photonics—in development for 16 years—to the market. At the Intel Developer Forum (IDF) this week, Diane Bryant, executive vice president and general manager of the company's Data Center Group, announced that the chip maker has begun shipping silicon photonics modules, the first products in an expected portfolio that officials have said will help meet the growing demand from cloud service providers for more network bandwidth, better scalability and faster connectivity. Silicon photonics refers to the use of pulses of light rather than electrical signals over copper wires to move large amounts of data at high speeds and over long distances. Intel's first two products, the 100G PSM4 (Parallel Single Mode fiber 4-lane) and 100G CWDM4 (Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing 4-lane), will target switch-to-switch optical interconnects in data centers and will be available later this year, with adoption ramping next year. The first silicon photonics-based components will enable the transfer of data at 100 gigabits per second over distances of 2km or more, and will come in a pluggable model and an embedded form factor. Silicon photonics not only will use light to offer faster connectivity, but Intel's technology also uses silicon lithography to more precisely align the laser, all of which will lead to greater performance, better efficiency and lower costs, officials said. The technology will enable organizations to move beyond the scaling and distance limitations of copper wire for transferring data between data centers and within systems, all at lower cost and greater efficiency, Bryant said during her keynote address at the show. Intel plans to increase the speed between network switches to 400g bps, and officials eventually want to bring optical communications onto the chip, driving at faster connectivity for inside the server. Intel, which has been shipping the modules since June, is the first step with silicon photonics for helping cloud service providers deal with the rapid growth in data center traffic. According to Bryant, network traffic in the data center is five times that of internet traffic every year, and the amount of traffic is doubling every year. A change is needed, she said. "Electrons running over network cables won't cut it," Bryant said. "We see a future where silicon photonics optical input-output is everywhere in the data center." Microsoft is an early adopter of Intel's silicon photonics, with officials planning on using it in its Azure cloud data centers. Kushagra Vaid, general manager of Azure cloud hardware engineering at the software giant, joined Bryant on stage. Vaid said the growth of data traffic in cloud data centers calls for new technologies that can scale better than copper. "It's a great way to continue that scaling, to use silicon photonics," he said. The plan is initially to deploy the technology in Azure for switch-to-switch connectivity, Vaid said. Intel isn't the only tech company pursuing silicon photonics. IBM engineers a year ago announced they had designed and tested a fully integrated wavelength multiplexed silicon photonics chip, which officials said was a key step to developing 100g-bps optical transceivers. IBM's silicon photonics research is part of a $3 billion effort announced in 2014 to research technologies that will replace traditional silicon chip architectures.             LATEST SERVERS ARTICLES   Microsoft Plans to Build a Quantum Computer Cray, SGI Awarded $52 Million in Federal Supercomputer Contracts IBM, OpenPower Foundation Make Push into Europe GPU's Role in Artificial Intelligence Advances Featured at Conference EMC Shows Its Data Center Strength at Inaugural Dell EMC Conference                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

But are any worth buying today? Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Aug 20, 2016 at 9:08AM Image source: Getty Images. Income investors broadly aim to buy above-average dividends that boast market-beating stock-price growth, as well. That's a tall order, because high-dividend payouts often come shackled to shares that have declined sharply -- often due to underlying business difficulties in stodgy, slow-moving industries.  To combat these natural difficulties, the technology sector just might offer the right mix of growth, dynamism, and dividend yield to be worthy of investor's attention. Below, we'll look at the top-dividend stocks in the technology sector with an eye toward finding the ones that could provide that elusive mix of hefty cash returns and capital appreciation. Highest dividend-paying technology stocks Stock Dividend yield Payout ratio Frontier Communications (NASDAQ:FTR) 8.7% N/A Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) 4.5% 56% AT&T (NYSE:T) 4.4% 82% Verizon (NYSE:VZ) 4.2% 64% HP (NYSE:HPQ) 3.5% 25% IBM (NYSE:IBM) 3.5% 43% Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) 3.4% 57% Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) 3.4% 44% Xerox (NYSE:XRX) 3.2% 74% Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 3% 48% Source:Yahoo Finance. Sustainable dividend A high dividend won't do you any good if it isn't also growing over time, so we can screen out dividends that aren't well covered by current earnings and cash flow. In Frontier's case, for example, the communications giant booked a net loss in its last fiscal year and for the first quarter of 2016. Sure, free cash flow is about twice the $125 million it pays out each quarter in dividends. However, Frontier's large debt load and costly expansion plans means that there are more-important priorities than boosting an already-generous payout. INTC Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts. Consider IBM as a stronger dividend-growth candidate. Its $1.3 billion quarterly payout was less than half of its (substantial) earnings last quarter, and just one-third of its operating cash flow. Big Blue's debt level, meanwhile, is less than twice its cash on hand. The consistently improving cash production has helped the dividend double since 2010, even as the payout ratio remains below 50% of earnings . Solid market outlook Intel stands out in this list as a dividend tech giant with solid growth prospects. Despite weakness in the PC market, Intel's management sees an acceleration in sales gains this year thanks to healthy demand in its data center, programmable solutions, and Internet of Things divisions. Profitability is also running ahead of plan thanks to falling production costs. Image source: Getty Images. Unfortunately, restructuring expenses will continue to pinch short-term profits. Yet Intel appears set to emerge from its transition in fine shape to take advantage of major tech trends like cloud computing and big data. Contrast that outlook with hard-drive giant Western Digital, whose stock has slumped by 40% in the last year as sales volume and profitability dropped. Like Frontier, WDC is hoping a major acquisition will help it right the ship, but sustainable dividend growth won't be possible until sales and earnings recover. Finding a good value Thanks to their relatively slow growth and spotty recent financial performance, nearly all of these tech stocks can be purchased at a discount to the broader stock market. Newly formed HP is the cheapest of the group at nine times forward earnings, while Qualcomm weighs in as the priciest, at 16 times next-year's profits. Investors are paying about 19 times forward earnings, meanwhile, for the S&P 500. All of the above stocks also pay an annual yield that's at least 50% higher than the S&P's current 2%.  Of course, the valuation and income gaps alone don't make these dividend stocks screaming buys. But they do suggest that income investors could find some solid long-term bets among mature dividend tech giants right now. With that in mind, I'm most interested in Intel at today's prices. The chip titan's cash flow and profits seem to have stabilized and are primed for steady growth even if the PC market stays weak, which means its dividend has room to improve from its already market-thumping 3% yield.  Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The 3.5mm audio jack, which was introduced as a way to connect headphones into an audio player is poised to be replaced by USB-C port. Most smartphones and high end laptops have transitioned from microUSB to USB-C as the primary port of interface and the reversible USB port is now aiming to kill the well known audio jack. At IDF, Intel has announced new USB audio standard that will push 3.5mm audio out of the smartphone industry. The first problem with USB-C port replacing the headphone jack is the countless number of headphones people own right now and ones that are lying in the inventory. The second problem being that while listening to music with a USB-C based headphone, it will become impossible to charge the device and vice-versa. Intel says its new USB audio standard will ensure efficient battery consumption and also define new mechanism for buttons to pause music or lower volume, reports CNET.

Miller August 19, 2016 10 Comments AMD showed good signs that it could again be a real competitor in processors for high-performance PCs and servers. In announcing the first details of its Zen architecture, and showing off the first products based on the design yesterday, AMD showed signs that it could again be a real competitor in processors for high-performance PCs and servers. That will be good news for buyers of both PCs and servers because Intel now thoroughly dominates both markets, and while Intel makes some great processors, more competition typically results in better products or at least better prices. Although AMD was once a big player in both of these markets and can claim many firsts—its Opteron server products were the first to go 64-bit—it's been years since AMD really had competitive products. The "Bulldozer" architecture and its successors just didn't deliver the performance the company wanted or needed compared with Intel's offerings. At a press conference announcing Zen held during the annual Intel Developer Forum this week, AMD CEO Lisa Su said that "AMD is at its best as a high-performance computing company." She also said that work on the Zen architecture goes back two years, to the beginning of her time as CEO. AMD SVP and CTO Mark Papermaster showed some details of the Zen microarchitecture, saying it was a "ground-up" new design architecture that can stretch from PCs to servers to mobile. He said Zen was designed for performance, throughput, and efficiency, which sounds good but not unique, and it's the details that matter. On that subject, Papermaster talked about how the new architecture provides a 40 percent improvement in performance per clock at the same energy compared to AMD's existing architecture, and with more parallelism, including 75 percent more scheduling capacity and 50 percent more instruction width. He said Zen has better branch prediction, as well as a micro-op cache. Perhaps the biggest departure is the addition of symmetric multitasking (SMT)—the ability to run two threads per core. In its previous architecture, AMD went for more integer calls, while Intel instead focused on its version of SMT, which it calls hyperthreading. Papermaster said additional details would be revealed at next week's Hot Chips conference. The new products will be produced on Global Foundries' 14nm FinFET process, which Papermaster said allows for improvements in performance per watt, making it more suitable for mobile processors. AMD is currently using this process on its Polaris Radeon Graphics GPUs. This first product, code-named Summit Ridge, will be an 8-core, 16-thread processor aimed at the desktop enthusiast market, Su said. This will support the AM4 socket the company plans to roll out with its next APU this fall, called "Bristol Ridge" (based on the older architecture). It supports DDR4 memory, PCIe 3.0, and next generation I/O, such as USB 3.1 and NVMe. The Summit Ridge chip is now expected to ship in volume in the first quarter of 2017, a bit later than some had hoped. In demonstrations, it appeared to do a fine job playing Deus Ex: Mankind Divided at 4K using a Radeon Fury X graphics board. AMD compared it with an 8-core, 16-thread Intel Core i7-6900K (Broadwell-E) at 3 GHz, showing it completing the Blender rendering test just slightly faster. As usual, I take all vendor benchmarks with a grain of salt; AMD has worked on the Blender benchmark to make it work better with Open CL on discrete GPUs, so it's unclear whether this is a representative test. Also note that Broadwell-E typically runs at 3.2 GHz with turbo up to 3.7 GHz, so AMD slowed it down for the test; it is also available in a 10-core, 20-thread version. That said, it does indicate that Zen should at least be competitive. Perhaps more importantly, the company announced a server processor, known as Naples, that will have up to 32-cores and 64-thread, designed for the standard 2-processor server market. AMD showed off a motherboard of such a system and had it running in one of the demos, though it was not running any real applications. This is supposed to be out in the second quarter of 2017. AMD said it now had "hundreds" of such servers in its labs and with software partners. Su said entry into the server market was not about a "point product," but about being competitive for the next five years. This seems important given how Intel has completely dominated the server market in recent years, with a market share well above 95 percent. Naples seems aimed squarely at the Xeon E5 and standard 2P servers, the kind of server that most businesses use for their everyday computing. It's not necessarily the most exciting part of the market, but it is the broadest, and one where there is room for competition. In the second half of next year, AMD plans to have an APU (integrated CPU and graphics) version designed for notebooks, with embedded products to follow. In short, the Zen products look competitive from a performance viewpoint; that's something AMD has not been able to claim about its CPUs in recent years. Of course, there's still a lot we don't know, including details about actual shipping versions of the chips, with things such as frequency, memory specifications, or Total Desktop Power (TDP). It's highly likely there will be versions of these chips with fewer cores, though AMD has not shared any details. The company hasn't announced pricing. Still, I'm always a fan of competition, and Zen represents AMD's best shot in years at giving Intel some real competition in the desktop and notebook markets, and particularly in the server market. "We are back," said an exuberant Su, and that's something that should be good for all of us who buy x86 processors. Back to top By Michael J. Miller Michael J.

But there’s no doubt the company is trying to move fast on multiple fronts to participate in a richly diverse set of opportunities ahead. This year’s Intel Develop Forum showed the company racing to get traction with a broad set of new platforms in machine vision, the Internet of Things, FPGAs, machine learning and more. None of them will replace the PC, but some collection of them could someday more than fill that gap. Analysts’ opinions were mixed. In a research note entitled, “Battleship is turning,” Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank said he was “impressed by Intel’s commitment to move beyond its PC heritage into a wide array of new markets … this transition will become increasingly apparent in 2017 as PC-related revs fall to ~50% of the company's mix. He and others praised the company for an update on its 10nm node that showed “its ability to keep pace with Moore’s law when others have found doing so more difficult.” Semiconductor analyst Mathew Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity added that Intel’s willingness to embrace ARM cores in its foundry and FPGA offerings a “refreshing relatively new sense of market pragmatism from CEO Brian Krzanich.” Market watcher Nathan Brookwood of Insight64 was less sanguine noting that the PC was probably was “the most important design win of all time…but it’s not clear IoT will be the same horn of plenty…I think ARM is going to be the long term winner in IoT,” he added. The three-day event began with a high octane band playing on virtual instruments using armbands powered by Intel Curie IoT modules, including a virtual keyboard played with gloves using its RealSense depth cameras (below). Among the many new platforms Intel is pursuing, RealSense is a clear star candidate. Next page: A depth camera with breadth (All Images by EE Times except where noted.)

Skylake EDAC Driver Is A Late Addition To Linux 4.8 Kernel Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Kernel on 21 August 2016 at 05:14 PM EDT. 1 Comment A new driver addition coming only now to the Linux 4.8 kernel after the merge window closure is skx_edac. This new thousand lines of code is for providing error detection and correction (EDAC) for the Intel Skylake server integrated memory controllers. Skylake servers are getting their own new EDAC driver due to various architectural changes with the hardware they decided to stop extending the Sandy Bridge EDAC driver. Tony Luck of Intel is the maintainer of this new skx_edac driver. The driver landed with this Git commit today. 1 Comment Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

This, in April this year, the California-headquartered company had announced, would result in reduction of 12,000 positions globally, almost 11% of its overall workforce. In an interaction with Bibhu Ranjan Mishra, her first one with media in the new role, Nivruti Rai, general manager of Intel India talks about how her focus would be on steering Intel India through its  third phase of journey, by deriving at least 30% more value through multitude of ways. Edited experts What would be your key focus areas in this role? I have been with Intel for 22+ years and half of my career here was in technology development, when I was in the US. The second half of my career has been in India as a technical manager. Intel India has gone through an organizational maturity phase. At the early stage, about 10-15 years ago, we were focusing on building credibility. It involved hiring strong talent and set up the organization with people and infrastructure. Then came the execution phase, which was essentially about building predictability by executing on key programmes flawlessly and consistently. From the organization maturity perspective we have now come to a stage of excellence where we are driving both innovations and inventions. The expectation from me is to drive excellence and create much higher value for the organization. One example of this is how to use the 7,500 people we have in India in a manner so that we create value equivalent to 10,000 or 12,000 people.  What are the innovations you are driving out of India? Within Intel India, there are different business groups which are driving innovations such as data centre development, graphics development, platform integration and IP development, all in hardware & software. When you look at the portfolio that Intel India is working on, we have an opportunity to invent and innovate in every single domain. For example, how we can make data centres better, smarter and more efficient; what can we do to graphics to make it better, work on brand new IPs that create new use cases. And, the world is moving towards making our machines more smarter while the smartest and most evolved living being is human. So how we can make our machines think like humans or enable machines to act like human brain. Those are the kind of areas I am looking at Intel India to work. Intel is very interested to make automobiles smart and connected, so that is another area of opportunity for us.  You have taken up the mantle of heading Intel India engineering centre at a time when globally the company is undergoing a restructuring and had announced around 12,000 job reductions. How is it going to impact India? It’s not really a reduction. It’s a shift in focus in line with our new strategy of virtuous cycle of growth.   What is the number of people in India who will get impacted by this? We are still working towards our transformation journey. So it’s not one shot. But like I said, I don’t look at it as a reduction. I look at it as a shift. This is about being proactive – looking at what are the needs and market requirements, and the kind of capabilities and products we need to build in alignment with our vision of touching the lives of everybody in the earth.  Critics say that one of the strong causes behind the massive restructuring by Intel is it lost the plot to play a major role in mobility segment. So how the focus is shifting? We are not getting out of mobile. We have a mobile roadmap though some projects may not happen. So what will it mean to India? Any change that we are making is to drive new strategies. Because of the changes globally, our focus has shifted – to things like machine learning to automobile. That’s exactly the focus we are shifting to Intel India also. We have created a slogan which says 'maximize Intel with maximum India’.  As you said, since the focus is on creating more value out of the existing employee base, how is it going to happen? There are many ways for doing this, not obviously by just making people go through the grinds and getting more hours. Making people work for long hours is not a sustainable strategy. So, we have to create strategies that keep our employees happy and motivated and this is something I am trying to figure out.  How can that be done? This can be done by making a person working in one technology area to learn another related technology. For example, let’s say there is one guy who does fantastic work in logic design and another, circuit design. The circuit design guy is cross-trained in logic design, which is an allied field, he can be roped in whenever there is a need for logic design and there is shortage of people. There are many different ways that we have thought which will help in creating 30% more value out of the existing people, without increasing the work hour. It’s about creating higher value.  So, does it mean that you are not going to hire for the next two-three years (in India)? We will hire to do new things as per Intel's current strategy. It does not mean that I am reducing the staff (here).  Of late, Intel is gearing up to work with the fledgling start-up ecosystem in India. What is your observation about the start-ups in the country? The startup ecosystem in India has a lot of room to grow. The reason why I say that is we have 8 million people in Bangalore which is equivalent to the entire population of Israel. Now, Israel does five startups a day and India does five startups a day with 1.2 billion population. So, there is a big gap. We have a huge opportunity to nurture and grow the product startup ecosystem here.  What is the status of the 'Maker Lab’ initiative you launched last year? In August last year, we started Intel India Maker Lab with an incubation facility. We set up a facility with Maker Lab where we provide start-ups with platforms, hardware, software development kits and mentoring from senior technologists from Intel India. We have now 18 start-ups here, and we are aligning the start-ups to our focus areas. One of these areas is automobiles. Our intent is to collaborate with them and enable them to the next level with think tank, equipment and ability because they contribute to our vision. We have set a review board with corporate experts and we will leverage them to identify and take them into the next level of engagement.  Read More On Intel India | Iot | Nivruti Rai | Cloud | Start-ups | Innovation | Data Centres | Israel | India | Start-up Ecosystem | Maker Lab | Companies | Q&a PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements New to the stock market?

From the organization maturity perspective we have now come to a stage of excellence where we are driving both innovations and inventions. The expectation from me is to drive excellence and create much higher value for the organization. One example of this is how to use the 7,500 people we have in India in a manner so that we create value equivalent to 10,000 or 12,000 people.  What are the innovations you are driving out of India? Within Intel India, there are different business groups which are driving innovations such as data centre development, graphics development, platform integration and IP development, all in hardware & software. When you look at the portfolio that Intel India is working on, we have an opportunity to invent and innovate in every single domain. For example, how we can make data centres better, smarter and more efficient; what can we do to graphics to make it better, work on brand new IPs that create new use cases. And, the world is moving towards making our machines more smarter while the smartest and most evolved living being is human. So how we can make our machines think like humans or enable machines to act like human brain. Those are the kind of areas I am looking at Intel India to work. Intel is very interested to make automobiles smart and connected, so that is another area of opportunity for us.  You have taken up the mantle of heading Intel India engineering centre at a time when globally the company is undergoing a restructuring and had announced around 12,000 job reductions. How is it going to impact India? It’s not really a reduction. It’s a shift in focus in line with our new strategy of virtuous cycle of growth.   What is the number of people in India who will get impacted by this? We are still working towards our transformation journey. So it’s not one shot. But like I said, I don’t look at it as a reduction. I look at it as a shift. This is about being proactive – looking at what are the needs and market requirements, and the kind of capabilities and products we need to build in alignment with our vision of touching the lives of everybody in the earth.  Critics say that one of the strong causes behind the massive restructuring by Intel is it lost the plot to play a major role in mobility segment. So how the focus is shifting? We are not getting out of mobile. We have a mobile roadmap though some projects may not happen. So what will it mean to India? Any change that we are making is to drive new strategies. Because of the changes globally, our focus has shifted – to things like machine learning to automobile. That’s exactly the focus we are shifting to Intel India also. We have created a slogan which says 'maximize Intel with maximum India’.  As you said, since the focus is on creating more value out of the existing employee base, how is it going to happen? There are many ways for doing this, not obviously by just making people go through the grinds and getting more hours. Making people work for long hours is not a sustainable strategy. So, we have to create strategies that keep our employees happy and motivated and this is something I am trying to figure out.  How can that be done? This can be done by making a person working in one technology area to learn another related technology. For example, let’s say there is one guy who does fantastic work in logic design and another, circuit design. The circuit design guy is cross-trained in logic design, which is an allied field, he can be roped in whenever there is a need for logic design and there is shortage of people. There are many different ways that we have thought which will help in creating 30% more value out of the existing people, without increasing the work hour. It’s about creating higher value.  So, does it mean that you are not going to hire for the next two-three years (in India)? We will hire to do new things as per Intel's current strategy. It does not mean that I am reducing the staff (here).  Of late, Intel is gearing up to work with the fledgling start-up ecosystem in India. What is your observation about the start-ups in the country? The startup ecosystem in India has a lot of room to grow. The reason why I say that is we have 8 million people in Bangalore which is equivalent to the entire population of Israel. Now, Israel does five startups a day and India does five startups a day with 1.2 billion population. So, there is a big gap. We have a huge opportunity to nurture and grow the product startup ecosystem here.  What is the status of the 'Maker Lab’ initiative you launched last year? In August last year, we started Intel India Maker Lab with an incubation facility. We set up a facility with Maker Lab where we provide start-ups with platforms, hardware, software development kits and mentoring from senior technologists from Intel India. We have now 18 start-ups here, and we are aligning the start-ups to our focus areas. One of these areas is automobiles. Our intent is to collaborate with them and enable them to the next level with think tank, equipment and ability because they contribute to our vision. We have set a review board with corporate experts and we will leverage them to identify and take them into the next level of engagement.  Bibhu Ranjan Mishra Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 MORE ON MARKETS: Quick Links Stock Market Live Portfolio Commodity Market Upcoming IPO Personal Finance Stock Market News Derivatives Mutual Funds Gold Price Sensex Browse STOCK Companies A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Browse Mutual Funds A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Index Stocks ACC Adani Ports Ambuja Cem.

Contact Newsletter SUBSCRIBE   previous Star Citizen Gamescom 2016 gameplay shown off    random   next Deus Ex: Mankind Divided Season Pass detailed  No Man’s Sky PC patches detailed Tons of fixes by Mikhail Madnani on August 20, 2016   After a rocky launch, Hello Games have issued patches on PC and have finally detailed the patches in a post on Steam Community. The patch notes are as follows and Hello Games claims this fixes 70% of the issues reported: Patch 1 The focus of patch 1 was to add greater support for more hardware. Either specific hardware configs, or hardware outside our min spec. We want as many people to be able to play as possible, and these were our most reported issues. AMD Phenom Support Game is now confirmed working on Phenom CPUs. Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten to support AMD CPUs. The game code no longer relies on anything above SSE 2, Havok Physics has also now created new libs for us to add Phenom support. Alt-Tab has improved Some systems/configs were crashing or not pausing correctly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved. Improved Performance On CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance has been improved. On CPUs with exactly 8 threads, performance has also been significantly improved. Framerate Stuttering due to Shader Caching Framerate was initially stuttering due to shaders not being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. We have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice some stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game (the very first time you run), but it should be smoother from then on. This is particularly true on ATI cards. Max FPS Cap On some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS to 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS (causing stuttering). This has been fixed. Radeon 6xxx Added support for this GPU, which doesn’t support OpenGL 4.5 fully. Save Corruption Solution to try to prevent saves getting corrupted no matter what’s going on in background processes (see Patch 3 below, where we also are attempting to recover corrupted saves). Intel GPU Detection We do not currently support Intel GPUS. We are working on this for a future patch, to expand our min spec. In the meantime, the game will now let you know if you are trying to run with an unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for some users that their high end GPU has not been selected. Gsync Gsync has been disabled by default, which was causing an issue for some users Mouse Smoothing Generally this is most helpful for players with sub-30 FPS. Smoothing on mouse movement has been improved to prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now adjustable through the Options menu in “Mouse Smoothing”. It defaults to off. If you feel micro stutters in framerate affecting controls, feel free to turn this up. If you feel the framerate is “slow” or “lumpy”, please make sure that this is turned off Patch 2 For patch 2 our focus was on the most reported bugs or crashes. Our aim was to improve stability, and make sure player’s saves are safe in future. Stuck under the world It was possible for players to save their game stuck under the terrain, leaving them stuck. This was caused by getting shot down in atmosphere, and their ship reaching ridiculous speeds as it crashed to the planet. This has been resolved. Whilst it won’t happen anymore, if you are currently already stuck under the world, we detect this and do our best to rescue you. Crash after warping Occasionally at random the game would lock up after a warp, or return to desktop. This was due to very specific timing in hardware (a threading specific bug) – meaning that unfortunately for some people it was regular, and for others they would never be able to recreate it. This was our most reported crash during gameplay, and has now been resolved. Game failing to save until you died If the player died, and then loaded the game ten times without saving, and then died, player progress wouldn’t be saved from then on until you died again. This is fixed now! This was also causing player’s saves to grow in size. Crash fixes in scanning Quite a rare crash, but in certain scenarios it was possible to scan from space or on planet and crash the game. Crash warping inside a freighter When warping into a battle sometimes the player warped into the inside of a freighter and everything went crazy This is fixed now. Patch 3 Patch 3 is targeted at our next most common support requests, fixing the next most common crashes, as well as trying to help players who have become stranded or have corrupted their save files. Stranded in Space Station If you died in your ship while in atmosphere of a planet with a damaged ship, you could respawn in a space station with your launch thrusters and pulse engine damaged. If you did not have the resources to fix them then you could no longer take off and be stuck there. This will no longer happen. Loading Corrupted Save Files Some players have corrupted save files, we’ve been working with them to still load saves even if they are corrupted (this can happen for many reasons outside of the games control). This fix has allowed many players to still load their save even if they have become corrupt on PC. Crash fixes for next three most commonly reported issues: - As the player gathers a huge amount of discoveries, there was a threading issue that becomes more prevalent the more discoveries you have, and could cause the game to crash. - If you had collected a large number of blueprints, in a specific order it was possible to crash the game when you received a new blueprint. This has been fixed. - Players who set a large number of waypoints could find themselves in a situation where they could crash the game in the Galactic Map, this is remedied now (PS. A better waypoint system is coming). No word on the release notes for the latest PlayStation 4 patch as of this writing. There was a 600mb update to the PS4 version yesterday. No Man’s Sky is available on PlayStation 4 and PC. More information is available on Steam Community.

Brian Feroldi (TMFTypeoh) Aug 20, 2016 at 8:07AM Image source: Getty Images. We Fools believe that the stock market is largely rational and prices stocks appropriately the vast majority of the time, but that doesn't mean that it's always correct. Sometimes the markets may be overly bullish or bearish for any number of reasons, and if you can take an alternative stance and be proven correct, then you can be in a position to make a killing. With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors are sharing the one stock that they think the market is pricing incorrectly. Read on to see which stocks they picked and why they believe that the market's assessment is wrong. This specialty retailer isn't dying -- it's growing! Brian Feroldi: Short-sellers, or investors who bet against stocks, have placed a target on the back of video game retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME). Currently more than 31% of the company's shares have been sold short, which indicates that many believe that this company's future is looking bleak. At first glance it's easy to understand why so many have adopted that viewpoint. With the rise of smartphones and digital games, it's not hard to predict that the company's core business is going to be under a lot of pressure into the future. Image source: GameStop. I thought so, too, but once I started to look under the hood I realized there are plenty of reasons to believe that the market is wrong. First, let's get the bad news out of the way. Yes, the company's physical game business is expected to continue to decline from here, but at a far slower rate than you might otherwise believe. Management is only forecasting a 6% annualized decline over the next few years.  Before you smirk at that claim, it's worth pointing out that cutting-edge video games require a huge amount of storage capacity. The average PS4 or Xbox One video game takes up 40 gigabytes of storage space, which is a big reason why digital penetration in video games is only about 20% (versus 50% for music).  In addition, physical games can be resold in GameStop's stores, allowing the customer to recoup some cash. You can't do that with digital downloads, so those two factors should help to slow the overall decline. But GameStop isn't simply sitting still, as it has numerous growth opportunities in place that will help to offset that decline. For one, the company is using the shift to digital games as a catalyst for growth. GameStop currently rings up more than $1 billion in sales for digital games, up a huge 263% from 2010.  GameStop is also pushing into the collectible space by offering game-related apparel, gadgets, toys, and more at its stores. Sales are expected to be $500 million in 2015, and the company has aspirations to reach $1 billion in sales by 2020. There's also the company's Spring Mobile and Simply Mac concepts, which sell products from AT&T and Apple. Sales from these stores are fast approaching a billion dollars, with more to come in the years ahead. Add it all up, and management is projecting operating earnings growth of 3% to 5% annually from here. The numbers look even better on the bottom line when you consider the effects of share repurchases, as recent history has shown that the company has had success at taking down its share count. GME Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Quarterly) data by YCharts. Believe it or not, even analysts agree that this strategy is going to work. The company is projected to grow its EPS by more than 8% over the next five years. With shares trading for only 8 times trailing earnings and offering up a dividend yield of 4.7%, I can't help but think the shorts have bet against the wrong company. Don't count your chickens before they hatch Tim Green: Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) have surged a mesmerizing 320% over the past year, providing those betting on a turnaround with an incredible gain. The company has already launched the first of its Polaris graphics cards, meant to win back market share from rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), and it plans to release its upcoming Zen CPUs next year. Following years of share losses to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in both the PC CPU and server CPU markets, investors are banking on Zen to right the ship. The first tangible signs of a turnaround surfaced when AMD reported its second-quarter results. The company managed to grow revenue year over year, and while AMD still posted a significant net loss, margins improved. The bull case that has been driving the stock higher over the past year is simple: Polaris and Zen will allow AMD to win back market share from NVIDIA and Intel, heralding in a new era of growth and profitability for the company. The bear case is also simple, especially following the stock's massive gains over the past year: Both Polaris and Zen will face plenty of competition, and significant market share gains are far from guaranteed. NVIDIA has already launched the GTX 1060, a mainstream competitor to AMD's RX 480, and competitive lower-end cards from NVIDIA are likely later this year. And Intel, which has a near monopoly in the server CPU market, outspends AMD on R&D by a factor of 13. It's certainly not impossible for AMD to stage a triumphant comeback, but I think the market is getting way ahead of itself. The market is missing a growth story at this century-old Rust Belt icon John Rosevear: Here are two charts for your consideration. The first shows General Motors' (NYSE:GM) operating profit margin, excluding special items, in every quarter since the beginning of 2014. (Yes, General Motors. Bear with me here, it's a good story.)  Chart shows quarterly EBIT-adjusted profit margin as reported by GM. Data source: General Motors. Second, here's how GM's stock price has performed over the same period. GM data by YCharts. Interesting, no? Full disclosure: I did cheat somewhat by choosing a cherry-picked time period. GM's margin in the first half of 2014 were clobbered by the costs of its ignition-switch recall mess, so the slope of the increase looks particularly dramatic. But I only cheated a little: The trend overall has been upward since GM's first post-IPO quarter in 2012, when its margin was around 5.8%. In fact, last quarter's 9.3% margin was a record. It's not a fluke, either: CEO Mary Barra is driving a series of long-term initiatives (learn more about them here) that are intended to put GM's margin into the 9% to 10% range sustainably by early next decade. There may well turn out to be a sizable increase in revenue (and therefore profits) along the way, too.  Image source: GM. It's true that GM was the poster child of the bad old days of Detroit. But that GM is long gone: Over the last few years, GM's quality ratings have skyrocketed, it has emerged as a leader in electric cars and self-driving technology, and it has become much more shareholder-friendly. What do I mean? Old GM talked about market share and its long-gone glory days as the world's largest-selling automaker, while ignoring the advances made by its rivals. Barra and her team talk about return on invested capital, about returning excess cash to shareholders, about out-disrupting Silicon Valley, and about becoming the world's most profitable automaker. It's a great story that much of Wall Street seems to be overlooking. The upshot is that right now, GM is dirt cheap: It's trading at just 4 times trailing-12-month earnings, with a dividend yield of almost 4.7%. (Read why that dividend is probably sustainable through a recession.)  Investors are worried about a near-term slowdown in the U.S. new-car market, but GM's longer-term prospects are very bright. For a patient investor, this one's worth a close look.  Brian Feroldi owns shares of Apple. Like this article?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 19, 2016 at 5:23PM Intel's new chip-development methodology. Image credit: Intel.  Last year, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) released products based on its Skylake architecture for desktop systems. Skylake represented a brand-new architecture manufactured in the company's then-new 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. Although the lineup of Skylake-based desktop processors consisted of a wide range of products, perhaps the two most interesting parts were the Core i5-6600K and Core i7-6700K, targeted at gaming PCs -- a sub-segment of the PC market that, according to Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, "continues to grow at a double-digit rate." According to a leak via Chinese website coolaler.com, the company's gaming-PC-oriented processors based on its upcoming Kaby Lake architecture should pack quite a punch. Solid boost in clock frequencies The prior-generation 6600K ran at a base frequency of 3.5GHz and a maximum turbo frequency of 3.9GHz. The higher-end 6700K came at 4GHz base and a maximum turbo speed of 4.2GHz. The 6700K wound up faster than the 22-nanometer Core i7-4790K that it replaced as a result of greater performance per clock (that is, the new chip family can do more work at a given frequency than the prior-generation one). However, it's worth noting that the 4790K actually ran at 4.2GHz base and 4.4GHz turbo -- slightly higher frequencies than the newer 6700K chip. Per the leak from coolaler.com, the upcoming 7700K, based on Kaby Lake, will run at a 4.2 GHz base frequency and manage to hit a 4.5GHz maximum turbo speed out of the box. This means that performance, assuming that performance per clock doesn't change, should move up by at least 5%. Additionally, if Intel is able to hit 4.5GHz maximum turbo on a single core out of the box on the top Kaby Lake desktop part, the new chips may also have more headroom than the prior generation in terms of overclocking capability (overclocking is the process by which the user adjusts the chip speed to run at higher levels than what the chip is rated at out of the box). Enabled by Intel's enhanced 14-nanometer process? Earlier this week, Intel talked about the performance enhancements that it's bringing to the table with its second-generation 14-nanometer manufacturing technology, known as 14-nanometer+. According to the company, 14-nanometer+ has 12% better performance than its first-generation 14-nanometer technology. Based on the speed boosts we're seeing here with Kaby Lake, it would appear that the frequency gains are related primarily to the enhanced chip-manufacturing technology. Desktop Kaby Lake looks like a winner Although it would have been nice to see Intel improve the underlying CPU architecture of Kaby Lake to wring even more performance enhancements out of the chip (Intel probably didn't have enough time to do this given that Kaby Lake was added sort of at the proverbial last minute), Kaby Lake looks like a solid successor to the current-generation Skylake chips. I doubt that many owners of the 6600K/6700K chips will rush out and buy systems based on the new Kaby Lake chips, but for owners of older platforms who may have skipped out on Skylake in pursuit of something better, Kaby Lake might just be the ticket.

Wendy Lemeric |Tuesday, August 23 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (Microsoft.com)Surface Book 2 is rumored to release in late 2016 or early 2017. The Surface Book 2 is said to be one of the products that Microsoft will introduce soon but the release date has yet to be determined. Reports suggest that the new laptop might be available by the end of 2016 or early 2017. This release period will somehow depend on the availability of its processor and operating system. It has been rumored for quite some time that Microsoft will carry the latest chipset offering from Intel, the Kaby Lake processor. Kaby Lake is expected to be available later this year, and if rumors prove to be true, it is highly likely that the Surface Book 2 will be available around the same time with the chipset on board. Given that the laptop will run on a Kaby Lake chipset, it could come with 4K and 3D graphics support. There is also the possibility that Microsoft will release the device in 2017. The Surface Book 2 is said to carry the Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system and this update will reportedly be available in spring next year. PC-Tablet also reported that the Surface Book 2 will have a Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 graphics processing unit (GPU). This GPU supports Intel Realsense camera, USB Type-C connection and Thunderbolt 3. All these features should contribute to faster data transfers. When it comes to design, the new laptop is likely to be thinner compared to its predecessor. There was even a mention that the device will come with a full-metal unibody. A better and more efficient battery pack is also expected. There's also a lot of talk on the hinge mechanism of the device, which is rumored to get a significant revamp so it will not leave an awkward gap once the laptop is closed. There seems to be a lot of rumors and speculations regarding Surface Book 2. Avid Microsoft fans should note though that the company hasn't confirmed any of them yet. With that said, all reports should be taken with a grain of salt until Microsoft gives out the official news.

HP Inc. looks to prove it's not all about growth MarketWatch 8/21/2016 By Don Clark Growth has always been golden in Silicon Valley, and HP Inc. hopes to prove it isn't the only definition of success. Quotes in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.39 -0.74 -1.20% Intel Corp INTC ▼ 35.14 -0.34 -0.96% International Business Machines Corp IBM ▼ 161.92 -0.75 -0.46% Lenovo Group Ltd LNVGF ▲ 0.6254 +0.0267 +4.45% Analysts expect the former Hewlett-Packard Co. printing-and-personal-computer business to continue a recent pattern of revenue declines when it reports quarterly financial results on Wednesday, the latest evidence of waning demand for those products. Yet HP's shares are up 22% on the year, outpacing the broader stock market and other mature tech companies such as Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. HP's stock-market cachet is linked to its generation of cash, which has fueled outsize dividends and the potential of share buybacks that could further boost its stock price. Highlighting those attributes for investors was one motivation for separating the company from the more growth-oriented entity now known as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., said Dion Weisler, HP's chief executive, in a recent interview. The original HP, a technology pioneer founded in 1939, had developed finely tuned practices to monitor sales and profit, said Cathie Lesjak, HP's CFO. Putting equal attention to the balance sheet and cash flow "is new muscle for almost everybody in the company," she said. Not that Mr. Weisler isn't laying plans to get HP growing again. But he said the company's business creates financial breathing room to place bets that may take years to pay off. HP, the second-largest PC maker behind Lenovo Group Ltd., gets most of its revenue from sales of those products. That market has been shrinking, but cash flow from the business remains very strong, Mr. Weisler said. One reason is that HP takes in revenue from customers significantly faster than it pays suppliers of components to build the systems it sells, he said. More than half of HP's profit comes from printing, primarily sales of ink and toner that generates a steady flow of cash. The dynamics have enabled HP to pledge to investors that it will return 50% to 75% of its free cash flow -- the amount remaining after capital expenditures -- to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. The company has estimated it will generate $2 billion to $2.3 billion in free cash flow for the fiscal year ending in October. Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note that HP's current 12.4 cent quarterly dividend amounts to about 30% of free cash flow, so could be increased. Mr. Sacconaghi said HP's 3.4% dividend yield is already among the highest of publicly held companies. Still, shrinking revenue remains an issue, particularly for HP's printing business. Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS Securities, predicts HP will report a 15% third-quarter decline in revenue from its supplies business compared with the year-earlier period, with printer sales down 9%. In all, he expects quarterly revenue to fall 8% to $11.4 billion and net income to drop 23%. Mr. Weisler hopes to spur growth by building a franchise beyond desktop-oriented inkjet and laser printers toward the bigger copying and printing systems that serve entire departments. In a longer-term bet, the company has announced plans to enter the newer market for 3-D printers. In PCs, Mr. Weisler said, HP plans to focus on growing, profitable segments such as high-end gaming systems and premium laptops while avoiding low-margin, me-too products such as low-end tablets. Some progress emerged in the second quarter. Market researcher International Data Corp. in July estimated HP's global quarterly shipments rose 5.1%, despite a 4.5% drop in the total market. In the U.S., shipments rose 11.5%, IDC said. "I'm interested in growth," Mr. Weisler said. "But I'm much more interested in profitable growth."

August Has Been A Super Exciting Month So Far For Linux / Open-Source Users Written by Michael Larabel in Free Software on 21 August 2016 at 09:52 AM EDT. 5 Comments Just over half-way through August, it's been a particularly exciting month for Linux and open-source fans. From Microsoft bringing PowerShell to Linux, Google working on a new operating system, AMD making open-source driver progress, Fedora 25 going ahead with Wayland by default, and more, there's been excitement for almost everyone this month. Given everything exciting that's been happening this month, I decided to do a quick recap of the most-viewed news so far on Phoronix this month, in case you've been out enjoying the summer and are behind on your reading. So far this month on Phoronix there have been 153 original news articles and the 12 most viewed include: Btrfs RAID 5/6 Code Found To Be Very Unsafe & Will Likely Require A Rewrite It turns out the RAID5 and RAID6 code for the Btrfs file-system's built-in RAID support is faulty and users should not be making use of it if you care about your data. Google Working On New "Fuchsia" Operating System, Powered By Magenta / LK Kernel Google appears to be working on a new operating system that's written from scratch and appears to be target both phones and PCs, among other form factors. Linux 4.7 - Btrfs vs. EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. XFS vs. NTFS Benchmarks Continuing on from yesterday's Linux 4.4 To 4.7 - EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. Btrfs Benchmarks comparison, here is a wider look at mainline file-systems on the Linux 4.7. File-systems tested on the NVMe SSD included Btrfs, EXT4, F2FS, XFS, and NTFS. Secure Boot Isn't So Secure After All: The Golden Key Is Out So much for Secure Boot being so secure... After a mistake by Microsoft, the "golden key" is now out in the wild. Systemd Rolls Out Its Own Mount Tool Systemd-mount is the newest tool added to systemd by Lennart Poettering. CryENGINE Is Planning To Deliver Its Vulkan Support In About Two Months The middle of October is when Crytek should be publicly rolling out their Vulkan API support in the CryENGINE. BioShock Infinite Can Run More Than 23% Faster With New RadeonSI Patches Marek Olšák at AMD continues optimizing the RadeonSI Gallium3D driver for offering much better Linux gaming performance when using this open-source AMD graphics driver code. The latest are double-digit gains for at least the BioShock Infinite game. The Speed Of Ubuntu 16.10 Currently Versus Ubuntu 16.04, Clear Linux Being mid-way through Ubuntu 16.10's development cycle, here are some fresh benchmarks showing how its performance has changed (if at all) compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as well as compared to Intel's high-performance Clear Linux distribution as a reference point. Fedora 25 To Run Wayland By Default The Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee has decided that Fedora 25 will indeed ship the Wayland display server by default in place of the X.Org Server. Reboot Mode Driver Added To Linux 4.8 Kernel The power supply updates for Linux 4.8 adds a "reboot mode" driver to the kernel. Lumina Desktop 1.0 Released The PC-BSD/TrueOS developers have announced the release of the Lumina Desktop Environment 1.0. XFS Reverse-Mapping Proposed For Linux 4.8: Getting Ready For New File-System Features Last week was the main XFS feature pull for Linux 4.8 while one day before the 4.8 merge window is expected to close, XFS maintainer Dave Chinner is hoping to land a big new feature. The most popular featured articles include: 18-Way GPU Linux Benchmarks, Including The Radeon RX 460 & RX 470 On Open-Source Yesterday I published early open-source benchmarks of the Radeon RX 470 while today is a full 18-way graphics card comparison including the newly-launched Radeon RX 460 and Radeon RX 470 graphics cards alongside the RX 480 Polaris graphics card. All of the AMD graphics cards tested for this article were running the very latest open-source driver stack on the Linux 4.8 kernel and Mesa 12.1-dev Git. Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 vs. Ubuntu Bash On Windows 10 Anniversary Performance When Microsoft and Canonical brought Bash and Ubuntu's user-space to Windows 10 earlier this year I ran some preliminary benchmarks of Ubuntu on Windows 10 versus a native Ubuntu installation on the same hardware. Now that this "Windows Subsystem for Linux" is part of the recent Windows 10 Anniversary Update, I've carried out some fresh benchmarks of Ubuntu running atop Windows 10 compared to Ubuntu running bare metal. Linux 4.4 To 4.7 - EXT4 vs. F2FS vs. Btrfs Benchmarks I've been a bit behind on my file-system benchmarking the past few months but for your viewing pleasure today are some EXT4 vs. Btrfs vs. F2FS file-system tests on an NVMe SSD when testing the Linux 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 kernels. Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu + Linux 4.7 + Mesa 12.1 Intel OpenGL Tests With Microsoft having recently released the Windows 10 Anniversary update I've been running some fresh Windows vs. Linux performance comparisons. The first of these comparisons for your viewing pleasure is looking at the latest Windows 10 build with the latest Intel driver compared to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS while also comparing the performance when manually upgrading to the Linux 4.7 kernel and Mesa 12.1-dev for delivering the latest OpenGL performance potential. Early Benchmarks Of FreeBSD 11.0 vs. DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Distributions Following last week's DragonFlyBSD 4.6 benchmarks I carried out a fresh comparison of FreeBSD 10.3 vs. FreeBSD 11.0 (Beta 4 at the time) along with the DragonFlyBSD results and a few of the popular Linux distributions. Here are those numbers. AMDGPU-PRO Radeon RX 460/470/480 vs. NVIDIA Linux GPU Benchmarks Last week I published an 18-way GPU Linux comparison featuring the new Radeon RX 460 and RX 470 graphics cards along with other AMD Radeon and NVIDIA GeForce GPUs. The Radeon tests were done using the very latest open-source Linux driver stack while in this article are similar benchmarks done but using the AMDGPU-PRO hybrid driver stack. The Many Exciting Features To The Linux 4.8 Kernel Today marks the closure of the Linux 4.8 kernel merge window so as usual here is our recap of all the features we've been monitoring over the past two weeks. Among the highlights for Linux 4.8 are AMD GPU OverDrive overclocking, initial NVIDIA Pascal support, a new ARM Mali display driver, mainline support for the Raspberry Pi 3 BCM SoC, HDMI CEC support, big reworks to Btrfs and XFS file-system code, and a number of new security features, among other changes. DragonFlyBSD 4.6 vs. Linux Benchmarks With DragonFlyBSD 4.6 having been released this week, here are benchmarks comparing its performance to that of the previous DragonFlyBSD 4.4 release as well as seeing how it compares to some Linux distributions. 4-Disk Btrfs RAID Benchmarks On Linux 4.7 Going along with the recent Linux 4.7 file-system benchmarks, here are some tests of Btrfs' built-in RAID functionality when tested on the Linux 4.7 kernel across four SATA SSDs. AMDGPU-PRO vs. Open-Source Gallium3D OpenGL Performance On Polaris Is A Very Tight Race For those wondering how AMD's hybrid "AMDGPU-PRO" Linux driver stack compares to the latest pure open-source driver stack of the AMDGPU kernel driver and RadeonSI Gallium3D driver, here are side-by-side results for the Radeon RX 460, RX 470, and RX 480 Polaris hardware as well as the R9 Fury (Fiji) graphics card. What else do you hope will happen before the month ends as further excitement for the Linux/open-source communities?

The building’s uncanny brutalist architecture only added to the nostalgia of a two years adventure coming to an end: Then… A wild Kat strong-armed me into preparing an "unconference" talk for this year's #GUADEC after all… — Jeff (@nekohayo) August 10, 2016 And so I made a new talk proposal at the last minute, which was upvoted fairly quickly by attendees: The conference organizers counter-trolled me by inscribing it exactly like this onto the giant public schedule in the venue’s lobby: The result was this talk: Laptops & Tablets Manufactured to Run a Pure GNOME. Go watch it now if you missed it. Note: during the talk’s Q&A session, I mistakenly thought that Purism‘s tablets were using an ARM architecture; they’re actually planned to be Intel-based. And to make things clear, for laptop keyboard layouts, Purism is currently offering US/UK, which are different physical layouts (different cutting etc.). Also relevant to your interests if you’re into that whole privacy thing: Cosimo’s unconference session about the earmarked privacy funds Federico’s talk about our, ahem, suboptimal key management UX in GNOME. Stef Walters pointed out during this talk’s Q&A (and to me personally when I discussed with him on the previous day) that he’d be glad to review & merge patches, but does not currently have enough time to maintain Seahorse otherwise. Interested in improving security for our PGP, SSH and geeral keys management in GNOME? Check out Seahorse and start polishing that code! Werner Koch’s keynote: We want more centralization, do we? Alexander Larsson’s Flatpak status update and future plans In my luggage, I carried ~20 kilograms of the Foundation’s annual reports. Some folks were skeptical and thought I should “only bring a few of them, people aren’t usually interested in the annual report.” Well, they were dead wrong: within one afternoon, the annual reports “sold out” like hotcakes. See also my tandem lightning talk (at the 29mins mark) to get a glimpse of how much work we put into designing the new annual report this year. Also, if you took one of them at the conference, remember: they’re precious little works of art and a powerful tool to convince people to become contributors or sponsors to support GNOME, so make sure to use them towards that goal! I was very happy to see Mathieu and Alexandru from the Pitivi team deciding to attend at the last minute, even if it was just for one day. We spent time with Jakub Steiner discussing his workflow and wishlist for a “perfect” video editor: Pitivi makes people smile! Left to right: Alexandru Băluț, Jakub “Skywalker” Steiner, Mathieu Duponchelle. I took a handful of photos of the BoFs and uploaded them to my gallery for GUADEC 2016. Licensed under the Creative Commons “by attribution” 4.0 as usual, so that the GNOME Engagement team can use them for GNOME promotional materials if needed. Make sure you do the same and list yours in here. The Flatpak BoF session Overall, this GUADEC was one of the most well-organized ones I’ve seen in years. I was floored by the amount of efforts and planning the local team put into this. They really deserve some kudos! Everything ran smoothly on the surface (I know that in such events there will always be odd situations happening here and there, but they dealt with them so efficiently that they were invisible). The team had a professional-grade two-way radio system to coordinate, a car and trailer to carry stuff around every day, made and reused food (pro-grade cafeteria counter metal containers = genius), a lifetime supply of IKEA mugs that got washed and reused frequently, tons of snacks, managed to pull in great sponsors even at the last minute, put signage in various parts of the city to guide people to the venue, had huge quantities of tasty dead animals (and plants) to eat at a very successful barbecue event, got an icecream vendor to come to the venue, and even filled up a pool and beanbags, for pete’s sake! Spotted at #GUADEC2016: @GNOME developers hard at work! Only missing some piñas coladas 😜 pic.twitter.com/xx0dEO53IJ — Jeff (@nekohayo) August 13, 2016 Thanks to the the Chaos Computer Club for providing a flawless live video streaming, recording and publishing service. Very rarely did we have GUADEC videos published in a timely fashion in the past, let alone streamed live and with proper laptop video output capture as well as proper sound mixing. This is fantastic. I should mention the closing night’s event in the biergarten, with sponsored drinks and food by our friendly GStreamer experts Centricular, a very nice gesture that was well appreciated by everyone. Survivors at rest in the snacks bunker on the last day of the BoFs Thanks to everybody involved to make this event a success, and thanks to the GNOME Foundation for making it possible for me to attend.

Seit dem Verkaufsstart hat Hello Games drei Patches bereitgestellt und in der Zwischenzeit wurden auch die Patch-Notes angeschoben. Laut den Entwicklern sollen die drei Patches ungefähr 70 Prozent der Probleme, die dem Support gemeldet wurden, aus der Welt schaffen. Der erste Patch war dafür gedacht, eine größere Hardware-Bandbreite (u.a. AMD Phenom Unterstützung) abzudecken und die Performance allgemein zu optimieren. Der zweite Patch soll Bugs und Absturzursachen beheben sowie dafür sorgen, dass die Speicherstände in Zukunft "sicher" seien. Das dritte Update dreht sich ebenfalls um Absturzprobleme und die Korrektur von beschädigten Speicherständen. Ein vierter Patch befindet sich in Entwicklung und soll ab Montag getestet werden. Erst wenn die bekannten Probleme behoben wurden, sollen dann neue Features hinzugefügt werden. Patch 1 The focus of patch 1 was to add greater support for more hardware. Either specific hardware configs, or hardware outside our min spec. We want as many people to be able to play as possible, and these were our most reported issues. AMD Phenom Support Game is now confirmed working on Phenom CPUs. Thousands of lines of assembly have been rewritten to support AMD CPUs. The game code no longer relies on anything above SSE 2, Havok Physics has also now created new libs for us to add Phenom support. Alt-Tab has improved Some systems/configs were crashing or not pausing correctly on Alt Tab. This should now be resolved. Improved Performance On CPUs with 4 threads or fewer, performance has been improved. On CPUs with exactly 8 threads, performance has also been significantly improved. Framerate Stuttering due to Shader Caching Framerate was initially stuttering due to shaders not being correctly cached by the GPU on some systems. We have replaced the GPU caching system. You may notice some stutter during the Galactic Map intro to the game (the very first time you run), but it should be smoother from then on. This is particularly true on ATI cards. Max FPS Cap On some CPU/GPU configurations, setting Max FPS to 60 or 30 was not giving 60 or 30 FPS (causing stuttering). This has been fixed. Radeon 6xxx Added support for this GPU, which doesn't support OpenGL 4.5 fully. Save Corruption Solution to try to prevent saves getting corrupted no matter what’s going on in background processes (see Patch 3 below, where we also are attempting to recover corrupted saves). Intel GPU Detection We do not currently support Intel GPUS. We are working on this for a future patch, to expand our min spec. In the meantime, the game will now let you know if you are trying to run with an unsupported GPU. This will hopefully flag for some users that their high end GPU has not been selected. Gsync Gsync has been disabled by default, which was causing an issue for some users Mouse Smoothing Generally this is most helpful for players with sub-30 FPS. Smoothing on mouse movement has been improved to prevent hitching or stuttering, and is now adjustable through the Options menu in “Mouse Smoothing”. It defaults to off. If you feel micro stutters in framerate affecting controls, feel free to turn this up. If you feel the framerate is "slow" or "lumpy", please make sure that this is turned off Patch 2 For patch 2 our focus was on the most reported bugs or crashes. Our aim was to improve stability, and make sure player’s saves are safe in future. Stuck under the world It was possible for players to save their game stuck under the terrain, leaving them stuck. This was caused by getting shot down in atmosphere, and their ship reaching ridiculous speeds as it crashed to the planet. This has been resolved. Whilst it won't happen anymore, if you are currently already stuck under the world, we detect this and do our best to rescue you. Crash after warping Occasionally at random the game would lock up after a warp, or return to desktop. This was due to very specific timing in hardware (a threading specific bug) – meaning that unfortunately for some people it was regular, and for others they would never be able to recreate it. This was our most reported crash during gameplay, and has now been resolved. Game failing to save until you died If the player died, and then loaded the game ten times without saving, and then died, player progress wouldn’t be saved from then on until you died again. This is fixed now! This was also causing player’s saves to grow in size. Crash fixes in scanning Quite a rare crash, but in certain scenarios it was possible to scan from space or on planet and crash the game. Crash warping inside a freighter When warping into a battle sometimes the player warped into the inside of a freighter and everything went crazy :( This is fixed now. Patch 3 Patch 3 is targeted at our next most common support requests, fixing the next most common crashes, as well as trying to help players who have become stranded or have corrupted their save files. Stranded in Space Station If you died in your ship while in atmosphere of a planet with a damaged ship, you could respawn in a space station with your launch thrusters and pulse engine damaged. If you did not have the resources to fix them then you could no longer take off and be stuck there. This will no longer happen. Loading Corrupted Save Files Some players have corrupted save files, we’ve been working with them to still load saves even if they are corrupted (this can happen for many reasons outside of the games control). This fix has allowed many players to still load their save even if they have become corrupt on PC. Crash fixes for next three most commonly reported issues: - As the player gathers a huge amount of discoveries, there was a threading issue that becomes more prevalent the more discoveries you have, and could cause the game to crash. - If you had collected a large number of blueprints, in a specific order it was possible to crash the game when you received a new blueprint. This has been fixed.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Surface Pro 5, Surface Book 2 release date, specs: seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor included? Noriel See Aug 22, 2016 9:09 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Microsoft)A promotional image of Microsoft's Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, and Surface 3 As of the moment, Microsoft has yet to confirm or deny that they are working on the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Book 2, but that did not stop the rumors concerning their specs from popping up. Several reports say that the Surface Pro 5 will feature either Intel's sixth or seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor, a USB Type-C port, and a new improved battery. There are also rumors that the high-end tablet/laptop hybrid will come with a 2K screen. However, a model that supports 4K graphics will also be available. Its memory will also be upgradable up to 16 gigabytes (GB) of random access memory (RAM). The other components that will be upgraded include the phone camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the Surface Pen, which will contain a rechargeable battery that charges wirelessly. Like the Surface Pro 5, sources say that the Surface Book 2 will also use the seventh-generation Kaby Lake processor, which will support 3D and 4K, as well as virtual reality displays. The device will also have 16 GB of RAM, up to 1 terabyte of internal storage capacity, USB Type-C port connectors, as well as ThunderBolt 3 ports. It is possible that the Surface devices will be released with the Windows 10 Redstone 2 operating system. The devices are expected to be priced in the $900 to $1500 range. It was speculated that the Surface devices might be released at the same time as Windows 10's second major update in Spring 2017. News of Microsoft's plans for their Surface Pro and Surface Book lines intensified when a developer named Shubhan Chemburkar posted a photo of a wall in Microsoft's building 88. @bdsams see here pic.twitter.com/Tri8HDI1w5— Shubhan Chemburkar (@shubhan3009) July 3, 2016 The photo shows a Surface placeholder with the words "2016" and "coming soon." There are also three devices which say "2017" on them. Besides the rumored Surface Phone, Microsoft seems to be planning the next versions of the Surface Book and Surface Pro for next year.

The sale is for a limited time only and ends on Saturday, Aug. 20.  ( Microsoft ) Advertisement Best Buy is offering the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and a Type Cover at a discount of $280. The online retailer has started a 50-hour sale that lasts from Thursday, Aug. 18 at 10 p.m. CT to Saturday, Aug, 20 at 11:59 p.m CT. The latest sale is offering a number of products, including the Surface Pro 4, at discounted prices. "When you buy this Surface Pro 4 along with a Type Cover below, you can save $280 total. The Type Cover features well-spaced, backlit keys so you can type comfortably. It doubles as a protective shield for the screen. Choose from five colors. Plus, get free shipping," says Best Buy. The retailer is offering the base model of the Surface Pro 4 that has 128 GB on-board storage and 4 GB of RAM, and is running on Intel Core m3 processor. As part of the bundle, customers have to pick a Type Cover that comes in five different colors: teal, black, blue, bright blue and red. The original price of the tablet is $899.99 and the Type Cover, $129.99. When combined they have a total value of $1029.98. Luckily as part of the 50-hour sale, customers will get $280 off, bringing down the cost of the bundle to $749.98. The discount will appear only once the two products are added to the cart. Best Buy notes that the offer is not available in-store and cannot be combined with the College Student Deals, which offer up to $150 off on select Surface Pro tablets. The deal should be very attractive to customers looking to buy a new Microsoft tablet as the base model of the Surface Pro 4 is available from the company's own website for $749, excluding the Type Cover. Microsoft launched and released the Surface Pro 4 in October 2015 as the fourth-gen two-in-one detachable tablet in the company's Surface Pro line. Best Buy's discount could be taken as an indication that Microsoft is planning to unveil the next-gen Surface Pro 5 soon and wants to get rid of its Surface Pro 4 stock. However, previous rumors suggest that the Surface Pro 5's launch has been delayed because Intel will launch the Kaby Lake processor — expected to power the next Surface Pro tablets — toward the end of this year. Since Microsoft released the first-gen Surface Pro tablet in February 2013, the company may opt for a February release for the Surface Pro 5 as well. The Surface Pro 4 remains one of the most powerful detachable tablets currently available in the market, so the latest deal from Best Buy is worth a shot for those who want to purchase a new tablet.

Toggle navigation James Altucher About Books Podcast Appearances Altucher Report Free Updates I Made a Mistake Here’s what happened… I bought too many books…. Usually that’s a good thing. This time it wasn’t. I bought over 1,000 copies of two of my favorite books ever written. It was an accident, but now I want you to profit off of my mistake. First I’m going to tell you what the two books are. Second, I’m going to tell you how I’m going to give you these two books for cheaper than you can find them anywhere else (plus I’m going to throw in some extras). Bold  In 2000 I read “The Tipping Point” by Malcolm Gladwell like everyone else did and put it nice and neat on my bookshelf so anyone walking into my office could see it. I didn’t understand it. I kept asking myself: OK, he shows all of these ‘tipping points’ when a business suddenly breaks out and everyone is buying their products. But he doesn’t show us how a technique to get to a tipping point. He doesn’t show how to predict a tipping point, or any way at all to benefit from one. He did this all in “Blink” also. I just didn’t get it. But finally in “Bold” I got it. They basically tell you how to determine what industries are going to hit a tipping point and almost exactly the day it will happen. I don’t know if that was there intent but when they came on my podcast we discussed it. They talk about industries that have exponential growth that can almost be explained by a formula. Like the famous “Moore’s Law” named after the former CEO of Intel in 1965 when he said that (more or less) that computing power would double every year. This is sort of like the story of the history of chess. A man in India taught the king a game he invented: chess. The king was so happy he said, “Ask for anything you want and I will give it to you! The man pointed to the chessboard and said, “I just want a piece of wheat on the first square, two pieces of wheat on the second square, four on the third, and double on each square until square 64. ” The king thought the man was a fool. He put a single stalk of wheat on the first square. And then kept doubling. By the time he was about halfway through the board, he had to put his entire kingdom on the square. So what did he do? He killed the man. Back then there were simple solutions to hard problems. The authors of Bold define the “6 Ds” that help you if an industry is about to turn exponential (in other words, they are about to go from the tiny tiny sizes to exponentially large sizes) and they discuss which specific industries are on their radar. They talk about 3D Printing, Robotics, Sensors, and so on…. Fascinating book. And then… The Essays of Warren Buffett There are a lot of books out there about investor Warren Buffett (including one that I wrote in 2005) and I can tell you this: Almost all of them suck. Most books go on and on about how Buffett is a value investor (he’s not) and what value investing means (almost all of the descriptions are wrong). I don’t know what purpose these books serve, other than to maybe help the authors raise money for their own funds (“Oh, investing with him is like investing with Warren Buffett!” It’s not.) or sell more books (“Warren Buffett is always hot,” my then-editor told me before my book had practically no sales). But, I do have to say, this is the one book I would buy about Warren Buffett (over my own). Author Lawrence Cunningham delivers the real goods on Buffett and the work that has gone into his mind-blowing success. Not in terms of a biography of the man (who cares) but in terms of his collected wisdom about corporate America. The book is a curated collection of the almost 50 letters that Warren Buffett has sent to shareholders of his company, Berkshire Hathaway. These letters are rarely about investing. They are about business. Many people ask, “What stock should I buy?” or “What stock is going to go up in the next two months so I can make some money?” Warren Buffett doesn’t ask that. He asks, “What business is likely to be here 20 years from now? Because if it will still be around then, it’s probably a good investment now.” And then Buffett gives case study after case study on both his successes and his many failures and how he judges whether a business is good or not. Warren Buffett has been working about 10 hours a day since the early 1950s, learning how to effectively value and understand businesses. That’s about 5,000 hours a year for 60 years. Buffett has put in his 10,000 hours… times three! What better person to learn from than someone who dedicated 60 years of his life to becoming the best businessman in the world? Cunningham scoured all of Buffett’s writings and pulled the most salient pieces out to compile this book of essays. So we get an expert curation on the entirety Buffett’s business and investing philosophies. It’s a great book if you want to be better at your own investments and your own approach to life. And for the next few days I’ll give you something you can’t buy anywhere. Even the best mentors can only take you so far… You HAVE to become an “idea machine”.  Here’s how I do it (and what I’ll give you to help you do it too). Come up with 10 ideas a day.  Everyday.  I carry a waiters pad with me everywhere I go.  I make lists, I create new ideas. I can’t tell you if you should too, but I can tell you it’s saved my life over and over again.  If you want to try I’ll send you the same kind of waiters pad I use as part of this “Quickstart” gift bundle. Write.  I’ll also send you a “Choose Yourself” pen…  I mean, you’ve got to write your ideas down with something. Listen.  I spent a few weeks creating a CD with some of my best podcasts.  This is a highlight reel that shares some of the toughest questions I’ve asked or answered.  Plus in-depth interviews with people who will challenge your view on the world.  These people helped me grow. They’ll help you too. Note:  these gifts are only available with this special gift set. So here’s where you get to take advantage of my mistake. Say “yes” to this offer and I’ll send you all of this today. 1NedSprockethead1 Times thirty. x32 I’d agree with you (and James) here if 10h a day wouldn’t be 10h x 6d (in hope that Mr. Buffett has one day off) x 52w = 3120h per year. I think a bit of excitement is understandable when someone talks about Mr. Buffett ))) Thanks to James for pointing to “The Essays of Warren Buffett”. Charles Boisseau Great stuff. The message is harmed a little by the sloppiness and incorrect grammar, such as the usage of “there” (it’s “their”) and the irritating way you put periods outside of closing quote marks. (They go inside.) Moore’s Law refers to computing power doubling not every 12 months, but 18 months. Clean this up please. I so love your messages. You might consider hiring an editor like myself. Grammar Policia … like me. Not like myself. Try it this way: You might consider hiring me. Or, You might consider hiring myself. Hmmmm. Charles Boisseau No, silly. The way I wrote it is accurate and works for this. BTW, I’m not asking him to hire me. Hire an outstanding editor — like myself. Jaye Agree. This it true of all of James’ posts, though. All of his posts, newsletters, and yes, even books are full of grammatical and spelling errors. He chooses not to employ even a proofreader, much less an editor. Not sure why that is, but I have my guesses. ;-) Pamela Ravenwood Great offer. Why is there always that jerk who feels it their job to be the grammar police? They didn’t get the memo that it’s actually more annoying to be corrected than to Se a simple misspelling. 😏 Grammar Policia It’s actually not more annoying than seeing professional writers make careless mistakes. Would you correct your surgeon if he/she tried to use a screwdriver instead of a scalpel? I love James’ writing, but the punctuation outside the quotes is maddening and distracting. Charles Boisseau Yes, I’d correct them just as you sought to correct me. Since you are doing the grammar policing thing, consider putting all your corrections in a comment to James, rather than waste your time correcting commenters’ comments, and perhaps you’ll get his attention. The errors take away from his message and, as they say these days, “brand.” Charles Boisseau Oh, a personal attack and name-calling. There’s annoying for you. terre I’m pretty sure James could not care less about the grammar police, or your defense of him. He might be amused by your unintelligible post, however. kdsays I love this post!! Absolutely hilarious. I am going to BUY your BOOK!! Jaye This guy, like everyone else publishing this sort of blah blah blah, appeals to people who are not happy with their lives and thus need someone to say, “Hey – choose yourself – change your life – act now and you too can own only 15 things and be a millionaire”. It’s a sad society we live in, but it’s one in which the newcomers don’t want to work, so they’re enamored by the idea of sitting around all day in coffee shops writing ideas down on waiter’s pads and becoming millionaires. James is taking advantage of this time in history. I say good for him! “I Choose Me!” is the great mantra of this narcissistic generation and he’s capitalizing on it. I must admit – that was one great idea he wrote down on his waiter’s pad! More power to him. To everyone else, stop reading and start doing. Get out there and make this world a better place every day. Just a little better, every day. Care. Care about more than yourself. (Yes, you need to care about yourself – I’m saying care about MORE than ONLY yourself.) Go out and create a beautiful day – for yourself AND for someone else (or many others!) Will Roche James I was sent to this article from an automated email you sent me. Why don’t you write a book about how to sell a book? Having written a book this year I clearly understand how hard it is to get any sales volume. You sold 600,000 copies of one of you books about life. Why and how? I agree that there are way too many books out there and not enough people reading these days. Might I suggest having that marketing machine you have built is a big swinger? https://www.amazon.com/Frank-Wilson-Twelve-Apostles-Beginning/dp/1530170095/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr= Fernando I’m not finding the book BOLD.

So much so, that AMD stock has increased by a massive 330% in the last year, rising another 8% today on the back of the positive news of Zen from IDF 2016.     AMD has had a few years of financial grief, but it looks like the company is getting past this, returning to profitability in Q2 and should hopefully continue that with the sales of the Radeon RX 480, RX 470 and RX 460 throughout the rest of 2016, and into 2017. But the last week has been all about Zen, AMD's next-gen CPU architecture, which has been impressing us for quite a while now. AMD's new Zen architecture looks to have the company on an even playing field with Intel once again, who has had a monopoly on the market for what feels like forever.   Zen won't see the light of day for consumers and gamers until early 2017, but it will be delivering a 40% improvement of IPC (Instructions Per Clock), which is beyond impressive for something that has probably only reached testing phases now. AMD will continue to improve its Zen craft, with next-gen motherboards also featuring new connectivity like M.2 SSD support, USB Type-C and support for the likes of DDR4 RAM, and more.     Looking deeper into AMD's financials over the years, here we have a 5-year look at AMD stock. You can see that it really did bottom out throughout 2015, even after the launch of their exciting HBM1-powered Radeon R9 Fury X graphics card, powered by the new Fiji architecture. Looking back to 2012, AMD was hitting $8 per share - where the company finds itself today.     Rewinding all the way back to the 80s, we can see that AMD rode quite the wave back in the day - and I remember that wave fondly. In the 90s the company was fighting Intel in multiple races, with the K6 architecture jogging some serious memories for me. AMD was the first to market with a dual-core CPU, something that really did do an Apple and change everything for PC users. I fondly remember building my new AMD Athlon X2 3800+ system at the time, and it blowing my mind that I could do multiple things at once.   You can see that in 2000-2001 the company hit a major high, with close to $100 per share (nearly 10x where they are now) which was before the huge $5.4 billion acquisition of ATI in 2006. Since then, it hasn't quite gotten its footing, but things are turning around with Zen, Polaris, the next-gen Vega architecture and then the GPU architecture after that - Na'vi, will be even better again.   It's a great time to be an AMD fan!

Where the rich and famous shop for audio systems 0 Speakers by Steve Guttenberg August 20, 2016 9:27 AM PDT @AudiophiliacMan Up Next Pokemon Go tracking finally goes live and actually works There's high-end audio, and there's a wholly different strata of high-end audio that even I, the Audiophiliac, rarely come in contact with. I was keenly aware of that fact when I dropped by Rhapsody Music & Cinema, here in NYC. I was warmly greeted by the owner, Bob Visintainer, who showed me around his impressive selection of truly exotic gear from the US, Europe and Asia. Here's but a small sampling of brands sold at Rhapsody: Acoustic Signature, Aurender, Kaiser-Acoustics, Goldmund, Kondo-Audio Note Japan, Magico, Ubiq Audio, and Vitus Audio. These brands may not be known to the general public, but they are the Rolls Royces, Ferraris, and Lamborghinis of the audio world. Rhapsody opened its doors in 2004. Before he started working in audio Visintainer was at Intergraph Corporation in Alabama and later Intel doing sales and marketing, but his fascination with high-end audio dates back decades. Rhapsody's partner in sound and style, the Iliad showroom in NYC.Photo by Rhapsody/Iliad We chatted for a while, but Visintainer was eager to walk a few blocks to check out the Iliad showroom. That space was filled with gorgeous bespoke furniture and art, great stuff indeed, but I didn't at first notice the Goldmund speakers deployed throughout the lavish surroundings! You see, Visintainer also sells "lifestyle" ultra high-end audio systems, working hand in hand with Iliad's designers. The Swiss-made Goldmund speakers can be custom-finished to the buyer's requirements. In-wall Goldmund speakers are also available, anything is possible. I assumed Rhapsody was exclusively a two-channel audiophile oriented enterprise, so I was a little surprised to learn three-quarters of the systems Visintainer sells have video or home theater components. He has customers all over the world, but if they are in the NYC area, Visintainer visits their homes to get a fix on their rooms acoustics. He's a big guy, and has learned over the years how to uncrate 300-pound speakers and 200-pound amplifiers by himself! After spending time at Iliad we returned to the Rhapsody showroom, where I took in the staggering array of audio components. We listened to a pair of Magico S1 Mk II speakers, which sounded great, but then we talked about how customers find Rhapsody: word of mouth, referrals from manufacturers or in the press. Audiophiles seek out the store because it sells components no other NYC area dealers do. For some lines Rhapsody might be the only US dealer. Many customers are wealthy and extremely busy, so they rarely have time to come to the showroom or get involved with selecting their systems. That's also true for the most famous ones, they have aides and assistants that handle that stuff. Visintainer wasn't about to divulge any rock, sports or movie star customers names, he was too discreet for that. I tried to pry a few loose, but he remained mum. Some of those customers even have Iliad design furniture to house the gear. To say I was impressed with the store and Visintainer's expertise and passion for audio would be an understatement. I've visited a lot of audio shops in my time, but nothing compares with Rhapsody Music & Cinema.

[1.9.4]
- Moved snapping from ProgressBar to Slider to prevent snapping when setting the value programmatically.
- Bullet: added btSoftBody#getLinkCount() and btSoftBody#getLink(int), see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4152
- API Change: Wrapping for scene2d's HorizontalGroup and VerticalGroup.
- Fix hiero problem with certain unicode characters. See https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/4202
- Switched to RoboVM fork 2.2.0, fixes incompatibility with Android Gradle plugin and iOS 9.3.4
 Please update your projects as usual. If you use MobiDevelop’s RoboVM fork make sure to update your Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio plugin. It works with iOS 10 devices, but does not work with the Xcode 8 beta just yet. In other news, Multi-OS Engine has been open-sourced by Intel. It’s now being maintained by its originator, Migeran, who previously sold the IP to Intel. We will update to the OSS version in the coming week(s) and do another release.

News Microsoft Surface Devices 2016/2017 Roundup – Surface Pro 5, Surface Phone, Surface Book 2, Surface AiO By Pranav Rastogi - August 20, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Microsoft has strived to improve its much loved hybrid device — the Surface Pro — over the years. And in the end, all the efforts have paid off, as the Surface Pro 4 is undoubtedly one of the most loved hybrid devices on the market today. The Surface Pro 4 offers not just a better experience as a laptop replacement, but also carries a lot of power for demanding tasks. We have seen Microsoft trying to translate the success of the Surface Pro 4 into something for the Surface Book — and although it isn’t as popular a device, it certainly makes one wonder if Microsoft will further expand the Surface lineup. Surface Desktop or Surface All in One A number of reports have suggested that Microsoft wants to introduce a new line of All-in-One systems soon. Although there is no confirmation what these AIOs will look like, it is certain that Microsoft wants to take a bite out of Apple’s share in the pertinent markets. It has been suggested that these AIOs will be unveiled in three sizes. The smallest model will have a full HD (1080p)21-inchh screen. The other available screen sizes will be 24-inch and 17-inch — and both will have 4K support. These AIOs are expected to implement the use of touch input on devices with larger screens, like a desktop. Do note that these devices have not been yet confirmed by Microsoft, and might very well be pulled from the market at the eleventh hour. However, if these devices do debut, they will be ideal for living room environment — which is why they will be a direct competition to Apple Macs. For more details on the Surface desktop, click here. Surface Phone Granted, Windows Phone never really took off the way Microsoft wanted it to, but Microsoft isn’t holding itself back from the smartphone market. Rumors suggest that Microsoft will debut a new Surface Phone soon. The phone is expected to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM. The phone will obviously be running Windows 10. A less likely version of the phone that is also rumored has an Intel Atom processor, and 5GB of RAM. Some leaked images suggest that the phone could come with a 5.5in AMOLED display, and a body crafted out of aluminum and magnesium. Furthermore, the Surface Phone is also rumored to work with Surface Pen and allow seamless integration with Microsoft Continuum. Surface Book 2 and Surface Pro 5 Now coming to the two most anticipated devices. Do note that no radical design improvements are expected in the next iteration of the Surface Pro and the Surface Book. Under the hood improvements in graphics and performance, as well as a new Type Cover are more likely. A number of reports suggest that the Surface Book 2 will come with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors — and this is why the device might be delayed to the beginning of 2017. Further, the Surface Book 2 is also likely to make minor improvements in the hinge design: Microsoft is planning to retain the functionality but change the physical appearance to something that doesn’t leave a gaping whole when the laptop is closed. To read more about Surface Book 2, go to: Will Surface Book 2 be a MacBook Killer?  The Surface Pro 5 and the Surface Book are expected to come with Windows 10 Redstone 2 update. Since that update is likely to happen in 2017, these two devices might be debuted alongside the update. Microsoft has also started offering price discounts on Surface Pro 4, which is also a reminder of the impending release of the Surface Pro 5. For more details on the Surface Pro 5 visit here.

Ecumenical News ecunews.com Home U.S. world Church Culture Belief Humanitarian Analysis Lifestyle Korean Peninsula Fighting Fake News Iranian Bahá'ís Middle East Christians Venezuela Impasse Climate Change Nov 23, 2016, Updated at 15:30 PM EST Home Lifestyle Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date, specs rumors: Device to be released next year, to come with a rechargeable Surface Pen Vincent Alocada |Monday, August 22 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (Microsoft Official)Shown in the picture is Microsoft Surface Pro 4. According to rumors, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be released in spring next year. Contrary to earlier speculations, it is said that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will not be released this year and will come out in spring next year. Speculations on Microsoft Surface 5 not getting released this year stemmed from the leaked photos of the placeholders of the variants of the Surface with labels "2016," "2017," and "coming soon." While it is true that there is a possibility for Microsoft to make an announcement of one Surface product in October, it is unlikely to be the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 as its predecessor was only released in the same month last year. However, there are also other reports claiming that it is unlikely for Microsoft to release any hardware this year as it wants the release of its products to coincide with the second part of the big Windows 10 update in early next year, otherwise known as the Redstone 2. There are also allegations that Microsoft is still waiting for the arrival of Intel's Kaby Lake processor, which is rumored to be packed in the upcoming various Surface products. Meanwhile, apart from being rumored to be released in spring next year, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is also believed to come with an upgraded Surface Pen. While it's true that the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 already comes with the Surface Pen, it is alleged that the upgraded version will come with a rechargeable battery that automatically charges wirelessly when it is attached magnetically to the device. There are also rumors claiming that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come with a 2K resolution screen, although there will be a variant that will offer a 4K resolution. It is also suspected that Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come with a USB-C port that will be used for charging the device. Interesting as the specs and features of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may be, they are nothing but rumors and speculations at this point in time and can only be confirmed once the device is launched.

CES 2017 is arguably the biggest event in the tech calendar, and it's only two months away. Read on for all the latest CES 2017 news, rumours, key dates, and more. What is CES? One of the biggest technology tradeshows in the world, the Consumer Electronics Show (or CES, for short), takes place in Las Vegas every January. The show sees big-name firms like Samsung, LG and Ford flock to the city to flaunt their latest wares, and CES 2017 will be no different. Media registration for the event has already begun. Here's how the organisers reckon it'll make you feel: "The moment you find what you didn't know you were looking for, when you feel like you might have found the next unicorn, when your eyes and your brain stare blankly at each other and the only thing your mouth can muster is 'whoa'." Right... When is CES 2017? CES always takes place every January. For 2017, it's on 5-8 January. But you can guarantee that some of the bigger companies will show off their new goodies in the days leading up the show, typically at dedicated press conferences. TrustedReviews' Editor Evan Kypreos got a sneak peek at CES 2017 when he went to CES Unveiled in Paris. Here are some of the innovative products he saw there. Buddy: The Family Companion Robot If Jonny 5 taught us anything, it’s that robots can have feelings but more importantly that they can be cute. None are cuter than Buddy and its kawaii features. It pootles around your home checking for intruders, and can manage your smart home products, remind you of important events, play music and even call the fire brigade if it senses a fire. Jooki Bluetooth Speaker Bluetooth speakers are ten-a-penny but Jooki is a little different. For a start it's also a Wi-Fi enabled which means it can work like a Sonos or other streaming speaker. It's also different because it's aimed at children. It combines Amiibo-like toys with playlists so kids can decide what to listen to simply by placing the right toy on top of the splash-proof Jooki. You can even record your own voice reading out stories so your kid can listen to your voice when you’re travelling abroad. CT Band If you’re a bit of a watch fiend then the idea of dumping your favourite Rolex for a fitness band or Apple Watch Series 2 will freak you out. The CT Band attempts to give you the best of both worlds by providing fitness tracking capabilities and a small LED screen in the strap instead. Still in its prototype stage, the CT Band looks a little chunky, and I’m not convinced a screen that small is useful or needed, but getting fitness tracking capabilities using any watch face is a great idea. Rool’in This is one of the smartest ways I’ve seen a traditional push bike transformed into an electric bike.

The Rool’in is available to buy now in three sizes but one that can be charged by the sun as you pedal is also in the works. What else to expect from CES 2017 Unfortunately, because it’s still early days, very few of the major companies have announced their press events, and the organisers of CES are still keeping a lid on the show schedule. That said, it’s guaranteed that almost every major tech firm you’ve heard of will be in attendance, except for Apple – tradeshows aren’t its thing. CES is a little different than most other tradeshows, however, in that it falls straight after Christmas. That means most companies will have already announced their flagship products several months prior to the holiday season. Generally, this results in CES being a hotbed of spin-off devices (think LG G Flex) and concept products (like Razer’s Project Christine). What to expect at CES 2017 Unfortunately, most companies are keeping their announcements close to their chests. But here's what we know so far: Nvidia at CES 2017 Nvidia has teased its announcement line-up for CES 2017, and it’s got everyone excited. It turns out that CEO Jen-Hsun Huang will be helming Nvidia’s first-ever keynote address at the CES technology tradeshow in Las Vegas this January. Nvidia has promised that he’ll be breaking news in “some of the areas” it’s focused on, including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, virtual reality, and gaming. This announcement has launched speculation into what Nvidia might announce. Last year, Nvidia showed off DRIVE PX 2, the world’s first supercomputer for driverless cars. And the year before that, it ignited conspiracy theories by commissioning a crop circle in California – oh, and the launched the Tegra mobile processor too. Check out this year’s teaser video: So what might Nvidia actually announce? It’s hard to say, but we could see anything from new processors to a brand new GeForce graphics card to improvements in deep learning AI technology to a new accelerator for self-driving cars. There’s even a chance we could see a new device to follow on from the Shield hand-held console. Perhaps the most exciting possibility would be details on the new Volta GPU architecture, the sixth-generation technology that’s set to follow Pascal (launched 2016). After all, rival AMD plans to show off its new Zen ‘Summit Ridge’ CPUs at the show, and has been heavily teasing its next-gem Vega graphics cards. What happened last year?

Ivan Menchavez22 August, 2016 Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today Microsoft is said to be planning on releasing several devices this year or in 2017 including the highly anticipated Microsoft Surface Pro 5. According to reports, the upcoming hybrid laptop is Microsoft's answer to the new MacBook Pro 2016 from Apple, which is rumored to come out in fall. Although Microsoft has yet to provide concrete details with regard to the development and release of the highly anticipated device, several information have emerged online that would get tech fans excited. (Microsoft)The latest iteration, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could launch in 2017 alongside Surface Book 2 and two other Surface devices. According to a report by to PC Advisor UK, the successor of Microsoft Surface Pro 4 will come out in 2017; however, the publication said that there are indications suggesting that a different version may come out this year. Apparently, a photo has been spotted inside Microsoft's building 88 that appear to show a Surface device with "coming soon" and "2016" texts. Another poster was spotted showing three devices with "2017" on them. There are reports suggesting that Microsoft might announce the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 in October 2016 but will schedule the release by next year. However, this has yet to be confirmed by the company. A spring 2017 release for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 makes a lot of sense since the new Windows 10 update will not be available until next year. Meanwhile, Country Caller reported that Microsoft is also waiting for the seventh generation core processor from Intel, the Kaby Lake. There have been speculations saying that the company will build the Surface Pro 5 around the new powerful chipset. In the meantime, the Country Caller shared that Microsoft is still waiting for the availability of Intel Corp.'s Kaby Lake processor, another reason why it is impossible to see the Surface Pro 5 this year. There are reports suggesting that Intel will start the roll out of the processor by the end of 2016. As of the moment, fans are expecting the company to provide solid information with regard to the development of Surface Pro 5.

Black Friday Tech Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Holiday Gifts Cyber Monday     Here Is A Working IPhone 7 In Deep Blue Color Posted: Aug 20 2016, 11:27am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Aug 20 2016, 11:35am CDT, in Rumors | Apple   tech.infeng   New pictures of the rumored Deep Blue iPhone 7 Plus have emerged online via tech.infeng, which show every beautiful angle of the phone. How To: Find Pokemon Go Plus In Stock If the pictures are authentic then all this becomes more exciting as they depict a fully working unit but it is possible that the final model we see at the release might be slightly different. These pictures are our first actual look at what the iPhone will look like. The images coincide with everything we have learned and seen of the new iPhone 7 over the months. There is the camera hump present as well has dual lens and repositioned antenna lines.                     This Deep Blue iPhone will become the first iPhone to be offered by Apple in any color other than Space Grey, Gold, Silver and Rose Gold. If one was to over think this color choice than we could look at Samsung and its apparent bias towards this color and use in most of its high end product lines. With the launch of the iPhone so near we are now getting to hear more about what the device has to offer internally. Recently a comparison of the logic board for iPhone 6S and 7 was leaked which pointed out all things similar and different between the two. The comparison pointed out that Apple will no longer be using Qualcomm to power its baseband chips but will instead be switching to Intel. It is a possibility that Apple ends up offering both the baseband chips but we won’t be able to comment on this until people actually starting using the new iPhone. We will surely be getting a whole host of new leaks before the final release of the iPhone 7 which is scheduled to take place on September 7th, so near!

Perhaps swarm-based robotics has something to offer after all. Watch as the ReefScouts take off like a group of dolphins and then sink to the bottom like a synchronized swimming display.  If you think swarm robots are just small insect-like machines, or at best a flying squadron of drones, then meet the ReefScouts. These small, yellow, torpedo-like robots can do real work sampling and measuring underwater environments.      Watch the video and notice the way they are casually dropped from a container into the sea. Notice they way they school like a shoal of fish and get back to base on their own. This is not just a mark of how much robotics has moved on, but how low cost it is becoming. The components you need to make robots is dropping the more we make. Small computing devices like the Pi Zero are so cheap that they are effectively disposable and if you need the power devices like the new Intel Joule can provide, the price may be higher but it is still affordable.   ReefScouts look as though they were built to do real work. OceanLAB built the swarm as a demonstration of how intelligent control systems can make deployment of data gathering devices easier. The whole point of the swarm is that the user, or controller, doesn't have to navigate at the level of individual robots, but just tell the swarm where to go and sample and let them sort out the details on their own.     As OceanLAB explains it: "We seek to maximize swarm agility while protecting the operator from complexity. Our swarms can be guided as a large, fluid mass. For oceanographers, the group delivers a map of real-time distributed data and can be actively guided to target areas of maximum interest." If you want to know what theoretical approach is being used, it is basically non-equilibrium thermodynamics with each robot regarded as a particle in a fluid.  "Numerical modeling experiments demonstrate how groups can be influenced to display different phase-like behaviors by adjusting global parameters. Dissipation (drag) is the most effective parameter for regulating group coordination."   More Information http://oceanlab.com/ Related Articles Modern Fireworks - 100 Drones Break The Record Festo's Ants And Butterflies  1000 Kilobots Make Patterns  The Swarm Game        Kilobots Work Together        A Swarm Of Humanoid Robots!          To be informed about new articles on I Programmer, sign up for our weekly newsletter, subscribe to the RSS feed and follow us on, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or Linkedin.      Neural Networks Have A Universal Flaw 04/11/2016 It was recently discovered that neural networks have a flaw that leads them into errors that look stupid to a human.

 How Microsoft built a computer so good, even Apple wanted to copy it Matt Weinberger Aug. 21, 2016, 8:30 AM 110,969 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft Corporate VP of Devices Panos Panay.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider On May 20, 2014, Satya Nadella — the recently appointed CEO of Microsoft — sat down next to Microsoft Surface boss Panos Panay in a packed New York City auditorium. They were there to launch the Surface Pro 3, the newest version of Microsoft's tablet. "This is a big day," Nadella told Panay. "Let's get it right." The pressure was on: The first generation of Surface tablets had performed so badly in the market, Microsoft had to take a $900 million write-down for unsold inventory in 2013. The second Surface hadn't fared much better. Nadella had told Panay that the third version had to be right: "We need to make hardware that gives us permission to be in hardware."  'We need to make hardware that gives us permission to be in hardware.' — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  Panay knew what he was up against, but he was confident they were going to get it right on the third try. "You have a vision. You have a whole vision. It's never one generation that's going to get you there," Panay tells Business Insider. Now Microsoft has won a reputation as the trendsetter in tablets, with companies like Dell and HP following suit. And when Apple announced the iPad Pro in late 2015, the whole world couldn't help but notice that, with its keyboard cover and big screen, it looked a lot like the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. Last year also saw the launch of the Microsoft Surface Book, the company's very first actual laptop, to positive reviews, with Wired calling it "the most exciting Windows laptop in years."  Microsoft? A hardware company? Indeed, there's a little bit of a hardware renaissance going on in Redmond, with a brand-new and gorgeous Xbox One S, the Surface Hub mega-tablet, and the Microsoft HoloLens all showing promise. There are even positive signs that the category of computers created by the Surface and Surface Book are helping turn around the overall shrinkage of the PC market. But it almost didn't work out that way. Here's how the Microsoft Surface was created — and how it's dragging Microsoft itself into the next phase of computing. The first generation Surface was also sold as "Surface with Windows RT."Wikimedia Commons A showcase for Windows 8 Around 2009, Microsoft's Windows division, then led by Steven Sinofsky, had started work on Windows 8.  The Apple iPhone, released in 2007, had ushered in a new era of touchscreen-friendly computing, and Sinofsky's team was planning to push Windows into the future. The new operating system would forgo classic elements of the operating system, including the iconic Start menu that had been around since Windows 95 in 1995, in favor of a new so-called Metro interface, with big, colorful "tiles" that were easy to push with your finger.  The problem was, PC manufacturers of the day were pretty happy making the traditional laptop and desktop computers that they always had and were focused on building "netbooks," super-cheap Windows computers that offered a crummy user experience. Microsoft worried that nobody in the Windows PC world was going to make the perfect touchscreen Windows computer that would "usher us in to that new era in computing." Panay says. "We needed to ensure it would happen right." Steven Sinofsky and Panos Panay at the 2012 launch of the original Microsoft Surface.AP Images/Jason DeCrow At the time, Panay was in charge of Microsoft's hardware business, which at that point mostly meant computer mice and keyboards. But his team had more experience with ergonomics and manufacturing than most of the others at Microsoft, so in early 2010, Microsoft leadership told Panay to "go create something." The iPad had just come out. Tablets were a hot commodity. If consumers wanted tablets, Panay's team decided, Microsoft would make the best and most productive tablet in the world.  "How are people going to do what people wanted to do?" Panay says. "'Tablet' was the easy word at the time." Torturing the team to get the details right Panay is known as a guy who sweats the details: When the Surface launched in 2012, he bragged that the company had 200 parts custom-designed and manufactured specifically for the tablet.  Coming up with the Surface's unique form factor, with the kickstand in the back and the Type Cover keyboard case in the front, took a lot of work, including prototyping the tablet with cardboard and tape until they got the weight and feel just right.  "I tortured [my team] the whole way," Panay says. "We needed something iconic. You can't create an icon; an icon creates itself." Prototype parts for the original Microsoft Surface tablet, created just to give a sense for the aesthetics before it was packed full of electronics.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider The design of the Surface was supposed to make it disappear in your hands — the point of the Surface was to highlight Windows, after all, not to bring attention to itself. From the get-go all the way through today, the Surface project was designed to highlight "the best of Microsoft," he says. "I think people separate hardware and software too quickly," says Panay.  It also had to show PC manufacturers like HP and Dell that the world was ready for something that combined the best of the PC and the best of the tablet. Surface tension Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer revealed the Surface to the world at an event in Los Angeles on June 18, 2012. That announcement also explained that the first Surface would run Windows RT — an offshoot of Windows 8 designed to run on the ARM-based processors used in most smartphones and tablets, including the iPhone and iPad at the time. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at the launch of Windows 8. It eschewed traditional Windows elements like the Start button in favor of big, touch-friendly buttons.Wikimedia Commons Because Windows RT ran on ARM processors, the first Surface would offer longer battery life than a regular PC, more along the lines of an iPad. But there was a huge trade-off: It couldn't run traditional Windows software at all. It could only run preloaded Microsoft software like the special version of Office Microsoft created for RT and a very few apps available from the new Windows Store app market. When the first Surface launched to the public in October 2012 alongside Windows 8, Microsoft commemorated it with a webcast launch event that featured then-Windows chief Sinofsky riding a custom version of the Surface like a skateboard. (Sinofsky left Microsoft in November 2012.) Couldn't resist taking it out for a spin... #surface pic.twitter.com/Nzj2xj6T — Steven Sinofsky (@stevesi) October 16, 2012 In February 2013, Microsoft followed the first Surface up with the Surface Pro.  Where the Surface was more like a tablet with an optional keyboard, the Pro had the guts of a laptop. It looked a lot like the regular Surface, but sported a higher-resolution screen, a Surface Pen stylus for touch input, and, most importantly, a full version of Windows 8.  Steve Kovach/Business Insider Despite some early excitement and some positive reviews, the first-generation Surface devices would turn out to be a huge disappointment for Microsoft.  The ARM-based Surface compared favorably with the iPad on battery life but got slammed because Windows RT couldn't run the apps that people actually wanted. The Surface Pro fared better with its full Windows 8 installation but offered lousier battery life and performance than a regular laptop. Plus, both devices were only originally offered at Microsoft's retail stores, limiting availability. In March 2013, Bloomberg reported that Microsoft had sold only around 1.5 million Surface devices, 400,000 of which were Surface Pros. That was well short of the company's expectation that it would sell 2 million Surfaces in the last quarter of 2012 alone. In July 2013, Microsoft took a $900 million write-down on the Surface business, mostly related to unsold inventory of the original ARM-based Surface devices. Despite the warning signs, Microsoft stayed the course. In late 2013, Microsoft announced a Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, with better battery life and performance. But sales didn't improve much, perhaps because Windows 8 itself wasn't much liked.  "We needed better battery life. We needed better performance for people," Panay now reflects. That's the Surface situation that Satya Nadella inherited when he took over as Microsoft CEO in 2014.  All one team Behind the scenes, one of the first things Nadella did was start to upgrade Microsoft's culture. Microsoft in the 2000s functioned like a group of warring fiefdoms — loosely related product groups fighting for supremacy. Previous CEO Steve Ballmer had started unifying the company under one banner, as one team, but left Microsoft before those changes fully took hold. Nadella made it one of his top priorities to continue that transition. So while the Surface business had been floundering, Nadella saw opportunity. When Nadella took over Microsoft, they had already started working on Windows 10, the successor to Windows 8, designed to better toe the line between the desktop Windows of old and the touchscreen future. To prepare for that future, Microsoft still needed a computer that showed off its best features, the combination of touch screen and traditional Windows laptop. "It's part of the growth story for Windows and for Microsoft," Panay says.Left to right: Microsoft CVP Panos Panay, former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at the 2014 launch of the Surface Pro 3.AP Photo/Mark Lennihan So Nadella and Panay started bringing the rest of the company into the process of designing the Surface Pro 3 — a process that continued into the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. The Skype team now advises the Surface on the camera and speakers, Panay says, and the OneNote team advises on the stylus features. Panay says that Microsoft doesn't even talk in terms of "software" or "hardware" anymore, just the products that they make. "Everybody's on the same boat — grab an oar, let's move forward," Panay says. Finding a focus: power users The Surface Pro 3 launched in June 2014 and looked similar to its forebearers. But in practice, it was thinner, lighter, and more responsive. Reviewers like Yahoo's David Pogue found it to be "an actual, fast, luxury laptop" in addition to a worthwhile tablet.  "It wasn't until [Surface] Pro 3 that we had crossed the chasm," Panay says. "We learned enough from our failures." While Microsoft doesn't report sales numbers, the Surface division posted its first profitable quarter in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, with revenue exceeding $1 billion just a quarter later.   Screenshot In the summer of 2015, Microsoft introduced a smaller Surface 3. But there was a big change: Instead of the now discontinued Windows RT, it ran full Windows 8.1, meaning it could run old apps and new. As Panay has said in interviews, that change came directly from customer frustration with Windows RT — the Surface was always pitched as a tablet that can replace your laptop, but Windows RT was way too limited for that. People wanted full Windows on Intel, so that's what they got. Plus, they got a better and more flexible kickstand and better battery life. Microsoft was finally delivering on the promise to deliver a tablet that could replace your laptop. The Microsoft Surface Pro 4, launched October 2015, still doesn't have a non-Pro counterpart Surface 4, with no indication that it's coming. To Panay, that's a natural evolution. Instead of supporting two operating systems, the whole Surface line is now on the most recent Windows 10. Instead of trying to serve consumers and businesses simultaneously, Microsoft is focusing on productivity — which includes the Surface Book's groundbreaking detachable tablet features. Melia Robinson/Business Insider "We've gone from complexity to opportunity," Panay says. The key, he says, is to never compromise on the people-pleasing aesthetics or features of the device to satisfy enterprises, because, "enterprises are made of people."  In July 2015, following the success of the Surface Pro 3 and the turnaround in the overall Surface business, Panay was placed in charge of Microsoft's overall hardware business. Every new Microsoft device, including the Xbox One S console, the Microsoft HoloLens, and the rumored next-generation Windows phone, have to pass through Panay's team. Meanwhile, the effects of the Surface's effect on the market are hard to miss. Microsoft is partnering with the likes of Dell and HP to sell more Surfaces, even as they build their own Surface-esque devices. IBM partnered up with Microsoft to push Surface in the workplace, too.  The Microsoft Surface Pro 4, left, with the Apple iPad Pro, right.Matt Weinberger/Business Insider It's not all sunshine and roses for Surface, though: Despite the fact that Surface was a $4.1 billion business last quarter, and despite the fact that the Microsoft Surface basically invented the market that Apple is now carving out for itself with the iPad Pro, Microsoft is still lagging behind Apple in so-called hybrid-tablet sales overall. "Do I get frustrated now and then? Sure," Panay says of seeing competitors like Apple copy Microsoft's inventions. But still, he says he's focused on the future, with more to come from Surface. Reports hold that Microsoft will be announcing updates to the Surface Book and a new Surface all-in-one desktop PC later this year.  "Want to light me up? Let me give people something new," Panay says.

Owens PUBLISHED: July 30, 2014 at 10:21 am | UPDATED: August 12, 2016 at 8:30 am Today:Yelp scores its first quarterly profits in another busy day for Silicon Valley earnings reports, and Twitter shoots higher after its World Cup score. The Lead: Yelp posts a profit, still sees growth ahead Yelp produced the first quarterly profit in corporate history in the spring and increased its forecasts for the full year as the online-reviews site continued to show off burgeoning popularity Wednesday. The San Francisco company reported net income of $2.7 million, or 4 cents a share, on sales of $88.8 million, representing a gain of 61 percent from the same period a year ago. The results easily beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations for the company of a loss of 3 cents per share on revenues of $86.3 million. Co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman celebrated the company’s ability to produce profits for the first time, but insisted his focus was on continued growth and investment. “While this is an important milestone, we still have a large local opportunity ahead of us,” he said in Wednesday’s announcement. Yelp managed to post such strong numbers through increased visitors, with monthly unique visitors to all of Yelp’s offerings growing 27 percent year-over-year to 138 million, and mobile users growing 51 percent and nearly equaling half of all visitors at 68 million. The businesses that those visitors are looking up or reviewing also jumped at the chance to advertise on Yelp, as active local business accounts neared 80,000 after year-over-year growth of 55 percent. The strong quarter led Yelp to increase its forecast for full-year revenues, with the company now expecting to generate sales of $372 million to $375 million in 2014 after posting a 2013 total of $233 million. Yelp stock jumped 8.8 percent to $75.60 in regular trading Wednesday, then topped $80 in late trading immediately following the results’ release, though prices soon calmed down and remained closer to the closing mark. Eleven other SV150 companies released their earnings reports Wednesday, with the largest profits and revenues belonging to Fremont chip company Lam Research. Lam, the 26th-largest tech company in Silicon Valley, reported net income of $233.4 million, or $1.35 a share, on sales of $1.25 billion, and shares dropped about 1.5 percent in late trading after closing at $67.89. Redwood City photo-services website Shutterfly lost $27.1 million in the second quarter, or 70 cents a share, on sales of $159.1 million, and shares moved about 1 percent higher after closing at $47.49. Ruckus Wireless earned $1.44 million, or 2 cents a share, on sales of $81 million, and its shares moved about 3.5 percent higher after closing with a 3 percent gain at $12.96. Rovi lost $2.6 million, or 3 cents a share, on sales of $137.1 million and saw little movement in late trading following a close at $23.71. Cavium announced the acquisition of fellow San Jose networking company Xpliant, which it had invested in, for about $90 million Wednesday, and showed off a quarterly net loss of $11 million, or 21 cents a share, on sales of $90.7 million. Sunnyvale flash-memory company Spansion seemed to be the day’s big post-earnings loser, dropping 13 percent after announcing losses of $12 million, or 20 cents a share, on sales of $314.7 million. Coherent reported profits of $13 million, or 52 cents a share, on sales of $196.5 million, and FormFactor lost $4.3 million, or 8 cents a share, on sales of $67.4 million. Equinix earned $10.1 million, or 22 cents a share, on revenues of $605.2 million, and the Redwood City data-center company moved about 1.5 percent higher after closing at $215.75. Nanometrics lost $588,000, or 2 cents a share, on sales of $48 million, and Silicon Image earned $1.1 million, or a penny a share, on sales of $59.5 million. SV150 market report: Twitter roars 20 percent higher Wall Street’s major indexes moved little Wednesday, after the federal government announced that economic growth in the second quarter experienced a large leap to 4 percent and the Federal Reserve gave no hints about when it would increase interest rates. Technology stocks did experience strong gains, though, as Twitter’s explosive post-earnings increase helped Silicon Valley tech stocks gain 0.7 percent on the day. Twitter shot 20 percent higher after showing off strong user growth and better than expected revenues in the same quarter that soccer fans turned to the social network to discuss the World Cup. Analysts tripped over themselves to increase price targets and cheer Twitter’s results, with Topeka Capital Markets analyst Victor Anthony writing that the results “should represent a breakout quarter for Twitter.” Despite the positive notes, analysts still doubted CEO Dick Costolo’s contention that the user gains were not a result of the World Cup, which would bolster bears’ case that the gains could be a one-time boost. Twitter moved as high as $48 Wednesday before closing at $46.30, its highest closing price since April Fools’ Day, and it acquired yet another small tech startup. Netflix jumped 2.4 percent to $434.36 after striking an interconnection deal with AT&T, similar to the Los Gatos video-on-demand company’s previous deals with Comcast and Verizon. Tesla Motors moved 1.7 percent higher to $228.92 a day ahead of its expected earnings report, as Morgan Stanley predicted Tesla could double its 2013 revenues with battery sales for solar power collection. Facebook couldn’t match rival Twitter’s gains, but the Menlo Park company gained 1.3 percent to $74.68 after ditching its e-commerce attempt dubbed Gifts. Sunnyvale’s Applied Micro began shipping server chips in a challenge to Intel, but investors punished its weak earnings report from Tuesday by sending shares down 9.9 percent to $8.71; Intel gained 0.5 percent to $34.35.

Haughey has spent the past 16 years collecting old computers, taking them apart and reassembling the pieces into works of art. Scott Roberson / Daily Journal At one time, the blood red center core memory board had helped NASA technicians track satellites and shuttles on missions in orbit. The retired computer no longer manages the intensive calculations necessary for space flight. Instead, hanging on a wall in Joyce Haughey’s Trafalgar studio, it has been transformed into a modernistic collage of burrowing circuits, descending rows of processors and chaotically beautiful wiring patterns. “I kept finding things that were pretty like processors and other pieces that I wanted to keep,” she said. “As you keep collecting it, you see more and more patterns. That’s what makes it so much fun.” 1 of 18 Examples of artwork artist Joyce Haughey has created using parts from old computers.

Scott Roberson / Daily Journal Artist Joyce Haughey arranges circuit boards as she works on a piece Wednesday at her Trafalgar workshop. Haughey has spent the past 16 years collecting old computers, taking them apart and reassembling the pieces into works of art. Scott Roberson / Daily Journal Haughey, a Trafalgar resident, has spent the past 16 years collecting old computers. She buys the vintage processors and equipment from auctions or salvages them from businesses who are upgrading their systems. With the machines in her studio, she takes them apart to their base elements, reassembling the pieces into amazing works of art. Old processors become abstract landscapes and collages. Silicon wafers are segmented and recreated as dazzling mosaics. Floppy drives turn into metallic flowers, insects, cogs and other circular adornments. Some of the pieces need to be seen and worked with using a magnifying glass. Combining all of these minuscule pieces into a cohesive work of art can take weeks, months or years. “It can take months to get the parts. Some of this stuff I’ve had since 2000, so it can take years before I get enough of a piece that I want. Then when I have all the pieces, it can be a few more months to finish it,” she said. Her pieces are currently hanging at the Greenwood Public Library through the end of August. “Her work is so beautiful and unique and I think many people are drawn to it,” said Valerie Moore, reference librarian at Greenwood who organized the show. “Technology is transitioning so quickly, it’s refreshing to see someone take old, discarded pieces and make something wonderful out of them.” Stepping into the doors of Haughey’s studio — the former bank building in downtown Trafalgar — is to be surrounded by the history of computers during the past 30 years. Rows of old machines that need to be salvaged are stored under tables. Plastic bins of copper-wound floppy disc drives are stacked on shelves and tables. Small bits of copper and silver, cut down and up-cycled from old computer electrical cords, are collected in plastic bags. When local companies, library systems and schools upgrade their computers, Haughey steps in to salvage the machines. Since she started working with computes, Haughey has recycled more than 1,600 machines that would otherwise have gone in a landfill. She sees her work not only as an expression of creativity, but an eco-friendly solution to technological turnover. “Most of the work, probably 95 percent, is finding the computers, hauling them home and stripping them out. I kind of pile it up in colors and multiples of things,” she said. “If you start putting them together, you see things. I always have junk all around. If you put it away, you forget you have it.” Haughey keeps heat sinks removed from the machines. At one time, each apparatus helped manage the intense heat generated by the computer processors. Now, the items serve as eye-catchers to children and their parents as they walk by. “I try to keep a few things in the window for kids who walk by,” she said. “Anybody is welcome to stop in while I’m here. I show them around, and kids that are into art, I give them pieces to take home and play with.” Haughey is one of a handful of artists throughout the world working in recycled computes. Franco Recchia, an Italian artist, reimagines the elements from old computers and turns them into cityscape sculptures. New York-based artist Theo Kamecke uses the forms of circuitry to make unique sculptures. Kamecke, a documentary filmmaker for many years, had collected a pile of vintage circuitry over the years. The hand-designed circuits had a sort of beautiful aesthetic that struck him as an ideal material to use in his work. “It comes down to the way the circuits were made. I wouldn’t have done them at all if they hadn’t been graphically appealing,” he said. “At the time I was doing this, no one knew what a circuit looked like. I always avoided calling attention to them as technology and focusing on them as art.” Yuri Zupancic takes microchips and RAM, turning them into tiny canvases where he makes impossibly detailed oil paintings. “Painting on microchips is an intuitive response to everyday life, where I’m constantly alternating from online activity to hands on experience,” Zupancic said in his artist statement. “It is essential to explore this space ‘between’, where virtual, tangible, and mental spheres overlap, where apps and icons mingle with emotions and physical stimulus.” Haughey has always had an interest in taking base elements and creating something visually exciting. She was a toy designer throughout her career, doing projects such as envisioning plush toys to compete with Beanie Babies and doing high-end toys in Germany. Her foray into computers started around 2000. Her husband, Ron, was working for a company who had leased Cummins Inc. their computers. When the decision was made to upgrade, that left more than 1,000 machines that would otherwise be scrapped. Haughey volunteered to help go through the computers and pull out the hard drives to be wiped clean. Then she started separating the machines into steel and aluminum pieces, and her interest in the guts of the computers started to grow. As Haughey’s experience and skill level have progressed, so are the things she’s been able to do with her artwork. She is doing more cutting and segmenting of the salvaged hardware, though doesn’t venture too much more into altering the appearance of the pieces. “Everything else is exactly as it comes out of the computer. I don’t paint them, or do anything else to them. It’s exactly what the computer gave me,” she said. Not all of her work becomes serious pieces of art. By gluing some square processors together and adding a hinge to one, she can create unique keepsake boxes. In the winter, she uses the combination of gold, green and red on some boards to make Christmas ornaments. Hardware from different companies and eras are made with varying colors, materials and styles. Silver Intel Pentium processors skew more modernistic, particularly when paired with the dazzling rings used as spacers in hard drives. Some of Haughey’s pieces would make hardcore technology historians and aficionados drool. The NASA MODCOMP computers, used for tracking in the 1980s, were given to her by a friend who ran a computer e-cycling company. She was able to buy a Silicon Graphics Onyx server — the kind of equipment used to create the film “Toy Story” — at an auction. The piece had previously been used in IUPUI’s graphics department. “The boards were so smooth and so much fun, I wanted to do something unique,” she said. Haughey does not show her work often, mostly keeping her art on display in her studio. She was part of a South Bend Museum of Art exhibition in 2011, and was featured in a profile in the Wall Street Journal about silicon platters and those who collect them. But she has big plans for the future. Haughey has set her sights on the birthplace of much of her raw materials — Silicon Valley. She has worked with the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, regarding a group show with four other artists working in recycled computers. Though details are still coming together, Haughey hopes to have a crowdfunding campaign to help pay for the exhibition soon. Ideally, the show would be up in the next year.
