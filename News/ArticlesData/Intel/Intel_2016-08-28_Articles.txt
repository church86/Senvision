It was in October, and the company referred it as the ultimate laptop. (check: LeEco Le 2S Pro Specifications.) It has a detachable screen, Surface Pen, Intel ‘Skylake’ dual core processors, and Windows 10 Professional on the OS front in the lower model. By shelling out some extra money, the tech giant offers Nvidia based discrete GPU for about $1499. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Despite a lot of good hardware specs, it had a few hiccups. There were complaints regarding the Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge which induced a space when closed. Lower battery life to its competitors and steep pricing for higher end specifications were some other complaints which surrounded it. Keeping the previous gadget to its place, let’s move on to the upcoming product. Surface Book 2 release date As of now, Microsoft hasn’t officially announced the launch date as it has been only a year since the launch of its original product. However, it’s definitely clear that the successor is in progress. It is anticipated that it will be released along with Surface Pro 5, Surface Phone, and a Surface all-in-one PC. The above tech products are expected by the firm as the Microsoft’s second Redstone update (RS2). It will come out on the anniversary of this summer. It would be more beneficial to users if the company releases the upcoming device with the all new Intel’s next generation Kaby Lake processors. This 14-nanometer microprocessor architecture is expected to go for high volume production at the end of 2016. The processors will offer USB 3.1 Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 support along with the regular four cores’ configuration and improved CPU / GPU performance. Microsoft recently unveiled its Play Anywhere program and it’s still not clear if the company will be including it with the hardware of upcoming Surface Book. The year 2017 makes it a perfect time to launch an additional gaming focused configuration with a GeForce 980M. Stay tuned for latest updates regarding it. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors Expectations Leave it to Microsoft what it gives with the all new 2-in-1 laptop. There will always be improvements which can be done. And it will even if the company gives their best. Below are some of the ideas from us and some readers to make a better Windows 10 laptop Take a look and if you want to add yours, let’s know via comments. Better Screen Latest Intel Kaby Lake processors will be required to power the next HD screen for the SB 2. The previous model has a 13.5-inch display screen with a 3,000 x 2,000 resolution pixels with 267 PPI. Moreover, there is an integrated Intel HD Graphics 520 GPU. The new model should offer a 4K screen. The upcoming Kaby Lake architecture of Microsoft processor will improve the playback of 4K video and 3D graphics. Along with it, the company should focus on providing a better with which the screen can be detached from the keyboard. There are a lot of complaints regarding the hinge mechanism in the original SurfaceBook. As of now, it both requires electricity and mechanical process to detach it. It’s both software and hardware based process. So, there can be an unforeseen glitch in the system. There must be a better way for it. It should get detached irrespective of the system is ON or OFF. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors More Battery Life If Microsoft includes new Kaby Lake architecture, then the device will definitely need more power as the screen resolution will increase. With this, we meant to say that there should be enough battery to power the device with improved performance. With tests and normal usage, original Surface Book has a 4-hour battery in the Clipboard and an 8-hour battery in the base. To watch 4K content, users will require more of the battery backup. It won’t be possible with the current specs. The built-in recharge dock for the Surface Pen will need an improved battery. As of now, the device has a standard AAA battery. However, a patent has made it clear that Microsoft is working on a stylus with a built-in rechargeable battery. This is, however, an old patent. But it can be possible if the company provides a rechargeable Surface Pen for SB2. As of now, Microsoft’s focus is on providing a better stylus in Windows 10. The new pen should have a LED indicator light and a power button. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors The updated GPU will need more power. The current device can include a Nvidia GeForce graphics chip with Maxwell architecture which has a thermal envelope of up to 75W. If Microsoft comes up to give Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 graphics chip, then it will need to support power requirements of up to 145 W. Its alternate is to use slower GeForce GTX 980M with 100W and it will still support DirectX 12 in Windows 10. But it will still need more juice. It would be great if it comes out VR-ready. For it, the laptop will need to have two USB 3.0 ports, a mini Display Port, and an SD card reader. With it, it should have an HDMI 1.3 port to support 297 MHz clock by a ‘direct output architecture.’ It means that the external video output pumped through the HDMI port can’t be locked to the performance of the laptop. Storage It should have 128gb to 1TB internal storage. Price It should cost from $1500 to $3500 depending upon the specifications. Updates: 29th August 2016: Microsoft posted an image on Instagram to tease, it wasn’t a teaser at all. It was a cropped photo of original Surface Book. Microsoft Surface Book 2 Release Date, Specs, Images, News, Rumors Will It Beat Its Rivals? Despite talking what should it have and when it releases, there have several rumors that it will be released this Summer with Surface Pro 5 and Anniversary update. It is still not in the market to beat Apple MacBook Air 2016 and MacBook Pro 2016. The devices of Microsoft are still young, and the follow-up models will take time. This is all for now. Let’s see if there are any easter eggs in the Windows 10 Insider Preview builds regarding hardware. It seems that the company has bigger plans for Redstone 2. Most of the people are still hoping for an early 2017 release for SurfaceBook2. Let’s wait and watch what happens next as 2016 comes to an end.

On today's edition of NFC East Intel, we look at the Eagles releasing two wide receivers, Victor Cruz making his long-awaited return to the field for the Giants and the Cowboys' quarterback situation with an injured Tony Romo. PHILADELPHIA EAGLES Headline: Eagles Release Rueben Randle, Chris Givens As cuts begin to be made, the Eagles on Sunday parted ways with two veteran receivers: Rueben Randle and Chris Givens. Randle, 25, was signed by the Eagles earlier in the offseason after spending four seasons with the Giants. He is coming off a season in which he hauled in 797 yards and a career-high eight touchdowns, but reports coming out of Philadelphia was that he was far too inconsistent to grab a roster spot. Givens, 26, was also acquired in free agency this offseason after he split the first four years of his NFL career between the St. Louis Rams and Baltimore Ravens. He had worked some with the first-team offense (including a 19-yard reception to begin the Eagles’ most recent preseason game), but the Eagles decided to move on without him. The moves leave the Eagles with eight wide receivers: Jordan Matthews, Nelson Agholor, Dorial Green-Beckham, Josh Huff, Paul Turner, Marcus Johnson, Cayleb Jones and David Watford. What this means for the Redskins: Philadelphia’s passing game appears to be a work in progress, even if Sam Bradford is the starting quarterback and Matthews and Agholor are returning. The Redskins and Eagles first meet in Week 6 of the regular season. NEW YORK GIANTS Headline: Victor Cruz Plays In First Game Since The 2014 Season For the first time since tearing his patellar tendon in October 2014, followed by a calf injury that wiped away his 2015 season, Cruz was back at MetLife Stadium on Saturday evening, recording one reception for four yards. It was his first catch in 685 days. "It felt good to put that jersey on again and go out there with my teammates, from the warmup, the pregame, and then during the game to be in the position to make a play and be out there running routes against an opponent, it felt good," Cruz said via NBCNewYork.com. While Cruz recorded just one reception, he said it was “definitely good to get one in.” "That ball felt like it was forever in the air before it got to my hands, but it was good to kind of catch that ball and get a little contact, get a little hit out of bounds, and hopefully I can build on that," Cruz said. What this means for the Redskins: The Giants are hoping that Cruz can come back healthy and bolster a passing attack that has heavily relied on Odell Beckham Jr. If the 29-year-old stays on the field, rookie Kendall Fuller or Dashaun Phillips could be tasked with stopping him in the slot. DALLAS COWBOYS Headline: Tony Romo Suffers Fractured Bone In His Back The Cowboys likely won’t be with Romo to start the regular season, as Dallas head coach Jason Garrett announced on Saturday that the veteran quarterback suffered a fractured bone in his back from a hit taken in last Thursday’s preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks. “We’re going to monitor his condition day by day and we’ll see how he feels going forward,” Garrett said via DallasCowboys.com. “There’s no timeframe when he’s going to return.” While Garrett wouldn’t specify Romo’s status moving forward, most reports that have surfaced have said the Eastern Illinois product will likely be out six to 10 weeks. That could potentially see him miss the first half of the season. With Romo hurt, the Cowboys currently move forward with 2016 fourth-round pick Dak Prescott as the starter and Jameill Showers as the primary backup. Fourth-year Boise State product Kellen Moore broke his ankle on Aug. 3 during a training camp practice. Even though Prescott has shined in the preseason (he’s thrown five touchdowns and ran for two more in three games), ESPN’s Bill Barnwell thinks Cowboys fans should be worried. “I would be lying if I didn't say the numbers look better than Prescott on tape,” Barnwell writes. “He has made some excellent throws, and I'm not a scout, but watching with impartial eyes, Prescott has been inconsistent. He underthrew a fair number of his passes, including the touchdown pass to Dez Bryant against the Dolphins and the score to Jason Witten against the Seahawks, the latter of which was nearly intercepted. Miami also dropped a would-be pick. Prescott has had a clean pocket for many of his throws, and when teams have pressured him, his throws have suffered." What this means for the Redskins: The Redskins and Cowboys face off early this season, as their first matchup comes in Week 2 at FedExField. If Romo is unable to go (and all signs point to in that direction), then it will mark the third straight game that the Redskins have faced a Cowboys quarterback other than Romo. The Cowboys face the Giants in Week 1 in a Sunday afternoon game.  Trending Now Redskins' Path To A Potential Playoff Bid Clears Up Entering Week 17 Redskins-Giants Game Flexed To 4:25 p.m. Redskins' Opponents For The 2017 Season Confirmed Redskins Sign Josh Evans, Place Donte Whitner Sr. On Injured Reserve More News » CSN Videos More Video Recent Articles Redskins Sign Nine To Reserve/Future Contracts Five Takeaways: Jay Gruden's End Of Season Presser Snap Counts: Redskins-Giants (2016 Regular Season, Week 17) PHOTOS: Redskins Wrap Up 2016 Season Redskins-Giants Monday Stats Pack Redskins' Opponents For The 2017 Season Confirmed PHOTOS: Redskins-Giants Highlights The Best Of #SkinsRightCombo, Week 17 Papa John's Redskins Touchdown Special Redskins Process The Sting To The End Of Their Season Subscribe More Headlines » Featured Galleries Redskins Clean Out Their Lockers The Washington Redskins players officially wrapped up the 2016 season on Monday, Jan. 2, 2017, cleaning out their lockers and speaking to the media before beginning their offseasons.

The company has been keeping the lid tight on this product, but there are speculations that it may be launched during the last quarter of this year. Fortunately, the latest leak provided several details on the upcoming chip. Benchlife, a Chinese tech website, has published several slides that show different information on the processor. Laptops and 2-in-1 tablets equipped with the new Intel Core processor will reported be launched during the fourth quarter of 2016. These low-power-consuming chips use between 4.5 watts and 15 watts. The leak also shows that a 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7-7500U Kaby Lake processor will have an increase of up to 12 percent in terms of productivity and up to 19 percent web performance against a 3.1 GHz i7-6500U of the previous micro-architecture. However, this improvement will be at the cost of the device's battery life, unless Intel has worked something around the new chip that will improve its power efficiency. Techworm mentioned that the top-of-the-line i7-7700K desktop variant of the Kaby Lake processor will be so powerful that gamers will not be needing a separate video card in order to have a 4K output. A new graphics architecture on the upcoming chip gives visual performance a big boost, and it will even handle 3D graphics. The Intel Kaby Lake processor is also rumored to include native support for USB 3.1, HDCP 2.2, HEVC Main 10/10-bit and VP9 10 bit hardware video decoding. Meanwhile, a Kaby Lake desktop processor list also surfaced recently showing the three sub-categories it will have, which are based on power requirement or TDP (Thermal Design Power). They are Standard Power at 95 W, Low Power at 65W and Ultra Low Power at 35 W. All of these processors will be taking the existing LGA1151 package.

As we have predicted more than two years back, the industry is bifurcating, and just a few products pursue scaling to 7nm while the majority of designs stay on 28nm or older nodes. Our 2014 blog 28nm — The Last Node of Moore's Law has now been confirmed. At the time we wrote: “After the 28nm node, we can continue to make transistors smaller, but not cheaper.” It is illustrated in the following slide, presented by Samsung at the recent Semicon West 2016. Click here for larger image Intel did announce that going forward, the time between nodes will increase but it still claims it can keep reducing transistors cost. Yet Intel’s underwhelming successes as a foundry suggest otherwise. We have discussed it in a blog titled Intel — The Litmus Test, and it was essentially repeated in Apple will NEVER use Intel Custom Foundry! “Yes, Intel will argue that their 10nm and 7nm are better than the foundries (TSMC and Samsung) but that will have to be proven at the chip level which is based on PPAC (power, performance, area, AND cost). The foundries have beaten Intel at every node based on SoC PPAC and I do not expect that to change at 10nm or 7nm.” This discussion seems academic now, as the actual engineering costs of devices in advanced nodes have shown themselves to be too expensive for much of the industry. Consequently, and as predicted, the industry is bifurcating, and few products pursue scaling to 7nm while the majority of designs use 28nm or older nodes. The following chart  derived from TSMC quarterly earnings reports was published last week by Ed Sperling in the blog Stepping Back From Scaling: Click here for larger image Yes, the 50-year march of Moore’s’ Law has ended, and the industry is now facing a new reality. Similar industry dynamic has also been shown in a blog by Mentor Established Technology Nodes: The Most Popular Kid at the Dance. Key quote: “designs at 65 nm and larger still account for approximately 43% of all wafer production and 48% of wafer fab capacity. Even more significant, nodes 65nm and larger account for approximately 85% of all design starts (see charts below, source: VLSI Research). Clearly, established nodes are not fading away any time soon.” Click here for larger image This is good news for innovation, as a diversity of choices helps support new ideas and new technologies such as 3D NAND, FDSOI, MEMS and others. These technologies will enable new products for the emerging market of IoT. A good conference to learn more about these new scaling technologies is the IEEE S3S ’16, held in the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport, October 10th thru 13th, 2016. CEA Leti is scheduled to give an update on their CoolCube program, Qualcomm will present some of their work on monolithic 3D, and three leading researchers from imec, MIT, and Korea universities collaboration will present their work on advanced monolithic 3D integration technologies, and many other authors will discuss their work on monolithic 3DIC and its ecosystem, in addition to tracks focused on SOI, sub-VT and dedicated sessions on IoT. —Zvi Or-Bach is the founder of Zvi Or-Bach is the founder of MonolithIC 3D Inc..

Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: <28nm will ramp ElishaMemoryVentures   8/31/2016 12:13:31 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Most designs are on N-2 or older generation as that is all most designs need. i think this was true in 2006 also. I 100% agree that most designs dont ramp on latest technology. Can I see an updated graph on what volume and designs are on which technology. Something in the last 4 years please? I just talked to a company who said they would never go below 28nm. they just taped out a design on 14/16nm as it will be cheaper than 28nm. I am assuming they got the info from TSMC. but maybe TSMC is confused Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author Re: <28nm will ramp bec0   8/30/2016 9:20:42 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Agreed, the bifurcation is real. The numbers support it and it has been predicted for a good time. The tech leaders are already experiencing a dramatic spend increase for developing  each node, and it is taking longer, especially when one includes the time for ramp to yield. Also, we can't split the atom (see Intel's talk). On the other side of the split, many product companies, not just the IoT/preIoT/postIoT/IoTofIoT.... folks, have plenty of processing power and memory at fully depreciated costs for human interfaced products. As well, the spectre of true3D is now here, taking advantage of older nodes and stacking monolithically...see 3D NAND. The world has changed. Dennard scaling has mostly been replaced. The economic Moore's Law has morphed. It had too...we have all gotten used to its benefits.

To meet it 14nm should had been cheaper in 2016. 2. In 50 years of efective Moore's Law the industry move quickly to the new node and closed down, end-of-life, fabs of older nodes. Now the industry is bifurcating, very few design move forward while most of the design are being design into older nodes. And foundries invest and develop enhancements to older node. 3. This bifurcating will soon dry up the funding required to develop new nodes as already been seen with Intel formally announcing slowing down to three years between nodes. 4.

Miguel Salonga29 August, 2016 (Microsoft Official website)The Microsoft Surface Book Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7. Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today According to the latest rumors, Microsoft is already gearing up for the release of Surface Book 2. The rumors are rife that the public may not have to wait longer for the release of the new Surface Book iteration, as the hybrid device is expected to arrive during the last quarter of the year.  According to a report from Bench Life, a leaked plan by Intel reveals the release schedule of the new generation Kaby Lake processors. According to the recent reports about the Surface Book 2's main features, the device may be sporting the latest Intel processing chip, and the new Surface Book's release will depend on the Kaby Lake's availability. If the leaked details from the website are to be believed, the Kaby Lake chipsets will be ready this September. In this case, the Surface Book 2 might be developed by October. Moreover, Wccf Tech reported that the Kaby Lake will boast 15W TDP or thermal design power, something that will further enhance the Surface Book's performance. The online publication also stated that with the latest developments with the Intel Kaby Lake, the Surface Book 2 will be ready during this year's last quarter, or possibly in October. On the other hand, the official Microsoft Surface Instagram account was reported to post the first look of the Surface Book 2. As reported by MS Power User, the appearance of the device on the photo is different from the original Surface Book, particularly on its hinge. The device posted on Instagram does not look to have a hinge gap. The website's unnamed sources claim that Microsoft is indeed starting to tease the public regarding the Surface Book 2, as the recently posted photo was that of the highly anticipated device. The Surface Book 2 is expected to boast many upgrades from the first Surface Book iteration released last year. The current Surface Book is boasting the sixth generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processor with NVIDIA GeForce GPU, with 1GB GDDR5 memory. It has 128GB, 256GB, 512 GB and 1 TB SSD storage variants. It is also sporting a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with 3000 x 2000 maximum screen resolution.

However, increasing the CPU frequency beyond the official specification is not the only way to extract more performance from a computing system. Memory-bound workloads can benefit from memory hierarchies with increased bandwidth and/or lower latencies. The memory controller in the Intel U-series processors (on which most, if not all, high performance SFF systems are based) is rated for operation only according to the standard JEDEC guidelines (1600 MHz for DDR3 and 2133 MHz for DDR4). However, the Skull Canyon NUC (NUC6i7KYK) can support DDR4 SODIMMs operating at 2133 MHz+. In this article, we explore the effects of varying DDR4 frequencies and latencies on the NUC6i7KYK. Background Intel's Skylake platform brought DDR4 DRAM into the mainstream market. DDR4 brings a host of improvements over DDR3, particularly in terms of operating at lower voltage and higher frequencies. Another important advantage is the maximum capacity per DIMM (moving from the usual 8GB in DDR3 to 16GB in DDR4). On standard non-overclocked systems, the DDR4 memory can operate at up to 2133 MHz. DDR4 DIMMs operating as high as 3733 MHz are available for desktop systems with full-sized memory slots. On the SODIMM side, we have seen various vendors introduce kits operating at more than 2133 MHz. However, there are very few systems utilizing DDR4 SODIMMs that also support for memory overclocking (a term I will use in this article to indicate DDR4 operation at more than 2133 MHz). SODIMMs are used in notebooks and SFF PCs. The memory in most notebooks is rarely upgraded, and many high-performance notebooks are now opting to go with soldered DRAM instead of SODIMM slots. That leaves SFF PCs as the only viable option to explore the benefits of these new wave of DDR4 SODIMMs. Skylake-U is not an effective option because its memory controller is rated to operate at only 2133 MHz. However, the Skull Canyon NUC (NUC6i7KYK), which combines a Skylake-H CPU (Core i7-6770HQ) with the H170 chipset, is a completely different platform. The BIOS includes XMP support, resulting in the appropriate SODIMM kits operating at speeds higher than 2133 MHz automatically. One of the advantages of DDR4 SODIMMs is that we can get up to 16GB on a single SODIMM. On systems like the NUC6i7KYK with two SODIMM slots, we can have up to 32GB of DRAM. To that end, for today's article we have procured 2x16GB DDR4 SODIMM kits rated for operation at more than 2133 MHz from Corsair, Crucial, G.Skill, Kingston and Patriot Memory to study the impact of memory overclocking on the performance of Skull Canyon. The Core i7-6770HQ Memory Controller and Hierarchy Our Skull Canyon NUC (NUC6i7KYK) review analyzed the platform and BIOS in great detail. The block diagram shows two channels of DDR4 memory operating at 1.2V for a 128b memory interface. When both memory slots are occupied, the two memory channels operate in dual-channel symmetric mode (also known as interleaved mode) and provide the best performance for real-world applications. Addresses are ping-ponged between the channels after each cache line boundary (64 bytes). In the case that only one slot is occupied, the operation is in single-channel asymmetric mode. The memory controller does support ECC RAM (since it is used in the Xeon E3-1500 v5 lineup also), but the feature is disabled in the Core i7-6770HQ. Intel recommends that the SODIMMs used in the NUC6i7KYK support the Serial Presence Detect (SPD) data structure. This allows the BIOS to read the SPD data and program the chipset to accurately configure memory settings for optimum performance. If non-SPD memory is installed, the BIOS will attempt to correctly configure the memory settings, but performance and reliability may be impacted or the SO-DIMMs may not function under the determined frequency. The other interesting aspect of the Core i7-6770HQ that bears relevance to the performance of the NUC6i7KYK is the internal memory hierarchy. The processor is one of the Skylake-H members to come with a 128MB On-Package Cache (eDRAM). The processor also features a 6MB L3 (LLC) cache, which is smarted among all 4 CPU cores. Each core also has a dedicated 256KB L2 cache (making for a total of 1MB L2 in the Core i7-6770HQ). Skylake's core architecture (32KB of I-cache and 32KB of D-cache) is well-known and has been analyzed before. The LLC in the Core i7-6770HQ is only 6MB (1.5MB/core), while other members of the Skylake-H family with Iris Pro Graphics (same 128MB eDRAM configuration) have 2MB of LLC per core (total of 8MB). The most important aspect here is that the eDRAM is not available only to the GPU, but also to the other clients of the memory controller. The BIOS of the NUC6i7KYK supports the Extreme Memory Profile (XMP), an Intel-developed JEDEC SPD extension for memory kits to indicate support for high-performance timings that are beyond the standard JEDEC standard. This allows 'overclocked' memory kits to be plug-and-play. The BIOS can read the extra SPD information at boot time and automatically set the memory timings to the overclocked configuration. Evaluating Memory Frequency Scaling on the NUC6i7KYK The rest of this review deals with the quantitative measurement of the effectiveness of different types of DRAM in the Skull Canyon NUC. In order to do this, we processed various benchmarks while keeping everything other than the DRAM SODIMMs constant. Each configuration was booted to BIOS multiple times to ensure that the SPD information was properly parsed and the optimal frequency / timing parameters chosen. Once the OS was booted, we also checked with multiple hardware monitoring tools that the parameters indicated by the BIOS for the DRAM SODIMMs were indeed what the OS was also seeing.

Altering the 'Automatic' DRAM timings to 'Manual' and 'user-defining' the various timing parameters as printed on the SODIMM label (16-18-18-43) enabled higher frequency operation." I'm not surprised. My G.Skill RAM (DDR3) also didn't perform as advertised in a plug and play fashion, and when I emailed to complain, they acted as if it was normal for manual entry to be required. So much for XMP compliance. Reply Ian Cutress - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link The system BIOS automatically loads the SPD profile of the memory kit unless the XMP option is enabled. In most systems, XMP is disabled as the default option because kits without XMP (most of the base ones) don't exist. Also, the SPD profile is typically left as the base JEDEC settings to ensure full compatibility. If you want true plug and play of high speed memory kits, one of two things need to happen: 1) XMP is enabled by default (but not all memory will work) 2) Base SPD profiles on the memory should be the high-speed option (means the memory won't work in systems not geared for high performance) There are a number of Kingston modules, typically DDR4-2400/2666, that will use option number (2). Some high-end motherboards have an onboard switch for (1). For everything else, it requires manually adjusting a setting in the BIOS. The problem, as always, is maintaining wide compatibility. Just in case someone buys a high-end memory kit but wants to run it at base JEDEC specifications, because the hardware they are moving the kit into doesn't support the high frequency. Reply Lissia - Monday, October 24, 2016 - link Well, in the bios it is always going to show the same, because it is /2 of the sharing memory https://clashrealm.com Reply TheinsanegamerN - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link dissapointing to see nearly no improvement in gaming benchmarks. You'd figure that a big iGPU would need more bandwidth with newer games. Perhaps current iGPUs just are not powerful enough. Maybe AMD will fix that with zen APUs next year. Reply Ian Cutress - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link It's a function of the embedded DRAM. You would expect DRAM speed to affect the iGPU less when eDRAM is present because it provides a large 50GB/s bidirectional DRAM buffer. Without eDRAM, I would expect the differences in gaming results to be more. Will have to do testing to find out - this piece was focusing primarily on the Skull Canyon environment which lists high speed memory support as a benefit. Reply Samus - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link I haven't seen a memory frequency roundup like this since Sandy Bridge, which did show a slight benefit (more than Skylake for sure) moving from DDR3 1066 through 1333, 1600 and so on. Haswell I'm sure is a similar story. I had noticeable performance improvements on AM3+ platforms going from 1600 to 2400 especially in regard to the embedded GPU. With sky lake it seems you are just wasting your money to run potentially less reliable, more expensive memory out of specification. But I wonder if CPUs without the eDRAM have the same flat scale?

NEWS August 29, 2016 From more than 120 entries from Post Primary schools all over the country, Crana College, Buncrana has been selected as only one of two schools in Donegal and 22 schools nationally for a new Junior Cycle Coding pilot initiative. Teachers from Crana College will be among the first in the country to teach the new Junior Cycle short course in Coding. The Information Technology (IT) sector continues to grow in Ireland and offers students excellent career opportunities. IT is an integral component of the curriculum in Crana College, and as it’s teachers seek to equip students with the skills they will need to meet the challenges of the 21st century Coding will play an important role in doing this. Intel has also made a donation of 900 Galileo Gen 2 Boards and teacher kits to the 22 Post Primary schools. The training and donation are part of a collaboration initiative between Intel Ireland, Lero ­ The Irish Software Research Centre and Department of Education’s Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) professional development service. Crana College teachers Thomas Boyle and Annmarie Walsh are among 56 teachers to receive training as part of this pilot. The initiative is designed to support teachers in exploring the Coding short course now available under the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015. Students will engage in technology and design related activities with the use of state of the art resources. “This donation will support schools in this innovative and exciting Coding initiative, which we hope will produce Ireland’s innovators of the future.” said Paul Phelan, Public Affairs Operations Manager, Intel. “Intel Ireland are delighted to give students an insight into technology, and allow the development of both logical and digital skills in a fun, collaborative, and innovative learning environment”. “These digital skills are vital if Ireland, and indeed Europe, is to address the coding skills shortage which has led to in excess of 500,000 open job postings across the continent in 2015. Participating teachers enjoy specific training to support their exploration of this new learning area in their schools. Both Intel Ireland and Lero support JCT in this work. “A career in computing can be interesting and creative. This project will allow students to take the first steps in exploring this potential,“ said Clare McInerney, who is Education and Outreach Manager in Lero. “We are very happy to help build capacity in schools to provide inventive short courses like Coding to their students.” “I am very excited about the introduction of Coding to our timetable”, Kevin Cooley, Principal of Crana College. “We were not included in the initial list of 19 schools in Ireland eligible to offer the Exploring Coding pilot in the College in 2016. However, we made a strong case to the Dept of Education and Science highlighting the need to offer young people in the Northwest opportunities to explore Coding as a possible career option”.

Skip to content Purism High-quality laptops that protect your freedom and privacy Search for: Menu Why Purism? Products PureOS News & Events Support My Account Global Shipping Status FAQ Forums Contact With recent chipsets, Intel offers a mechanism called Active Management Technology (Intel AMT, part of the “vPro”* featureset, specifically the Intel Management Engine) which, Intel says,“allows IT or managed service providers to better discover, repair, and protect their networked computing assets”. This means somebody can control devices remotely, even when powered off—what is officially called out-of-band system access. What?! Remote access even when powered off? Yes. This is the case with recent hardware (post 2008) from mainstream computer manufacturers. It was created, not as some conspiracy of remote access to all hardware, but as a specific request from businesses and their technology departments to be able to remotely control large swaths of systems that they own, at a lower level than the operating system. In practice, it is essentially a “backdoor”. You can imagine how that represents a serious security and privacy problem for everyone else. The good news is: AMT remote access is not possible on Purism hardware. How does Purism avoid Intel’s AMT? Intel AMT requires three parts to work. The presence of these three parts is required to enable out-of-band remote access: an Intel CPU that supports the vPro feature set; an Intel networking card; the corporate version of the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) binary. Our solution turns out to be pretty simple: We do not use an Intel CPU that has vPro (nor AMT). We do not use an Intel networking card. We do not use the “corporate” version of the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) binary. Note that we do use the “consumer” (smaller) version of the Intel Management Engine (Intel ME) binary, which we released a petition for, and continue to work with Intel to free it entirely (what Intel is calling a “ME-less” design). So, there is no hardware level remote access to Purism hardware? No, none that we are aware of, nor have put-in. As it relates specifically to Intel AMT, we neutralize the threat by avoiding Intel CPUs that have the hardware chip allowing it, we do not use Intel networking cards, and we use a version of the Intel ME that Intel claims does not have these capabilities (yes, we know that “Intel claims…” means we don’t have visibility into the source code, and yes, we know that is a concern, and yes, we are working on solving this). You’re still working on freeing the “consumer” Intel ME version used on Purism hardware. Why? It is still an issue of concern because even the consumer Intel ME binary is still, fundamentally, “mystery” non-free code that executes on the CPU. That said, this is an order of magnitude less worrysome than the enormous security hole that a complete Intel AMT system (with all three “puzzle pieces” put together) represents—a system vulnerable to all-encompassing remote access even when powered off. Conclusion Purism is proud to select CPUs that do not have vPro or AMT chips on them, we are proud to use non-Intel wireless cards to avoid any potential conflict, and are happy to know we use a smaller consumer version of the Intel ME that Intel says cannot work to offer out-of-band remote access. Therefore, Purism actively avoids Intel Active Management Technology and is working hard to improve the situation, with the aim of completely removing and neutralizing the threat of the proprietary Intel ME. *Note: vPro is an umbrella term to include a lot of features, one of those features being Intel AMT. You get AMT only with vPro chips, even though vPro chips also offer other features.

In a South by Southwest panel entitled “Who Owns Your Fans? Not You!,” an executive from computer chip-maker AMD told how he mobilized the company’s fans and used online video to spread brand and product awareness in an merging market. While AMD is a big name in chips, its sales fall far behind that of market-leader Intel. In marketing and advertising, Intel outspends AMD 60 to 1. That’s why, social media manger John Peters explained, he has to be clever to get more bang from his marketing dollar. In his address, Peters explained how he harnessed fans to further the company’s objectives in a campaign in India. Peters started his campaign to build awareness and increase laptop sales on Facebook, targeting ads to 18- to 35-year-old Indian gamers in. His company saw this as an emerging market ripe with potential due partly to the massively popularity of gaming and LAN parties in that country. Next, he identified early adopters through Facebook, gamers who felt strongly about AMD and wanted to spread its message. AMD created a point system to incentivize these adopters in non-monetary way. Fans were able to show their influence while accruing points, and could redeem points for goods. While Facebook is a great way to find fans, it’s not a great platform for working with them. That’s why AMD transitioned its fans and its point competition to a separate page that it created and ran. By hosting its own promotional page, AMD was able to share more media assets, including product videos, while still maintaining the contest point system. Fans were then able to upload their own original content. For example, one early adopter edited an online video game trailer and added AMD messaging and branding. Others could earn points by sharing that video. “Video content, we know, is extremely engaging these days,” said Peters. Working with Samsung, AMD gave away laptops and game codes to several participants. Peters made the decision not to delete negative comments from contest pages, since he wanted fans to know they were taking part in an open dialog. That decision wasn’t popular with management, Peters acknowledged, but he stuck by it. At the end of the campaign, Peters was highly satisfied with the results. Fan acquisition on Facebook cost $.81 per person. AMD saw revenue growth of $520,000 from the campaign, and enjoyed $600,000 of earned media. Fans generated over 1,000 pieces of original content, often working with AMD brand assets. When launching campaigns, Peters said marketers should define their program objectives, making sure those objectives align with company goals, and narrow the scope, if needed. After all, you’re not likely to further all of your company’s goals in one program. Start small and progress from there, he said. Remember that content is king, so supply fans with great assets, including original videos, to work with. Finally “measure, measure, measure,” so you know exactly where your campaign is working and by how much.

May Tap Intel Corporation for Future A-Series Chip Manufacturing Nikkei, citing comments from an industry analyst, reports that Intel could manufacture Apple's custom-designed A-series processors by 2018 or 2019. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Aug 27, 2016 at 7:05PM Image source: Getty.  Just a few days ago, I penned a column speculating on whether smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) would tap microprocessor specialist Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for the manufacture of iPhone-bound applications processors at some point in the future. According to a report from Nikkei, citing comments from Gartner analyst Samuel Wang, Intel has "begun to engage with Apple" for such foundry work. The analyst also believes that Intel "is likely to gain orders from Apple" by either 2018 or 2019. The foundry jackpot Until now, most of the contract chip manufacturing deals that Intel has made public have been ones with seemingly limited volume and revenue potential to Intel. However, winning a significant portion of Apple's A-series chip business would bring meaningful revenue to the company. It would also allow Intel to control an even greater portion of the industrywide unit volumes on cutting-edge chip manufacturing technology. If we assume that Apple pays around $22 per A-series processor (this is the estimate put out there by IHS Technology ), then at around 200 million units shipped per year, the revenue opportunity for the manufacture of these processors works out to roughly $4.4 billion per year. If Intel can get this deal done (something that, frankly, I'd have to see to believe), grabbing a piece of that pie would be a positive for the company and its stockholders. A potential positive for Apple Readers may remember a recent report from DIGITIMES claiming that Apple is trying to squeeze its suppliers for iPhone 7 component orders. That same report said that Apple wasn't going to try to squeeze Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) "simply because it is difficult for Apple to find alternative sources to replace TSMC." If Intel can become a credible second source to TSMC for A-series contract chip manufacturing, then Apple may be able to get better pricing on these chips. That better pricing could allow Apple to either expand its gross profit margins per device (even a few dollars saved across hundreds of millions of units adds up to a non-trivial amount of incremental gross profit) or it could allow Apple the freedom to pack even more features and functionality into its chips at roughly the same manufacturing cost. A potential negative for TSMC If Intel does, in fact, wind up winning some A-series processor orders from Apple, this would be a negative for TSMC. I wouldn't expect Intel to become the primary source for A-series chips in the event that Apple actually uses Intel, but going from 100% allocation to TSMC (as is widely expected for the upcoming A10 and the follow-on A11 chips) to, say, 60%-70% allocation would hurt year-over-year revenue comparisons. Additionally, with Intel in the mix, TSMC might have to price more aggressively, which would drive down average selling prices and, potentially, gross profit margins on the chips that Apple does buy from TSMC. That being said, I would be very careful about predicting gloom and doom for TSMC. The company's execution over the last several years has been nothing short of excellent, and I expect that the chip manufacturer will continue to very aggressively push technology development in a bid to try to keep all of Apple's orders (as well as orders from other top mobile customers) flowing through its factories.   Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Apple MacBook Pro 2016 release news, specs: New Pro may be announced some point between September and November Noriel See Aug 31, 2016 9:37 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Apple)A promotional image for the current MacBook Pro Will Apple's MacBook Pro for 2016 come out this year? There are sources saying that this year's MacBook Pro will be announced as early as September, during Apple's annual fall event, with the launching in November. However, Bloomberg believes that the MacBook Pro will not be introduced at the event. Other reports also say that it will be announced sometime in October or November. Right now, consumers will have to wait and see. The rumors indicate that Apple will not push back the launch date for the MacBook Pro and wait for Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake processing chip. The MacBook Pro 2016 will likely run on a sixth-generation Skylake processor instead. According to AppleInsider, high-end 15-inch versions of the laptop will come equipped with a new AMD Polaris graphics processing unit (GPU), while the lower-end versions will use Intel's integrated graphics processor. The 13-inch model will also be using Intel's integrated graphics. There are also speculations saying that the new MacBook Pro will likely support 5K displays with a resolution of 5120 x 2880 pixels. The new MacBook Pro will allegedly come with an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display touch bar instead of the physical function keys. The new macOS Sierra used in the laptop will feature a biometric touch ID functionality. It will also have the capabilities to support augmented reality features and applications. The new MacBook Pro will be shipped with a second-generation USB 3.1 with transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second. Siri will also be available in the new macOS Sierra. The various versions of the new MacBook Pro will probably cost anywhere between $1,299 and $1,499. Apple has yet to confirm the existence of the MacBook Pro 2016, so the release dates and specs mentioned are all speculations and rumors as of this moment.

MacBook Pro 2016 Release Date, Specs And Features (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) MacBook fans, rejoice! The MacBook Pro 2016 release date is upcoming, presumably not later than November 2016, but the refresh is likely to skip Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake chip, according to a slew of latest reports doing rounds online. Powering the purported Mac notebook instead is Skylake with the GPU muscle furnished by AMD and Intel. Although rumor mills have not ceased swirling speculations around the MacBook Pro 2016 release date hinting that Apple has pushed back the scheduled 2016 arrival of the much-awaited MacBook Pros due to Kaby Lake, Apple Insider claims that the laptops will be unveiled in the next few months, and will be running on Skylake. In other words, the impending MacBook Pro refresh will pack the seventh generation of the Intel Core-series processor in it. The report further claims that AMD Polaris 11 GPU will be used with exclusive models of the MacBook Pro 2016, especially the 15-inch premium editions. Industry watchers believe that Apple will debut the MacBook Pro 2016s in 13-inch and 15-inch form factors featuring lighter and thinner build than ever, and the latter will exclusively pack AMD's latest mobile graphics card. Citing the state of the GPU market, continued use of AMD GPUs seems inevitable with the Polaris"-series chip seemingly obvious for the imminent MacBook Pro. As far as the comparatively affordable 15-inch models and 13-inch builds are concerned, they are likely to be powered by the combination of Intel Skylake and the chipset's integrated graphics. Apple reportedly opted for Skylake as Kaby Lake is unlikely to be ready for the MacBook Pro specifications in near future. And Apple is understandably unwilling to further postpone the already delayed upgrades for the MacBook Pro. When it comes to choosing integrated graphics for most of the MacBook Pro 2016 models, the Cupertino-based tech giant seem to head towards the right direction. Integrated graphics chipsets are more advanced, and pack higher performance than ever. Moreover, benefits in power consumption for leaving out a dedicated GPU are undeniable. If rumors doing rounds proved to be true, Apple might just roll out the MacBook Pro 2016 along with the iPhone 7 in September, however MacWorld claims such a scenario is highly unlikely. The impending MBPs are rumored to pack an array of awe-inspiring upgrades including renamed MacOS Sierra, ultra-slim build and design, Touch ID-enabled power button, OLED touch bar, Apple Pencil support and Siri for Mac. MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to be unveiled by late September or sometime in October with the actual release date happening no later than November.

Robb M. Stewart, Vera Sprothen Dow Jones 12:00AM August 30, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Australia’s fledgling corporate Kangaroo-bond market is bouncing into life. For years, big businesses have discarded the Australian debt market as too small and obscure, leaving it to a tight group of supranational borrowers and investment banks. That has changed recently, however, as a sharp drop in funding costs has helped catapult the country on to the radar of several high-profile US companies, including Apple, Intel and Coca-Cola Company. Many of these companies have recently turned to Australia for the first time to raise debt denominated in the local currency through Kangaroo bonds. It is part of a wider strategy to tap new investor groups at a time when bond issuance at home has reached record highs. Eager to diversify their funding, US issuers are increasingly venturing into offbeat markets and using foreign currencies to take on debt. Coca-Cola this year raised €8.5 billion ($12.5bn) through the sale of euro-denominated bonds, while Apple has tapped lenders in Taiwan, Switzerland and Japan. Foreign-currency bond deals completed by US companies have risen to 365 this year so far, raising a combined $US77.4bn ($102bn), according to Dealogic. That’s 20 per cent more than the same period last year and more than twice as much as two years ago. The trend has been a boon for Australia’s corporate bond market. Apple’s first foray into the market last year, selling Kangaroo bonds worth $2.25bn, sparked a flurry of activity. Intel made a debut in November, followed by the financial services arm of Ford and a $1bn offering by Coca-Cola. In June, Apple returned with a second large issue. Almost $3bn of corporate Kangaroo bonds have been issued in the seven months to the end of July, according to Commonwealth Bank. It is the market’s most successful year so far, considering foreign non-financial corporate borrowers were absent for much of the past decade. They now account for 15 per cent of all Kangaroo deals, which raised a combined $32.2bn last year. Analysts and investors say another spurt is likely in coming weeks, as the cross-currency basis swap rate — a key metric for US borrowers wishing to raise debt in Australia — rose to a one-year high this month. Companies watch this figure because it defines how expensive it is for them to convert debt raised in a foreign currency back into US dollars. The current rate means they can do this at the lowest cost in a year. Adding to the appeal of raising debt in Australia is a favourable exchange rate. The Australian dollar continues to hover around levels last seen in April, boosting gains for US firms repatriating money from Down Under. “Foreign corporates can effectively get a funding advantage in Australia over Europe or the US right now,” said Martin Whetton, a senior rates strategist at ANZ, which helped manage the most recent Apple and Coca-Cola deals. Of course, the Australian dollar could weaken and exchange-rate gains fade if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates soon. But overall funding costs should remain attractive, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The reason: Australia’s four major banks have begun to heavily borrow abroad to prop up regulatory capital buffers and their funding needs are expected to remain large. Their US dollar-denominated bond sales this year alone amount to $US33bn, double last year’s volume in the same period, according to Dealogic. This flood of debt has helped push the cross-currency basis swap to recent highs. Rod Everitt, who heads Deutsche Bank’s debt-syndication business in Sydney, says overseas borrowers are attracted by the country’s $US1.5 trillion pension market, the world’s fifth largest, which provides a strong source of investor demand. But it wasn’t until Apple turned to Kangaroo bonds that others took notice. “Initially there was some scepticism,” said Mr Everitt, a manager on all three recent US bond issues. “The fact (Apple) would look at Australian dollars highlighted the market to other borrowers.” Still, investors can be choosy. Mihkel Kase, a Sydney-based fund manager at Schroders, bought Apple’s and Intel’s recent Kangaroo bonds to diversify his portfolio. But he only did so, he said, after he and his team spent hours speaking to the firms’ executives and vetting the offerings.

His book, The Alliance, helped the company crystallize its need for an alumni focus. (Photo: STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images) Tech companies put a lot of effort into talent acquisition and retention. Team strength obsesses emerging firms, and of course every CEO touts his staff as the best of the best. It’s an attitude perhaps best captured by an ad campaign that Intel ran back in 2009:   If a little startup grows into a going concern, that makes for good evidence that it attracted the very best (or at least really good) talent. At that point, it may also realize that the folks who once worked for them prove to be an asset. That’s why large innovation companies work to maintain a relationship with their alumni. When Tony Audino left Microsoft in 1995, the company wasn’t putting any effort into maintaining an alumni network. Audino wanted to maintain a connection with co-workers, so he started a Microsoft alumni group. Now, Audino runs Conenza, a company that facilitates the same work for many companies, such as HP, Nielsen and the Gates Foundation.“The interest in maintaining relationships has gone up pretty dramatically over the last 10 years,” Audino continued.  The question is, at what point does it start to make sense for a company to begin investing in an alumni network? “If you get to 1,000, people start to get interested,” Audino told the Observer in a phone call. “Above 5,000, definitely interested.” There are exceptions, Audino said. For example, the Gates Foundation is a small organization that still has an alumni network. It makes sense, however, because it really is able to attract people at the very top of their fields. Like a top 10 university, a part of the appeal of going there is establishing relationships with the others that have. LinkedIn, which has roughly 10,000 employees, runs an in-house alumni program. According to Rachelle Diamond, a manager who runs it, the network was started informally in 2008 by ex-employees, by creating a group on their old employer’s site (naturally). But two-and-a-half years ago, the company decided it wanted to get serious about maintaining relationships with its former employees, so it asked the moderators of that community to take it over. For anyone who has ever run a decently large online forum, it should come as no surprise that there was no objection. Microsoft’s and Intel’s still operate independently, however (neither alumni network responded to a request for comment from the Observer). Audino’s customers see the return on investment falling into three buckets: brand ambassadors, recruitment or re-hires (employees that return to a former employer are called “boomerangs”) and business development (your former operations chief could be in charge of IT procurement at her next gig, after all). Diamond confirmed all these points from LinkedIn’s perspective. Lots of ex-employees have told the company in one way or another that they are happy to recommend working there to others, and the company wants to maintain that goodwill. LinkedIn also sees a value in gleaning business intelligence. Staying in touch with former employees helps the company know what potential partners might want.   If a company wants an alumni network to work, at the bare minimum, Audino said, they really need to do two things: build an online platform (this can start with a Facebook or LinkedIn group—though Conenza’s company also offers a white-labelled platform) and someone on the company’s current staff needs to take responsibility for the program. Audino described how different companies do different things to go beyond the basics. Some hold events. Some put a lot of effort in online communities. Dell has a leadership network, where alumni come back and get matched up with younger employees, in a sort of mentorship role. Microsoft lets alums keep their employee discount. The Observer reached out directly to several different tech giants, but most of them (including Google, Twitter and Facebook) didn’t respond. Yahoo confirmed it doesn’t have a formal alumni effort. Diamond has put a lot of work in the last two years into learning what alums would like, and she’s finding there’s a lot of nostalgia, made more acute by an upcoming move to a new HQ in Sunnyvale, California. The company, which was recently acquired by Microsoft, has invited alums in for one of three days of lunches at the old Mountain View office this week. The cafe was always the place where employees made connections and hung out, so she said the former staff are excited to see it one last time before the company relocates. “We thought it was a good opportunity to invite people back and reminisce,” Diamond said. “They want to connect. It doesn’t have to be a fancy event.” In fact, it probably means more to come back to a familiar place than a strange, formal one.  The company has 30 offices in 19 different countries. If the lunches are a success, they will duplicate the model across all their locations. Linked also has a newsletter, which features a profile of a monthly boomerang hire (among other recurring features). Maybe home won’t have you back, but—these days—your old boss probably will.

Asciimation I'd rather live in a world full of eccentric thinkers than one full of unthinking consumers Home About WPG2 CNC Electronics. August 28th, 2016 This weekend I worked some more on the CNC machine. It’s really meant to be for laser cutting but seems to have become more of a 3D printer. Mainly since there is more involved in getting that to work. It is easier to stick a laser on a 3D printer than stick a 3D print head on a laser cutter! During the week my electronics and extra linear bearings arrived. I spent a bit of free time on Friday getting the RAMPS board fired up.  It took me a little while to get things actually working, mainly due to a string of silly but easy to make mistakes. First I needed to get the firmware on the board. I am using the latest stable version of Marlin (1.0.2-1 at time of writing). Marlin needs configuring before you install it and the way this is done is by changing #defines in a couple of header files. Being an old computer geek this isn’t too hard. Where I did go wonky though was when the code wouldn’t build.  That turned out to be and error in one of the header files, dogm_font_marlin.h. Inside there the include path to the library used by the LCD I have was wrong. It should read #include <clib/u8g.h> but the path was originally wrong. The thing that threw me was for some reason that include is in the file twice, once at the top and again half way down. I had changed it in one place and not the other. The IDE was telling me why it wasn’t building, I just wasn’t reading the error carefully enough and assumed I had fixed it! Most people probably won’t know what I am on about there. It’s probably enough to say if you are building a machine yourself there are quite a few fiddly little things you need to do to get everything working. There is documentation out there but it is all over the place. It takes a bit of digging to figure out what is the best way to do things sometimes. With the software building and uploaded to the Arduino Mega I finally got the screen and controller working. But with the motors connected I couldn’t get anything to move. One issue was when I plugged the RAMPS board onto the Arduino Mega some of the pins were misaligned and they didn’t go into the sockets correctly. I removed the board, straightened the pins and reconnected everything. Still the motors wouldn’t work. Then I realised I had made a truly daft mistake. I had followed some instructions I had found online for plugging in the stepper driver boards. I am using the DRV8825 stepper driver boards (well Chinese copies anyway). The instructions I found showed an earlier type of driver board so when I plugged mine in I plugged them in the same was as in those instructions. I should have actually looked at the boards and worked out which pin was which. Of course I had them in backwards! Luckily this didn’t damage anything. With them installed the right way around I finally got stepper motors stepping. So far so good. In the weekend I spent Saturday morning finally organising the computer wing. It’s been bugging me it was still as it was when I moved in and now I actually want to be doing electronics and making things in here so it needed a tidy up. I was also looking for some things I knew I had for the CNC machine at the same time. After organising things I find what I was looking for. An old ATX power supply out an old PC. I knew I had one floating about but couldn’t remember if it worked. It didn’t. But then I remembered I had another in an old working PC. So I pulled that apart. Some people reading this might recognise the old Intel Home PC from way back in the day when Intel decided every employee should be given a free computer! It’s the original box (was a nice HP machine with a great modular case) but had long since had the motherboard, drives, power supply, etc upgraded before finally being retired to the cupboard’o’crap in my spare room. I pulled out the supply (and also a 120Gb drive and 1GB of RAM I didn’t know it had in it) as well as the CPU and case fans. It’s an old 450W ATX supply. Not exactly a well known brand I think but it worked fine in my old machine so it should be good. The RAMPS boards needs a 12 volt supply at quite high current, 5A for the motors and extruder and 11A for the heated bed. All of this is explained (not very clearly) here. An ATX supply can easily supply the right current. There are some traps though. Some ATX supplies won’t supply a well regulated 12 volt line unless there is some load on the 5 volt line. There are tons of sites about talking about this, it’s called ATX balancing, so I won’t repeat it here. My supply seems to work ok so far but I will see when things are actually running. Converting an ATX power supply is also well documented out there. I will briefly mention what I did. First I opened it up.   I gave it a good clean as these things are always dust magnets. Then I unsoldered all the wires after taking note of which colours when where. Black wires are grounds, red are +5 volts, yellows are +12 volts. There are three other wires I was interested in, the green PS_ON, the purple +5VSB and the grey PWR_OK. The green wire is used to turn the supply on and off. If you short this to ground the power supply will turn on. The purple wire supplies 5 volts all the time (when the mains switch is on) even if the green wire hasn’t been grounded. The grey wire will show 5 volts when the power supply has turned on after the green wire has been grounded. I left two yellow 12 volt wires and grounds for the two 12 volt inputs into the RAMPS board. I also pulled out a red +5 volt wire and ground wire in case I need it (perhaps for balancing later or to run 5 volt fans). I connected the grey PWR_ON lead to a 220R resistor and a red LED to provide a visual indicator that the power supply is on. I also added a toggle switch to the PS_ON line. The switch either connects the wire straight to ground, turning the supply on, or to an external green wire so the RAMPS board itself can control it. The switch let me test everything was working with some load, in my case two old car headlights.   The next bit about how you get RAMPS to control the switching all gets a bit confusing and the documentation isn’t very clear. How I understand it works is this. The Arduino is powered either from the 12 volt supply feed into the RAMPS board or via the USB connection to the computer. The ATX supply can supply 12 volts and can be controlled via the green PS_ON green. So you can plug this wire into the RAMPS board on the provided connector and switch the 12 volt supply on and off as needed (there is an M code to do this). This works fine if the Arduino is connected via USB and getting it’s power via that. Then you can switch the 12 volt lines from the ATX supply on and off easily. The problem is if you don’t have the USB connected. If the Arduino is being powered via the 12 volt in this of course this won’t work. The ATX won’t switch on unless the Arduino tells it to but the Arduino won’t be running until the ATX supply is turned on! So we’re deadlocked. The way around this is to use the purple +5VSB wire. Since this is powered all the time we can use that to power the Arduino and then that can turn on the main 12 volt supply when needed. The RAMPS board provides a connector for this. What you need to do is wire the +5VSB from the supply into the VCC pin on the header near the RAMPS reset button. That is the top pin. The green PS_ON wire goes into the bottom pin. The middle 5 volt pin is left unconnected. That is only there to power the servo headers to the right of the reset switch. The one other VERY important thing to do is remove diode D1. This diode is what feeds 12 volt power to the Arduino. We don’t need that as we are now supplying the Arduino with 5 volt directly via that VCC pin above. It is bad to try to do both at the same time. So we disconnect D1. This is a little tricky as it is hard to reach. The tweezers point to where it was on my board. So now we have the Arduino powered directly by the 5 volt stand by signal from the supply which means it can turn on and start up. It can then tell the ATX supply when to turn on and off the main 12 volt supply. All this works with no USB connection which is handy since my controller also has an SD card slot so it can run without a PC at all. With this working I was able to hook up the supply, motors, extruder, extruder thermocouple and heatbed and test it out. Unfortunately the heated bed that came in my kit didn’t have a thermistor! I have ordered one separately but until that comes I can’t test the heated bed. I was able to test the stepper motors and that the extruder heats up and the temperature reading of that works. I haven’t actually tried melting plastic yet though as I only went up to 60 degrees C. One thing I do need to do is provide wiring for the extruder fan and for fans to cool the electronics (using one of the case fans I pulled from the old PC). So, having gone as far as I could with that, I then went out to the garage to work on the X axis gantry. This was more simple metalwork. I used my laser cut templates to mark where to drill the holes for the mounting points. I ran out of time so haven’t actually bolted everything together yet but it is coming together.    I can do more on that tomorrow evening I hope. The whole thing is rather heavy. I am not even sure it will work as a 3D printer at all. It might be too slow although I think slow isn’t a problem except it means printing anything will take forever! The problem isn’t the speed but accelerating everything up to that speed. It’s going to be interesting to see! Posted in CNC Machine | | Top Of Page Comments are closed.

Ecumenical News ecunews.com Home U.S. world Church Culture Belief Humanitarian Analysis Lifestyle Pope Francis Christmas message Korean Peninsula Fighting Fake News Middle East Christians Climate Change Jan 02, 2017, Updated at 21:56 PM EST Home Entertainment Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date updates: Device will have the best resolution among Surface Pro models Rachael Marifosque |Wednesday, August 31 2016 Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it (Reuters/Lucy Nicholson)The Surface Pro 5 will reportedly have the best display resolution of the whole Surface line. It has been almost a year since Microsoft released the formidable Surface Pro 4. Consumers are naturally wondering when the device's successor will arrive; and whether the Surface Pro 5 will be able to top it. Speculations about what features the Surface Pro 5 will carry and when it will be unveiled have been numerous. One persistent rumor involves the upcoming device's resolution and it seems consumers will be getting two options — a 2K display and a 4K Ultra HD display. If the rumor turns out to be true, then the Pro 5 will have the best resolution among the other models. The Surface Pro 5 will reportedly also have 16 GB of RAM, USB-C support, an improved Surface Pen, and is said to run on the Windows Redstone 2, which is expected to also be released in the spring of 2017, the same time frame given to the device. Another thing that the Surface Pro 5 will allegedly be getting is a new processor, the vaunted Intel Kaby Lake. Based on the processor's leaks that surfaced recently, the Kaby Lake will probably be 12 percent more efficient than the Skylake processors that the Surface Pro 4 is using. It will have Gen9 graphics and HDMI 2 support as well. This lends further credence to reports that the Pro 5 will be better all around. However, Microsoft hasn't released any statement regarding the Kaby Lake or whether the Surface Pro 5 will be carrying it. Various reports have pointed out that this doesn't bode well for the company as there are supposedly other hybrid devices set to launch this year that will be carrying Intel's new processor. One such device is Asus' Transformer Tablet 3. On a good note, a short delay in the release of the Surface Pro 5 with Kaby Lake would give the company time to really check whether the new processor is compatible with the laptop's software and avoid a fiasco similar to what happened when the Surface Pro 4 was released.

PC-Tablet News Rumors Updates Smartphones Apps Wearables Gaming Accessories Editorials Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date hints 4K Display, 16GB RAM and Intel Kaby Lake CPU By Alice Jane - August 29, 2016 Microsoft is yet to launch Surface Pro 5, but there are reports on the web about the rumors related to the device’s release date, specs, price, and features. The most recent news suggests that the upcoming Surface Pro 5 will bear same qualities with the recently released Asus Transformer 3 Pro. Since Microsoft has not yet announced the specs of Surface Pro 5, consumers are confused whether to wait until October to decide between Surface and Transformer Pro 5. Design On the design front, the upcoming Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will inherit the same qualities and appearance as its previous counterpart. There are rumors that the device will flaunt a tablet body with an optional keyboard, which can be detached from the device. According to unconfirmed reports, the keyboard will be bundled with the keyboard. On the specifications front, the Surface Pro 5 is expected to feature a high-resolution IPS Corning Gorilla Glass protected display with a resolution of 2736 x 1824. Even though the default Surface Pro 5 will include the same display size as the Pro 4, Microsoft is also planning to launch a bigger display variant with an advanced 4K Ultra HD screen with a 3840 x 2160 display resolution, most probably on a 14-inch display. Surface Pro 5 will have 4K Display According to rumors spreading on the web, the upcoming flagship will be released with a bigger display than the currently available Surface Pro 4. The Surface Pro 5, meanwhile, will be powered by an Intel Core M processor, up to 16GB RAM, up to 512GB eMMC storage space, accompanied by a high capacity rear camera, most likely 16MP. There are unconfirmed reports that Microsoft could delay the launch of the Surface Pro 5 to wait for the upcoming next-generation AMD graphics processor codenamed Polaris, or NVIDIA’s Pascal. If the reports turn out to be true, then you can expect a dedicated graphics chip with the Surface Pro 5. Surface Pro 5 Specs: 16GB RAM, Intel Core Kaby Lake CPU, NVIDIA GPU? Based on reports, the upcoming Surface Pro 5 will make use of the Intel Kaby Lake to improve the device’s overall performance, since the new processor will take advantage of all the capabilities of Windows 10. In all probability, Microsoft will launch Surface Pro 5 in October. Hence, you can expect to work with the device after the launch of new iPads and MacBooks. As of this writing, we don’t have correct information about the availability and price of Surface Pro 5. We expect Microsoft to release of both the standard and premium variants with a price higher than the currently available Surface Pro 4. Therefore, expect it to set you back around $800 for the baseline model.

For almost two years, that sole motherboard has been the only integrated solution – since then, ASUS launched the Maximus VIII Assembly which comes with a single port add-in card, and we saw a micro-ATX C236 model with a single port from MSI at Computex. We also listed the X99-E-10G WS from ASUS, a new board set to come to the market and we had an early sample. We’re still testing the board, but ASUS is officially announcing it today. The X99-E-10G WS is built like a brick outhouse, with the focus on premium workstation parts and the latest set of features ASUS could put together while still under the X99 chipset banner, rather than a Xeon chipset. The board is designed for any Broadwell-E CPU, either consumer i7 or Xeon E5 v4, with extensive heatsink arrangements to carry both the Intel X550-AT2 controller (11W), the chipset, the upgraded power delivery and additional controllers. The main feature is obviously the 10GBase-T ports, which are RJ45 compatible with most home and SMB networks. The X550-T2 controller is a PCIe 3.0 x4 part, which is an upgrade over the older X540-T2 generation that needed PCIe 2.0 x8 (and even at PCIe 3.0, you still needed 8 lanes due to controller limitations). This controller has a list price on Intel’s ARK of $80 for batches of 1000, however it probably adds nearer $100-$150 to the motherboard cost paid for by the end user. Alongside the Ethernet ports are a pair of 10 Gbps USB 3.1 ports (one Type-C), four USB 3.0 ports and the audio. The board has full support for PCIe graphics, using dual PLX8747s as high-end PCIe switches. This allows support of x16/x16/x16/x16 slots (or x16/x8/x8/x8/x8/x8/x8) while also having enough bandwidth for the X550-T2 controller, a U.2 connector running at PCIe 3.0 x4 as well as an M.2 slot also at PCIe 3.0 x4. The PCIe slots have two additional features, with integrated guard rails in each of the slots to increase rigidity and reduce RMAs, but also the PCIe latches are translucent. When the system is turned on, the main PCIe slot connectors have a LED light that implements a slow breathing effect. Speaking with the motherboard product managers, it turns out that users do not often know which PCIe slots are suitable for maximum bandwidth, and this is designed to help. The ASUS X99-E-10G WS also comes with 10 SATA 6 Gbps ports, dual USB 3.0 onboard headers, Dr. Power, BIOS Flashback, EZ XMP and an upgraded audio solution. ASUS expects the board to land with an MSRP of $650 with select authorized resellers and distributors soon.

For whatever reason the manual wasn't available when I checked just now - it could be that I'm directed to the UK page and something isn't synchronizing right?

Reply zepi - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link I have one question in mind: How is that we've had 10Gbps Thunderbolt ports and 5Gbps USB3.0 ports using copper wiring for aoens in our cheap consumer grade battery powered tiny little Chinese built devices, but we don't get 10GbE ports even in relatively expensive mid-range motherboards? Is it really just the difficulty of driving the electric load (impedances / inducatances) of 100M cable at needed frequencies (250 / 500MHz frequencies) instead of 1-5meters that is reasonable spec for Thunderbolt 2.0 / USB3 cables? Because otherwise I don't really understand what is the problem in modulating voltage to 2-4 pins of RJ45 connector?

If it was, then everyone outta have a sports car, or better off - a helicopter, because when you are in a hurry, a regular car is easily the bottleneck. 10 gibt network - that's already too slow, on the odd chances you copy "a file" (let's say data) from one pci-e ssd to another pci-e ssd. Or what if you wanted to copy data from ram to another system's ram? Big data transfers are a rarity in consumer usage, but are common in enterprise, which is the market which merits 10gbit and more. For 99.9% of what consumers do 99.9% of the time, 1gbit suffices. 10gbit internet?

This has some people up in arms, and it’s been a kerfuffle the likes we haven’t seen since, oh, Apple decided to delete the floppy drive from the iMac. It’s even bigger than the kerfuffle over Apple’s decision to remove the DVD drive from the laptops! Horrors! Or removable batteries in the laptops and phones. Horrors! And you can see just how wrong Apple was in both of those decisions… And that’s kind of my point. I could mention some more, such as, oh, the transition from PowerPC to Intel. Or the transition from ADB to USB. Or SCSI to Firewire. Or… Or… And each one has a similar set of reactions: initial outrage, a period of time (typically from about 6 months to 18 months) where there are pain points for us as we have to shift to the new technology bits and bobs, and then a realization that the new reality isn’t that bad. Except for the small but noisy group that will never get over it and wants everyone to know that. Although it’s been a while since I’ve heard anyone make that argument over the floppy drive; I expect they all died off of old age… But.. battery life! Yes, we can argue battery life endlessly, and yes, it can be a problem, but to me, it’s also a solved problem. If you need it, you can add a battery case to your phone. If you (I’m in this category) need it occasionally, buy a battery block and carry it in your bag or purse — I use this RAVpower and love it, and I hate the idea of adding weight to the phone to increase battery life unless I absolutely have to. People forget this is a physics problem: battery is heavy, and it’s clear Apple believes weight is a key feature (or problem) for the desirability of the device and so it makes the tradeoffs to keep the weight light. I for one am really happy with the result. And that’s really a forgotten aspect of Apple’s product design: It’s not about giving a product every capability to solve every problem, but to make sure it solves the problems most people have, and allowing for optional solutions for the outliers. Long battery life is an outlier for most iPhone users, so why force them to carry the weight or pay for the components they don’t need? Apple gets that. And for those that do need it, good options exist. How does Apple justify removing the port? One of the things I’ve been mulling over is how Apple is going to justify removing the port? Why is the phone better off without it? Jason’s article on this did a great job of covering why this matters and why Apple needs to explain why this change is happening, and I’ve got some thoughts about that… First, how many users use the port? Think about how usage breaks down: Users using the supplied earbuds Users using bluetooth headsets or speakers Users using the built-in speaker Users using headphones or speakers via the headphone jack What’s the mix of these? I couldn’t find concrete data, but we can make some intelligent guesses. You see Apple’s earbuds everywhere: a large percentage of users seem to be quite happy with them (I don’t know why, I find them incredibly uncomfortable, but they’re free). This implies that if/when Apple releases the new iPhone they’ll likely release it with earbuds that work without the headphone jack, and that will solve the problem for these people. What percentage of users is this? 30%? 40%? People who listen via the built-in speakers don’t care. People who listen via some bluetooth device also don’t care. How many of these are there? Marco Arment on one of his podcasts made a comment that his analytics show that as many as half of the listens going through Overcast are to bluetooth devices (or perhaps bluetooth/speaker; I couldn’t find it to verify). So I expect a major point from Apple will be that for most of us, the speaker jack is already unnecessary. What percentage is that? My guess is it’s around 70%, but it’s pretty clear that well over half of the audio emitted by an iPhone is already handled without using the jack, or will be with the new Earbuds in the box with the iPhone 7. But what’s the advantage to do this? One reason would be improved water resistance. Big steps were made with the iPhone 6s although Apple never formally acknowledged that, and removing this jack would be one more way to make the device water safe. Another advantage to removing the jack is that the jack is a huge percentage of phone failures: it’s a great way to mess up your phone so you need to replace it. So Apple can talk about reliability, and saving everyone (including Apple) money on reducing failures and replacements when the jack fails or gets junk wedged in it. Apple can use that space for improving other things, like adding improved speakers to the iPhone like it did for the iPad. I own a nice bluetooth speaker; unless I’m working in the garage, I almost never use it, because these days, I use the speakers in the iPad instead. They’re perfectly good for most of what I do. Improved speakers in the phone would push that further, because then places where I use the speaker for volume as I move around, I simply carry the speakers with me in my pocket. So that’s how I see Apple justifying this change: Most of you are already not using the jack, and that trend is accelerating. The jack is the biggest cause of failures of the phone after drops, so this will make it more reliable and less likely to fail and need replacement. I’m not sure if Apple will go for full “water safe” language, but at the very least, it’ll make it better in casual water contact situations. And they’ll have some suggestion for how removing it gives them the ability to add something else nice to the phone solving some other problem for you. Better speakers is my guess. Will that convince you? We can already guess that nothing will convince some people, and we can also know we’re going to hear from them. But I think in reality, for most iPhone users that upgrade this will be either a non-issue, or at worst be a minor hassle for a short time. I think it’s also clear that Apple is not so much forcing this change on users as it is recognizing a trend that’s already happening and at worst accelerating it along. And in a year, the dust will settle, we’ll all have gotten used to the change, and only a few percentage of the user base will still be complaining about it, just like you can still find a few people upset that they can’t swap batteries on their laptops. Most of us long since realized the advantages of the current design… (although to be honest, I’m really looking forward to moving my laptop to USB C because it’ll mean both a single combined charger for all my gear, and that I can upgrade to a battery block that will charge my phone and my laptop if needed… Yay progress!) Unintended consequences Lost in the noise about this debate are some of the unintended consequences of removing the jack — there are accessories and devices that depend on it. The big one is the Square Reader and this could create disruptions for businesses and vendors that depend on it. Is this a reason not to make the change? No, and I expect Square has a compatible replacement in the works, and if it doesn’t by now, it deserves what it’ll get in the backlash. Were you aware there’s this fun sub-culture of weird accessories that plug into the jack? Check out Etsy and you’ll see all sorts of stuff. Is this a reason not to do it? no, but these vendors will have to adapt somehow. There are medical devices that use that jack: glucose monitors for diabetics, Oximeters, blood pressure monitors and other devices. All of these devices now have versions that work via bluetooth, or occasionally wifi or the lightning port, so users have options — but it’s still a disruption. These users have to plan for the upgrade, and these vendors need to have new products moving forward, or find themselves operating in an Android-only world. So yeah, it’s gonna happen. So yeah, this is going to happen. Like it or not, our future is a bluetooth enabled one. In practice, for most of the user base, this change has already happened, or with a new pair of free earbuds, will happen seamlessly. From all indications that number is well past half, and it might be as big as three quarters. Of course, when you sell a billion devices 25% is also a huge number — and there are users of specific accessories like the Square Reader for which this might be a bigger headache — but to me it looks pretty clear Apple is following a trend here, not creating one, and that the transition for most of us will be painless or close to it. And we know from history that this won’t stop the noise and grumbling, and that a year from now, we’ll mostly have moved on, and two years from now, we’ll be surprised that people were making so much noise about something that simply seems normal now. Because that’s how it’s been every time we’ve hit one of these technology inflection points in the past… Share this: Tweet Email This entry was posted in About Chuq, Apple Inc. « Apple’s fall product event: September 7 Reprocessing old images… Two Examples » Subscribe (or else) I’m looking for my next job.

While not every sector is, the S&P 500 as a whole is, driven by huge premiums in utilities, telecoms and consumer staples. Premiums are generated by investors starved for yield and buying stocks in those sectors in lieu of bonds with historically low coupons. The key for investors is to find cheap stocks in sectors that are still reasonable. Consumer discretionary and technology are cheaper than their averages over the past 25 years, so we screened the Merrill Lynch research data base for stocks in those sectors, that were still cheap and rated Buy. We found four that look outstanding, and all have dividends that are higher than the current 30-year U.S. Treasury, which is currently yielding a paltry 2.25%. GameStop This top retailer looks to benefit from new releases. GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) operates as an omnichannel video game retailer. It sells new and pre-owned video game hardware; physical and digital video game software; pre-owned and value video game products; video game accessories, such as controllers, gaming headsets, memory cards and other add-ons for use with video game hardware and software; and digital products, including downloadable content, network points cards, prepaid digital and subscription cards and digitally downloadable software. The company also sells mobile and consumer electronics, including smartphones, tablets, headphones and accessories, as well as pre-owned smartphones; personal computer (PC) entertainment software in various genres, including sports, action, strategy, adventure/role playing and simulation; and strategy guides, magazines and gaming-related toys. As of January 30, 2016, it operated approximately 7,117 stores in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe. GameStop primarily offers its products under the GameStop, EB Games and Micromania names. Leading Wall Street analysts feel that hardware updates and the holiday release slate this year should help the gaming segment. In addition, the second-half hardware refreshes and fourth-quarter high-quality product releases could help drive traffic to the stores. We recently covered its benefits from the recent Pokémon craze and also the company’s big expansion plans. GameStop investors receive a 5.15% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $35 and the Wall Street consensus price objective is $34.90. Shares traded down fractionally to $28.66 on Monday morning, after closing down over 10% on Friday after reporting a disappointing quarter. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. The company also provides communication and connectivity offerings, such as baseband processors, radio frequency transceivers and power management integrated circuits, and tablet, phone and Internet of Things solutions, which include multimode 4G LTE modems, Bluetooth technology and GPS receivers, software solutions and interoperability tests, as well as home gateway and set-top box components. Intel reported an inline second quarter, but data center sales came in way below expectations for the tech giant. But a new partnership with Microsoft for virtual reality and a consistent shift away from reliance on chips for personal computers keep the stock a compelling buy. Intel investors receive a 2.95% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $42 price target, and the consensus target is $37.58. The shares traded Monday morning at $35.46.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Asus updates X99-E WS with twin 10Gb Ethernet connections by Zak Killian  12:56 PM on August 29, 2016 Asus released the original X99-E WS motherboard back in 2014, and reviewers were fond of its generous expansion options. Given the success of that model, it's no surprise that Asus is updating it for Broadwell-E, with the appropriately-named X99-E-10G WS. New to this version of the board is an Intel X550AT2 10-gigabit Ethernet controller. That chip and its heatsink rest amidst the I/O cluster. This does take up quite a bit of back-panel port space, but it ensures maximum reliability when using the X99-E-10G's dual 10-gigabit Ethernet ports. In addition to four USB 3.0 and two USB 3.1 ports on the back panel, the board still has headers for four more USB 3.0 and four USB 2.0 ports. Besides the new high-speed network hardware, this board also drops its predecessor's unloved SATA Express connection for a U.2 jack. Of course, it also has an M.2 socket, with screws for 60mm and 80mm M.2 drives. Both U.2 and M.2 connections are equipped with four lanes of PCIe 3.0 connectivity. Ten SATA 6Gbps ports fill out the board's storage options. Aside from those changes, the X99-E-10G WS is pretty similar to the original X99-E WS. Like the previous model, the new board uses a multiplexer to spread 64 lanes of PCIe 3.0 across seven x16 slots. That allows the board to support four PCIe x16 connections, or a single x16 and six x8 connections. Asus reinforced all seven slots to prevent users who frequently remove and reinstall cards from damaging the board. Asus says the refreshed X99-E WS will be available "soon" for a suggested price of $650.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Texas Advanced Computing Center has installed a server based on Microsoft's Catapult design. Credit: TACC More like this Intel's megachips will take on Nvidia's GPUs and Google's TPUs Microsoft Azure networking is speeding up, thanks to custom hardware How Intel plans to change servers as it breaks away from PCs Video Mingis on Tech: From superfast SSDs to Bluetooth locks and solar shingles For years, Microsoft has been delivering speedy and accurate Bing results with experimental servers called Project Catapult, which have now received an architectural upgrade. The Catapult servers use reprogrammable chips called FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), which are central to delivering better Bing results. FPGAs can quickly score, filter, rank and measure the relevancy of text and image queries on Bing. Microsoft has now redesigned the original Catapult server, which is used to investigate the role of FPGAs in speeding up servers. The proposed Catapult v2 design is more flexible in circumventing traditional data-center structures for machine learning and expands the role of FPGAs as accelerators. Microsoft presented the Catapult v2 design for the first time earlier this month at the Scaled Machine Learning conference in Stanford, Calif. Microsoft's data centers drive services like Cortana and Skype Translator, and the company is constantly looking to upgrade server performance. Microsoft is also working with Intel to implement silicon photonics, in which fiber optics will replace copper wires for faster communications between servers in data centers.  Catapult v2 expands the availability of FPGAs, allowing them to be hooked up to a larger number of computing resources. The FPGAs are connected to DRAM, the CPU, and network switches. The FPGAs can accelerate local applications, or be a processing resource in large-scale, deep-learning models. Much like with Bing, the FPGAs can be involved in scoring results and training of deep-learning models. The new model is a big improvement from the original Catapult model, in which FPGAs were limited to a smaller network within servers. The Catapult v2 design can be used for cloud-based image recognition, natural language processing and other tasks typically associated with machine learning. Catapult v2 could also provide a blueprint for using FPGAs in machine learning installations. Many machine learning models are driven by GPUs, but the role of FPGAs is less clear. Baidu has also used FPGAs in data centers for deep learning. FPGAs can quickly deliver deep-learning results, but they can be notoriously power hungry if not programmed correctly. They can be reprogrammed to execute specific tasks, but that also makes them one dimensional. GPUs are more flexible and can handle several calculations, but FPGAs can be faster at given tasks. Many large companies are showing interest in FPGAs. Intel earlier this year completed the $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, an FPGA vendor. Intel will put Altera FPGAs in cars, servers, robots, drones and other devices. Outside of Microsoft, a Catapult server, used for machine learning, is installed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas, Austin. The system is small, with 32 two-socket Intel Xeon servers, which are packed with 64GB of memory, and an Altera Stratix V D5 FPGA with its own 8GB DDR3 memory cache.  To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Under this pledge, the companies promise to do their part to close the gender pay gap. Among the companies were some major tech firms: Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Dropbox, and LinkedIn. Also taking the pledge were: Anheuser Busch, Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola, General Motors, and Nike. According to the White House, the pledge includes five main points, reported Engadget: –Acknowledging the critical role businesses must play in reducing the national pay gap. –Committing to conducting an annual company-wide gender pay analysis across occupations. –Reviewing hiring and promotion processes and procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers. –Embedding equal pay efforts into broader enterprise-wide equity initiatives. –Pledging to take these steps as well as identify and promote other best practices that will close the national wage gap to ensure fundamental fairness for all workers. The companies also vow to “conduct an annual company-wide gender pay analysis and to review hiring and promotion practices to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers,” reported CNN. “The typical woman working full-time all year in the United States only earns 79 percent of what a typical man working full-time all year earns,” said the White House statement. “While the gap has narrowed slightly over the past few years, there is much more work to be done to ensure fair pay for all.” Trending on MadameNoire View Comments Comment Disclaimer: Comments that contain profane or derogatory language, video links or exceed 200 words will require approval by a moderator before appearing in the comment section.

Not addressed were some of the unintended consequences of this progress. Facebook Live, Snapchat and Pokemon Go provide a few examples of how tech is outpacing our ability to socially (and legally) master it. Innovation unchecked can pose serious challenges to our very humanity. Best practices for user research and focusing on specific use cases have limited impact on our ability to shape the future we want. Join us in Portland and on AirMo for our Augtember speaker as we explore how to proactively preserve our humanity in a world that is increasingly digital. Specifically, we’ll learn about five things that don’t change and five things that do, and how paying close attention to them will help us be successful.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Microsoft Surface Pro 5 News and Release Date: Rumor Mill Boasts RAM, Display Upgrades; Specs and Price Details By Maverick Russel Flores Aug 29, 2016 | 6:58 AM The tremendous success of Microsoft's device line Surface Pro is undeniable. The latest release was Surface Pro 4, which celebrated its anniversary Sunday, prompting Microsoft pundits to ask: what's next? With legitimate specifications offered in a lightweight detachable tablet, the PC series can only raise the bar higher. Fortunately, details of a fifth edition are reaching the—pun intended—surface. Specs wishlist Updates on the Surface Pro 5's release date is still in the works, but PC fans are getting a glimpse of the much-awaited product through speculations and sporadic news. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit One such rumor suggests the tablet may now be armed with a Kaby Lake CPU from Intel. The chips had just been distributed to various manufacturers, which provides Microsoft an opportunity to grab hold of these powerful processors. Surface Pro had been riddled with battery issues, and the Kaby Lake CPU could be the solution to those woes. It strains the PC's battery less, in addition to rumors of it being a much faster processor than those used on today's devices. Despite the improvements on endurance the Kaby Lake can bring to the table, Microsoft is still expected to work more on this aspect. Battery life is essential for a device advertised for business, which notably cannot even last 10 hours. Besides getting a better battery model, people are suggesting tweaks in the operating system. Surface Pro 5 is reportedly set to run on Windows Redstone 2—which is charted to be released next year. Microsoft has the power to improve both their device and its operating system, therefore this is an issue that they should attend to. Furthermore, gamers who plan on buying the product are asking for a reprieve in terms of the Surface Pro's graphic card. There had been suggestions to bolster the device by adding attachments for top-tier NVIDIA graphics cards. Promising details Despite the current obscurity of important specifications, information on resolution, storage and other appendages of the device have been floating around. Surface Pro 5 may run on 16GB RAM, with 2K and 4K resolution displays. It is said to also include USB Type-C support. USB Type-C is not only backwards compatible with obsolete devices, it also boasts improved data transfer speeds and external charging support. Still, consumers are concerned about the price of the new model. Surface Pro 5 is projected to cost at least $900, with high-end variants reaching up to $1599. The price is considered a luxury compared to laptops such as Chromebooks, which can cost as low as $200. Details on the device's release are yet to come, but projections set it around next year.

Recently authorized by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), CBRS allows 150 MHz of 3.5GHz spectrum previously reserved for the US military to be used in commercial civilian applications for short-range broadband communications. The new CBRS Alliance, founded by Alphabet's Access, Federated Wireless, Intel, Nokia, Qualcomm, and Ruckus Wireless (now part of Brocade) aims to evangelize and foster development of LTE-based CBRS technology. "It started with a need for indoor coverage," Oren Binder, chair of the Alliance's marketing group and director service provider marketing at Ruckus Wireless, told EE Times in an interview. "Cellular signals from macro towers can get blocked by building materials, and downward-pointing cellular antennas provide less coverage for the upper floors of tall buildings such as hotels. So a lot of users have been having issues with indoor cellular service, issues that cell companies are unable to address." Small cells, Binder pointed out, turned out to not be viable. The problem, he noted, is that providing indoor coverage required small cells for each building. The cost as well as allocation of spectrum for numerous small cells was unmanageable. "Cell operators are not equipped to handle thousands of hotels," Binder added. Signals from cell towers have difficulty penetrating into buildings and are positioned to favor ground coverage. The solution the Alliance is promoting is to use CBRS spectrum to provide standard LTE cellular services in small areas where standard cellular service is inadequate. Such spaces could include hotels, office buildings, factories, subway stations, and other places where cellular coverage is an issue. By using standard LTE protocols, Binder noted, cellular users would be able to roam seamlessly from macro towers to the indoor CBRS systems. The frequency band has the added benefit of being relatively uncrowded, he added. But before such systems can become commonplace, Binder said, there are many hurdles to overcome. One is having a critical mass of cellular handsets become equipped with the necessary transceivers. "Thats where Alliance members like Qualcomm and Intel come in," he said. "They're already supporting this band in the new chipsets they are offering." Binder expects that the speed with which cellphones get updated will ensure an adequate supply of potential users in a few years' time." We could see deployment beginning by the end of 2017 and should see rapid adoption after that." The technologies for implementing CBRS LTE are all available, Binder said. Alliance members already have working access points and CBRS-equipped phones in early field trials, he said. Full field trials and tests of the dynamic spectrum access system (SAS) needed to ensure that adjacent installations do not interfere should be underway by the end of this year. "We've solved the technical issues," Binder said. "Now it's a matter of expanding the ecosystem and getting more companies involved." —Rich Quinnell covers industrial control for EE Times.

I just learned about an incredible piece of information with regards to Virtual SAN and some record breaking performance. This is something that current  and potential Virtual SAN customers should be able to love and appreciate. Intel continues to push the boundaries of Virtual SAN with their technologies and flash devices. Last year they delivered the World’s first all-flash 64 node cluster (The BigDaddy as I called it). This was an impressive configuration that reached a total of 6.7 million IOPS delivering about 100K IOPS per node. For VMworld, they decided to put together something nice and basically push things a bit more and showcase the very first all NVMe flash Virtual SAN 6.2 beast based on their new Intel SSD P3520 Series devices and the results are incredible. Below is cluster configuration: Eight Supermicro* SuperServer 2028U-TN24R4T servers with Dual Intel® Xeon® E5-2687Wv4 (12 Core @ 3.0 Ghz) 256 GB DDR4 RAM Boot Drive – 1x Intel® SSD DC S3710 Series (200 GB, 2.5”) Virtual SAN SSDs – 4 Disk Groups comprised of 4x Intel® SSD DC P3700 Series (800 GB, 2.5” SFF) 20x Intel® SSD DC P3520 Series (2 TB, 2.5” SFF) Intel® Ethernet Server Adapter X540-DA2 Read the entire article here, New Virtual SAN 6.2 Performance Record with Intel SSD P3520 Series via Rawlinson Rivera at Punching Clouds.

He succeeds Shayne Millington, who left the agency for McCann New York earlier this month.  DeAngelo joins StrawberryFrog from William Morris Endeavor, where he has been an executive creative director since last October, serving as part of the team leading creative for the company’s own properties and fee-based clients (including AB InBev). “We welcome Tyler as our new Executive Creative Director,” said founder and CEO Scott Goodson in a statement. “Tyler is an extraordinary thinker, innovator and creative leader who over the course of his career has produced amazing work for some impressive brands as diverse as Verizon, AB InBev, Sony PlayStation, Intel and Diageo.” Goodson added, “Beyond the work, he also has been an innovator in terms of agency models, most recently at William Morris Endeavor where he helped the agency expand its capabilities and scope of work. StrawberryFrog Co-Founder and COO Karin Drakenberg and I, along with the rest of the Frog team, are delighted to have Tyler on board.” Prior to joining WME, DeAngelo — who brings more than a decade of agency experience to the new gig — spent over two years as ECD at mcgarrybowen New York, working with brands including Intel and Verizon. That followed a little over a year in the same role with Havas Chicago, where he led campaigns for such brands as Michelob Ultra, Cracker Barrel and Sony Playstation. While with WME, DeAngelo didn’t just make ads. He also “led the rebranding of IMG’s Professional Bull Riders” and co-wrote the corresponding anthem “Hold On” for fellow WME client Steven Tyler … who later included the song on his latest solo album. DeAngelo’s work has received plaudits from the Cannes Lions, the One Show, the Webby’s and the Effies, among others. Regarding his new job, he said, “I’ve always admired Scott and this innovative agency. Like the StrawberryFrog team I believe in the power of creativity, tech and culture and the even higher degree of power all three have when seamlessly combined to support ground breaking ideas.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Samsung Reportedly Has A New Windows 10 Tablet In The Works By Adnan Farooqui on 08/29/2016 09:20 PST It has been a while since Samsung came out with a Windows-powered tablet. Samsung launched the Galaxy TabPro S some eight months ago and according to a new report, the company is now working on a successor to this tablet. The Galaxy TabPro S2 is expected to feature the latest processors from Intel and it’s likely that the tablet may also receive 4G LTE support. According to the report, four different models of the Galaxy TabPro S2 might be offered, processors and other internal components might be the differentiating factors between these different models. The company is expected to keep the Super AMOLED display size to 12 inches like the original tablet and the successor may even have the same metal body. The biggest changes will undoubtedly be made under the hood. Samsung’s new Windows 10-powered tablet may feature the latest 7th generation Intel Core M processors and upgraded RAM for a nice performance boost. Expect it to have detachable keyboard support like its predecessor. There’s no word as yet on pricing and availability. Samsung does have an event coming up as part of IFA 2016 in Berlin but it’s unclear at this point in time if the company is going to launch the Galaxy TabPro S2 at this event. Filed in Tablets..

SAN FRANCISCO, August 8, 2016 – The Zephyr™ Project, an open source collaborative effort to build a real-time operating system (RTOS) for the Internet of Things (IoT), announced today that Linaro Ltd, the collaborative engineering organization developing open source software for the ARM® architecture, has joined the project as a Platinum member. Linaro is a global organization whose 35 members include leading companies from many industry segments. Linaro joins founding members of the project: Intel® Corporation (including its acquired business groups Altera Corporation and Wind River), NXP Semiconductors N.V. (including its recent merger with Freescale) and Synopsys, Inc. As a Platinum member, Linaro will help drive Zephyr specifications and initiatives, and contribute toward the development of the Zephyr Project’s goal of becoming the premier multi-architecture open source RTOS for IoT. Linaro’s participation will especially help to ensure quality ARM® architecture support in the Zephyr Project. “Since its establishment, we have worked closely with The Linux Foundation on many common projects of interest to Linaro and its members. These have been exclusively focused on ARM Cortex-A based systems," said George Grey, Linaro CEO. "Joining the Zephyr Project signals Linaro's interest in reducing MCU OS fragmentation and helping enable ARM Cortex-M based MCUs in the Internet of Things and embedded space. We see Zephyr as a unifying project, and as an architecture-neutral RTOS. Linaro will use Zephyr as the basis for developing and testing technologies applicable to the IoT and embedded markets.” “IoT promises new levels of connectivity for embedded technologies,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. “Linaro is not only a global leader in embedded devices, but one that deeply understands the power of open source. I’m excited to see how their collaboration with other members of the Zephyr Project impacts IoT.” About the Zephyr™ Project The Zephyr Project is a small, scalable real-time operating system for use on resource-constrained systems supporting multiple architectures. To learn more, please visit www.zephyrproject.org. The Zephyr Project is hosted by The Linux Foundation, the organization of choice for the world's top developers and companies to build ecosystems that accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption. More information can be found at www.linuxfoundation.org. About Linaro Linaro is leading collaboration on open source development in the ARM ecosystem. The company has over 200 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing open source software for the ARM architecture, including developer tools, the Linux kernel, ARM power management, and other software infrastructure. Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations to everyone by working upstream, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation. The effectiveness of the Linaro approach has been demonstrated by Linaro’s growing membership, and by Linaro consistently being listed as one of the top five company contributors, worldwide, to Linux kernels since 3.10. The full scope of Linaro engineering work is open to all online. To find out more, please visit www.linaro.org.

While audio has hit a plateau of maturation to some extent, video continues to skyrocket with new technologies to render images bigger, brighter, clearer, and more colorful than ever before. The following product showcases focus on the two chief canvases of video presentation—flat panels and projection screens—and the technological developments that have allowed them to display content in an increasingly captivating, versatile, and affordable manner for almost any kind of visual application imaginable. NEC X551UHD The What: The NEC X551UHD is a new 55-inch display that rounds out its lineup of UHD models in 65-, 84-, and 98-inch models. The What Else: The X551UHD features UHD/60Hz support through its Open Pluggable Specification (OPS) slots, and enables users to insert the optional NEC SB-08DC card into the OPS slots to give users an extra HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.2 input. The SB-08DC also is fully HDCP 2.2 compliant. The X551UHD and the other displays also have the ability to enhance content non-native to the resolutions of their panels. Expanding on normal upscaling—when a full high-definition signal is brought into the system—the new UHD upscaling feature uses algorithms to adjust pixels based on the intensity and color of surrounding pixels in order to provide an even sharper and richer image. The Bottom Line: Featuring 4,000:1 contrast ratio and up to 10-bit color performance, X551UHD’s high-resolution imagery and versatility make it well suited for a variety of applications, including design, corporate, retail, and transportation. LG Dual-View Flat OLED The What: LG’s Dual-View Flat OLED is the first digital signage solution to offer OLED technology to the commercial marketplace, according to the company, and provides a two-sided media experience in 1080p resolution. The What Else: OLED is a new category of display that delivers a dynamic picture with deep blacks and vibrant color, even from wide viewing angles, unlike what LCD/LED displays can deliver. With OLED, each of the screen’s 8 million pixels can be turned on and turned off. That means blacks rendered by LG’s OLED displays are up to 200 times deeper than those of an LCD panel, creating an infinite contrast ratio and bringing colors to life like never before possible. The Bottom Line: With its very slim profile, measuring 8.94mm (0.4 inches), and three different installation options—ceiling suspension, wall-mount, and floor stand—this unique, flat OLED commercial display allows retailers to plan the most efficient use in any retail space while utilizing a high-end display solution. ViewSonic CDE7061T The What: The ViewSonic CE7061T is a 70-inch, 10-point touch interactive flat panel display. Delivering a highly collaborative display solution, this large-format display is designed for stimulating interactive learning in classrooms and collaborative brainstorming in boardrooms. The What Else: This display, when paired with PC-less operation and pre-installed annotation software, allows multiple users to simultaneously write or draw using fingers or styluses. With 350 nits of brightness and wide viewing angles, the CDE7061T provides high visual performance in bright settings or rooms. With a built-in dual-core processor, 8GB of internal storage, and versatile connectivity options including HDMI, VGA, RS-232, RJ45, and USB ports, this commercial display provides powerful computing for annotation and multimedia playback without the need for a PC. The Bottom Line: ViewSonic’s CDE7061T is designed to assist with teamwork and collaborative sharing. From corporate huddle spaces to teaching through interactive applications using the integrated ViewBoard for Education software and Mersive’s Solstice collaboration software, the CDE7061T is engineered to help bring viewpoints, concepts, and designs to life. This display can be utilized in Android-, iOS-, and Windows-based environments. Planar UltraRes Series The What: Planar Systems is now shipping its next-generation UltraRes Series 4K LCD display line, designed for ultra-high resolution commercial applications. The What Else: Available in 98-, 84-, and 75-inch diagonal models, the latest generation of Planar UltraRes Series includes built-in Planar MediaPlex Plus Processing for enhanced versatility and control of multi-source viewing. It also offers cutting-edge video performance with support for native 4K resolution at up to 60Hz that can be driven via single-cable HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.2. Other features include advanced multisource viewing, flexibility with Intel’s Open Pluggable Specification, and advanced energy efficiency and ruggedness. The Bottom Line: The Planar UltraRes Series is designed for professionals in a wide variety of commercial uses who require a large viewing area, very high pixel density, and enterprise-level features that allow teams to collaborate around highly immersive and detailed visual information. It is also well suited for interactive digital signage in diverse settings such as retail stores, corporate lobbies, airports, and museums. Barco LDX-8482 The What: Barco’s LDX-8482 is a large, high-quality display that was optimized for use in critical business environments. The What Else: With a screen diagonal of 84 inches and UHD resolution (3840x2160 at 60Hz), this screen offers the accuracy of four full HD displays. Features include picture-in-picture support, offering users the possibility to display even more information. Using the display’s integrated OPS slot, the functionality of the display can be further enhanced to include additional sources. The Bottom Line: Engineered using the most durable components available, the LDX-8482 was designed for professional applications in which reliability is of utmost importance. This includes control rooms and crisis rooms, but also boardrooms, high-end meeting rooms, and retail and advertising applications. Sony FWD-85X850D The What: The Sony FWD-85X850D is an 85-inch Pro Bravia 4K HDR UHD display with Android operating system. The What Else: The FWD-85X850 features a number of features to enhance the viewing experience. In addition to heightened contrast through high dynamic range, it features Sony’s TRILUMINOS color technology, which enhances color depth for noticeably brighter and more realistic colors. 4K Processor X1 technology further enhances the picture’s color, contrast, and clarity, and Motionflow XR 960 refresh rate technology optimizes the clarity of high-motion video. The 85X850D’s Android OS also features Google Cast for built-in BYOD collaboration. The Bottom Line: Featuring UHD resolution and high dynamic range, plus enhanced color with TRILUMINOS technology, the FWD-85X850D is well suited for commercial applications that require the highest levels of visual impact. Panasonic EF1 Series The What: Panasonic has expanded its EF1 Series of entry-level displays to include 84-and 75-inch sizes, offering a cost-effective solution for digital signage, or for general use in the office or classroom. The What Else: EF1 Series displays feature a built-in USB media player, eliminating the need for set-top boxes or other external devices and reducing cable connections in offline environments, with updates to USB memory devices via LAN when connected to an intranet (ideal for difficult-to-access installations). An IPS panel assures excellent all round visibility and outstanding picture quality, while the narrow bezel and quality finish help enhance nearly any interior space. The Bottom Line: The EF1 Series blends high imaging performance with adaptability and efficiency, and is built for self-contained or networked digital signage or as an office, education, retail, or communication system. Samsung P Series The What: Samsung’s new standalone displays (PHF and PMF Series) provide a slim, strong and simple signage solution for environments facing tight or irregular space limitations. The What Else: Featuring a slim-depth design (29.9mm) and narrow bezel (6.9mm), the PHF and PMF displays are among the thinnest on the market and can accommodate a range of business settings. The Tizen-supported standalone displays are designed for uninterrupted 24/7 content delivery, and an integrated centralized infrared receiver further ensures continued performance in any environment. A non-glare frontal panel reduces natural and ambient light reflection to ensure continuous readability.

Da-Lite Parallax Thin The What: The Parallax Thin screen from Da-Lite features the company’s Parallax 0.8 surface for standard-throw projection, ambient light-rejecting technology, and ships assembled with a thin-bezeled frame. The What Else: Parallax Thin screens feature a 3/8-inch bezel aluminum frame that is only one inch deep, for a sleek aesthetic. The screens feature an advanced optical lens system that rejects light. This new technology mimics the look of a television when it is on and when it is off, but without the glare from windows or lighting fixtures. The Parallax material’s micro-layered optical lens system blocks 96 percent of ambient light, while allowing for an 85-degree-wide viewing half angle. The Bottom Line: With its extremely wide viewing angles, no speckle, and no glare, the Parallax Thin is well suited for a range of applications in pro AV as well as home theater. Elite Screens Manual Grande The What: Elite Screens’ Manual Grande is a 180-inch, manually retractable projection screen for large-venue presentations. The What Else: The Manual Grande’s MaxWhite 1.1-gain front projection material has a wide viewing angle to accommodate large gatherings. It is also black-backed to eliminate light penetration for enhanced brightness, while the black masking borders on all sides mitigate projector overshoot while enhancing perceived visual contrast. The material is also GREENGUARD and GREENGUARD Gold (UL 2818) certified for safe indoor air quality emissions. The housing is of a durable aluminum construction. It is moisture resistant and available in black or white colors. The Bottom Line: The Manual Grande is specifically crafted for large-room presentations, classrooms, training facilities, lecture halls, and other large-venue applications. It ships fully assembled and is easy to install using the most basic tools. Stewart Filmscreen Model AT-1.5 The What: The Model AT from Stewart Filmscreen is an aluminum-tube-frame professional large-venue projection screen available in front-and rear-projection configurations in sizes up to 15 feet high by 32 feet wide. The What Else: The AT frame series are made with seamless aluminum tubing, heliarc welds, shock (stretch) cord, and “S” hooks to secure screen edge through grommets. The screen’s frame assembles in minutes with factory slip-joint corners. Each system is designed and built to a user’s individual specifications and need. Available in either a two-inch or three-inch tube frame for draping or masking on the job site, the AT series comes in a variety of gains, ranging from 0.7 to 3.0, in gray, white, off-white, and 3D finishes. The Bottom Line: Stewart’s Model AT’s custom-engineered design, large sizes, and selection of gain and finish options make it well suited to a variety of applications, including broadcast, postproduction, and commercial AV. AV Stumpfl Fullwhite The What: The AV Stumpfl Fullwhite is a borderless front projection screen designed to give the appearance of floating in space. It is available in variable dimensions and custom formats. The What Else: Fullwhite screens feature vinyl surfaces—available in a variety of different types, including 3D and high gain—that can be stretched easily and attached to the frame with specially developed hooks on the rear side of the screen’s frame. The frame features a uniquely shaped profile: one side of the profile is skewed to the rear side of the screen by 45 degrees, making the frame invisible when viewed slightly from the side. Fullwhite screens are usually flown on stage or mounted on walls, but AV Stumpfl offers a number of different mounting options to meet the needs of customers. The Bottom Line: The Fullwhite’s borderless design allows for use in variety of applications, and multiple screens can be connected to created projected walls or cubes. Draper Ultimate Access XL The What: The Draper Ultimate Access XL/Series V is a tab-tensioned electric projection screen for ceiling-recessed installation. The all-new Ultimate Access XL, available up to 22 feet, replaces the Signature/Series V. The What Else: This new series carries over the improvements made to the Access case, including the same re-engineered Access bottom closure panel which is easier to attach, and has an improved overall engagement with the screen housing. An improved “T” bracket engagement allows the panel to hinge downward for service, eliminating the need to make extra trips up and down the ladder carrying the closure. The Ultimate Access XL is available in a variety of materials, including Gray XH600V, Pure White XT1300V and MH1500V, and Matte White XT1000E. The Bottom Line: Ultimate Access XL has an independently motorized ceiling closure. In its closed position, the motorized closure forms a solid bottom panel giving the ceiling a clean appearance. At the touch of a switch or wireless transmitter, the door opens into the case before the viewing surface descends into the room. Pro Display Ultra Black The What: Pro Display’s Ultra Black diffusion screen is a black-tinted rear-projection screen, providing high contrast and resolution. The What Else: The non-glare matte surface provides sharp, bright images at all angles. Featuring a peak gain of 2.4 and 140-degree viewing angle in sizes ranging from 30 to 138 inches (with custom sizes and shapes available), Ultra Black provides a cost effective alternative to other black screen technologies. The Bottom Line: Pro Display’s Ultra Black screen technology is designed for high-end video and advertising, and is especially suited to control room, home cinema, and multi-screen applications. dnp LaserPanel The What: The dnp LaserPanel is a high-contrast, wall-mounted projection screen designed to be used with an above-mounted ultra short throw projector. The What Else: dnp LaserPanels are based on optical screen technology, and powered by a laser projector mounted over the screen, which shoots down from a steep angle. The display is mounted on the wall like LED flat screens. The compact, 100-inch display can be fitted into any conference and meeting room, and is available as a one-box solution including laser projector, screen, and projector mount (touch version). All elements of the display can be mounted on the wall with the projector above or below the screen. The Bottom Line: The dnp LaserPanel is available in a standard version and a Touch version for interactive presentations. The dnp LaserPanel Touch is equipped with an interactive camera and IR pen. Both versions are designed to offer a cost-effective alternative to a large-screen flat panel display. Severtson 4K Thin Bezel Series The What: The Severtson 4K Thin Bezel Series is a collection of premium fixed-frame Severtson projection screens that offer a sturdy extruded aluminum frame with a 3/8-inch visible bezel which can be removed for customers desiring zero-edge border options. The What Else: The 4K Thin Bezel Series’ durable, aluminum frames offer the thinnest visible frame that Severtson Screens can provide for a clean appearance that maximizes the viewable area. Customers can choose from a variety of tensioned screen materials with optional optical coatings or acoustic options. The series includes the SAT-4K, a pro AV screen with virtually no size limitations. Acoustically transparent, the entire sound stage can be placed directly behind the screen at the same horizontal axis. The Bottom Line: Available in Impression, Deluxe, and Deluxe Curved configurations, 4K Thin Bezel Series screens meet or exceed all industry standards for optimum video and acoustic performance, providing reference-quality reproduction of the digital image combined with true fidelity of the original soundtrack. Nippura Blue Ocean The What: The Nippura Blue Ocean is a line of rear-projection screens designed to maximize the capabilities of any high definition projector, including in ambient light conditions. The What Else: Blue Ocean projection screens are cast into a high-tolerance viewing plane centered between two ultra-clear panels of cell-cast acrylic, the same type of material used in fighter jet canopies and the world’s largest aquariums. The thickness of each screen can be fabricated so that it maintains its form without external frames or tension systems. Its frameless design is engineered for high definition projected images without borders to amplify the depth of the viewing experience. The Bottom Line: Standard sizes are available in 72, 84, and 100 inches in 16:9 aspect ratio. Blue Ocean screens can also be custom fabricated into nearly any geometric shape imaginable: curved walls, hemispheres, teardrops, or tunnels. Seymour-Screen Excellence TAM-4 The What: The True Aspect Masking (TAM) 4-way screen from Seymour-Screen Excellence features motorized masking technology that allows for the same image area for any aspect ratio between 16:9 and 2.40:1. The What Else: The TAM-4 features one of the industry’s thinnest borders and sophisticated frame design, with an added secondary set of masks. With a narrow, 4-inch border and 6-inch depth, the TAM-4 screen maximizes the available image space in the installation, and features high acoustical transparency with its Enlightor 4K screen fabric. The constant-area screen uses four independent acoustically transparent masks. It is therefore well suited for any lens that can zoom from standard 16:9 to “scope” ratio content that varies up to 2.40. The Bottom Line: The TAM-4 combines a reference-quality projection screen with automated masks controlled electronically for complete, versatile masking with any automation system. It can also be simply controlled by IR or RF remotes. Screen Innovations 5 Series Motorized The What: The Screen Innovations 5 Series Motorized line of projection screens is engineered for versatility, and is available in a wide variety of sizes, aspect ratios, and surface materials to accommodate nearly any application. The What Else: The 5 Series Motorized screens are precision cut on computer-drive cables, and are built with dependable Somfy motors. The motor limits are designed to be simple to set up and operate with all included controls—wall switch, IR receiving eye, IR remote control, and low-voltage trigger. Surface materials for the 5 Series include the 65-percent ambient light-rejecting Slate, acoustically transparent Maestro, and ultra-fine Pure. The Bottom Line: The 5 Series Motorized is designed to suit the needs of a variety of use cases, including business, houses of worship, hotels, conference rooms, colleges, universities, and more.

With the promise of durability and performance, this new option looks like the ideal utilitarian machine, but is it actually worth your attention? Hardware Just like most of Lenovo’s ThinkPad laptops, the 13 features a pretty understated look. The matte black plastic construction isn’t anything impressive, but it is quite durable. I dropped the ThinkPad 13 a couple of times during my testing (once on thin carpet, the second on vinyl flooring) and it came out in perfect condition with no noticeable damage. According to Lenovo, the ThinkPad 13 is tested against military spec durability tests, so it should be able to handle anything your day-to-day life can throw at it. Despite that, the ThinkPad 13 is still pretty thin and light. It comes in at 19.8mm thin at 3.2lbs. For me, this was perfect portable both in a bag or case when I went out. What really hurts the Chrome OS version of the ThinkPad 13 is what it could have been. This machine is almost completely made out of plastic, and that’s fine. But the Windows variant is almost completely made of metal. Both machines look identical, so it’s needless to say that a metal body would have helped the Chrome OS variant stand out a bit more from the countless other plastic Chromebooks — especially at this price. Display For many Chromebooks, the display is the sore point, and the ThinkPad 13 is sadly no exception. While the more expensive options come with 1080p IPS displays, the base model I received came with a 1366×768 TFT panel. After spending time with other new Chromebooks such as the Dell Chromebook 13, Acer Chromebook 15, and more, this panel was just sad to use. Dell Chromebook 13 – 1080p, 75% brightness (left) vs Lenovo ThinkPad 13 – 1366×768, 75% brightness (right) The software felt cramped, the viewing angles are terrible on anything but full brightness — and the brightness itself doesn’t go that high either. This probably isn’t going to be a complete deal breaker for most users, but comparing this $375+ machine to others that are far cheaper, it really makes me wonder why Lenovo would opt to include such a sub-par panel. Specs And Performance Under the hood on the ThinkPad 13, you’ll find anything from an Intel Celeron processor up to an Intel i5. The model I reviewed came with a Celeron chip and 4GB of RAM, and performance was decent for that. I could easily have a handful of tabs and apps open without anything reloading or lagging. It was only under intensive loads that the ThinkPad 13 had issues, but even my i3-powered Dell Chromebook would have had trouble in the same situation. Battery Life And Charging Lenovo claims that the Chrome OS variant of the ThinkPad 13 should get about 10 hours of use out of a single charge, and in my testing, I would say that’s pretty accurate. Using the device with the brightness turned up to full might shave off a couple of hours, but overall I was pretty satisfied with the battery life. One huge advantage to the ThinkPad 13 over other Chromebooks is the charging method. While most Chromebooks today charge very proprietary connectors, the ThinkPad 13 is among the small list of the those with USB C charging ports. You’ll also find two USB C ports on this machine, one for charging, the other for data transfer, video out, etc. Keyboard And Trackpad Lenovo has always been great at keyboards, and the ThinkPad 13 is no exception. The keys on this laptop provide great travel, are very well spaced, and are just an overall pleasure to use. I adjusted to this keyboard without any issues and got up to my full typing speed within minutes. One big issue, at least for me, is the lack of backlighting. This isn’t a make or break deal for the machine as a whole, but it would have been a nice addition. The trackpad is equally solid. It’s very responsive to touch and provides a good amount of click. My sole complaint is that when the laptop base flexes, the trackpad tends not to work correctly. It will click, but it won’t come back up. This shouldn’t be a problem in normal cases, but I noticed it quite often when using this machine on my couch. Granted, this isn’t the only Lenovo laptop I’ve noticed this problem on. Final Thoughts So what’s the verdict? Good Chromebook? Bad? There’s really no way to answer that. The Chrome OS ThinkPad 13 is fine, but to compete at this price it really should have better specs. Specs don’t make everything about a product, but sadly in this case they kind of break it. The base model is overpriced and under-specced, and as of right now, the higher-end models aren’t even available for purchase. I can’t really recommend the base model ThinkPad 13 Chromebook at the moment, mostly due to the cost, but higher-end models could be well worth your time and money. Where To Buy If you’re interested in picking up the ThinkPad 13, you’ll be able to do so from Lenovo’s website only, starting at $429 (currently on sale for $386 at the time of publishing).

Monday January 2, 2017 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE Microsoft Surface Pro 5 news and release date: Launch of Kaby Lake processors hints at device's release Catherine Salvador 28 August, 2016 9:26 PM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Microsoft/Surface Pro 4)The hybrid tablet "Surface Pro 4" of Microsoft was released October 2015. Microsoft fanatics surely remember that the Surface Pro 4 was released in October, which is why they are expecting that a new model will arrive this year, in the same month. However, September will arrive in a couple of days and no one has yet to hear anything about the arrival of the Surface Pro 5. Reports claim that the Surface Pro 5 will come with the latest Intel processor, the Kaby Lake, which is set to launch in the last quarter of this year. Fresh news about the processor surfaced a few days ago, including how it is 12 percent more improved than the Skylake processors, which the current models of the Surface Pro run on. Other than that, the incoming processor is believed to prolong battery life, have larger RAM and deliver a 4K display. Microsoft has been quiet about the Pro 5's release date and specs but tech enthusiasts say that the company may not be in a rush to release the device as the Surface Pro 4 is still performing well in the market. In an article by HNGN, the company is selling millions of Surface Pro units every quarter so there is no need to immediately launch a new model. Microsoft, however, may still decide to launch the device due to the alleged rumors surrounding the Kaby Lake processor. In fact, recent leaks suggest that it will be installed to a hundred of hybrid devices before the year ends. In fact, Asus already posted an announcement on Twitter about the arrival of their own Transformer Tablet 3, which supposedly has the imminent processor. Tech enthusiasts believe that the Kaby Lake will boast of HDMI 2 support and Gen 9 graphics and will be launched alongside the processors for hybrid gadgets and slimmer-model laptops with 4.5 watts to 15 watts power consumption. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich previously announced that samples of the Kaby Lake have already been distributed to the company's OEM partners, igniting news that it will be released sometime in December.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Leak  ⋮  Mobile Microsoft Teases Fans With Surface Book 2 Hinge Image By Omar Sohail Posted Aug 29, 2016 18Shares Share Tweet Submit This is probably the first time I’ve seen Microsoft tease something on Instagram and would you know it, the upcoming Surface Book 2 has been show in the image. This could mean that we’ll be looking at a much earlier release date, unless of course Microsoft does not end up delaying its next flagship 2-in-1. Surface Book 2 Teaser Image Shows a Backlit Keyboard With a Smaller Key Travel, Revealing a Thinner Form Factor According to the teaser, Surface Book 2 is going to have a thinner form factor compared to its predecessor, along with a backlit keyboard, which is always useful in varied lighting conditions. While the notebook from this angle looks to be extremely thin, the keys present on it show that they will be able to travel a fair amount of distance, which is something that I personally prefer since it deliver a nice tactile feedback, and in some way, it also aids in speeding up the typing process, according to my experience. As for the hardware that’s going to power up the notebook, Intel’s Kaby Lake series of mobile i5 and i7 processor lineup is most likely going to be a part of the configuration. We currently do not know which GPU is going to be present and with NVIDIA’s new GeForce GTX series out, it won’t be long till we hear severe graphical improvements from Surface Book 2. In addition to this, the iGPU present in Intel’s Kaby Lake processors will definitely provide a nice little performance boost as opposed to the company’s Skylake processors. One of the highlights of Surface Book 2 will be in the resolution department and since its predecessor came with a 3000 x 2000 resolution, we expect that a 4K display will be a part of the upcoming notebook. We understand that this will stress the processor and GPU, but the improved architecture and performance boost will definitely come in handy in terms of efficiency for getting the most out of the notebook in terms of battery life, and perhaps this time, you might actually be able to enjoy AAA game titles with their video settings cranked up. Advertisement With Type-C USB ports slowly getting popular, Surface Book 2 will definitely feature one of these, but we have no information as to how many ports will be included. If a Type-C USB port is present, we expect that the underlying technology is USB 3.1 to increase the rate at which data is being transferred. If you’re going to be paying a lot of money for the upcoming Surface Book 2, then you might as well get the best of everything from it right? What impressions have you conjured up inside your head in regards to the latest teaser? Tell us your thoughts right away.

This week it introduced its first commercial product, the VT01. The new PC case inherits classic design elements of SilverStone chassis and despite the fact that Mini-STX is mainly intended for system integrators, SilverStone plans to sell its VT01 in retail as well. Mini-STX is the latest iteration of form factor for motherboards, decreasing from the 17cm x 17cm of the mini-ITX into a 12.7cm square by ditching the full-length PCIe port as well as moving the power into an external brick for a DC-input. At Computex, especially at vendors such as Silverstone and ECS (who works closely with Intel for the NUC), Mini-STX was being pushed as the platform to have in certain commercial verticals, such as digital signage, where power and adjustability are important. It aims to fit above the Core-M mini-PCs in that regard.  While the interest for small form-factor PCs is increasing mainly because such systems are small, energy-efficient, and provide good enough level of performance, there is another reason for their growing popularity. Highly-integrated systems are usually pretty inexpensive and have additional flexibility to adjust the socketable CPU in the Mini-STX form-factor. Style, affordability and a certain degree of flexibility is what SilverStone hopes the VT01 is all about. SilverStone VT01: Quick Specs Dimensions (W×H×D) 155mm (W) × 152mm (D) × 65mm (H)  1.53 Liters Weight 582 grams Motherboard Form-Factor Mini-STX PSU Form-Factor External / Power Brick 3.5" Drive Bays 0 2.5" Drive Bays 1 System Fan None CPU Cooler Dimensions Up to 34 mm in height External Connectors Audio in/out, USB Type-A and USB Type-C SilverStone’s VT01 chassis is made of 0.8 mm stainless steel and a weight just 582 grams. The case can fit in one Mini-STX motherboard with a cooler that is no higher than 34 mm as well as one 2.5” SSD or HDD. Theoretically, high-performance 34-mm coolers (such as Scythe Kodati) can support CPUs with up to 65 W TDP, hence, VT01-based Mini-STX systems can be quite powerful when paired with the appropriate hardware. The VT01 has one USB Type-A as well as one USB Type-C ports in addition to an audio in and audio out. Besides, the case has VESA mount mechanism. Initially SilverStone plans to offer the silver version of the case, but shortly it also plans to debut the black one. We also saw a blue one at Computex, which may come later. Since the case is very small, it naturally does not cost a lot: the manufacturer intends to charge $35 for it in the U.S., once it is available in approximately three weeks from now. In Europe, the case will be available late in September.

Reply eduardor2k - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link + all the backplate ports ;) Reply TheinsanegamerN - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link Interested in how this will stack up to in win's new chompin case. Any chance of a review? Also, this calls down to intel and AMD to get their rear ends in gear and get better iGPUs out there. Imagine a zen APU in this thing. Tiny LAN box. Reply tsk2k - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link That's a mini-ITX case, this is a mini-STX case. Reply jardows2 - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link Looks nice, but where can you buy mini-STX motherboards? I've seen them introduced at trade shows, but not seen any available for retail sale. Reply BrokenCrayons - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link I did a search in Amazon for the string "mini-STX" and found two motherboards for sale. One was an Asus model for ~$90 USD. Reply jardows2 - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link Thanks for the tip. For some reason, general Internet searches weren't coming up with anything. Reply fjgaude - Thursday, September 08, 2016 - link Get an ASUS at Newegg! Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link Looks like the VT101 is the actual final production version of this: http://www.tomshardware.com/news/silverstone-mini-... Reply JustSay'n - Monday, August 29, 2016 - link From the box art and the Silverstone web site, the actual product model is VT01, not VT101.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion iMac 2016 Release Date and Rumors: Apple Promises Better Graphics and a New Processor; Specs and Price Details By Christian Ver Marcelo Aug 28, 2016 | 9:25 PM The 2015 version of Apple's iMac was considered by many as the company's best performing all-in-one desktop computers of all time. With such a successful device, the Mac fans have been clamoring for a successor, so here's everything we know as of yet about the next generation. Design and Display Apple dropped the bomb last year when it announced the new iMacs with resolutions of up to 5K Retina Display equipped with a whopping 5120 x 2880 pixels. The 2016 model is expected to continue using this display technology. This display also factors in performance and power efficiency as its main driving points. On the design aspect of the machine, sadly, not much change is to be expected. With the 2015 version looking almost similar to its predecessor, the next generation would likely share the similar fate. Apple doesn't quite have the reputation with innovative and updated design through their recent devices. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Processor The release of the new iMacs comes along with the newest chipset releases of the biggest manufacturers in the industry. Intel has launched the Kaby Lake processors, which is its last 14nm processing line as it will switch to the 10nm Cannonlake architecture next year. On the other hand, the AMD Zen processor is also just released. The very robust processor allows users to tap into its processing power that features a CPU of 8 cores and 16 threads. These top of the line processors are expected to be utilized by the new range of iMacs in 2016, using nothing but the best of today's computing technologies. The 27-inch model is geared to adopt the Zen processor though, allowing for a more high-end experience for its users. Graphics With virtual reality innovations gaining speed with development and popularity, the new iMacs are set to adapt with it. It is most likely that in order to compete with its Microsoft competitors, Apple would integrate a chipset capable of maximizing VR technologies. The Polaris 10 and 11 from AMD are built on smaller and more power-efficient processors than the ones used in the current 2015 27-inch iMacs. Storage and Ports The hybrid Fusion Drive technology, currently staple for the highest-end models, are expected to be standardized across all models. Flash storage has been integrated into the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, so the 2016 iMacs are anticipated to come with this. A new USB Type-C port is also rumored to make an appearance, along with existing ports that are long overdue for upgrades. Pricing and Release Date Pricing for the next generation 2016 iMacs are expected to be at the same price range as today's lineup. It starts at $1099 for the 21-inch 1080p version, and goes up to $4099 for the 5K version with the highest spec configuration. Release date rumors vary from late 2016 to June of 2017. This goes with the new iPhones and other Apple tech set to be released this year. Sponsored Watch Your Favorite Christian Films, 24/7.

Processor: i7 4770k@4.1Ghz Mainboard: Z87 Plus Memory: 2x8gb TridentX 2400 Soundcard: PSU: EVGA 750 b2 Looks like flash is my nightmare - 08-29-2016, 02:23 | posts: 99 So i'm suffering with constantly system crashes since early this year with Win8.1/win10 + 390 drivers + any browser. 90% of the crashes appear in a stuck black screen, 10% of them appear in a common TDR and some in a BSOD with Thread Stuck in device driver. Removing 390 card and using Intel Igpu i can web browsing without a single headache. But 390 just cant deliver a stable web browsing experience. Almost every 24 to 72 hours it caused a black screen while browsing in Firefox, Chrome or even in Edge now. So this last days i started using spotify website which has flash base and the black screen there increased from a range of one every 2 days to 3 in same day. Looks like my card cant run nothing flash related, i even disabled flash hardware acceleration for Edge but yet this will cause a stuck system black screen of death. I yet not certain of not flash related browsing cause it, but looks like its flash related. In this 8 months using 390 it never crashed or caused any issue related to 3D gaming. One way to fix browser black screen before Anniversary Update was to reduce GPU memory clock to 1250mhz or rolling back to 15.11/15.12. After Anniversary Update now 15.11 cause black screens too browsing. There is a lot of dump files 0x141 related to atikmpag.sys for many of these black screens. I maybe send it back to warranty but if they dont find any problem with card it be returned, and for me it looks like a AMD driver problem more than hardware faulty since every 3D application i tried worked fine.

Keeping Chrome with flash disabled dont resolved, black screen happened again in a uncommom style. Apparently flash only increased the rate of black screens but was not the culprit. The problem is someway related to memory clock fluctuations spikes. I just dont know if it can be a problematic card/BIOS with voltage or if its AMD drivers problem. I contacted Sapphire but my card has the only/latest BIOS version and only word Sapphire say for help is RMA. But i already read other 390 users which suffer same thing and even after replacement the problem persists. @Seren so if Firefox dont have it, this reforce than is not only flash related since Firefox is the most unstable here.

I would also, if you're not running the latest bios from asus, flash the latest bios version available (2103 if I'm not mistaken); "improve system stability" they say.

My Intel PSU is the EVGA in description and with GTX770+560 runs perfectly fine. Just confirming after almost 48 hours of running 390 in AM3 platform, no crashes there browsing in a standard memory clock fluctuation. Anyway i'ill try the CX500 from AM3 in my intel setup with 390 later to see if PSU can be the problem.     chumanga1 View Public Profile Find all posts by chumanga1   (#16) chumanga1 Member Guru   Videocard: loading..

I installed it back in my intel z87 and the problem keeps up with newer drivers. Only what concern me now is if i send it to the retail they will identify the problem, why if they use only full stressing methods it will not fail, it only fail during extreme memory clock fluctuation which is caused only during browsing and the crashes are not happening every time, sometimes like i said it take 5 days to show. I played 40 hours of BF1 last week and no crashes, like i said before i had the card since december and it never crashed in full load, even furmark. It only goes crashing sometimes at browsing while memory keep fluctuating like crazy. Yesterday it crashed 2 times in a row, then i keep reproducing same usage and it only crashed again today. Just to demonstrate, a GPU-Z screenshot after i played a youtube 480p VP9 video with 390, you can notice how memory clock spiked like crazy while gpu core clock stay 300mhz always. VDDC spikes together with memory clock. 390 intrigues me, why it need to spike memory clock like crazy to run light tasks, even clicking desktop icons or anything make 390 memory spike everytime. Only way to avoid spiking is keeping some 3D application on then memory will lock at 1500mhz. http://i.imgur.com/tPLPN8Z.jpg I asked Sapphire support and they say this memory clock spikes are a AMD "feature", i just dont know for what and why since forcing 150mhz memory clock stuck with herpaderpa app cause no performance issue for video playback or tasks like that. Here GTX770 running same 480p VP9 video at same chrome browser, no crazy spikes, of course it's other brand and architeture but yet i dont understand why AMD need to spikes memory clock to light tasks. http://i.imgur.com/Fbo4HWX.jpg I just not confident this is a hardware problem because it dont crash in full load, that what make me doubt it's faulty hardware.     chumanga1 View Public Profile Find all posts by chumanga1   (#17) herpaderpa Newbie   Videocard: AMD Processor: AMD Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: Superflower 09-10-2016, 23:09 | posts: 32 hi, new program to automatically lock or reset clock state depending on load http://www81.zippyshare.com/v/sJYQ3S3K/file.html this works only for "general" usage and not hardware accelerated video and stuff to run it in background one could start the program with powershell start -windowstyle hidden od6auto.exe or from cmd powershell.exe -command "start -windowstyle hidden od6auto.exe" Last edited by herpaderpa; 09-10-2016 at 23:14.     herpaderpa View Public Profile Find all posts by herpaderpa   (#18) chumanga1 Member Guru   Videocard: loading..

After send card to warranty they reproduced the problem and decided to replace GPU with an reballing. After that they say card was working fine in their tests. So i receive it back. Give 16.10 and 16.9.2 drive a try and there was yet black screen while playing video/webbrowsing. I decided to install 15.11.1 and no more black screen crash for this. Then tried letting Windows Update install it own driver which is 16.6 in name but driver version is 21.19.137.1 which should be 16.9.2, and running it for 4 days not a single crash. So i decided to test 16.10.1 13oct and leave a playlist running in Youtube when get to bed and when i wakeup the screen was totally black again. I just getting mad with what's wrong with AMD drivers and why old driver and new Windows update driver works without a problem.

Would be funny if the PCIe clocks keep oscillating and causing driver instability. I'm curious to know what revision of 390 you have, as I have a Sapphire Nitro R9 390 w/ Backplate, as you can see here, and I have an X58 motherboard: I use Firefox and I do not have any of the issues you are referring to, so I am curious to know why. Perhaps I have different memory modules that yours? The first order of business I would suggest is redoing your chipset config, by getting the Intel Chipset package, and reinstalling them with the -overall command. (I know a few here think this doesn't do anything, but as a pro tech supporter I've had great success with this since despite popular opinion, they actually do something) By using the -overall option this will force the updated to replace all configuration files with the same build revision. Sometimes an install will get a couple of legacy files mixed with other revisions and get some form of instability. I would also increase the power to the GPU and power limit, just in case your card at idle/UVD is power starved. My card defaults are +19 mV to GPU.     Chastity View Public Profile Find all posts by Chastity   (#20) chumanga1 Member Guru   Videocard: loading..

Do you need higher voltage for full load or light tasks? The odd is than old AMD drivers are stable and Windows update 16.9.2 one too. Only AMD 16.xx drivers are broken for me. Yet if power or Intel chipset was a problem this would happen with every driver. When i apply herpaderpa tool to keep Memory clock fixed at 150Mhz or fixed at 1500Mhz then crashes stop at video/browsing. Other thing, AMD driver use fluctuating memory clock only to single 60hz monitor. When you put 2 monitor or a single 120hz+ monitor then AMD driver keep memory clock at full load 1500mhz 24/7. When i use 2 monitors and driver then keep memory clock fixed at 1500mhz all crashes disappear for video/browsing. This is AMD driver in their finest while playing a video: http://i.imgur.com/3aBp6uZ.jpg This is Herpaderpa memory clock fixed 150mhz which stop mem spiking: http://i.imgur.com/BoniqSE.jpg This is using OBS to kepp mem clock at 1500mhz and avoid crash: http://i.imgur.com/8Abaze2.jpg These tweaks are for AMD drivers which cause crashing, the ones which i specified are stable i dont need to do this.

The Internet has afforded me the ability to work from home for more than 15 years. What’s more, I can work from virtually anywhere so long as I have an Internet connection. As glamorous as it all sounds, working from home can also be stressful due to the amount of self-discipline it requires. Above all else, I’ve found that investing in efficiency pays off which in turn frees up time, the one asset that is both free and priceless. Throughout the years one of the best productivity boosters I found was adding monitors to my workstation. By doubling my desktop real estate, I could get a lot more done by not having to constantly resize and shift windows around. A few years later, I added a third display to the equation which meant I could keep even more information in front of me at once. With two 22-inch monitors and a 24-incher, I barely had enough room for my keyboard and mouse, but it was a trade I was willing to make. I’ve stuck with this arrangement for a few years now, sitting patiently on the sidelines as the display industry slowly transitioned from full HD displays (1,920 x 1,080) to Quad HD (2,560 x 1,440) and most recently 4K (3,840 x 2,160) and above. As resolution climbed and prices slid, I toyed with replacing the smaller units with monitors packing more pixels but there was this one lingering question that kept me from pulling the trigger: Could I replace my trio of displays with a single, large 4K monitor? It seemed plausible on paper considering a 4K monitor has four times as many pixels as a Full HD display, but I had a long list of concerns and questions. Chief among them was, how large of a screen would I need to view everything comfortably without having to rely on scaling? Dell recently came knocking with one of the most highly regarded 4K monitors on the market, the UltraSharp UP3216Q. Measuring 31.5 inches diagonally with a resolution of 3,840 x 2,160 @ 60Hz, this display was already high on my list of potential candidates so the timing couldn’t have been better. We are giving away this Dell bundle (XPS 13 laptop + Ultrasharp 4K monitor). Dell’s proposition wasn’t simply to review the UltraSharp UP3216Q (although a standalone review is in the works) but rather, evaluate its performance and value as part of a larger package that just so happened to address the one area on my path to optimal productivity that I hadn’t yet mastered: portability. I’ve owned a few notebooks over the years but they never really complemented my daily workflow and always played second fiddle to my desktop. Along with the monitor, Dell sent over their excellent XPS 13 ultraportable notebook – the same one we reviewed earlier this year albeit with a larger 1TB solid state drive. It was one of our favorite laptops when it debuted in 2015 and this year’s refresh with Intel’s Skylake onboard kept it at the top of our deserving list, awarding it a near-perfect score of 95 out of a possible 100 on both occasions. With some hands-on time now under my belt, I can certainly see why Tim and other members of our staff like it so much. Pictures don’t do it justice as the high-resolution (3,200 x 1,800) 13.3-inch touchscreen display is stunning in person. It has made me a firm believer that ultra-thin bezels should be adopted industry-wide. The system is plenty powerful and battery life is respectable given the QHD+ display. Most importantly, this system packs Thunderbolt 3 via USB Type-C (more on this in a bit). I could easily get carried away here but will instead direct you to Tim’s review for the full scoop on what to expect from the XPS 13. To go along with the XPS laptop, Dell also sent over a 512GB Sonnet Fusion Thunderbolt 3 PCIe flash drive as well as its own 12,000mAh power companion (an external battery pack), a USB 3.0 to HDMI / VGA / Ethernet / USB 2.0 adapter, USB Type-C-to-HDMI adapter, and even a backpack to carry everything in. That’s quite the bundle if I do say so myself and at this point, you’re probably wondering, what’s the point of all this? *** Goal #1 of this experiment was to determine whether this setup could replace someone’s desktop (or in my case, one with a triple-monitor configuration). That may sound like an open-and-shut case for some, but if you’re anything like me, it’s the type of proposition that can take your breath away. Goal #2: Dell said we could do as we wished with the hardware post-experiment. Usually, we have to return review units back to the manufacturer once the evaluation period is over. But in this case, we'll be giving away the XPS 13 laptop and the 32-inch UltraSharp UP3216Q to one lucky reader. *** Despite my passion for technology, I have deeply rooted “old man” tendencies, meaning I don’t like change. I’m the guy that rides out an OS long after it becomes obsolete and hangs on to electronics and hardware well past their prime. Again, I must say that this experiment couldn’t have come at a better time as I have been seriously contemplating gutting my Cooler Master Cosmos II case and rebuilding it from the ground up with new hardware. Now I’m second-guessing that plan. The phrase “desktop replacement” typically elicits images of massive 2.5-inch-thick beasts that weigh more than the average mid-tower. While such systems still exist, it’s usually only gaming systems that are oversized. With a Core i7-6500U, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, the XPS 13 is the prime example of a powerful system that’s incredibly lightweight and thus, portable. While not as much of a concern as it used to be thanks to cloud services like Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, regularly transferring data between a laptop and desktop can be a drag. That’s not a concern if your notebook is your desktop. And with the adapter Dell sent over, I don’t need a full complement of I/O ports as said adapter adds an Ethernet jack, VGA connector, a USB port (so you don’t lose one) and HDMI port which complements the integrated card reader, headphone jack, and USB 3.0 ports. Remember the USB Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3 I mentioned a bit ago? That’s the linchpin of this entire deal. If it didn’t exist, I wouldn’t even consider replacing my desktop with a laptop over ease-of-use concerns. Allow me to elaborate. Having a fast and lightweight computer that affords the flexibility to work anywhere is great, but when it comes to marathon work sessions, nothing can beat the comfort of a full-size keyboard, a good mouse, and lots of screen real estate. Business types have relied on their notebooks both on the go and in the office for years through the use of docking stations. The USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port removes the need for a proprietary connector. For those not up to speed, Thunderbolt 3 offers 40Gbps of bandwidth and can accomplish many tasks at once. A single reversible cable can simultaneously drive two 4K displays, transfer data and supply power to a system. Only a handful of notebooks thus far include the port and the XPS 13 is one of them. Dell sells a Thunderbolt 3 dock although suspiciously it wasn’t available in time for our evaluation. In theory, using the dock I could connect the 4K monitor as well as my mouse, keyboard, wireless headphones and Ethernet cable to the tiny box, so when it came to working in the office, I’d only need to connect a single cable to shift everything to my “desktop” workstation. That sounds incredibly desirable and virtually eliminates all the shortcomings I’ve previously had with notebooks serving as a workhorse. However, the dock is apparently not without its flaws so in the interim Dell preferred to send a less tidy alternative. I connected the XPS 13 directly to the 4K monitor using a USB Type-C-to-HDMI adapter and then all accessories to a USB 3.0 adapter. It’s not all that bad, but it's not as ideal as leveraging the Thunderbolt port for doing everything. Working with the XPS 13 has been nothing short of enjoyable although that’s to be expected. It’s one of the most aesthetically pleasing notebooks currently on the market, the system has a nice keyboard given its compact form-factor and the touchpad presented no issues. I have a standalone review of the UP3216Q 4K monitor in the works but let me tell you this: I’m not sure how (or if) I’ll be able to go back to my previous configuration. You have to get incredibly nitpicky to find any faults with this massive, gorgeous display. Although I haven’t had as many organic opportunities to use the system away from the office, the time I have spent with the setup leaves no question in my mind that it could easily stand in for my desktop. On more than one occasion I've found it convenient to do some writing in bed or get some work done outdoors. There’s something energizing about going outside and getting some fresh air, then when it’s time to come back in, I’d simply need to connect a couple of cables (one would have been ideal) to pick up work on the big screen with my trusty peripherals. Covering trade shows in the future would be a much more pleasant experience. With previous trips, I easily spent a few hours prepping my notebook to mirror my main workstation. Those headaches would be a distant memory with a desktop-replacing notebook. With the XPS 13 in “desktop” mode connected to the 4K monitor, you’ll have tons of real estate – especially if you run it at the native resolution (which may or may not involve moving the monitor a little closer to your face). What worked best for me was sectioning the display off into six equal-sized segments (creating a custom wallpaper with small markings surely helps). That way, I can comfortably have six windows visible at once. And if that’s not enough, I can always use the XPS 13’s display to showcase some more information on the side. What’s more, because Thunderbolt 3 can drive two 4K monitors, you could even add another standalone display to the mix -- talk about extremes. There are, of course, downsides. Notebooks aren’t nearly as upgradeable as custom-built desktops. Sure, you can add RAM and swap in a faster drive with more storage, but once the processor in your notebook becomes obsolete and no longer meets your needs, it’s time to shop for a whole new machine. You can’t make an apples-to-apples performance comparison between the desktop and laptop platforms, especially because we're dealing with a U-series (ultra-low power) processor. The i7-6500U in the XPS 13 is no slouch, but it’s no match for a desktop-class Core i7 CPU if you need that kind of grunt. It’s kind of like the car guys say, there’s no replacement for displacement. Don’t expect to get much serious gaming done with the XPS 13. The integrated Intel HD graphics can handle browser-based games (here’s looking at you, Cookie Clicker) with ease and even some modern titles at lower graphics settings, but if you’re a hardcore gamer, you’re going to need some help. The XPS 13 will hopefully receive Nvidia Pascal-level graphics eventually. In the meantime, Razer recently launched its Core external graphics card enclosure which is compatible with non-Razer Thunderbolt 3-equipped systems. It’s not the most economical option, but if you’re determined to do some hardcore gaming on a system like the XPS 13, options do exist to make it happen. Coming into this, I had my doubts that a notebook could serve as a true workstation, but here I sit a changed man. It’s been a real eye-opening experience and one that I won’t soon forget. You’ll want to weigh the pros and cons of your individual situation to determine if moving away from a desktop and relying solely on a notebook is the right move for you. If you’re leaning towards the latter, do note that you’ll have to make a few concessions in exchange for flexibility. Giveaway is now live! Want to get a chance to win this Dell hardware bundle?

Schindler at the Observer. He says Hillary encouraged, as part of the reset, tech firms to invest in a Silicon Valley-like Russian complex where state-linked hackers try to steal Western tech secrets under the watchful eye of the Russian intelligence services. “With encouragement from the State Department, American companies jumped aboard,” Schindler writes. “Cisco pledged $1 billion of investment in Skolkovo in 2010, and Google and Intel quickly joined the bandwagon. All three ‘just happened’ to be major investors in the Clinton Foundation too.” Education analyst: NAACP Gets It Wrong on Charters The NAACP at its annual convention in July passed a resolution stridently opposed to charter schools based on the idea that charters harm racial minorities. But the claims, writes Timothy Benson at National Review, are pure fiction. According to “four different random controlled trials,” he writes, “[charters] close racial achievement gaps, for example, at a much higher rate than do traditional public schools. Stanford University’s Center for Research on Education Outcomes found that, compared with their peers in traditional public schools, black students in urban charter schools received the equivalent of 36 days in additional math instruction and 26 days in additional reading instruction. New York State’s latest round of state assessments found that Big Apple charters are easily outpacing traditional public schools in math and English language arts (ELA).” From the campaign trail: Clinton’s Money Machine Writing in the LA Times, Evan Halper notes Hillary is engaged “in an unrestrained fund-raising blitz that makes even some supporters chafe.” Last week, one fund-raiser had a $50,000 ticket price. At another, she netted $2 million. “Along the way, Clinton’s campaign is pushing the boundaries of fund-raising further than any presidential nominee ever has. She has seized on loose federal campaign financing enforcement to substantially drive up the amount of money that can be accepted from the wealthiest donors. And her campaign has also taken advantage of GOP disarray to build a considerably more aggressive network of state and federal committees that often work merely as pass-throughs to step around legal donation limits.” From the right: Liberals’ Inequality Fantasy Liberals obsessed with inequality love to talk up the 1950s, when the top tax rate hit 91 percent, as a time of relative fairness. Bunk, says James O’Brien. Writing at the Daily Caller, O’Brien points out that the decade was really one of unfairness. The top tax rate was mostly irrelevant, because there were so few families it affected. Tax revenue as a percent of GDP was about what it is today. Government spending on social programs was comparatively nonexistent. And rampant racial and gender bias meant opportunities were far from equal: “Those who portray the 1950s as some sort of golden age of progressivism are writing historical fiction, not history.” Reporter’s notebook: Iowa the Swing State? Trump has talked about expanding the map by winning states traditionally supportive of the Democratic nominee. In one state — Iowa — he might be on the cusp of proving it. Ben Jacobs writes at the Guardian that “Republicans have only won Iowa once since Ronald Reagan — in 2004, when George Bush eked out a win by 10,000 of more than 1.5 million votes. And yet, among the traditional battleground states, Iowa has become perhaps Trump’s best hope of a win.” The reason? “Trump’s strong position is in part due to the fact that unlike in other swing states, the Iowan Republican establishment has rallied conclusively behind him.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under donald trump ,  editorial ,  fast takes ,  hillary clinton ,  naacp Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next A light in the politically correct campus darkness Read Next A light in the politically correct campus darkness Most Popular This Week 1 Science says these are the men who will make you orgasm 2 Mariah Carey closes 2016 with disastrous NYE performance 3 Massive 'anomaly' lurks beneath ice in Antarctica 4 How this home intruder got what he deserved 5 Obama’s ugly bid to snub voters and tie Trump’s hands 6 Debbie Reynolds rushed to the hospital Share Selection Columnists Johnny Oleksinski Social media users have hijacked celebrity deaths for self-glorification Adam Brodsky Count on these predictions not to come true in 2017 Benny Avni Obama's hypocrisy when it comes to interference in our politics SEE ALL COLUMNISTS Editorials DC Court of Appeals' global warming decision threatens First Amendment Grading de Blasio's pivotal year Looks like it’ll be another year of campus insanity Yule Log Click here for The Post's HD Yule Log from now until the end of the year!

Linus Torvalds Announces Linux Kernel 4.8 RC4 with Skylake Power Management Fix GO Linux 4.8-rc4 is now ready for public testing Aug 28, 2016 22:48 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  It's Sunday evening, so guess what you'll be doing in the next few hours? Yes, that's right, Linus Torvalds has just announced the fourth RC (Release Candidate) version of the upcoming Linux 4.8 kernel branch. The development of Linux kernel 4.8 continues today with the Release Candidate 4 (RC4) snapshot, and according to Linus Torvalds, things are looking quite normal at this stage. At the same time, it also seems that this is the smallest RC to date, the biggest new feature being a fix for an Intel Skylake power management bug. However, there are also the usual updated drivers, arch improvements, and some KVM changes. "Everything looks normal, and it's been a bit quieter than rc3 too, so hopefully we're well into the 'it's calming down' phase. Although with the usual timing-related fluctuation (different maintainers stagger their pulls differently), it's hard to tell a trend yet," says Linus Torvalds in today's announcement. "Regardless, it all looks pretty small." Final Linux kernel 4.8 release to land at the end of September Now that we're able to take the fourth Release Candidate build of the Linux 4.8 kernel for a test drive on our PCs, its development cycle will continue, and next week, we will get our hands on the RC5 milestone. After that, there should be only two RCs left, RC6 and RC7, until the final Linux kernel 4.8 release hits the streets, which should happen at the end of September. Until then, we invite you to download the Linux kernel 4.8 Release Candidate 4 sources right now via our website or directly from kernel.org and report any bugs you might encounter. We should also warn you not to replace your stable kernel with this one, nor install it on a production-ready operating system. This is a pre-release build intended for testing purposes only. #Linux 4.8-rc4#Linux kernel 4.8 RC4#Linux kernel 4.8 Release Candidate 4#Linux 4.8#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Debian-Based Q4OS 1.6 "Orion" Linux Distro Launches with Trinity Desktop 14.0.3 Geary 0.11.2 Email Client Improves Showing of Right-To-Left (RTL) Messages Linux Kernel 3.10.103 LTS Has Lots of MIPS Improvements, Updated Radeon Drivers ConnochaetOS 14.2 Officially Released, Based on Slackware 14.2 and Salix Linux New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Linux kernel 4.8 RC4 released New Linux Apps Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Otter Browser: An Internet browser software that tries to recreate the classic Opera UI using the Qt toolkit Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Reader comments Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository more on: Ubuntu 17.04 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

It would take two years for this operating system to be developed and released in December 1987. During this period, one Paul Maritz, would join Microsoft. It is said that he would later suggest to Microsoft to continue to develop their own operating system and desist from engaging IBM. In 1990 Microsoft cut ties with IBM and released Windows 3.0. Microsoft would go on to sell billions of dollars worth of the operating system. Paul Maritz later resigned from Microsoft in 2000 and found his own company, Pi Corporation that got bought bought by EMC. In recognision of his efforts to the computing world, Business Journal accorded him the Executive of the Year award for 2011. Paul Maritz was born and raised in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). His family later moved to South Africa where he was schooled atHighbury Preparatory School and Hilton College. He received a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Natal, and a B.Sc. (Hons) degree, also in Computer Science, from the University of Cape Town in 1977. After finishing his graduate studies, Maritz had a programming job with Burroughs Corporation and later became a researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, before moving to Silicon Valley in 1981 to join Intel. He worked for Intel for five years, including developing early tools to help developers write software for the then-new x86 platform, before joining Microsoft in 1986. From 1986 to 2000 he worked at Microsoft, becoming executive vice president of the Platforms Strategy and Developer Group and part of the 5-person executive management team. He was often said to be the third-ranking executive, behind Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He was responsible for essentially all of Microsoft’s desktop and server software, including such major initiatives as the development of Windows 95, Windows NT, and Internet Explorer. He was the highest-ranking executive to testify at the antitrust trial of Microsoft in 1999. While at Microsoft, Maritz was credited for originating the term “eating your own dogfood” also known as dogfooding. In July 1999 he announced he would have a reduced role at Microsoft, and resigned in September 2000 around the announcement of Windows ME. According to Steve Ballmer Maritz was “truly a leader among leaders”. Bill Gates stated that “Paul’s vision and technological insight has had a major impact not only on Microsoft but on the entire computer industry.” He then co-founded, and was CEO of Pi Corporation, a company backed by Warburg Pincus, which developed software for Linux with development in Bangalore, India. When Pi was acquired by EMC in February 2008, Maritz briefly became president and general manager of EMC Corporation‘s cloud computing division. On July 8, 2008 he was appointed CEO of VMware (a public company majority-owned by EMC), replacing co-founder and CEO Diane Greene. He was succeeded as CEO by Pat Gelsinger on September 1, 2012. In April 2013 he was announced as the CEO of GoPivotal, Inc. (Pivotal), a venture funded by General Electric (GE), EMC and VMware. In October 2013 he was reported to again be under consideration to become chief executive of Microsoft, succeeding Ballmer.[10] He was an angel investor in Apture. He sponsors third-world development projects and is the chairman of the board of the Grameen Foundation.

Collabora's Devs to Bring Performance Improvements to Emulated NVMe Devices GO These patches will be implemented in Linux kernel 4.8 Aug 28, 2016 21:00 GMT  ·  By Marius Nestor  ·  Share:  We reported earlier this month that Collabora's developers contributed patches to the upcoming Linux 4.8 kernel to bring the open source Intel graphics driver on par with its Windows equivalent. And now Softpedia has been informed by Mark Filion about some other interesting patches contributed by Collabora's developers to the upcoming Linux 4.8 kernel. These patches promise to add huge performance improvements to emulated NVMe devices. According to Collabora's Helen Fornazier, it would appear that it's currently possible to attach a local SSD (Solid State Drive) disk drive to a virtual machine in Google Cloud Engine (GCE) via an NVMe interface, but you won't get a good number of IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second). To achieve that, one needs to instantiate a virtual machine using the nvme-backports-debian-7-wheezy image based on the Debian GNU/Linux 7 "Wheezy" operating system, of course. It would also appear that this will only work with the Debian 7 Linux OS, as other distributions available in Google Cloud Engine won't support so many IOPS. Custom NVMe command allows for up to four times more IOPS Helen Fornazier has discovered and tested that Google's Virtual Machine Monitor, which now includes a custom NVMe command that could increase the number of IOPS up to five times faster. "This is from what I've tested so far, but it seems to be possible to get up to 5 times faster according to the original commit message; check the Technical Details sessions to see how this is possible," says Fornazier in a blog post. However, it looks like this command has to be present in the kernel you use, and there's no such support in the mainline Linux kernel. And this is where Collabora's developers will make their contributions noticed, as they have made the patch available online for anyone interested in using it. Unfortunately, since this is an unofficial (third-party) NVMe command, it will not land in the mainline Linux kernel anytime soon. But Collabora will try its best to help the NVMe workgroup implement an official extension to standardize it, as this brings considerable performance increasements to emulated NVMe devices. #Collabora#NVMe#emulated NVMe#Linux kernel#Linux subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Another Set of Updated Fedora 24 Linux Live ISO Images Are Now Ready to Download LinuxConsole 2.5 Gaming Distro Out Now with Minecraft, SuperTux, and Many Games Calibre 2.65.1 eBook Viewer Adds Driver for Kobo Aura One and Aura 2 Readers Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 Beta 1 Released with GNOME 3.20 and GNOME 3.22 Beta Apps New Leaked Image Points to Continuum-like Functionality for Samsung Galaxy S8 Asus ZenFone AR Tango-Enabled Smartphone Inadvertently Confirmed by Qualcomm HTC's Next Flagship to Be Called “U Ultra,” Rumored to Pack 6-Inch Display ASUS Launching New ZenFone With Snapdragon 835 SoC at CES Ubuntu 17.04 Skips First Alpha for Opt-In Flavors, GCC 6.3.0 Hits the Repository Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking Parrot Security OS 3.4.1 Includes GNUnet PeaZip 6.3.0 Free Archiving App Improves DPI Awareness, Adds Hamburger Menu Netrunner Desktop 17.01 "Baryon" Rolls Out Based on Debian GNU/Linux 9 "Stretch"    Collabora brings NVMe improvements to Linux kernel New Linux Apps Parrot Security OS: An Open Source and free security-oriented Linux operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux Linux Mint Xfce Edition: A community derived Linux Mint operating system that features the Xfce desktop environment Linux Mint MATE: An elegant, up to date and traditional GNU/Linux distribution based on the Ubuntu and MATE projects Linux Mint Cinnamon: An Ubuntu-based distribution of Linux that uses the Cinnamon desktop environment Otter Browser: An Internet browser software that tries to recreate the classic Opera UI using the Qt toolkit Neptune: An opens-ource Linux operating system optimized for slower computers and old hardware 4MLinux: The main edition of the 4MLinux operating system, a minimal distro for system rescue tasks Reader comments Firefox 50.1.0 Lands in Ubuntu's Repos, Multiple Security Vulnerabilities Fixed more on: Firefox 50.1.0 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Home > News By Company > Market Reports Center Tweet   Research Report on China Integrated Circuit market, 2010-2019 - market overview, size, outlook, growth and development Ever since its entry into WTO, China has become one of the regions where integrated circuit industry grows fast. In 2014, integrated circuit industry in China reported sales revenue of CNY 267.2 billion with a year-on-year growth of 11.2% and a profit of   (EMAILWIRE.COM, August 27, 2016 ) Although China integrated circuit industry has made many progresses, the gap between it and advanced integrated enterprises must be envisaged. Leading international companies are 1-2 generations beyond Chinas chip manufacturing in advanced technology. And their packaging &testing technology is more advanced too. Besides, IC design in China is just a start-up with single product. High-end integrated circuit relies on import. To secure their technological advantages, international giants has increased R&D investment. For example, the big five semiconductor companies Intel, Qualcomm, TSMC, Quatek and Hynix have reported a R&D cost of 15.9% that is close to a five-year high. While local enterprises like Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation has reported an input less than 10% despite the fast growth in R&D investment. The experience of integrated circuit development has shown that inefficient investment in R&D might further widen the gap in severe competition. Request sample at : https://marketreportscenter.com/request-sample/133471 In 2014, USD 217.6 billion of integrated circuit was imported with a year-on-year decrease of 5.9% while only USD 60.9 billion was exported, decreasing 30.6%. And integrated circuit remained the largest import. Trade deficit continues to grow to USD 156.7 billion with a year-on-year increase of 9%, which shows the overall strength of integrated circuit is still weak. Governments at all levels have issued plenty of policies supporting the development of integrated circuit. In Feb.2014, the State Council of the Peoples Republic of China issued the Outline of Promoting the Development of Integrated Circuit Industry which will serve as a guideline on the development of integrated circuit industry. Later investment funds for integrated circuit industry were issued and increased from CNY 100 billion to CNY 120 billion, improving market participants expectation and the attention paid to the industry. Meanwhile, local governments have issued supporting policies for integrated circuit. Mobile communications has entered 4G era with over 80 million out of 1.28 billion users are 4G users. As 4G spreads faster than expected, the competition in domestic low-end market will become very fierce in the coming year. Against the short supply of phone chips, local integrated circuit manufacturers will take a share of the market too. The internet of things has developed fast in China and the demand for smart city, smart transport and industrial monitoring have kept increasing. According to CRIs research, the market size of the internet of things has already exceeded CNY 600 billion and lead to a rising demand for sensors. According to the Peoples Bank of China, bank card with magnetic stripe will gradually be replaced by financial IC card. Currently, all commercial banks in China have begun to replace magnetic stripe card with financial IC card. And the number of financial IC card to be put into use is estimated to reach billions in the next few years in China. As China boasts of the largest consumer group of electronic terminal, the largest manufacturing base of electronic products as well as the largest consumer market of integrated circuit, there will be many development opportunities for integrated circuit industry in future.

Jennifer Jolly for USA TODAY Columnist Jennifer Jolly trying out tech gadgets for college students. (Photo: Roddy Blelloch for USA TODAY) Heading off to college is equal parts exciting and nerve-wracking. Just because our teens can’t wait to fly the coop, doesn’t mean they won’t want to land in a dorm room that still has all the comforts of home. Here are some high-tech, fairly low-cost ways to make their new college living space more comfy, cozy, productive, and fun. Like home, but with no annoying parents. Amazon it When I geared up for this story, the first thing I did was go to Amazon’s Off To College store. It’s quick, easy, provides checklists on the essentials, and can save tons of money on everything from Amazon's rental textbook program to it’s $50 Fire tablets. Plus, you can shop in your jammies and have stuff delivered directly to your doorstep or dorm room. Amazon’s suite of handy devices stand out this year too—for being super affordable and a great fit for dorms. Chief among them is the Fire TV Stick ($39.99); a tiny HDMI dongle that turns even the most basic HDTV into a smart entertainment hub with support for Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Video, and a ton of other apps and games. The Amazon Tap ($129.99), a portable Bluetooth speaker with the Alexa virtual assistant built right in, keeps the podcasts and music flowing during those long study sessions. Alexa’s handy voice commands also let students look up information, get the latest weather reports, or even order a pizza — just by asking for it. And with Amazon Prime Student, which your kids can try for six months before paying ($49.99 per year — half of what grown-ups have to pay), students get access to even bigger bargains, free two-day shipping, and might even be able to pick their order at one of the new Amazon Campus stores. Pocket-sized PCs Space is at a premium in any college dorm room, so a full-sized desktop computer is out of the question. Intel’s ridiculously cool Compute Sticks pack the power of a traditional desktop into a tiny HDMI stick that plugs right into any compatible computer monitor. These pint-sized PCs come with Wi-Fi built in, as well as expandable storage, integrated graphics, and a whole host of other features. There are several models to choose from, including sticks that come with Windows 10 pre-installed for less than $90. “Free” smartphone I know a lot of parents are shopping for smartphones with their college-bound students right now. If budget is key, take a look at T-Mobile's latest promotions, like getting free Samsung Galaxy On5 or J7 smartphones with family plans that include 6 gigs of data at a wallet-friendly $30 per line. The real boon here though might be the Binge On unlimited streaming feature. College kids addicted to Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, HBO Go, and dozens of others services can enjoy as much as they want without racking up data costs. That means you won’t get slammed with a surprising overage fee just because a boring lecture turned into an impromptu Game Of Thrones marathon. Moto Mod magic Moto Mod that works as a pocket-sized projector.  (Photo: Lenovo) The new Moto Z ($624.00) Droid has a really cool trick up its’ smartphone sleeve: Moto Mods. The Mods snap-on the back of the phone like high-tech magnets to transform an already awesome handset and give it some crazy-cool features. The JBL SoundBoost mod ($79.99) adds a set of high-powered stereo speakers and a handy kickstand right to the back of the phone, while the Moto Insta-Share Projector ($299.99) actually lets the Moto Z project a massive 70” virtual display onto any surface, which is perfect for a college movie night. Not your parents' beanbag chair I’ll just come right out and say it: dorm furniture totally sucks. Finding something that will fit in such a small space is a challenge on its own, and when money is tight, the result is usually some hand-me-down loveseat or chair that has more stains than a chef’s apron. Yogibo’s adult-sized bean bags (starting at $89.99) are a fantastic replacement for the worn-out, curbside college furniture stereotype we’re all so used to. They’re big, super comfortable, extremely durable, and they come in different sizes to fit any living space. Get up, stand up Have you heard that sitting is the new smoking? That’s what many are saying about long, sedentary hours stuck in a traditional computer chair. Oristand ($25) can turn any normal desk into a proper standing desk, getting your college kid on their feet while they research their term papers, browse Facebook, or play games. It’s basically a cardboard pop-up piece that folds out to create a standing desk, or folds back down to tuck away out of sight.

The Privacy Pop bed tent (starting at $129.99) is a cool, affordable way to get a little alone time without having to actually leave the room. It’s just like a real tent, complete with mesh sides and a double-sided zipper, and it comes in any size from twin to queen. Perfect for any teen who needs to be cut off from distractions during a late night study session or simply for some relaxing “me” time when they need it. Built for speed A router is the gateway between a college student and all the vital research, streaming entertainment, and information that resides online, so it’s obviously pretty important to send your kid off to school with one that won’t break down halfway through the semester. TP-Link’s Archer C9 ($149.99) is a decent dorm room companion, with lightning fast 2.4GHz and 5GHz connections and a total bandwidth of 1.9Gbps. You don’t need to know what any of those numbers mean — kids know more about these things than us parents most of the time anyway — all you need to know is that TP-Link has a fantastic reputation for quality, and the Archer C9 is a budget-friendly router with some serious muscle. Putting high-tech pen to paper Of course, some days your kid is going to be burned out on digital toys and tools, and reach for a pen and paper instead. When that happens, Moleskin’s Smart Writing Set ($199) lets them scribble notes, doodles, and stories on paper, and then the high-tech pen digitizes them. The digital copy of their work is saved right to their phone or tablet, and they can save it or share it wherever they want. It’s great for those long school days where a screen just doesn’t cut it.

The first is super cool because you can write on it, the second just wildly great looking.

Jennifer Jolly for USA TODAY Columnist Jennifer Jolly trying out tech gadgets for college students. (Photo: Roddy Blelloch for USA TODAY) Heading off to college is equal parts exciting and nerve-wracking. Just because our teens can’t wait to fly the coop, doesn’t mean they won’t want to land in a dorm room that still has all the comforts of home. Here are some high-tech, fairly low-cost ways to make their new college living space more comfy, cozy, productive, and fun. Like home, but with no annoying parents. Amazon it When I geared up for this story, the first thing I did was go to Amazon’s Off To College store. It’s quick, easy, provides checklists on the essentials, and can save tons of money on everything from Amazon's rental textbook program to it’s $50 Fire tablets. Plus, you can shop in your jammies and have stuff delivered directly to your doorstep or dorm room. Amazon’s suite of handy devices stand out this year too—for being super affordable and a great fit for dorms. Chief among them is the Fire TV Stick ($39.99); a tiny HDMI dongle that turns even the most basic HDTV into a smart entertainment hub with support for Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, Amazon Video, and a ton of other apps and games. The Amazon Tap ($129.99), a portable Bluetooth speaker with the Alexa virtual assistant built right in, keeps the podcasts and music flowing during those long study sessions. Alexa’s handy voice commands also let students look up information, get the latest weather reports, or even order a pizza — just by asking for it. And with Amazon Prime Student, which your kids can try for six months before paying ($49.99 per year — half of what grown-ups have to pay), students get access to even bigger bargains, free two-day shipping, and might even be able to pick their order at one of the new Amazon Campus stores. Pocket-sized PCs Space is at a premium in any college dorm room, so a full-sized desktop computer is out of the question. Intel’s ridiculously cool Compute Sticks pack the power of a traditional desktop into a tiny HDMI stick that plugs right into any compatible computer monitor. These pint-sized PCs come with Wi-Fi built in, as well as expandable storage, integrated graphics, and a whole host of other features. There are several models to choose from, including sticks that come with Windows 10 pre-installed for less than $90. “Free” smartphone I know a lot of parents are shopping for smartphones with their college-bound students right now. If budget is key, take a look at T-Mobile's latest promotions, like getting free Samsung Galaxy On5 or J7 smartphones with family plans that include 6 gigs of data at a wallet-friendly $30 per line. The real boon here though might be the Binge On unlimited streaming feature. College kids addicted to Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, HBO Go, and dozens of others services can enjoy as much as they want without racking up data costs. That means you won’t get slammed with a surprising overage fee just because a boring lecture turned into an impromptu Game Of Thrones marathon. Moto Mod magic Moto Mod that works as a pocket-sized projector.  (Photo: Lenovo) The new Moto Z ($624.00) Droid has a really cool trick up its’ smartphone sleeve: Moto Mods. The Mods snap-on the back of the phone like high-tech magnets to transform an already awesome handset and give it some crazy-cool features. The JBL SoundBoost mod ($79.99) adds a set of high-powered stereo speakers and a handy kickstand right to the back of the phone, while the Moto Insta-Share Projector ($299.99) actually lets the Moto Z project a massive 70” virtual display onto any surface, which is perfect for a college movie night. Not your parents' beanbag chair I’ll just come right out and say it: dorm furniture totally sucks. Finding something that will fit in such a small space is a challenge on its own, and when money is tight, the result is usually some hand-me-down loveseat or chair that has more stains than a chef’s apron. Yogibo’s adult-sized bean bags (starting at $89.99) are a fantastic replacement for the worn-out, curbside college furniture stereotype we’re all so used to.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch Samsung Galaxy S8 MacBook Pro CES 2017 iOS 10.2 Reviews Overclockers UK Titan Hadron review Overclockers UK Titan Hadron review By Kane Fulton PC & Mac desktops  A classy-looking micro machine with 1440p muscle Shares Recommended Jump to Section: Best Price Comments Our Verdict Games look fantastic and run smooth on the Titan Hadron at 1440p, thanks to Nvidia's GTX 1060 inside. Its classy-looking case hides top-tier components, including a nippy SSD and overclockable Intel processor. For Overclockable processor Primed for VR and 1440p gaming Nippy SSD storage Attractive design Against Can get a stronger GPU for less Not cut out for 4K gaming Nvidia hasn't so much shaken up mobile gaming with its desktop-grade Pascal notebook GPUs as turned it completely on its head. The company's GTX 10-series graphics card have also made a mark in the desktop space, providing an opportunity for system builders to come up with powerful, single-GPU configurations capable of running the best VR games and demanding 4K setups. Called the Titan Hadron, the latest machine from Stoke, UK-based system builders Overclockers UK promises oodles of gaming grunt, courtesy of Nvidia's GTX 1060 GPU. But, as we now know, there's no such thing as a cheap Pascal card. Even at the mid-range, Nvidia's card pushes up the Hadron's price to £1,091/US$1,4453/AUS$1,894, with an offer currently shaving £30/$US40/AUS$52 from the price. However, it's important to note that the cost includes a number of enviable features. Among them are an SSD along with a capacious HDD, an overclockable, top-tier Intel processor and, of course, one of the beefiest graphics cards around. Micro machine One of the more interesting aspects of the Titan Hadron is its design. Overclockers has gone for Fractal Design's Node 804 Micro-ATX case, which separates warmer running components from cooler ones while allowing for unrestricted airflow to the Asus Z170M motherboard and sixth-generation Intel Core i5-6600K processor inside. We're a fan of the case's unassuming appearance. Black materials dominate without appearing bland, in part thanks to a brushed aluminum finish on the front panel that contrasts with a plastic mesh along the bottom. Viewed head-on, it looks like a high-end subwoofer that's part of an expensive speaker set-up. Rotate the Titan Hadron on its side, and the mask slips, revealing a view that's more typical to PC gamers. A transparent side panel provides a view of the various components inside, which are bathed in a green light that emanates from the top of the case's roof. Spec sheet Here is the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 3.5GHz Intel Core i5-6600K (Quad core, 6M Cache, up to 3.9GHz using Turbo Boost) Graphics: Gainward GeForce GTX 1060 Dual (6GB GDDR5) RAM: 8GB DDR4 (2,400MHz) Storage: 240GB SSD; 1TB HDD (7,200 rpm) Ports: 1 x USB 3.1 (Type-C), 3 x HDMI, 2 X DisplayPort, 2 x DVI-D, 3 x USB 3.0, 2 x USB 2.0, 1 x VGA, headphone/microphone ports, Ethernet Size: 12.09 x 13.54 x 15.31 inches (H x W x D) Weight: 13.22 pounds (6kg) Don't be fooled by its name – the Titan Hadron isn't powered by Nvidia's wallet-intimidating Titan X; nor does it fire tiny particles around super quickly, for that matter. It actually opts for a more sensible choice of card in Gainward's GeForce GTX 1060, which sports 6GB of GDDR5 memory. Compared with Nvidia's newer GTX 1060 that has half the video memory at 3GB, the version on offer here is much more suited to 1440p gaming, much less 1080p. The Intel's 6600K Skylake processor is more than capable of matching the Nvidia part, the 'K' denoting that it can be overclocked to provide horsepower for gaming. It's more than up to the task out of the box, but overclocking is a welcome option to have for enthusiast users who can get their hands dirty in MSI Afterburner or another tool of choice. You won't get caught short for ports, as there's an abundance of I/O around the back. That includes a USB 3.1 Type-C port for speedily transferring data to an external hard disk or hooking up a compatible peripheral. There are two more USB 2.0 ports on the right hand side of the case, located alongside headphone and microphone ports, the power button and slot loading CD drive. These can be fiddly to access if the machine is facing a direction that hides them out of view, forcing you to run your hand along the edge to find them. Relocating them to the top of the case wouldn't have been a bad move. Benchmarks Here's how the Overclockers UK Titan Hadron performed in our suite of benchmark tests: 3DMark: Cloud Gate: 19,409 ; Sky Diver: 23,179 ; Fire Strike: 10,072 Cinebench CPU: 599 points; Graphics: 126 fps GeekBench: 3,980 (single-core); 11,498 (multi-core) PCMark 8 (Home Test): 4,568 points GTA V (1080p, Ultra): 43 fps; (1080p, Low): 163 fps; (4K, Ultra): 14 fps The Division: (1080p, Ultra): 60 fps; (1080p, Low): 150 fps Steam VR Bench: Ready Nvidia says that the GTX 1060 is good for GTX 980-grade frame rates, and our benchmarks show that to be true. The Titan Hadron scored 10,072 in PCMark 8's Fire Strike benchmark, compared to the 9,284 achieved by the 980-powered Asus GX700. Overclockers' machine also scored higher in Cinebench R15's graphics test (126.3 fps versus the GX700's 101.26 fps), and more than double in our demanding GTA V 1080p Ultra settings benchmark (43.3 fps versus 21 fps). With the exception of extremely demanding games, like GTA V, the GTX 1060 is capable of maxing out games at 1080p; it's also a solid performer at 1440p. We played Doom at that resolution on Ultra settings and got a consistent 55 - 70 fps, depending on which environment we were in. As expected, it struggled at 4K, straining to reach around 30 - 45 fps at 4K on Ultra and frequently dipping to as low as 25 fps. It almost goes without saying that the GTX 1060 isn't as powerful as the GTX 1070, losing out in every GPU benchmark compared to the StormForce Tornado that we recently reviewed. At £899/US$1,180/AUS$1,540 the Tornado also costs less despite having the more powerful GPU. On the other hand, it only comes with a weaker (and not overclockable) Core i5-6500 CPU and misses out on an SSD, both of which are major scoring points in favor of the Titan Hadron. Final verdict There's a lot to like about the Titan Hadron. We found favor with its minimal, no-nonsense case that provides easy access to components and makes a refreshing change from conventional tower PCs. Nvidia's GTX 1060 has proven itself to be a great option for 1440p gaming, striking a balance between cost and performance, and the version with 6GB of video memory on offer here leaves you confident you can whack up the graphics options to hit that magic 60 fps mark. Its SSD provides nippy loading of files, and that overclockable CPU provides an avenue for more advanced gamers to eke out even more power. On the other hand, the machine is simply not up to the task of fluid 4K gaming on Ultra, or even High settings, depending on the title – you're going to need a machine like the StormForce Tornado with a GTX 1070 for that. And, considering the Titan Hadron costs more than a grand, that might be a deal-breaker for some.

So how does it fare? Here is our review. Rating: 3.5 out of 5 Written by Karthekayan Iyer | Updated: August 28, 2016 2:24 pm At Rs 27,999, Asus Zenfone 3 is taking on the likes of OnePlus 3 and Xiaomi Mi 5. So how does it fare? Here is our review. Asus surprised the entire tech fraternity when it announced Zenfone 3 Deluxe with Snapdragon 821 at Rs 62,999. While Asus has complete independence when it comes to choosing a price point, this price seemed to go against the concept of Zenfone as people had come to understand. The Zenfone was introduced in the wake of growing popularity of budget devices that offered great value for the money. The first generation Zenfone 5 and second generation Zenfone 2 paired great hardware, beautiful design with low cost. Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe, on the other hand, comes at a premium. Asus Zenfone 3 The latest Zenfone 3 stays true to its name – offers serious value for money hardware specifications and a really stunning design. Asus being Asus announced multiple variants of Zenfone 3, which looks confusing at first and becomes more complex later. Asus Zenfone 3 is also different in number of ways this time. The first generation Zenfone series and Zenfone 2 were launched with Intel chipsets while the Zenfone 3 favours an all new Qualcomm SoC. At Rs 27,999, Asus Zenfone 3 is taking on the likes of OnePlus 3 and Xiaomi Mi 5. So how does it fare? Here is our review. Specs: 5.5-inch (1080x1920p, ~401 ppi) IPS LCD display | Octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor | 4GB RAM | 32/64GB storage | 16MP rear camera + 8MP front | Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery | Android Marshmallow OS Price: Rs 27,999 What is good? If you are buying the Zenfone 3 then it has to be for its battery. Agreed, reviews don’t start with battery part, but this review is different. With Zenfone 3, Asus has somewhat mastered the art of tying software and hardware together, which ensures better battery performance. Asus Zenfone 3 lasted me nearly a day and a half despite the relatively small 3,000mAh battery. Watch Video On a very busy day when I was tweeting from an event, writing a copy on my phone and clicking some random pictures with 4G on, I managed a screen on time of 5 hours 27 minutes, which puts Asus Zenfone 3 right on top in terms of battery backup. Most smartphone OEMs have failed miserably when it comes to delivering on battery life and have often resorted to options like Quick Charging to compensate. Asus Zenfone 3 also supports quick charge 2.0, but I found myself charging this phone only once in two days which isn’t bad at all. I believe Asus Zenfone 3’s USP is its battery, but design is an equally strong point. The smartphone is built with metal and glass and looks very similar to Samsung’s 2016 Galaxy lineups. The rear of Zenfone 3 features metal reinforced with glass which is a serious fingerprint magnet (keep those wet wipes handy). Asus Zenfone 3 is wide, but not tall making it easier to hold in one hand. This is definitely one of the best designed smartphone of this year. Asus Zenfone 3’s USP is its battery, but design is an equally strong point. This is definitely one of the best designed smartphone of this year. A good smartphone’s primary component is the display, that’s how we interact with the device. Asus Zenfone 3 features a 5.5-inch Full HD display and it’s adequately bright. The auto brightness setting works accurately and the display is viewable even under the harsh sunlight of Delhi. But is this the best in the price range? Certainly not. Asus Zenfone 3 also comes with a very decent camera. It is not extremely capable like Huawei P9 or colour accurate like the OnePlus 3, it rather turns out to be a fast and potent smartphone camera. It comes with a variety of modes and tweaks, but I was mostly shooting in auto mode. Also the camera shoots in 12MP resolution with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Asus Zenfone 3 also comes with a very decent camera. In the case of a leaf or flower, we found Zenfone 3 handling highlights well, but failed with the edges.

(Sample shot from Asus Zenfone 3) (Image resized for web) I was not really impressed with the low light mode or the super resolution mode but I did end up using HDR Pro which offered greater detail while shooting the sky. In the case of a leaf or flower, I found Zenfone 3 handling highlights well, but failed with the edges. For Rs 27,999, this is one smartphone camera I can easily count on. Asus Zenfone 3 is powered by a relatively new Snapdragon 625 chipset and it is pretty fast. Things like opening and closing apps, multitasking work extremely well. It easily manages basic games like Crossy Road and Dots, but graphics were smooth even with heavy games like Real Racing 3 and Asphalt 8: Airborne. Asus Zenfone 3 may not have the high-end Snapdragon 820 chip, but it holds its ground really well with performance. What is not good? Asus Zenfone 3’s display is bright but not very accurate with colour saturation and contrast. Since it is LCD, the blacks mirror grey tone at times. If display is your priority, OnePlus 3 is your best bet. Asus Zenfone 3 features a rear fingerprint scanner which is really odd in terms of design. It has a really small area and it’s not easy to rest your finger completely. Asus Zenfone 3, in my opinion, is just full of bloatware. The moment I set up the device, there were several Asus branded apps updating in the background – some of them you will never even open in your lifetime. Asus Zenfone 3 comes with Chrome browser out of the box but also has another browser called Puffin. Yes, you read that right – Puffin is a browser. There is Asus branded app replacement for ShareIt, Weather, Do It Later. There is also a handy tool to speed up the phone. I am not convinced about this UI, which takes up nearly 12GB out of the 64GB storage. Asus Zenfone 3 is just full of bloatware. When we started the device, there were several Asus branded apps updating in the background – some of them you will never even open in your lifetime. Asus could streamline its Android UI by following on the leads of Samsung and HTC, both known for significantly heavy Android skin. The simplest step could be to get rid of duplicate apps. Asus Zenfone 3 features a rear fingerprint scanner which is really odd in terms of design. It has a really small area and it’s not easy to rest your finger completely. It supports 360 degree recognition but the results are mixed. Should you buy? Any smartphone’s five basic pillars include design and display, performance, battery life, camera and software. Asus Zenfone 3 does well in three of those department while it’s camera is a passable one. It’s UI is something which may not appeal to everyone, especially if you have used a stock Android or Moto product. Asus Zenfone 3’s biggest competition is the OnePlus 3, which is an excellent smartphone in its own respect. OnePlus 3 offers great display and an extremely speedy processor, Zenfone 3 makes up for it with a beautiful design and strong battery life. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express PM Modi frames UP fight: Growth exiled for 14 yrs, give us majority EntertainmentDangal box office collection day 11: Aamir Khan film all set to take over Sultan as biggest hit of 2016 EntertainmentRaees: Dear Shah Rukh Khan, why are you so 'Zaalim' on us?

Lenovo's Thinkpad X1 Yoga will make you want OLED everywhere Engadget 28/08/2016 Devindra Hardawar © Provided by Engadget The dream of large OLED screens has, for the past few years, seemed perpetually on the horizon. LG has had OLED TVs on the market for a while, but they're still far more expensive than comparable LCDs. If you've wanted to get your OLED fix recently, you'd have to get it on a smaller phone or tablet screen. Now, the technology is finally making its way to laptops from the likes of Dell's Alienware, HP and Lenovo. So you can bet that I jumped at the opportunity to test out the new OLED-equipped Thinkpad X1 Yoga as soon as review units appeared. For the most part, it's a pretty typical Thinkpad convertible PC, but its screen is truly a thing of wonder.   Hardware The Thinkpad X1 Yoga doesn't offer up many surprises design-wise. It sports a black matte case, clean lines and it's built out of some sturdy material (a combination of a carbon fiber cover and magnesium alloy elsewhere). Its understated aesthetic befits its purpose: it's here to do work, not game or be an entertainment powerhouse. That doesn't mean it's ugly, it just resembles very traditional PC laptops, much like its sibling the X1 Tablet. Really, the X1 Yoga doesn't need any design flourishes, as it ensures the 14-inch OLED touchscreen is the real star of the show. (More on that below.) While it's built like a workhouse -- there's no flex to the case, and it feels like it could survive some major tumbles -- the X1 Yoga is also impressively portable, at 2.8 pounds and 0.67-inches thin. That's about on-par with most other Ultrabooks (and it's even 0.2-pounds lighter than the 13-inch MacBook Air). It's not as razor-thin as HP's stunning new Spectre, but because of that it's surprisingly versatile, with three USB 3.0 ports, HDMI and miniDisplayPort connectors, and a microSD card slot. There's also a proprietary OneLink+ port for connecting to Lenovo's docks, as well as a fingerprint sensor to the right of the trackpad. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget Being a Yoga device, the X1's screen can bend a full 360-degrees around the case, effectively turning it into a very large tablet. (In that mode the keyboard also recesses into the case, to prevent stray strokes and key damage.) You can also fold the screen over at an angle in a "tent" formation. That's ideal for standing it up on a table, or on your lap in bed. Lenovo designed a new double hinge for this device, and it's one of their smoothest implementations yet. The screen is easy to move around, but it also feels secure once you set it in place. Lenovo also tucked a stylus into the side of the X1 Yoga, which is useful for drawing or quickly jotting down notes. It's powered by super capacitor technology, which charges it whenever it's sitting inside the case. Display and pen input The X1 Yoga's OLED display doesn't waste any time impressing you. The red border around Lenovo's logo has an almost electric feel upon boot-up, and that carries over to everything in Windows. OLED displays are known for their bold colors and deep black levels, and this one doesn't disappoint. Watching videos and perusing photos is a revelatory experience. OLED adds an enormous amount of depth to images that makes them seem almost three-dimensional. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget With a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 (1440p/2K), the X1 Yoga's OLED screen is significantly sharper than a 1080p display, though it's not quite 4K. That's just fine, though, as Windows 10 still isn't well suited to 4K, and the benefits of such a high resolution are wasted on laptop screens. The X1 Yoga might not look like an ideal media machine from afar, but it ended up being one of my favorite ways to watch Netflix in bed. Mostly, that was due to sheer immersiveness of the screen. Its speakers sit right below the screen, and as is usual with Lenovo's gadgets, they were merely adequate. If you really want to get into a movie or TV show, bring along a good pair of headphones. The laptop's ability to flip around in a variety of different orientations also made it very useful. When I needed help in the kitchen, the tent formation was perfect on my countertop for watching videos and references recipes. And when I wanted to dive into the NYT, Comixology or a digital magazine app, the tablet mode was immensely convenient. It also worked well in direct sunlight, but be prepared to deal with some reflectivity depending on how it's oriented. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget While the built-in stylus was convenient for jotting down quick notes, it's also too light and flimsy to use for a very long time. It doesn't feel as substantial as Microsoft's Surface Pen or Apple's Pencil, instead it's like trying to write with an incredibly skinny pen. If you're really looking forward to handwriting on the X1 Yoga, though, you're probably better off investing in something that won't cramp your hand after a few minutes. On the plus side, the stylus is pressure sensitive, which could be useful for artists.  Typing and trackpad experience If there's one thing you can be guaranteed to find on a Thinkpad, it's a solid keyboard. That's been true of the line since IBM debuted it decades ago, and it's something Lenovo has maintained ever since it took over Big Blue's computer arm. The X1 Yoga's backlit chiclet keyboard is one of the most comfortable I've used in an Ultrabook. I had no trouble quickly typing up notes and reports from Intel's Developer Conference, or banging out most of this review. The keys are sloped inward slightly, which feels comfortable as you're resting your fingers on them, and they have a satisfying amount of depth. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget Basically, the X1 Yoga's keyboard feels like a balance of traditional Thinkpad typing with the modern chiclet style. I wish Lenovo included some media keys among its second functions though. Even the ability to start and stop music would be helpful (and being able to move between tracks would be even better). Lenovo used to offer some media keys on the X1 Carbon's capacitive touch strip, so hopefully we'll see those return eventually. The Thinkpad's trackpad is incredibly smooth, though it's not as roomy as the MacBook Air's or those found on other Ultrabooks. And if you're a Thinkpad diehard, you'll be pleased to learn there's also red Trackpoint nub among the keys, as well as mechanical mouse buttons right below the keyboard. For the most part, I relied on the X1 Yoga's trackpad, which was accurate for mousing, though it sometimes got confused between left and right clicks. I'm not a huge Trackpoint fan, but it was admittedly helpful while I was cramped in a middle airplane seat. In situations like that, being able to mouse with just your finger, and without moving your elbows, is immensely helpful.  Performance and battery life PCMark 7 PCMark 8 (Creative Accelerated) 3DMark 11 3DMark (Sky Diver) ATTO (top reads/writes) Lenovo Thinkpad X1 OLED (2.6GHz Intel Core i7-6600U, Intel HD 520) 4,892 4,186 E2,609 / P1,419 3,577 2.2 GB/s / 1.3 GB/s HP Spectre 13 (2.5GHz Intel Core i7-6500U, Intel HD 520) 5,046 3,747 E2,790 / P1,630 / X375 3,810 1.61 GB/s / 307 MB/s Huawei MateBook (1.1 GHz Core M3, Intel HD 515) 3,592 2,867 E1,490 / P887 2,454 538 MB/s / 268 MB/s Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet (1.2 GHz Core M7-6Y75, Intel HD 515) 4,951 3,433 E1,866 / P1,112 2,462 545 MB/s / 298 MB/s Dell XPS 13 (2.3GHz Core i5-6200U, Intel Graphics 520) 4,954 3,499 E2,610 / P1,531 3,335 1.6GB/s / 307 MB/s Razer Blade Stealth (2.5GHz Intel Core i7-6500U, Intel HD 520) 5,131 3,445 E2,788 / P1,599 / X426 3,442 1.5 GB/s / 307 MB/s Microsoft Surface Pro 4 (2.4GHz Core i5-6300U, Intel HD 520) 5,403 3,602 E2,697/ P1,556/ X422 3,614 1.6 GB/s / 529 MB/s Lenovo Yoga 900 (2.5GHz Core i7-6500U, Intel HD 520) 5,368 3,448 E2,707 / P1,581 3,161 556 MB/s / 511 MB/s On the hardware front, the Thinkpad X1 Yoga offers everything you'd expect from an Ultrabook today. It starts with an Intel Core i5-6200U, 8GB of DDR3 RAM and 128GB SSD. The model we reviewed is a bit beefier, with a Core i7 6600U, 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget It tackled just about every productivity task I threw at it: My daily workflow typically consists of having several browsers open with dozens of tabs, Slack, Spotify, and photo editing software running all at once. The Thinkpad handled video streaming from Netflix and Hulu just fine, and it processed dozens of large photos without any issues. It was about as fast as other recent ultraportables, like the new HP Spectre, when it comes to benchmarks. Tough, since it's sporting Intel HD 520 graphics, it can only tackle basic games. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the Thinkpad X1's battery life. It lasted only around 4.5 hours during typical usage, and I always had to recharge it in the afternoons. In our battery test, which involves playing an HD video continuously at 50 percent brightness, it lasted 8.5 hours. It's likely just far more efficient at handling video than a plethora of different programs running at once.  Configuration options and the competition As always, expect to pay dearly for the privilege of using OLED. This Thinkpad X1 Yoga model starts at $1,682, while the standard LCD version starts at $1,400. Its hardware starts with the specs I've mentioned above, but it would cost you $2,168 to upgrade to all of the specs from our review model. Still, the premium is likely worth it if you've been hankering for some OLED goodness. © Devindra Hardawar/Engadget While there's plenty of ultraportable competition on the market, there are few alternatives that pack an OLED screens. HP recently revamped its Spectre x360 convertible with the technology, which starts at a more reasonable $1,499. And Alienware's gaming-ready OLED models come in at $1,800. It might be worth sticking with the Thinkpad if you want OLED with the best productivity build quality, but if you're a gamer, Alienware's option is worth a look too. Wrap-up It'll likely be a while before OLED becomes the norm on laptops, but the Thinkpad X1 Yoga is a fine example of why we'd want it in all of our devices. Yes, even in a laptop that looks like it belongs in a boring corporate cubicle. That could also be appealing to some buyers: it looks like a dull Thinkpad on the surface, but it'll blow your mind when you actually turn it on. © Provided by Engadget The Thinkpad X1 Yoga is a reminder that OLED isn't just bright and bold, it's a transformative display technology.

(Photo: AFP Relaxnews) Israeli technology firm Mobileye and UK-based auto equipment maker Delphi said that they were teaming up to develop an autonomous driving system which would be ready for vehicle makers in 2019. A joint statement by the two companies said that Mobileye's vision and sensor systems would combine with Delphi's automated driving software to create what it called "the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution." The US-based Society of Automotive Engineers defines level 4 as "High Automation" in all but the most adverse driving conditions and level 5 as "Full Automation" "under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver." Last month, German car maker BMW announced that it was joining forces with Mobileye and US computer chip giant Intel on a self-drive project, also for "highly and fully automated driving" to be commercially available by 2021.

But on July 1, US electric car company Tesla announced that a driver was killed in a car crash in Florida in May while using the "autopilot" self-driving mechanism on one of its models. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it had opened a "preliminary evaluation" into the performance of the autopilot function in the wake of the crash. A major study released earlier this month said the looming arrival of self-driving vehicles is likely to vastly reduce traffic fatalities, but also poses difficult moral dilemmas. Scientists said autonomous driving systems will require programmers to develop algorithms to make critical decisions that are based more on ethics than technology, such as whether to sacrifice a driver or passenger rather than pedestrians. delphi mobileye self-drive car smart car From Our Network Sasikala as the new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister: Does BJP have a Plan B?- FirstPost Queen Elizabeth continues to suffer from 'heavy cold', misses New Year's Day church service- FirstPost Remembering Samar Sen: Frontier editor's dignity, courage a beacon in today's times- FirstPost Recommended For You TOP BOSSES OUTSupreme Court Removes Anurag Thakur as BCCI President Tatat's New offeringTata Motors Aims to Launch Kite 5 by March 2017 cricket cleansingSupreme Court Tells Cricket Administrators Above 70 to Vacate Post Can't wait!Raees, Baahubali 2, Rangoon: The Highly Anticipated Films of 2017 Partner ContentThe Tech And Auto Show: The Great Rajasthan Food Trail Special About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News 2016 has Raised Obstacles on Path to Better World: Azim Premji Samsung Galaxy A Series (2017) With Water, Dust Resistance Launched; Here is All You Want to Know Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Karan Johar Come Together for a New Film Rebels Put Peace Talks on Hold After Syrian Army Advance Angelina Jolie Celebrates New Year With Her Kids Without Brad Pitt Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Tech companies have tried everything to boost the low numbers of women in their ranks. Massive grants aimed at high-tech scholarships for girls and students of color. Longer parental leave perks for new moms and dads. Even benefits that pay for women who want to delay childbearing to freeze their eggs. Now, a growing number of both large and small tech companies are borrowing an idea from Wall Street banks: The “returnship,” which brings in mid-career women (and men) who've taken time out of the workplace to care for family, offering them a path back to the office. Recently, a nonprofit called Path Forward announced that six San Francisco-based tech companies, including domain registrar GoDaddy, customer service software maker Zendesk and grocery delivery outfit Instacart, will offer 18-week internships for about 20 mid-career professionals starting in October. While the program is open to men who have spent at least two years out of the workplace as a caregiver, it is expected to be filled largely by women. It is aimed at helping interns confront the stigma they face about time away. Also, tech companies get a chance to improve their reputation as places that too many women leave. “If you're wanting more women at the senior level, this is a way to jump-start that,” said Tami Forman, the executive director of Path Forward. Forman said there's been enough interest from other companies that she plans to start two to three more groups of these untraditional interns (who, yes, are paid) in several cities early next year, each with six to 10 tech companies. The nonprofit was spun out of the New York-based email software firm Return Path, which started its own mid-career internship program last year — Forman is a former marketing vice president there — and now helps bring that program, which includes training and networking opportunities for the group of interns to other tech companies. Path Forward's announcement follows another recent effort by seven technology and engineering companies — including IBM, Intel and General Motors — to run internships designed for women who've taken time away. The programs at these companies began this year and are part of an effort launched by the Society for Women Engineers and iRelaunch, a “career reentry firm” that runs a conference on returning to work sponsored by finance companies that have similar programs, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. The latter firm kicked off the trend back in 2008 and even trademarked the phrase “returnship.” Carol Fishman Cohen, iReLaunch's CEO, said her conference acts as something of a recruiting hub for those existing programs, and “it occurred to us we should take the concept to another sector.” She approached the Society of Women Engineers to establish a task force last year that would try and “replicate what we saw in financial services.” In tech, she says, “there's a lack of women at every level of the organization and they're looking for more ways to hire more of them and fill that pipeline.” Cohen said men are eligible to apply, but most applicants for the established programs have tended to be women in their 40s or even 50s who've left the workforce to be a caregiver. Some tech companies have long offered flexible leave policies or extended sabbaticals that help their own employees return after a break. But these newer mid-career internships, says Laura Sherbin, director of research for the think tank Center for Talent Innovation (CTI), offer certain advantages. For one, it exposes employers to outside talent. And in an industry like tech, where the pace of change is faster and more disruptive than in others, the low-risk bet on hiring an intern for 12 or 18 weeks can help erase the bias many managers have about people whose resumes have glaring holes on them. “There's a huge stigma to time off in the tech industry,” Sherbin said. “There's a perception that tech passes us by even on a maternity leave, and if you've had time out of the workforce you're hugely behind. Tie that in with the bias you do see about tech workers who have a little bit of gray hair,” and it's an industry particularly primed for managers who might look past candidates — even skilled ones — who have been out of the workforce. Steven Aldrich, chief product officer of GoDaddy, said that's one thing that attracted his company to the idea. “The company has a chance to try the employee, in a way, and see their fit with the company, and it's a win for the working parent coming back into the workforce to come in and get experience,” he said. “Those things are really challenging (when someone) comes straight back in.” The tech industry is trying to plug an especially leaky pipeline. According to 2008 data from the CTI, 52 percent of women with experience in the science, engineering or tech fields chose to leave their fields over time. Another 2013 study, meanwhile, compared women in multiple professions and found that after the first 12 years of their careers, 50 percent of women in science, engineering and tech were working in other occupations, while only about 20 percent of the other women switched industries over their entire careers. Running internships for returning parents could also help send a message to younger workers. With these programs, Cohen says, “what companies are signaling to their youngest employees and the people in their 20s is that they understand that employees may take a career break -- and we want to welcome you back.” If hiring rates are any test, such “returnships” appear successful. At Goldman Sachs, almost half of the 150 people who have gone through its program since 2008 were hired for full-time jobs; Cohen says that hire rates tend to be between 50 and 90 percent in established programs, and at the high end of that range for the tech firms so far. A spokeswoman for PayPal, which ran a program for nine interns in the U.S. called “Recharge,” with the help of Forman's group earlier this year, said that seven of the nine were offered jobs. And all six of the “Tech Re-Entry” interns working in analytics at IBM this spring, who had been out of the workforce for anywhere from two to 10 years, were recommended for full-time employment. Five have accepted jobs and the sixth is in final interviews at the technology giant. “We're increasingly looking for creative ways to bring women back to the workforce who we know are incredibly competitive,” said Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, IBM's chief diversity officer. She said the company is looking to expand the program. Still, while success rates for participants tend to be high, the effect such programs will have on moving the needle — either for the number of mid-career women in tech or the number of parents wanting to get back to work after child rearing — could be limited. In those industries where they could help bring in a few more women, warns CTI's Sherbin, hiring them only goes so far. Even programs that hire every mid-career intern they bring in won't make much progress on diversity if they don't also work to improve “bro” cultures that are hostile or toxic to anyone who's different. “You may get them in,” she says, “but they're going to be very very short hires.” More Business From food to fashion to toys, what's expected to sell big in 2017 Macy's and Sears may invite other retailers to take their spaces Ask Brianna: How can I refresh my finances for the new year?

Microsoft Continues To Challenge Apple's Reign With iMac-Like Device By Tin, Posted: 08/29/16 05:47PM EDT NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 06: A new Microsoft Surface Pro 4 sit on display at a media event for new Microsoft products on October 6, 2015 in New York City. Microsoft also unveiled a virtual reality gaming head set titled the HoloLens, a laptop titled the Surface Book and a phone titled the Lumia 950.(Photo : Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Microsoft is currently being rumored to release a computer version of its popular Surface brand. This brings sparks to the never dying issues about Microsoft's continuous stunts to 'challenge' Apple. Microsoft Surface Computer Rumored Specs, Release Date According to rumors from wccftech.com, the Microsoft Surface Computer will feature modular and stackable components. The said device will basically be an 'All In One PC". This allows users to swap components of the PC, avoiding major spending come upgrade time. For the release date, rumors previously suggested that the Surface Computer would come at the third quarter of this year. However, since right now this no longer seem possible, it is assumed that the Microsoft Surface Computer will arrive next year instead, together with the anticipated new Surface devices. Keep in mind however, that the new Surface event has not yet been confirmed. But there are rumors that concluded about the Surfaces' release dates being next year. This is in relation to the Windows update happening next year (Redstone 2) and Intel's new processor for the Surface Pro 4 (Kaby Lake) finishing by the end of 2016. As for the Surface Computer's price, just expect it to be way more expensive than your average computer, the same way the Surface tablet and Surface Book have been more expensive than their regular counterparts. Microsoft vs Apple Products The rivalry between Microsoft and Apple's products have been going on for quite some time. Even though Apple has always been popular to the masses, Microsoft has never failed to release hefty devices with powerhouse specifications, that can practically take on any competition. If you can remember the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book, they both had superstar specs that no similar products can compete with. This is probably why the two companies have always been compared to each other, and why Microsoft always develop and release new products that are obviously in comparison to Apple's products. Just recently, a Microsoft ad for the Surface Pro 4 mentioned Apple's Mac with not-so-subtle criticisms for the rival product. As per Forbes, the ad puts the limelight on Surface Pro 4's portability, versatility, and it's overall PC function. This, however, was done in the expense of the Apple MacBook.

After all, the team is determined to improve the player experience first before releasing the next two pieces of downloadable content for The Division. Update 1.4 will feature a plethora of bug fixes as well as changes to itemization, enemy scaling, and more. To that end, developers of The Division are seeking help from players to shape the 1.4 update. In the latest request, a survey on skills is ready for players to complete. In a post on the game’s official forums, the community developer listed each of the skills available in The Division and directed players to a survey on how often they use each skill. “It’s no secret that while The Division offers a variety of skills, skill mods and signature skills to choose from, only a few of them actually prove useful in the End-Game. This is something that we need to look at. Before we start making decisions however, we want to make sure to take the time to pick your brains on what you think about each of the skills, and get a more complete overview.” The survey, hosted at Survey Monkey, includes a list of skills and their mods. Players are tasked with ranking each one with one of four frequencies. Players can choose from “always,” “often,” “rarely,” and “never” as responses to how regularly they activate the skill. A selection is made individually for each skill’s mod, and the three signature skills are also listed with the same options. How often do you use skills in The Division? [Image via Ubisoft]It is important to note that the frequency at which some players use a skill will ultimately be affected by the skill’s strength and its performance. Some skills are stronger than others simply because they work, while another will not activate properly. For instance, there are issues when two Support Stations are down with the Immunizer mod that can essentially negate the effect. Not to mention, players are often plagued with skills not activating properly or skills becoming unusable in combat. In those cases, players may want to use the ability often but they cannot due to certain bugs. Leaving forum feedback on skills like that and explaining why a skill is not used as much is also very helpful. Enemy scaling and itemization will hopefully improve in update 1.4 or later [Image via Ubisoft]Feedback gathered from surveys like this, and from the Agent Intel section of the official forums, will be used to improve The Division starting with update 1.4 and beyond. According to the official site, update 1.4 is planned to release in October, pushing back the release of Survival and Last Stand. In fact, the final DLC will now release in 2017, rather than this winter. Players are encouraged to fill out the provided surveys and post replies in the Agent Intel section of the forums to contribute to improving the game. “With Update 1.4 in the works, it has become clear with your feedback and our own observations that our priority should now be on improving the core gameplay experience. For this reason, we have made several adjustments to our development schedule.” Update 1.4’s shift to bug fixing and overall game improvement comes after an interim period of silence from the developers after the release of Underground on PlayStation 4. In the first state of the game after their return, developers of The Division announced their focus on the game’s known issues and noted that player feedback would be a paramount part of the process. LMB forces are moving in! A new #OperationISAC mission starts Wednesday at 5PM PST. https://t.co/gGNvxWIjlm pic.twitter.com/fPv2ZQPOs4 — The Division (@TheDivisionGame) August 29, 2016 The survey and regular Agent Intel posts are a major part of collecting that feedback. As the Inquisitr reported, enemy scaling, itemization, and general difficulty are also part of improving The Division with the next update.

Max Maxfield, Designline Editor 8/29/2016 05:15 PM EDT  16 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet As this launch trailer video shows, Obduction takes immersive reality to a whole new dimension. I'm currently bouncing off the walls in excitement because I just downloaded my copy of the Obduction game that I supported as a Kickstarter project. This all began in October 2013 when I discovered that the folks at Cyan -- the creators of games like Myst and Riven -- had just launched a Kickstarter project to fund the development of a new game called Obduction (see I Cannot Wait to Be Obducted!). Well, the sands of time slithered their way through the hourglass as is their wont. The weeks turned into months and the months turned into years, so this had largely drifted to the back of my mind until March of this year when I received an update promising a release date in July 2016 (see I'm Ready to be Obducted -- Take Me!). Sad to relate, July came and went with naught but a sheepish communication saying something along the lines of: "Just tidying up a few loose ends -- it really is coming soon." There was much gnashing of teeth and rending of garb in my office that day, let me tell you. But all of that's behind us. I'm currently performing my Happy Dance (cover your eyes if you wish to preserve your sanity) because I just received my download code and I've installed the 2D version of Obduction on my monster virtual reality machine. "But why only 2D?" I hear you cry. Why indeed. Earlier this year, the folks at Cyan promised that the first release would be PC, Mac, and Oculus Rift-ready. Well, "one out of three ain't all that good," because it appears that only the PC version is available -- the Mac version is supposed to be ready but a lot of users are saying it doesnt work, while the Oculus Rift implementation is currently missing in action. I was poised to dispatch the butler to fetch my angry trousers, but then I powered up the PC version just to take a "look-see" and I have to admit that it appears to be mind-bogglingly awesome. Take a look at this Obduction Launch Trailer Video and see what you think. Now go back and watch it two more times to spot all the little details you missed the first time. "OMG!" is all I can say. If the 2D version is this good, the fully immersive VR realization is going to blow my socks off (note to self: order another crate of elasticated socks). So now I'm sitting on a horny dilemma the horns of a dilemma -- I really, really want to experience the VR version of Obduction, but I have no idea how long it will be before I can feast my orbs on this little beauty. Meanwhile, I have the 2D version sitting on my VR machine singing its siren song with promises of delectation and delight. But now we have another problem. Do you recall the machine the folks from GigaParts created just for me (see It's (Virtual Reality) Life Jim, But Not As We Know It)? "My Precious" (Source: Max Maxfield / EETimes.com) Performance-wise, this beast is awesome. It boasts a 6th generation quad-core, hyper-threaded, water-cooled Intel Core i7 processor running at 4GHz with 16GB of RAM, and this little beauty is mated with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 with 8GB of GDDR5 memory. On the downside, I only ever expected to be running this with my Oculus Rift, so in order to save money I didnt bother with any speakers (the Oculus has attached headphones) and I opted for a small, cheap-and-cheerful monitor on the basis that I was only ever going to use it for housekeeping tasks like launching the Oculus. Now that I've experienced a tempting taster of Obduction, I've been desperately trying to justify adding speakers along with a bigger, better monitor to the beast, and I think I've managed to come up with something. VR is wonderful, but -- at least in the case of a game like Obduction -- it's a solitary pursuit. That is, it's awesome for the person sporting the VR headset, but it's boring for anyone else in the vicinity. One of the great things about Myst and Riven was playing them and solving their puzzles with friends and/or family members. In the case of the 2D version of Obduction, I can imagine a few of us here in the office meeting up for 30 minutes at the start of the day before we commence work or at the end of the day before we head for home, toiling together to explore this new world and unveil its mysteries. Can you imagine the comradery and esperit de corps this activity will foster? I can hear your thoughts like you were here in the room talking to me: "What sort of man would you be to deny your colleagues this team-building activity?" You really are a smooth talker. How can I argue with logic like that? You are correct. I owe it to the creator of the universe to make this world a happier place. In the case of the speakers, I just ordered a pair of Creative Reference Multimedia Monitors from Amazon. These score 4.4 out of 5 stars with 809 people voting for them, which offers a very high level of confidence in my experience. In the case of the monitor, I just called Daniel at GigaParts and he says they have some amazing deals on the showroom floor, so I'm going to drop by as soon as I get a spare moment. Have you tried a high-end VR system yourself yet? If not, you'll get a chance to do so if you are planning on attending the Embedded Systems Conference (ESC), which will take place September 21-22 in Minneapolis, MN (see Experience virtual reality at ESC Minneapolis). Meanwhile, watch this space for future developments and -- while you're waiting -- I would be very interested to hear what you think about the Obduction video shown above.

In West Jordan, Utah, an initial plan to offer some $240 million in tax breaks over two decades fell apart after several local leaders said the lure was too rich. Negotiations have since restarted. In New Mexico, The Los Lunas Village Council agreed to give up all property taxes for 30 years in exchange for annual payments that start at $50,000 and top out at nearly a half-million dollars. The village has yet to provide a tally of the revenues it would forgo under a complex economic development agreement that also involves tax breaks on billions of dollars in computer equipment over time. Officials in West Jordan say they can hardly compete with the generous offer from the town of 15,000 people in New Mexico. Dave Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University, says West Jordan's initial offer was greater than the total combined tax breaks offered for seven other data centers in Iowa. "This is nothing but a giveaway," Swenson said. Tax deals worth hundreds of millions quietly helped finance a new industry that formed from an unlikely pairing of rural America and Silicon Valley.Los Lunas officials foresee a possible $1.8 billion construction project that provides as many as 300 direct temporary jobs, and just 50 permanent jobs thereafter -- a fraction of the steady employment at the local Walmart distribution center. Still, supporters of such deals see an opportunity to attract a hot company that would bring tax revenue despite the incentives and could attract other high-tech companies. "If you're in the market for a new car and this dealer offers a rebate for the same car and this dealer doesn't, where are you going to buy the car?" said Vale Hale, executive director of the Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development. Facebook's latest expansion comes as the social media giant looks to beef up its video presence, said John Harrington, a data center expert with Verify Research Associates. Video is increasingly the way to attract advertisers and eyeballs, but it also requires more space. Data centers are typically large facilities filled with rows of hard-drives and servers that store and process vast amounts of information. They're increasingly essential to the global economy, but on the ground they function more like storage facilities that need few people to keep them running. While the Facebook plan has been contentious in Utah, it's enjoyed broad political support in New Mexico, where the Los Lunas Village Council voted to sweeten the offer last week. New Mexico officials appear eager to please businesses willing to set up shop in a state hit hard by a downturn in the oil and natural gas sectors, and where computer chip maker Intel has been steadily unwinding a major manufacturing plant that was an early beneficiary of similar property tax breaks using industrial revenue bonds. There's been some question about whether the estimated 50 jobs are worth the trouble, but state Rep. Alonzo Baldonado, R-Los Lunas, anticipates that construction will spill over into other parts of the economy. Among other infrastructure upgrades, three industrial-scale solar power plants would be built to offset electricity consumed by the data center. The plants would be paid for through a power purchase agreement with Facebook. "You don't know until it's on the ground when it comes to seeing the economic benefits," said Baldonado, a staunch supporter of the data center project. "You have to take risks sometimes." The once-struggling timber town of Prineville, Oregon, for example, is reinventing itself as a digital hub since attracting Facebook's first wholly owned data center with the help of a 15-year abatement on property taxes. But in Utah's relatively healthy economy, critics of the Facebook deal argue the land eyed by the social media giant could be developed by another outfit that would pay more in school-funding taxes and create more jobs. They also worry that new companies coming to the state will expect similar treatment.

MullerAugust 29, 2016 6:00 pm Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: Image Source/AP If you've been waiting for science to confirm that pizza isn't entirely bad for you, the time has come. While the most addictive food known to man isn't going to improve your health, it will motivate you to work harder, according to a study led by Dan Ariely in his upcoming book Payoff: The Hidden Logic That Shapes Our Motivations, New York magazine reports. In Ariely's experiment, semiconductor factory workers at Intel in Israel were given the promise of one of three things at the beginning of their work week if they hit their goal: a voucher for free pizza, a cash bonus, and a compliment from their boss. Meanwhile, the control group received none of those promises. Almost immediately, pizza emerged as the most effective incentive. The workers who were promised pizza for meeting their quota out-produced the control group by 6.7 percent. Surprisingly, pizza was a considerably more effective motivator than a cash bonus, which increased productivity by 4.9 percent after the compliment group which landed at a 6.6 percent increased productivity. If you're looking to make more friends in the office, you now know which snack to bring to work.

 One of the oldest ways to write software is finally starting to fade Matt Weinberger Aug. 29, 2016, 6:00 PM 22,827 facebook linkedin twitter email print Dennis Ritchie, inventor of the C programming language, who died in 2011. Wikimedia Commons The TIOBE Index, a highly-regarded resource for ranking the popularity of programming languages, is a great place to figure out the skills you should learn if you want a career in technology. By the same token, the TIOBE Index is also a great way to keep your fingers on the pulse of the programming world, as upstarts like Google's Go and Apple's Swift languages make steady gains, pushing old-timer heavyweights like COBOL and Fortran even further down the list. Now, judging from the August update to the TIOBE Index, it looks like C — the legendary programming language invented in 1972 and still widely used  — is showing signs of being left behind as the bulk of new software development gets done on the web and on the smartphone. "The C programming language has a score of 11.303%, which is its lowest score ever since we started the TIOBE index back in 2001," writes Paul Jansen, who manages the TIOBE Index, in a preface to the August listings. Overall, C is still doing pretty well. By TIOBE's reckoning, it's still the second most popular programming language in the world, behind only Java, which is widely used in both Android apps and in business software development. But, by TIOBE's reckoning, this could be a sign of things to come, with C a " bit stuck" amid larger changes to the technology landscape.  C, evolved Over the years, Java has evolved — originally intended as an operating system for smart televisions, it eventually became massively popular for its rock-solid stability, making it a go-to programming language even during the emergence of the smartphone era. Meanwhile, C has stayed largely the same, not least because the community of volunteer developers who shepherd the language have focused squarely on performance, rather than adding new features. And so, while C is still being actively developed, it's possible that programmers are finding it less and less suitable for their day-to-day projects as time goes on and computing keeps changing. "The C Programming Language," the legendary guide to learning the language. Flickr And C++, an offshoot of C championed by the likes of Microsoft and Intel, already represents the changes that C would have to make to stay relevant. As the TIOBE Index notes, if C put in those C++ features, it would basically just be...C++, which is to say, redundant. Finally, the TIOBE Index notes that unlike most other major programming languages, C doesn't currently have a major corporate sponsor. Oracle makes a lot of money from Java; Apple pushes both Swift and Objective-C for building iPhone apps. But no big tech company is getting on stage and pushing C as the future of development. So C's problems could be marketing as much as anything. This is all extrapolated from one month of data, and it's possible that next month, C will have a massive comeback to top the charts. Regardless, this raises fascinating questions about the future of one of the oldest programming languages that's still widely used.  SEE ALSO: Lyft made a big bet on Apple's secret smash hit, Swift, and it paid off in a huge way NOW WATCH: This unconventional keyboard is a must-have for power-programmers Loading video...

IIoT systems differs from Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Failure in IIoT systems would lead to disastrous situations where as in IoT systems the failure would barely lead to emergency situations. IoT systems are designed at consumer level device such as smart home appliances, automatic pet feeders and wearable fitness devices. IIoT systems comprises of industrial machines such as health monitors and manufacturing machines deployed at industrial and manufacturing sites. IIoT incorporates machine learning, big data technology and Machine to Machine Communication (M2M). Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers with self-learning without being programmed. Big data technology is an emerging technology that incorporates any volume of data which can be converted into useful information. M2M Communication can be defined as direct communication between machines using any communication channel such as wired and wireless. The industrial machines in IIoT are connected through a communication software to collect, analyze, monitor and exchange information amongst themselves without any human intervention. The major factor that would drive the growth of IIoT market would be advancements in cloud technology. The growth in cloud technology would enable easy accessibility, unlimited storage and low-priced efficient processing for IIoT systems. Furthermore, formation of Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) by key players such as AT&T Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., International Business Machine (IBM) Corporation, Intel Corporation and General Electric Company would also accelerate the development and adoption rate for IIoT systems. Details About Industrial Internet of Things - bit.ly/2btEq1r Availability of low cost and highly efficient sensors would also drive the growth of market. The increasing need for optimum accuracy in industries such as aerospace, defense, energy, healthcare, manufacturing and transportation is likely to provide immense opportunities for IIoT market. Furthermore, Innovation in big data analytics could create immense opportunities for the IIoT market. However, the major challenge that IIoT markets likely to face is the interoperability issues and lack of standardization in IIoT products. The security and privacy issues with usage of cloud technology is likely to hinder the anticipated growth of IIoT market. IIoT market could be segmented on the basis of technology, industry vertical and geography. On the basis of type, the IIoT market could further be segmented into Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), sensors, 3D printed sensors, automated haulage systems, yield monitors, GPS, smart meter and robotics. On the basis of industry vertical, the global IIoT market could be segmented in manufacturing, aviation, oil and gas, healthcare, mining, power, agriculture and transportation. The key players in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market include General Electric Company, Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corporation, International Business Machine (IBM) Corporation, AT&T Inc., Huawei Technology Co. Ltd., Siemens AG, Rockwell Automation Inc., Robert Bosch GmbH, Accenture PLC and Schneider Electric SE.

According to the rumor mill, the primary technological advance for the new iPhone will be a new camera system. There's some speculation that a new Apple Watch will be announced, but in my opinion what the Apple watch needs most is better software (upcoming in the WatchOS 3 release). The Watch has been pretty satisfying as a gadget, but ultimately disappointing as a platform, and a new hardware version is unlikely to reverse that trend. Many Mac fans are hoping that a new Macbook Pro will be announced, but there doesn't seem to be any concrete evidence of that, other than the fact that it's been so long since the last real MPB redesign. The rumors are based, I suspect, on wishful thinking. However, if Apple releases an updated Macbook Pro with an OLED touchscreen and Intel Skylake, people would be lining up to buy them. Apple's custom is to make its primary OS announcements at WWDC and focus on new devices in the fall, but I'm sure we'll get a bit of an update on iOS 10 and possibly WatchOS3.

Graphics Cards Motherboards Cases/Cooling Processors Chipsets Memory Displays Systems Storage Mobile Networking Username: * Password: * Register | Password Reminder Home » News Samsung is being a little cagey about their new Z-SSD Subject: General Tech | August 29, 2016 - 02:27 PM | Jeremy Hellstrom Tagged: z-ssd, NVMe, Samsung, HHHL The Register had a quick chat with Samsung about the Z-SSD they announced at FMS 2016, hoping to get some details from the company about the technology behind the new product, with little success.  We know it will be DRAM-NAND gap-filler such as the one Netlist announced earlier and will be possible competition for Intel's XPoint.  Samsung did confirm that it will be NVMe and will initially launch as a half height, half length PCIe card, with other interfaces to follow.  They did admit it will use 3D V-NAND, but would only hint at the custom circuit design they will use.  The Register offers some prognostication at the end of the quick interview, you can see that right here. "The mysterious Samsung Z-SSD was announced at the Flash Memory Summit, and positioned as a DRAM-NAND gap-filler. This makes it competition for XPoint. We asked Samsung about it, and here is what we learnt." Here is some more Tech News from around the web: Tech Talk Players Seek 'No Man's Sky' Refunds, Sony's Content Director Calls Them Thieves @ Slashdot If you haven't changed your Dropbox password for 4 years, do so now @ The Register Source: The Register Comments Post a comment August 29, 2016 | 07:25 PM - Posted by Jeppe (not verified) How is it a DRAM-NAND gap-filler if it still uses NAND? reply August 29, 2016 | 09:21 PM - Posted by km3k (not verified) Exactly. Maybe they're going to try to go with a new PCIe NVMe design that competes by being close enough on performance and a lower price. I could see them doing marketing with comparisons to SATA drives instead of other NVMe drives. reply August 30, 2016 | 12:59 AM - Posted by BlackDove (not verified) Current fastest flash based SSDs use DRAM with supercapacitors for caching, or in the case of Mangstor's NVMe SSD, it uses STT-MRAM and DRAM caching. Perhaps Samsung is using a similar approach and saying its new tech? reply August 30, 2016 | 10:45 AM - Posted by John H (not verified) The Register has a little more technical detail -- looks like the latency of this memory is closer to current Optane speeds (only 2x slower) than traditional NAND. It sounds like this is still a 'block device' though and not a 'bit' device like DRAM (or Optane). It probably is fast enough you won't see a real difference between this and Optane on a PCI-E 3.0 x4 setup. I don't think Optane will show itself to be appreciably faster until it's on the DIMM slot.. reply August 30, 2016 | 12:55 PM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) Don't forget Micron's QuantX brand of XPoint, as there is that to compete with Intel's Optane(XPoint)! Micron should have used a different Branding as the QuantX(XPoint) brand name is also used under QuantX™(syringe barrels). Micron needs to get their QuantX name out there, as a recent article at ARS Ars Technica failed to even mention that Intel's Optine even has a competitor. It’s an easy way to tell if a so called “Objective” article is actually a sponsored article when for example the ARS story’s author fails to mention even one competitive to Optane product, especially for XPoint that has only 2 original creators(Intel/Micron). There is no objective article when the story’s author fails to mention by name the maker of any competitive product. reply August 31, 2016 | 03:03 AM - Posted by Anonymous (not verified) I wonder if they have implemented some kind of NOR type flash cell rather than a NAND type flash cell, or just some unique design made possible by the 3D structure. I don't know that much about the actual transistor level structure, but as far as I know, NOR offers byte addressability and lower read latencies. It has higher write latencies though, and takes more power. That could be countered by using a large DRAM write cache. NOR is supposed to be less dense due to parallel connection rather than serial, but I wonder if different designs are possible due to vertical flash cells. I was just thinking that having the flash cell on the 3D structure may allow them to add more circuitry in between the cells without changing the distance between the cells much. reply Post new comment Your name: * E-mail: * The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

How cities took over the world: Maps reveal the rapid spread... Share this article Share The question remains, though: Which American city is the hardest working? SmartAsset, a firm specializing in analysis of financial data, crunched the numbers and ranked American cities in terms of how hard they worked. What they found may surprise you... Arlington, Virginia, the second largest city in the metropolitan Washington area, is home to large federal government employers as well as private firms like Lockheed Martin 1. Arlington, Virginia The second largest city in the metropolitan Washington, DC, area Arlington will likely never see a shortage of work due to the presence of federal government agencies like the Pentagon – which is also the largest office building in the world – and the Department of Homeland Security. Those who are employed in Arlington log an average of 41.5 hours per week, making it the hardest working city in the country. A night-time view of downtown Anchorage. Residents in Alaska's largest city work an average of 40.7 hours per week and 37 weeks per year 2. Anchorage, Alaska An industrious population combined with tremendous wealth in natural resources make Alaska’s largest city a prime candidate for one of the country’s hardest working towns.  The labor force in the city works an average of 40.7 hours a week and 37 weeks a year, primarily for companies that specialize in resource extraction such as ConocoPhillips and BP. The skyline of Lincoln, Nebraska, home to a burgeoning cultural scene that is attracting creative-minded people who are looking for an affordable locale with a high quality of life 3. Lincoln, Nebraska Not only is Lincoln an affordable town for creative-minded folks, but it is also one that is seeking to attract more residents.  In the span between October 2014 and October 2015, hourly wages rose 8.5 percent. With low unemployment, Lincoln is becoming an attractive option for those who might be deterred by the high cost of living on the East and West coasts. Toyota and Hewlett Packard must be on to something if they've established a significant corporate presence in Plano (seen above), a growing suburb of Dallas 4. Plano, Texas Just 20 miles northeast of downtown Dallas, Plano has earned a reputation for being a business-friendly hub – one that hosts national and regional offices of industrial giants like Toyota, Alliance Delta, and Hewlett Packard. Home to the world's largest pleasure beach, Virginia Beach has become a magnet for tourists from around the globe, with an estimated 13.2 million visitors per year 5. Virginia Beach, Virginia Tourism is the backbone of the economy here, with an estimated 13.2 million people visiting the city every year.  Virginia Beach, the largest city in Virginia, is home to the largest pleasure beach in the world.  This keeps people here busy, with residents working an average of 1,195 hours per year. While it may rain plenty here, the wet weather hardly dampens locals' willingness to put in office hours. Seattlers work 37.32 weeks per year, third highest in the country 6. Seattle, Washington Starbucks and Amazon have their headquarters in Seattle, and Boeing employs about 80,000 workers, so there must be a reason these companies have set up shop in this rainy Northwest metropolis.  Seattlers also work 37.32 weeks per year, the third-highest in the country. Chandler (seen above), an affluent suburb of Phoenix, counts Intel and Wells Fargo among high-profile companies that have set up shop in the area 7. Chandler, Arizona This affluent suburb of Phoenix, with a population of over a quarter million people, is the hardest working town in Arizona. Its top employers include Intel, Wells Fargo, the Bank of America, and Verizon. Scottsdale (seen above) is a popular tourist destination for visitors from cold-weather areas eager for a respite from the brutal winters 8. Scottsdale, Arizona In Scottsdale, workers put in more hours than they do in Chandler, but because unemployment is higher in Scottsdale, Chandler residents work more per person on average. Nonetheless, Scottsdale has carved out a niche as one of the most popular warm-weather tourist destinations for tourists from up north looking for a respite from the frigid winters. Gilbert (seen above) is one of three Arizona towns to make the top 10 by virtue of its status as one of the fastest growing cities in the country 9. Gilbert, Arizona Cracking the top 10 is a significant achievement for a city that had a population of just 5,700 in 1980.  Today, it is home to over 240,000 residents, making it one of the fastest growing communities in the country. Texas' state capital has earned its reputation as a bubbling cultural hub while also seeing its residents show significant participation in the labor force 10. Austin, Texas Texas’ state capital boasts an impressive 81.2 percent participation in the labor force. Combined with the burgeoning number of career opportunities, Austin has earned a reputation in recent years as one of the country’s most dynamic up-and-coming cities.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Mariah botches New Year's Eve performance and storms off stage Heart-warming moment woman plays piano and sings in cathedral Man goes crazy when he catches another guy in bed with his wife Woman takes seven minutes to parallel park car in double space Man finally talks to wife after over twenty years of silence Passenger insults flight attendant before being led away by police Disturbing moment pitbull kills small dog in front of its owner Mass brawl erupts between customers and restaurant staff Dog shows off its incredibly efficient banana-eating technique Bottles and furniture thrown during terrifying NYE fight Spooky!

INNOVATE Meet 9 Women Who Have Raised Hundreds of Millions This Year Editas, Daqri, Kabbage, Ginkgo Bioworks--their companies range from editing DNA to virtual reality. By Lisa Calhoun Lisa Calhoun is general partner at Valor Ventures. She is the author of How You Rule the World and runs the online magazine FemaleEntrepreneurs as well as Female Founder meetups through the Southeast. She founded Write2Market, a tech public relations firm that ranks in the Top 10 agencies for startups in the country. Hobbies include golf, running, and Dutch. @Lisa_Calhoun General partner, Valor Ventures@Lisa_Calhoun WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement You've heard there are fewer women in STEM fields, or that fewer women lead technical companies. Well, the ones that do are raising significant capital to pursue their passions. I asked the analysts at Pitchbook to help me take a data-driven look at the landscape around female founders. They may be on the venture frontier, but even so, they're defining it with bold visions that range from inspired finance to practical virtual reality to the forefront of genetics and what's next for manufacturing. Top-ranked women for venture capital raised in 2016. Last year, the top-ranked female founders for raising venture capital included Sunrun, which IPO'd last year. This year, one of the top startups with a female founder has already had an IPO (Editas). See which trends you spot in this ranking of women who've raised hundreds of millions in venture capital in the past 12 months: 1. Kathryn Petralia, co-founder of Kabbage. Atlanta-based Kathryn Petralia and her team have raised almost $240 million. Kabbage is a unicorn startup that helps small businesses get working capital. They've distributed around $2 billion in capital to their 80,000-plus customers. I highlighted Kathryn's story earlier this year. 2. Jennifer Doudna, scientist and co-founder of Editas. Jennifer Doudna invented a new technology called CRISPR that edits DNA "like you edit a Word document," she explains. A member of the five-scientist team that raised $220 million--a significant haul for an early stage technology not even in clinical trials--Jennifer's story was covered in detail by Kimberly Weisul earlier this year. Because one of her co-founders is contending the patent on her work (she submitted earlier but he had his application fast-tracked), Jennifer left Editas. Since then, emails have come out that the speedy-filing scientist, a guy named Zhang, was following her work closely and apparently about six months behind. You can learn more about the status of the patent dispute in this recent article in Fierce Biotech. Editas went public shortly after raising that capital. 3. Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos. While certainly going through struggles on several fronts with Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes is still a top performer in fundraising in the past 12 months. Theranos investor Tim Draper was recently quoted by CNNMoney as positive on the value of Theranos: "If the government officials act fairly and allow this new technology to develop and improve, the company is worth way more than $9 billion. The world is watching. Women are watching. Young innovators are watching. I hope our government does the right thing." Holmes recently broke her long silence in this interview below. 4. Reshma Shetty, co-founder of Gingko Bioworks. With more than $151 million raised to develop a platform for bioengineering, Reshman Shetty says, "This next century is where we learn how to design biology-programming." Shetty intends to be the Intel for biology. Paired with this bold vision is her humble, thorough approach. "The thing that best qualifies you for starting a company is if you can live on small enough money," she says with a smile. Then, "the most important thing you should think about if you're going to start a company is, what is your mission?" Gingko's mission is to make biology easier to engineer. She didn't start raising money until years after starting the firm, because, "When most people pitch an investor, you don't necessarily know what the product is--and you change course. We deliberately waited until we had a clear picture of where we're going and we had traction with customers." Moving forward, one of her concerns is hiring women and minorities, which she admits is tough. She says her diversity strategy is like the movie Moneyball--systematically building a sustainable company and also ensuring that Gingko has a diverse workforce. "The very fact that there is a significant under-representation of women and minorities in tech suggests to me that women and minorities are systematically undervalued." You can catch more of her story at length below. 5. Amy Pressman, co-founder with her husband of Medallia. Amy Pressman has raised more than $150 million to help companies "see through their customers' eyes." The customer-feedback-and-experience company is a leader in its field. 6. Shannon Dahl, Lauren Niklason, and Juliana Blum, co-founders of Humacyte. This trio is working on growing new, healthy tissue for people suffering from disease with a tissue-engineering company that's raised $150 million. "I would hope one day our engineered blood vessels could be implanted into patients. I hope one day engineered lungs will be able to help patients with several lung diseases--although I think that's decades away." Hear Yale scientist Niklason speak below about Humacyte's vision. 7. Linda Avey, founder of Curious. Biologist and serial entrepreneur Linda Avey has raised $115.74 million to help you own insights into your personal data. Questions like, Does my diet really trigger my migraines? Do I sleep better if I cut out caffeine completely or can I still drink a cup or two? Should I be doing more weight-resistance exercise? Do I really need any of those thousands of supplements they sell at GNC? Does a gluten-free diet lower my stress and/or inflammation? You can try the Curious platform today, which uses big data and healthcare data to bring medical insights down to earth. Before founding Curious, Avey was co-founder at 23&M3, also on this list. 8. Gaia Dempsey, co-founder of Daqri. As co-founder of one of the world's largest emerging enterprise virtual reality companies, Gaia Dempsey believes the future of sharing information lies in mastering augmented reality. The company's projects help workers in industry see the data associated with physical structures. Dempsey has raised $115 million so far. This vision has attracted industrial customers from the bleeding edge, like Hyperloop, to the traditional, like Siemens. She discusses it below. 9. Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO at 23 & Me. Anne Wojcicki has raised $115 million to help people like you and me understand our DNA, including our ancestry and potential disease profiles. "The idea that people are actually empowered to get their own health information" is the founding vision, she says. More than a million people have used her kits, and drug companies are now starting to use the data she's mined to help create drugs faster. She recently spoke with Forbes about the challenges and successes of her entrepreneurial journey. Correction: An earlier version of this post cited Social Finance CEO Tracy Palandjan as the woman founder who has raised the most venture capital this year. Pitchbook informed Inc. that its data included a reporting error, and that Palandjan does not in fact rank in the top 10. This post has been updated to reflect the change. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Aug 29, 2016 Advertisement

We wish everyone the best of holidays and a prosperous 2017! #StandWithLeslie and Obliterate Internet Trolls By Rob Enderle Aug 29, 2016 10:28 AM PT I think there's a legitimate argument for removing one category of folks from the gene pool, because they spend the little time they are given on Earth making other folks' lives miserable. Back when I was playing MMOs, some twisted folks -- known as "griefers," would lie in wait to mug lower level characters and find creative ways to destroy the fun in a game, often eventually killing it. Then came trolls, folks who drop into forums to attack other members, often driving people away from the forums and killing them. More recently, these folks have gone onto websites that allow comments to attack the authors, so that many sites have had to remove comment sections in order to protect their employees. That reduces engagement and eliminates much of the enjoyment associated with reading online. One of the most horrible things I've ever witnessed in this regard is Gamergate, which started by pitting one of the rare women in tech against a bunch of -- you know, I don't have name bad enough for them -- who made her life, and the lives of most anyone who defended her, miserable because she dared to break up with an abusive boyfriend. Now, there's Leslie Jones, a comedian, who has suffered brutal public attacks just for being herself. This has gone so far over the line that Homeland Security now is directly involved, suggesting her attackers are viewed as a threat against the State. The hashtag #StandWithLeslie is an aggressive call to action from those of us who are saying "enough." Leslie Jones' website was hacked in massive violation of the actress' privacy: https://t.co/Cr3I1p36Pr pic.twitter.com/wks3qqwjlc — Entertainment Weekly (@EW) August 24, 2016 We in technology need to go further to make sure the tools we create to enrich lives aren't used to destroy them instead. We have the tools to identify people who engage in this type of behavior and not only remove them from social networks and forums, but also prevent them from getting on in the first place. There is even a strong monetary incentive to do this. Trolls and griefers don't stop at destroying lives -- they kill digital properties too. So getting this right not only could make the difference in how your product is viewed, but also could determine whether it -- and your job -- survives. I'll offer some thoughts on how to end trolls and griefers and then close with my product of the week: a long-underappreciated offering from Amazon, its US$49 Fire tablet. Analytics to the Rescue It strikes me that many of the amazing new technologies we develop end up largely being used against us rather than for us. Analytics is such a tool, because in most cases it is used to improve ad targeting in order to get us to buy stuff we often don't need. In effect, analytics is incredibly powerful in getting the firm that uses it money. That is understandable, given that it's an expensive tool, and funding is far easier to come by if you can tie the spend to some increased revenue. Nuclear power is similar, in a sense. Its first use was to kill, because that is what best justified the research -- survival is a huge motivator. However, both analytics and nuclear power offer far more beneficial uses than mining customers' wallets or killing mass quantities of people. With analytics, we can analyze the personalities of people based on how they interact online, blacklist them from social media networks and online forums, and remove any chance they'll work for our companies. Granted, there is a danger of falsely accusing people. For that reason -- and unlike the terrorist no-fly list -- people so identified should be notified and given a path to get off the list, particularly those who were wrongly included. In the long term, successful elimination of trolls and griefers actually could change politics in the developed world, as people with those tendencies increasingly would find it difficult to get the critical mass of support needed to enter a race. Politicians who sank to trollish behavior while running immediately would lose their social media voice to a large extent. I actually think this would make the current election far less painful to watch. Instead of an ugly choice between two people -- neither of whom should be viable candidates -- and a debate on which of them would do less damage, we'd be able to pick a qualified candidate based on potential accomplishments. #HACKHARASSMENT Pledge There are many tools to unfriend, block, or simply not acknowledge folks on social networks. You can think of them as cowards -- which most frankly are, in my view -- and realize that their lives must be pretty pathetic if what they think of as fun is simply causing others pain. The old rule is "don't feed the trolls," and with all of the publicity, we are feeding them far too much right now and giving far too many of them their 15 minutes of fame. Deny them that, and this problem likely will begin to moderate. One of the things our industry has gotten behind, and Intel is one of the big promoters, is the Hack Harassment Pledge: Online harassment has become a pervasive and often vicious problem with real-life repercussions. It has significant negative consequences for the well being and safety of individuals and for the success of digital communities. Everyone -- regardless of their identity, background, or beliefs -- is entitled to an online world where they are treated with respect and are free from harassment. In order to build a safer, smarter, and more inclusive experience online, I will recognize when harassment is occurring, responsibly speak up against it, and support those experiencing it by Abiding by and upholding the same standards and values online that are expected offline and accepting that my online behavior has real-life consequences; Valuing and supporting diverse perspectives, backgrounds and opinions; Actively participating in the movement to decrease the prevalence and intensity of online harassment. I've taken this pledge, and this column is part of my effort to fulfill it. I'm asking you to take the pledge as well -- and if it is within your power, to support people like Leslie Jones and work to make this a better world. We should make it better not only for those we care about, but also for our own self interests as well. You see, the next Leslie Jones could be you or me. Wrapping Up We complain about the lack of women in technology, and yet we don't make the segment safe for women. However, trollish behavior knows no limits. Anyone of any age, sex, color or religion can be hurt by it. Both children and adults have suffered horrible humiliation, terror and other abuses, and some even have committed suicide as a result of troll attacks. Take the pledge -- and even if you don't like the person being attacked, stand up for the individual's rights and stand against attackers. I'm not advocating violence against those who do this. I'm suggesting that we stand united with those who are attacked and collectively and consistently tell the attackers to stop. If you have power over a social media tool or forum, I'm also suggesting that you set up a mechanism to identify and ban those who misbehave, providing some recourse so that people who are hacked or misclassified can get their privileges back. At some point, we need to say "enough," and I've more than reached that point. My hope is that you have as well, and that you too will take the pledge and stand with people like Leslie Jones -- if only to ensure that you won't stand alone if the trolls should come for you. I'm a long time Kindle and Fire tablet user, and I've bought nearly every product in Amazon's e-reader and tablet lineup. There have been only two exceptions: the high-end e-paper product and Amazon's $49 7-inch Fire tablet. I passed up the first because I want something I can use for more than reading, so spending a ton on what is basically a reader doesn't make much sense. I resisted the second because I thought the $49 Fire had to be crap, given the price. As part of a company project, I had to buy a $49 Fire tablet -- and you know what? It actually is surprisingly good. It is good as a reader, it plays movies just fine, the battery life isn't bad, and it is more portable than most of the other tablets I use. I actually prefer carrying it over either the larger Fire or the Samsung tablets I have -- each of which costs between four and 10 times what this little beast costs. $49 7-Inch Kindle Fire Tablet The $49 Fire is arguably sturdier than any of the high-end tablets as well. Granted, things like speakers and gaming performance are hardly high end, but given that you are mostly playing casual games on it, it isn't bad. You'll likely be wearing headphones with it most of the time too, so the speaker doesn't matter much. If you want a tablet that is hard to break, doesn't break you if you break it, is great for kids, or just won't break the bank, Amazon's $49 Fire tablet is one of the truly amazing, incredible value products in the market -- and it's my product of the week.

For some reason, it seems my invite got lost in the mail (again), so I’ll again be sitting on the sidelines and watching the event from the sidelines, most likely based on the coverage by Jason and Dan at Sixcolors.com. Unless I’m in a court room and off the internet, since I have jury duty that week… This is traditionally when the new iPhone is announced, and there’s strong speculation that the 2nd generation watch will be announced as well. It’s our normal cycle for replacing phones (Laurie and I are still on iPhone 6) so I’m expecting to spend money on new phones. Which ones? Unclear, because there are indications the new big phone has an upgraded camera, which is tempting, but I much prefer the smaller form factor, and I won’t know until after the details come out what I’ll be doing. Will I upgrade to the new watch? I don’t know. I expect WatchOS 3 will push the watch forward in a big way, so people worrying about their first gen watch becoming obsolete should be pleasantly surprised, unless they just have a thing for always having the latest and greatest. I might, but it’s low on my priority list. But… Macbooks? Will Apple announce its new macbooks next week, or wait until later? I hope it’s next week, but there’s a lot of uncertainty about this. So much for how Apple can’t keep secrets any more… But I’m in the market for a new laptop, once Apple announced their new ones. My current 15″ MacBook Pro (2013) is perfectly fine, honestly, but it’s, well, big and heavy. A nice workhorse, but it’s a workhorse that I almost never undock from the desk any more. I’ve been very tempted to pick up one of the 12″ macbooks for working mobile, but I wanted to see what the new Macbook Pros looked like before a final decision. In a perfect world, I’d love a 13″ Macbook Pro with a good processor and GPU and the standard features the MPB bring with it, and with the new model, USB C and Thunderbolt 3. I don’t think it’s unreasonable guess there’ll be a 13″ screen with processing that matches or beats my existing 15″ model using a lot less power in a smaller form factor. Where are the Macbooks? Apple’s caught a lot of justified criticism for letting their product line go stale, but it seems they made some decisions that came back to bite them in terms of components (especially delays by Intel). And the new rumored books have hardware with a lot of new technology, which implies they can’t be supported until Mac OS Sierra ships. It also looks to me like the Sierra betas are coming along faster than in past years, making me think they’re pushing for an earlier release this year: maybe not next week, but sometime in September. And the Macbook hardware is blocked by the OS release, and the other things Apple maybe doing (new Cinema display?) can’t be released until the CPUs support them, and… And so Apple made some choices that have messed up their product cycles big time, but it now looks like that logjam is about to break loose. My perfect world scenario? I’d love to see new Mac Minis released along with the new MacBook pros, because I already have invested in a really nice monitor and so I’m not really interested in moving to the iMac G5, but I’d love a Mac Mini with the same performance package as that computer, and a Macbook for mobile work to go with it. Or a really nice, fast 13″ Macbook pro. I’m going to be really curious what surprises come out of next weeks event, because while we think we know most of the high level details, it’s what doesn’t leak out of Apple that I find most interesting. So, the waiting is almost over. Unless the laptop announcements are pushed out to later. But man, I hope not.. Here’s hoping that a release date for Sierra and some new hardware that uses it shows up next week… Share this: Tweet Email This entry was posted in About Chuq, Apple Inc. « Celebrating the 100th Anniversary of our National Parks: a treasure owned by all of us iPhone 7 and the death of the headphone jack… » Subscribe (or else) I’m looking for my next job.

This research report titled 'Global Front-end-of-the-line Semiconductor Equipment Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. FEOL equipment experienced a decline in 2015 due to a decline in sales of PCs and oversupply of DRAM. However, it will gain pace 2016 onward with the growing memory market and the increasing investments in fabs. The semiconductor market will see a high demand for semiconductor chips and memory devices from 2017 onward due to the growing adoption of IoT, high demand for connected devices, and increased vehicleautomation Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead analyst at Technavio, specializing in research on semiconductor equipment, says, "Semiconductor device manufacturers are increasing their capital spending by expanding their production facilities or constructing new fabs. The majority of the investment for new facilities will be for the development of memory and logic ICs due to their high demand." Request sample report: http://goo.gl/aK4CkO Based on end-user, the report categorizes the global FEOL semiconductor equipment market into three segments. They are: Foundry Memory Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) Foundry The foundry segment dominated the global FEOL semiconductor equipment market in 2015 and will grow at a CAGR of 2.25% during the forecast period. In 2015, the foundry segment saw a decline in capital expenditure due to a decline in the sales of tablets and PCs, which impacted the demand for new equipment by the foundries. However, the market will see a positive growth rate 2016 onward until 2019. The foundrysegment will gain momentum during the forecast period due to the increasing number of fab construction some of which are scheduled to start construction in 2016 while some already started construction in 2015. Around seven foundry fabs are expected to be completed by 2017. The R&D spending by TSMC, the industry's biggest pure-play foundry, rose by 10% in 2015 compared with 2014. Memory The memory segment will grow at a CAGR of 2.58% during the forecast period. In 2015, the memory segment saw a strong growth primarily due to structural changes such as segment consolidation in DRAM, higher market entry barriers, and more diversified demand. The major change includes the transition from planar to second-generation 3D NAND. The memory market is gradually transitioning to 3D NAND and next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies. The major memory customers are ramping up 3D NAND volume production, which will result in the growth of production equipment. For instance, Intel entered the 3D NAND business in 2016, partnering with Micron, which will significantly increase the spending levels on semiconductor capital equipment such as FEOL semiconductor equipment. IDM The IDM segment will decline during the period of 2015-2016 due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The manufacturing of ICs is a long and expensive process, from the conceptualization to the actual production and thus mandates high investment for the installation of equipment and machines like lithography equipment for chip fabrication. The shift of the IC manufacturing companies to the fabless model for reducing the pressure on their cash reserves and improving the focus on their core strengths will steady the decline in price after 2016. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio's research analysts in this report are: Applied Materials ASML TEL Lam Research KLA-Tencor Browse Related Reports: Global Semiconductor Packaging Equipment Market 2016-2020 Semiconductor Market in Vietnam 2016-2020 Global Semiconductor Capital Equipment Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

New Photo Leak Might Confirm Colors And Designs For Apple Products By Alexandra Suarez On 08/29/16 AT 12:56 PM Close A recent photo leak might give customers some insight into how Apple Inc.’s new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus phones will look. Weblog BGR published a series of photos Monday that claimed to offer a sneak peek of what the new phones will look like. The tech outlet reported that the new phones should look very similar to Apple’s current generation of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models. That said, the new generation might be thinner. Techradar reported that the iPhone 7 would indeed be slimmer than the current iPhone 6, which is 7.1mm wide. A source told the tech outlet that the new devices could measure in at 6mm and 6.5mm in thickness. Related Stories The 5 Biggest Rumors Surrounding New iPhone 7 Why Apple Is 'Likely' To Use Intel Chips In Future iOS Devices Rumors have circulated on the web for months regarding the new iPhone 7, especially its release date and how the new phones will look. In the recently leaked images, two new camera features can be seen. The iPhone 7 Plus will reportedly have a new dual-lens camera in the back while the other iPhone 7 will just have an upgraded camera lens. And, of course, there is the matter of what exterior colors the new phones will come in. The 2015 models for the 6 and the 6 Plus came in a new rose gold color. Earlier this month, BGR published other iPhone 7 leaked photos that suggested a new color would be added. Deemed “Space Black iPhone 7 Pro,” the photo shows the phone with a black, almost matte-like exterior color. An electric blue color (which appears in the leaked photos) also suggest that could be another new feature color for the devices. Prices for the new iPhone 7 have not yet been confirmed. Apple sent out invitations Monday for a Sept. 7 product launch event that is widely speculated to be the big unveiling of the next iPhone model.

Or, as the ad states, the Mac is “less useful, like a hat for your cat.” The Surface Pro 4 (pictured above) also weighs less than the MacBook Air, coming in at 2.36 pounds versus the MacBook’s 2.96. And, as Microsoft is quick to point out, the new Surface is faster, according to 3DMark's Sky Diver tests conducted last year comparing the Surface against the 13-inch version of the MacBook Air. A Tablet To Replace Your Laptop Microsoft is making a full-throated pitch for professional and business clients looking to replace their old laptops with the new Surface Pro 4. On the company’s page for the Surface, it describes the tablet’s keyboard as “laptop class.” Microsoft also mentions the device’s full-size USB 3.0 port, microSD card reader, and Mini DisplayPort. To make its case against the MacBook even more direct, Microsoft offers a side-by-side comparison between the two devices. At the top of the list is the weight difference, with Microsoft hoping that the more than half-pound of extra weight the MacBook Air is carrying will push prospective buyers into the Surface’s corner. The comparison also plays up the difference in other key specs. The Surface runs a faster sixth-generation Intel core processor against Apple’s fifth-generation core, while offering a full terabyte worth of storage space (twice as much as the 512 GB offered by the MacBook Air) and up to 16 GB of RAM, versus Apple’s 8 GB. That should provide more than enough firepower for the average business user looking for a portable work device. Bells and Whistles Microsoft is also attempting to provoke Apple with its argument that the Surface “runs all your desktop software,” a reference to the fact that the new tablet will be running Windows 10 Pro. The MacBook Air runs Apple’s iOS, which doesn’t work with apps designed for desktop environments. But beyond the capabilities designed to appeal primarily to professionals, Microsoft has included a few other features that are likely to attract a consumer audience as well. The Surface will let users run Windows Hello, Microsoft’s facial recognition software that allows users to log in to their computers just by looking into their cameras. It also offers a higher resolution screen, at 5M pixels versus the MacBook Air’s 1.3M pixels, making it more appealing as a platform for watching videos and movies. It also sports a 1080p 5MP front-facing camera and 8MP autofocus rear-facing camera, while the MacBook Air only features a single 720p front-facing camera. The Surface Pro 4 is available for purchase now on Microsoft’s Web site starting at $899 for the entry-level model.

The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global electronic design automationmarket for 2016-2020. The report also presents the major vendors that develop EDA software tools in regions such as the Americas; EMEA, and APAC. The presence of numerous semiconductor companies such as Samsung, SK Hynix, and Toshiba along with electronic device OEMs such as Sony, LG, Haier, Lenovo, Xiaomi, Nikon, Pioneer, Voltas, Panasonic, ASUS, and Havells has made APAC the fastest growing region in the global EDA market. Furthermore, the outsourcing of software development to APAC is also a major factor for this growth. Technavio hardware and semiconductor analysts highlight the following four factors that are contributing to the growth of the global electronic design automation market: Increasing requirement for SoC technology Demand for miniaturized electronic devices of high precision across sectors Adoption of FinFET architecture High R&D investments Increasing requirement for SoC technology The growth in the smart appliance and digital home markets during the last decade has resulted in high demand for high-powered, efficient, and smart electronic devices from the end-user segment. These changes have been brought about by advances in device technology and the integration of billions of transistors on a particular chip called SoC. The high processing capability of these chips has made it possible to adhere to the demand for embedded graphics and multicore technologies. This development is in line with the growing complexity of chip designs in the semiconductor industry. According to Sunil Kumar Singh, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on embeddedsystems, "Manufacturers of smart electronics such as wireless communication equipment, ECG, smartphones, telemetry devices, and automotive body electronics have started integrating SoC technology into their products. In addition, with the emergence of system-in-package technology, mixed-signal SoC manufacturers are now able to integrate more functionality onto a single chip at a moderate price." Demand for miniaturized electronic devices of high precision across sectors The demand for compact electronic devices has grown in almost every sector, including communication, automotive, industrial manufacturing, and healthcare equipment. This trend has forced semiconductor IC manufacturers to increase R&D expenditure in order to reduce the size while optimizing the performance of ICs. This has led to the emergence of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and 3D semiconductor devices. MEMS and 3D ICs have an increasing number of interconnects and transistors in the limited space, which requires finer deposition and patterning. "Therefore, the miniaturization of electronic devices will have a moderately high impact on the development of advanced production system for MEMS, 3D ICs, and fin-shaped field effect transistors or FinFETs, creating the need for electronic design automation to carry out the designing for the semiconductor devices," says Sunil. Adoption of FinFET architecture The surging demand for smart devices such as digital cameras, smartphones, notebooks, PDAs, PCs, and tablets along with the advent of new technology platforms such as the IoT has necessitated chip manufacturers to migrate from planar FET designs to FinFET architecture design. Dielectric etching is one of the major etching steps in the designing process. The need for improving performance and reducing power consumption has resulted in a wider adoption of FinFET architecture. FinFETs are estimated to be 37% faster than planar FET, consuming less than 50% of the dynamic power, or reducing static leakage current usage by almost as much as 90%. The increasing adoption of FinFET in 3D semiconductor devices is expected to fuel the demand for designing tools such as EDA tools because of the complex nature of FinFET designs. High R&D investments R&D forms an integral part of the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor industry recorded its highest R&D spending of USD 56.4 billion in 2015. This, however, is not in lieu of the industry standard for R&D spending since 2010, which grew at an average of 13% on a yearly basis. The industry spending toward R&D was up by only 0.5% from 2014, which is the lowest the industry has witnessed since the downturn of 2009. The spending was also below the CAGR of 4% between 2005 and 2015. Intel, one of the leading chip vendors in the market, accounted for 22% of total semiconductor spending in 2015. This was the highest among leading players such as Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics, and Avago Technologies and foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) Browse Related Reports: Global EDA Market in the Automotive Industry 2015-2019 Global EDA Market in the Aerospace and Defense Sector 2015-2019 Global EDA Market in the Industrial Electronics 2015-2019 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

Tuesday, January 3, 2017 Facebook Twitter RSS Navigate Home News Opinion Regions World Sports Business Special Features SPECIAL REPORTS The Sunday Times You are at:Home»Business»PLDT fixed broadband subscribers up 14% in H1 PLDT fixed broadband subscribers up 14% in H1 0 By JAMES KONSTANTIN GALVEZ, TMT on August 29, 2016 Business Tweet LEADING telecommunications services provider PLDT Inc., through its consumer group PLDT HOME, said its fixed broadband subscriber base grew 14 percent year-on-year to almost 1.3 million in the first six months of the year. PLDT HOME operations head Oscar Enrico Reyes Jr. added that quarter on quarter, their fixed broadband subscribers rose 4 percent as the company boosted its broadband programs with successful activations and superior digital products and services. “Our most recent offering is the Smart Watch, which helps parents keep track of their children. This cool gadget for kids will enable them to take photos, play music, and when paired with the Telpad or a smart phone, they can also receive notifications, calls, and text messages,” he said. PLDT continues to grow its fixed line business despite challenges from over-the-top players and the increasing shift to mobile devices. Its home entertainment services running on broadband include PLDT HOME DSL and PLDT HOME Fibr, which serve as the foundation for value-added services such as linear IPTV with Cignal TV, catch up TV with Fox, and video on demand as offered by iflix, all of which are available at home and on mobile devices. Meanwhile, its Data Sharing service enables customers to access Smart HOME through their mobile devices. “This is best experienced with the country’s most powerful broadband, PLDT HOME Fibr, with speeds of up to 1Gbps,” the executive said. PLDT Group’s consolidated capital expenditures for the first half of 2016 amounted to P20 billion, up 44 percent from the same period last year. The higher capital expenditure level reflects the group’s continuing program to roll out high-speed data infrastructure on its fixed-line network – in the form of more fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) facilities – and its mobile network – particularly through the expansion of its 4G/LTE mobile network. “As we strengthen our data infrastructure, we also make it easier for our customers to adopt web-capable devices such as the Telpad, FamCam, and the TVolution Stick as they start to live the digital life,” Reyes pointed out. Telpad is a tablet that serves as the hub of digital services for the home. It can control home appliances thru WiFi and Infrared as well as the FamCam, a home monitoring security camera that transmits live footage to mobile devices. The TVolution Stick, launched in partnership with Intel and Microsoft, is a device that turns an ordinary TV into a personal computer. “The TVo Stick, Telpad, FamCam, and Smart Watch are Smart HOME devices that are best experienced with PLDT HOME Fibr which can now reach 2.5 million households and is available in 3,000 areas nationwide,” Reyes added. Last year, PLDT established partnerships with international content providers like iflix, Fox International Channels, and Da Vinci Learning to provide customers with a unified experience that brings together both content and connectivity. Other integrated content and services offered by PLDT include Cignal on Telpad which allows subscribers to access select kid-friendly Cignal programs on Telpad, and Cignal on Broadband (Cignal over Fibr, and Cignal over DSL), the only IPTV service in the country.

MNR Daily HOME U.S. WORLD ENTERTAINMENT SCIENCE/HEALTH TECH LIFE Subscriptions Home TECH Microsoft Surface Book 2 release date: 2-in-1 to come with new hinge and Kaby Lake CPU; 2017 launch likely Charles Lim Aug 31, 2016 5:16 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Microsoft official website)The Microsoft Surface Book The release of the original Surface 2-in-1 tablet-laptop, the Microsoft Surface Book, was able to answer the majority of the needs of businessmen and power users, which is why it had experienced some relative success in the market. It is therefore quite understandable why tech fans are now getting impatient in waiting for any news regarding its highly anticipated successor, the Microsoft Surface Book 2. The company itself has unfortunately not been very open regarding details of the device's development, which has resulted in numerous rumors and reports surfacing online that are aimed at predicting when the device would be coming out and what it would be offering to the market. As of the moment, some leaks have provided fans with a hint at what the new Surface Book would likely be coming with, including its possible hardware and features. According to the latest leak reports, the brand-new Surface Book 2 will apparently be doing away with the original hinge design of its predecessor. The dynamic fulcrum hinge, as Microsoft had coined it, was not well received by most fans as it actually leaves a small gap when the laptop was closed. The gap itself was not just unsightly to look at, but it also allowed dust and dirt to seep into it and onto the device's screen and keyboard. The new Surface Book 2 is believed to be coming with a new hinge design that is rumored to be closer to typical hinges found in other laptops. As for the device's internals, the new Surface Book 2 is also being rumored to be coming with Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors. The new central processing unit (CPU) will greatly increase the device's performance and at the same time rid the device of the battery issues that had plagued its predecessor. Several reports regarding the device's release date base their delay claims on the fact that the Kaby Lake processor wouldn't become available until the latter part of this year. The reports claim that the CPU's late release will result in Microsoft delaying their launch date to incorporate the new chips onto their device. For now, the Surface Book 2 is reportedly going to be launched early next year, and most likely together with the Surface Pro 5 and the rumored Surface Phone smartphone.

Now, to further fuel these speculations, it appears that Microsoft itself is teasing the upcoming "Surface Book 2" on its official Instagram account. Discovered by Windows Central, the images show off a considerably different hinge from the original Surface Book. While Microsoft obviously hasn't officially outed it as the Surface Book 2, the image is in line with previous reports which suggested that the company is working on improving the unusual and elaborate 'fulcrum hinge' of the Surface Book, to remove the gap created when the device is folded shut. The new design is said to allow the display to fold flat with the keyboard section, like a conventional notebook. Another noticeable detail in the image is the black color of the alleged device, which is considerably different from the silver/magnesium color of the current Surface Book. Windows Central reports that while internal prototypes of the upcoming Surface Book are indeed black in color - or a dark metal for that matter - it is not yet confirmed if the device will be available to the public in the aforementioned color. With that being said, it is important to keep in mind that nothing can be said for sure about the upcoming high end device. Rumors indicate that the arrival of the new Surface Book will depend upon availability of Intel's Kaby Lake chips, pointing to a Spring 2017 timeframe, which coincides with the release of Windows 10 Redstone 2. Additionally, the company is also expected to launch the alleged Surface Phone and possibly three iterations of the Surface All-in-One desktop PCs. Update: It appears that the image Microsoft posted on its Surface Instagram account is of a Surface Book after all. Prolific Windows phone developer Rudy Huyn has just posted an image on Twitter which indicates that previous one is from an earlier Surface Book promo and not from an internal Microsoft "sizzler reel" as the original source had speculated. Hey @verge and @windowscentral, sorry but it's a promo image of the original Surface book... ;) pic.twitter.com/jTav2tJjwv — Rudy Huyn (@RudyHuyn) August 29, 2016 Indeed the two images are rather similar and it now seems likely that Microsoft isn't teasing images of the Surface Book 2 after all.

Surface ads have successfully promoted competitive advantages of the hybrid device, which comes with a detachable keyboard, pen, touchscreen and more. And thanks to an Intel chip, it runs the full Office suite and most other Windows programs, like Photoshop. Here’s the latest Surface Pro 4 ad, titled “Surface Pro 4 is the one for me”. I think it’s a pretty nice ad that doesn’t insult Apple customers more than Apple’s legendary Mac vs. PC campaign annoyed Windows customers. What did you think of this ad? Share: Tweet Follow: Follow @iDownloadBlog We Recommend What’s a computer? Just ask Cortana. New Surface Pro 4 ad pokes fun of the Mac because it doesn’t have a touchscreen New Surface ad wants you to think that your Mac “ain’t fast enough” DisplayMate: iPad Pro has stellar screen, but not better than iPad mini 4 Related Topics Advertising, Apple, iPad, iPad Pro, Marketing, Microsoft, News, Surface, Surface Pro 4 stylesbeyond that joke surface that crashes all the time and joke OS haha, they have nothing over OS X and a mac Danielle Erpenbeck Whatever. People are going to like Apple or not.. or use both platforms. No need to bash one another but I’m sure it’s all in good fun. I will like Macs forever, and I don’t care what haters say! lol Christian Zibreg Nuff said… racerhomie2 Microsoft must be Crazy trying to sell to sell a defective product like that.All of my friends who bought Surface Books returned them. racerhomie2 This is cringier than MACvsPC Rolf Bause The last spot with iPad Pro was kinda amusing and had a few valid points. But this one is pathetic. pnh I’m not sure about their analogy. It worked out pretty well for this guy. Jayy Lol therealjjohnson Cute. But absurd. Ive been using a Macbook Air since mad 2014. Useless? Please… Samuel I’ve been using mine since mid 2012, still fast as a bullet. ravinigga I don’t know if choose same specs on both platforms (again macos runs different with specs like iOS) Microsoft surface is more expensive even without the smart keyboard ravinigga And what can do more? Nowadays is does the same and they compare a 2 in 1 tablet vs a laptop.. Hussam Aldean I have MacBook Ait and I say with my full power. go to hell windows Joshua The-Legend Wiebe It’s that the kind of MacBook that consumes you or the one before 7? Starfall88 I bought the surface pro 4 when it first came out and I returned it the next day. The device is heavy, the OS is not touch friendly and it cost over $1000. Leslie B I’ve used Windows since it first came out. Versions 1, 2, 3, 3.1, 95, 98, etc, etc, etc. Then about 5 years ago, I learned it was possible to run Windows natively on a Mac. Intrigued by this idea, I bought myself a refurbished 2010 MacBook Air from Apple. My main reason for this was to learn about Macs and OS X, figuring I could use it as a standard Windows computer after teaching myself about Macs. It took some getting used to, but after about a month I noticed I wasn’t using Windows anymore. This wasn’t really a conscious choice; it just sort of happened. The Mac had also become my computer of choice for most of my daily computer activities. A few months later, I began to think about Apple’s iPhone. Up to that point, my experience with cell phones had been problematic. To be more precise, they all ended up pi**ing me off. They were poorly designed and unreliable. All the reviews I read about the iPhone seemed to be saying the same thing. Android had more bells and whistles and stuff, but if all someone wanted was a reliable, user-friendly cell phone, then Apple was probably the best choice. Having been a techie all my life, I could figure out just about anything. But what I’d learned from my Mac was that I had been spending a whole lot of time diagnosing and fixing just because of poor design. Fast forward to today… You couldn’t pay me enough to voluntarily buy anything with Windows on it. I think Steve Jobs said it best when he commented that Microsoft was the McDonald’s of the computer industry –basically mediocre and uninspiring. This article has inspired me to dismantle my remaining Windows computers. The bigger hard drives I can use for backing up my Macs. The remainder I can sell to some sucker at a yard sale! Gabriel Anaya Windows is a joke. So unstable and crashing is a common occurance, plus it just looks pretty ugly. I am so glad I switched to a Mac for my first semester in college. iByron Wait. They went after the MacBook Air? Hah! The iPad Pro I could see, but the MacBook Air is such a stalwart and sturdy machine that I bought a used 2012 model (well cared for) for travel and still feel like I got a new machine. When I’m out at the airport, the things are all over the place being used by everyone from businessmen and -women to teens on vacation. It’s arguably the most not-less-useful traveling computer out there. Stick to the iPad Pro comparisons, MSoft. A lot of people don’t have them yet, and you just might score points.   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Happy New Year firework wallpapers Jailbreak tweaks of the week: CCLowPower, CCRecord, Evanesco, & more… The top stories of the week on iDB CCLowPower adds a Low Power Mode toggle to Control Center ForceInPicture enables Picture in Picture mode on unsupported devices   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: CCLowPower, CCRecord, Evanesco, & more… CCLowPower adds a Low Power Mode toggle to Control Center ForceInPicture enables Picture in Picture mode on unsupported devices CCRecord: a tweak to quickly and easily record your iPhone screen Customize your iOS 10 Control Center toggle colors with Cream 2 and Creamless iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2017.

INNOVATE Meet 9 Women Who Have Raised Hundreds of Millions This Year Editas, Daqri, Kabbage, Ginkgo Bioworks--their companies range from editing DNA to virtual reality. By Lisa Calhoun Lisa Calhoun is general partner at Valor Ventures. She is the author of How You Rule the World and runs the online magazine FemaleEntrepreneurs as well as Female Founder meetups through the Southeast. She founded Write2Market, a tech public relations firm that ranks in the Top 10 agencies for startups in the country. Hobbies include golf, running, and Dutch. @Lisa_Calhoun General partner, Valor Ventures@Lisa_Calhoun WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement You've heard there are fewer women in STEM fields, or that fewer women lead technical companies. Well, the ones that do are raising significant capital to pursue their passions. I asked the analysts at Pitchbook to help me take a data-driven look at the landscape around female founders. They may be on the venture frontier, but even so, they're defining it with bold visions that range from inspired finance to practical virtual reality to the forefront of genetics and what's next for manufacturing. Top-ranked women for venture capital raised in 2016. Last year, the top-ranked female founders for raising venture capital included Sunrun, which IPO'd last year. This year, one of the top startups with a female founder has already had an IPO (Editas). See which trends you spot in this ranking of women who've raised hundreds of millions in venture capital in the past 12 months: 1. Kathryn Petralia, co-founder of Kabbage. Atlanta-based Kathryn Petralia and her team have raised almost $240 million. Kabbage is a unicorn startup that helps small businesses get working capital. They've distributed around $2 billion in capital to their 80,000-plus customers. I highlighted Kathryn's story earlier this year. 2. Jennifer Doudna, scientist and co-founder of Editas. Jennifer Doudna invented a new technology called CRISPR that edits DNA "like you edit a Word document," she explains. A member of the five-scientist team that raised $220 million--a significant haul for an early stage technology not even in clinical trials--Jennifer's story was covered in detail by Kimberly Weisul earlier this year. Because one of her co-founders is contending the patent on her work (she submitted earlier but he had his application fast-tracked), Jennifer left Editas. Since then, emails have come out that the speedy-filing scientist, a guy named Zhang, was following her work closely and apparently about six months behind. You can learn more about the status of the patent dispute in this recent article in Fierce Biotech. Editas went public shortly after raising that capital. 3. Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos. While certainly going through struggles on several fronts with Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes is still a top performer in fundraising in the past 12 months. Theranos investor Tim Draper was recently quoted by CNNMoney as positive on the value of Theranos: "If the government officials act fairly and allow this new technology to develop and improve, the company is worth way more than $9 billion. The world is watching. Women are watching. Young innovators are watching. I hope our government does the right thing." Holmes recently broke her long silence in this interview below. 4. Reshma Shetty, co-founder of Gingko Bioworks. With more than $151 million raised to develop a platform for bioengineering, Reshman Shetty says, "This next century is where we learn how to design biology-programming." Shetty intends to be the Intel for biology. Paired with this bold vision is her humble, thorough approach. "The thing that best qualifies you for starting a company is if you can live on small enough money," she says with a smile. Then, "the most important thing you should think about if you're going to start a company is, what is your mission?" Gingko's mission is to make biology easier to engineer. She didn't start raising money until years after starting the firm, because, "When most people pitch an investor, you don't necessarily know what the product is--and you change course. We deliberately waited until we had a clear picture of where we're going and we had traction with customers." Moving forward, one of her concerns is hiring women and minorities, which she admits is tough. She says her diversity strategy is like the movie Moneyball--systematically building a sustainable company and also ensuring that Gingko has a diverse workforce. "The very fact that there is a significant under-representation of women and minorities in tech suggests to me that women and minorities are systematically undervalued." You can catch more of her story at length below. 5. Amy Pressman, co-founder with her husband of Medallia. Amy Pressman has raised more than $150 million to help companies "see through their customers' eyes." The customer-feedback-and-experience company is a leader in its field. 6. Shannon Dahl, Lauren Niklason, and Juliana Blum, co-founders of Humacyte. This trio is working on growing new, healthy tissue for people suffering from disease with a tissue-engineering company that's raised $150 million. "I would hope one day our engineered blood vessels could be implanted into patients. I hope one day engineered lungs will be able to help patients with several lung diseases--although I think that's decades away." Hear Yale scientist Niklason speak below about Humacyte's vision. 7. Linda Avey, founder of Curious. Biologist and serial entrepreneur Linda Avey has raised $115.74 million to help you own insights into your personal data. Questions like, Does my diet really trigger my migraines? Do I sleep better if I cut out caffeine completely or can I still drink a cup or two? Should I be doing more weight-resistance exercise? Do I really need any of those thousands of supplements they sell at GNC? Does a gluten-free diet lower my stress and/or inflammation? You can try the Curious platform today, which uses big data and healthcare data to bring medical insights down to earth. Before founding Curious, Avey was co-founder at 23&M3, also on this list. 8. Gaia Dempsey, co-founder of Daqri. As co-founder of one of the world's largest emerging enterprise virtual reality companies, Gaia Dempsey believes the future of sharing information lies in mastering augmented reality. The company's projects help workers in industry see the data associated with physical structures. Dempsey has raised $115 million so far. This vision has attracted industrial customers from the bleeding edge, like Hyperloop, to the traditional, like Siemens. She discusses it below. 9. Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO at 23 & Me. Anne Wojcicki has raised $115 million to help people like you and me understand our DNA, including our ancestry and potential disease profiles. "The idea that people are actually empowered to get their own health information" is the founding vision, she says. More than a million people have used her kits, and drug companies are now starting to use the data she's mined to help create drugs faster. She recently spoke with Forbes about the challenges and successes of her entrepreneurial journey. Correction: An earlier version of this post cited Social Finance CEO Tracy Palandjan as the woman founder who has raised the most venture capital this year. Pitchbook informed Inc. that its data included a reporting error, and that Palandjan does not in fact rank in the top 10. This post has been updated to reflect the change. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Aug 29, 2016 Advertisement

Bringing back the woolly mammoth — TEDxChristchurch 2016: 360º is bringing the past to the present. Key points • Topics at TEDxChristchurch 2016 include de-extinction, the use of “waste” in architecture, and the restoration of New Zealand’s bird population • Story about Cacophony Project timely in light of Predator-Free New Zealand initiative • Youth memberships sold out • Creative new TEDxChristchurch Village You don’t need a ticket to Jurassic Park to experience a bygone time. This year TEDxChristchurch is transporting attendees to the past to make a difference for the future. From the resurrection of species to the revival of discarded wind turbines for playgrounds to the restoration of New Zealand’s bird population, TEDxChristchurch 2016 has it all, minus the dinosaurs. Today, TEDxChristchurch announced the next four speakers in the 2016 lineup: Dr. Amy Fletcher, Jos de Krieger, Sophie Rea and Grant Ryan. We’re taught that extinction is forever – but scientists today are proving otherwise. Dr Amy Fletcher, associate professor in political science at the University of Canterbury is looking into the big questions around “bringing back” extinct species. As just one example, we’ve nearly completed sequencing the woolly mammoth genome and it is only a matter of time before scientists have the ability to “revive” extinct species, including the giant sloth, the saber-toothed tiger and New Zealand’s own giant moa. Dr Fletcher’s research and teaching, focused on life sciences and biotechnology, have helped shaped our understanding of wildlife, nature, animals, the role humankind has to play with de-extinction and whether we should be raising creatures of the Ice Age back from the dead. Are we overstepping the field of science? What will become of our conservation efforts if we know there’s a backhand solution? And how far will resurrection go before we’re in the realm of dark arts? Aiming to intervene before de-extinction becomes necessary, the ‘addicted inventor’ Grant Ryan is putting his energy into helping make New Zealand predator-free with The Cacophony Project. The creator of Eurekster, YikeBike and PurePods is harnessing yet more Kiwi ingenuity, using artificial intelligence and big data to eliminate pests and restore New Zealand’s bird population to its former glory. As James Cook’s botanist Joseph Banks explained, the singing of the birds ashore was the “most melodious wild musick [he’d] ever heard… the most tuneable silver sound imaginable.” Ryan is inventing new ways to bring back that soundtrack. Further improving the quality of our environment, Netherlands-based Jos de Krieger and the team from Superuse Studios cleverly manipulate the disused into the useful, leaving nothing to spare. One of the team’s most publicised projects turned recycled wind turbine blades into a children’s playground. Five discarded rotor blades were cut up and into parts to serve as tunnels, towers, bridges, hills, ramps and slides. de Krieger and his team have reused other locally sourced ‘waste’: PVC cable reels into multipurpose storage, airplane seatbelts into fashion accessories – even a whole house made entirely of “waste” materials. de Krieger and his partners are pushing the boundaries of design and building methods while promoting the idea that sustainability, functionality and creativity all go hand in hand. Finally, slam poet Sophie Rea is an up-and-comer to listen to. Taking out first place in the Christchurch Poetry Slam competition and the Rising Voices National Slam, Sophie will win your heart over as she did ours at TEDxYouth@AvonRiver in 2015. One of TEDxChristchurch’s youngest performers, Sophie reminds us that everyone has a story, and she conveys her message with power and conviction. Her words are beautiful to listen to while holding deep meaning and important lessons for society. Following the highly successful return to the CBD last year, TEDxChristchurch 2016: 360º will take place on 29 October at TEDxChristchurch Village, encompassing the iconic Isaac Theatre Royal and surrounding area. This year, the Village expands to include the new Centre for Music and Arts, The Piano, around the corner. Youth memberships sold out within days but General Memberships are still available. The all-day event costs $189.00, which alongside the inspiring talks includes delicious food, the famous goodie bag, entertainment, free espresso all day, and more.

Windows 10 vs. Linux Radeon Software Performance, Including AMDGPU-PRO & RadeonSI Written by Michael Larabel in Operating Systems on 28 August 2016. Page 1 of 7. 82 Comments As alluded to earlier and on Twitter, the past few days I have been working on a fresh Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux graphics/gaming performance comparison. This time it's looking at the latest Radeon performance using an R9 Fury and RX 480. Tests on Windows were obviously done with Radeon Software Crimson Edition while under Linux were the two latest AMD/RTG Linux driver options: the hybrid AMDGPU-PRO driver and the fully open-source driver via Linux 4.8 and Mesa 12.1-dev. Given all the progress of particularly the open-source AMD Linux graphics driver stack this summer and the recent RX 480 Polaris launch, I figured it was a good time to do a fresh comparison of Windows 10 vs. Ubuntu Linux on the red side. Windows 10 Pro x64 had all available updates and was running Radeon Software Crimson Edition 16.8.2. On the Linux side was Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS x86_64 with all available updates. Tested first on the Linux side was AMDGPU-PRO 16.30.3-315407 followed by the open-source driver. For the open-source driver tests was the Linux 4.8 Git kernel along with Mesa 12.1-dev. The Mesa 12.1 Git packages were obtained from the Padoka PPA that are also built against LLVM SVN for the latest AMDGPU compiler back-end. The same Intel Xeon E3-1280 v5 Skylake system was used for both the Windows and Linux benchmarking. With the current AMD open-source driver OpenGL 4.3 was exposed while via AMDGPU-PRO and Radeon Software on Windows there is OpenGL 4.5. It hopefully won't be too much longer until the RadeonSI Gallium3D driver is caught up to OpenGL 4.5. Tested for this article were a wide variety of cross-platform games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Metro Last Light Redux, GRID Autosport, and Tomb Raider. Also tested were Dota 2 and The Talos Principle; with both those games offering OpenGL and Vulkan renderers they were each tested on Windows and Linux to make for a nice comparison. See our premium comparison with Direct3D 11 if you want to see how D3D11 is competing with Vulkan and OGL.

Home About Directory Programs Attractive Chaos Just another WordPress.com weblog Feeds: Posts Comments « Converting PDF to EPS Optimizing Matrix Multiplication August 28, 2016 by attractivechaos Vector and matrix arithmetic (e.g. vector dot and matrix multiplication) are the basic to linear algebra and are also widely used in other fields such as deep learning. It is easy to implement vector/matrix arithmetic, but when performance is needed, we often resort to a highly optimized BLAS implementation, such as ATLAS and OpenBLAS. Are these libraries much faster than our own implementations? Is it worth introducing a dependency to BLAS if you only need basic vector/matrix arithmetic? The following post may give you some hints. Results In this github repository, I implemented matrix multiplication in seven different ways, including a naive implementation, several optimized implementations with cache miss reduction, SSE and loop blocking, and two implementations on top of OpenBLAS. The following table shows the timing of multiplying two 2000×2000 or 4000×4000 random matrices on my personal Mac laptop and a remote linux server (please see the source code repo for details): Implementation -a Linux,-n2000 Linux,-n4000 Mac,-n2000 Naive 0 7.53 sec 188.85 sec 77.45 sec Transposed 1 6.66 sec 55.48 sec 9.73 sec sdot w/o hints 4 6.66 sec 55.04 sec 9.70 sec sdot with hints 3 2.41 sec 29.47 sec 2.92 sec SSE sdot 2 1.36 sec 21.79 sec 2.92 sec SSE+tiling sdot 7 1.11 sec 10.84 sec 1.90 sec OpenBLAS sdot 5 2.69 sec 28.87 sec 5.61 sec OpenBLAS sgemm 6 0.63 sec 4.91 sec 0.86 sec uBLAS 7.43 sec 165.74 sec Eigen 0.61 sec 4.76 sec You can see that a naive implementation of matrix multiplication is quite slow. Simply transposing the second matrix may greatly improve the performance when the second matrix does not fit to the CPU cache (the linux server has a 35MB cache, which can hold a 2000×2000 float matrix in cache, but not a 4000×4000 matrix). Transpose also enables vectorization of the inner loop. This leads to significant performance boost (SSE sdot vs Transposed). Loop blocking further reduces cache misses and timing for large matrices. However, OpenBLAS’ matrix multiplication (sgemm) is still the king of performance, twice as fast as my best hand-written implementation and tens of times faster than a naive implementation. OpenBLAS is fast mostly due to its advanced techniques to minimize cache misses. As side notes, “sdot with hints” partially unrolls the inner loop. It gives a hint to the compiler that the loop may be vectorized. Clang on Mac can fully vectorize this loop, achieving the same speed of explicit vectorization. Gcc-4.4 seems not as good. The Intel compiler vectorizes the loop even without this hint (see the full table in README). Interestingly, the OpenBLAS sdot implementation is slower than my explicit vectorization on both Linux and Mac. I haven’t figured out the reason. I speculate that it may be related to cache optimization. As to C++ libraries, Eigen has similar performance to OpenBLAS. The native uBLAS implementation in Boost is quite primitive, nearly as slow as the most naive implementation. Boost should ditch uBLAS. Even in the old days, it was badly implemented. Conclusions For multiplying two large matrices, sophisticated BLAS libraries, such as OpenBLAS, are tens of times faster than the most naive implementation. With transposing, SSE (x86 only) and loop blocking, we can achieve half of the speed of OpenBLAS’ sgemm while still maintaining relatively simple code. If you want to avoid a BLAS dependency, this is the way to go. For BLAS level-1 routines (vector arithmetic), an implementation with SSE vectorization may match or sometimes exceeds the performance of OpenBLAS. If you prefer a C++ interface and are serious about performance, don’t use uBLAS; use Eigen instead. Like this: Like Loading...

Do you have any theories why OpenBLAS and Eigen is so much better? Are they using threading or maybe AVX? on August 28, 2016 at 8:17 pm | Reply attractivechaos Have a look at the “matrix multiplication algorithm” wiki page and you will get some hints. I guess they are faster mostly because they are better at minimizing cache misses by splitting and reordering the computation block by block. As to other possible explanations – I have intentionally disabled multithreading; although the linux server supports AVX, gcc doesn’t and I explicitly tells OpenBLAS not to use AVX. on August 29, 2016 at 2:19 pm | Reply BLAS Pascal For GotoBLAS, from which OpenBLAS was forked, you might want to read the paper https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pingali/CS378/2008sp/papers/gotoPaper.pdf on August 28, 2016 at 9:49 pm | Reply zhanxwzhanxw I like Eigen a lot. It can use Intel MKL backend, and that has good performances besides matrix multiplication. on August 28, 2016 at 10:44 pm | Reply rurban What about the new gather-scatter vector intrinsics, esp. the 512 bit ones? Is this included in SSE? I guess not, as it needs AVX or Knights Landing/Phi. on August 29, 2016 at 8:56 am | Reply 2# This is one very interesting ecample where you could use some multy threading in order to acchieve faster multiplication. on October 14, 2016 at 1:45 pm | Reply Paweł I do recomend including also implementation with instruction reordering(eliminates cache-misisng) and openmp directives for parallization Comments RSS Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Lasta Aug 28, 2016 | 9:33 AM We are learning more and more about the Macbook Pro 2016 as days progress and more leaks find their way into mainstream media. For example, the leaked macOS Sierra Code reveals a lot of information about the product's enhanced capabilities and new features. Let's take a look at some of these newly discovered features of the Macbook Pro 2016. Touchscreen 9T05Mac reports that the Macbook Pro 2016 will no longer have physical function keys. Instead, this part of the keyboard will be replaced by an OLED display touch bar. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Touch ID Capability The new macOS Sierra comes along with it several developer-oriented changes, including Touch ID support. The macOS Sierra code hints that the Macbook Pro 2016 will have devices specifically for biometric input. The Touch ID capability is one feature connected to the device's new touchscreen. Aside from the Touch ID, the touchscreen will also give way for utilization of third-party apps. USB 3.1 Connectivity According to the International Business Times, the MacBook Pro 2016 will likely support USB 3.1, which is a super-fast 2nd generation port. This was concluded after analyzing macOS Sierra beta code. From what we've learned from Apple, the company has always been quick to incorporate the latest USB and Thunderbolt port technologies to maximize the performances of their Mac products. The USB 3.1 variant expected to be used in the MacBook Pro 2016 is one that supports a speed of 10GB/s. Currently, Mac devices only support 5 Gb/s. New GPU Apple Insider believes that "the high-end 15-inch 2016 MacBook Pro will have a new AMD "Polaris" GPU, while lower-end 15-inch models and all 13-inch models will feature Intel integrated graphics." Other rumors point to the Cupertino-based company's use of 6th gen Skylake processors from Intel for the MacBook Pro 2016. Display MacBook Pro 2016 is rumored to feature 5K Apple Display, with a screen resolution of 5,120 pixels by 2,880 pixels. The device will probably also support features for Augmented Reality. There will be two variants in terms of screen size: 13-inch and 15-inch. Graphics will be supported by AMD Polaris. Price Start saving now. The MacBook Pro 2016 will be priced anywhere between $1,299 to $1,499. Release Date For now, there is no mention of any specific date whatsoever to the release of the latest MacBook Pro. In fact, even the mere actuality of this product hasn't been confirmed by Apple. The most recent rumors point to a 2016 MacBook Pro release sometime in October this year, or maybe even November.

Lefteris Pitarakis/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of September is an exciting month for bargain hunters. Not only does it bring us one step closer to the holiday season — which is the best time of year for many big-ticket items — but this month is also a great time to stock up on a variety of items, thanks to a small overlap in Labor Day, summer clearance, and back-to-school sales. So while the end of summer may be upon us, the best deals of the year are only now just beginning. Check out our guide below for tips on the best things to buy in September. For more deals every single day of the month, consider signing up for the DealNews Select Newsletter to get the best deals of the day delivered to your inbox. 9 Things to Buy Now Labor Day Sales on Summer Apparel Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer. That means all summer-related goods will be at or near their lowest prices of the year, as stores try to clear out summer inventories ahead of the holidays. Expect to see sales from major retailers like Gap, Banana Republic, and Forever 21 offering 50% to 70% off. Last year Amazon discounted a wide range of men's, women's, and children's apparel; though it was a modest 20% off, that might be worth it for Prime members. Recommended: Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Outdoorsy goods were also popular last year. We saw strong discounts from stores like REI, L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer, and Nautica, and expect the same this year. Also be on the lookout for an influx of deals on designer clothes. Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, and Calvin Klein (at 6pm) all saw discounts of up to 80% off last year. Test your knowledge Can you manage your money? A personal finance quiz. Photos of the Day Our best photos of the year 2016 Grills September offers the best deals on grills and BBQ-related utensils. Although grills are generally associated with the summer, the less humid autumn weather may actually provide a more ideal climate for your backyard soirees, so rest assured that any investment you make this month can still be put to use in the coming weeks. Sears was the grill king last year, supplying over a third of the grill deals we saw in September. That included a broad 25% off sale with stackable coupons. Walmart also had several good discounts. Patio Furniture Similar to grills, patio furniture sees some of its lowest prices of the year at the end of outdoor season. We recommended patio furniture purchases last month, too, with August providing six times as many Editors' Choice deals as June and July. And September has twice the percentage of Editors' Choice patio furniture deals as August! Look to Target and Sears for discounts of around 40% off. Freebies on National Coffee Day Coffee is one of the most beloved morning beverages, so it's no surprise that it has its own holiday. September 29 is National Coffee Day and to celebrate, food chains across the country will offer free or discounted cups of joe to their customers. Last year, we saw freebies (no purchase required) from Dunkin' Donuts, Krispy Kreme, Flying J, Pilot, and LaMar's. One notable exception: Starbucks did not offer a freebie; instead the chain chose to kick off a charity initiative on Coffee Day last year. 32" TVs, or Big-Screens September is traditionally a stellar month for deals on 32" 1080p HDTVs. Not only will deals be abundant for this category, but they'll be at the lowest prices of the year. Last year, they hit an astounding $110, though $150 is a more realistic bet. These small screens are perfect for a dorm room or first apartment. Outside of 32" TVs, the other end of the size spectrum is hot for deals in September. During Labor Day weekend in 2015, a full quarter of the TV deals we listed that were 55" or larger were at an Editors' Choice price. Otherwise, if you can't find a low price on the set you want, we recommend waiting until November for TV purchases. Mattresses Mattress deals are generally at their best during the months of April and May, when retailers add stackable coupons to their already-existing sales. However, Labor Day has become a mattress event itself. US-Mattress, Sam's Club, and Sears in particular had noteworthy sales taking 50% off select mattresses with an extra 10% to 40% off via a stackable coupon. That's on par with the best mattress deals we see in April and May. Laptops If you're in the market for a new laptop, make your purchase early in the month to take advantage of lingering back-to-school sales. Last year, 75% of the Editors' Choice laptop deals we saw were in September. Look for deals on 15" laptops with current-generation Intel Skylake processors from Cowboom, Dell Home, Newegg, Lenovo, and more. For Apple users, we recommend bypassing the Apple Store's back-to-school sale, which this year (like last year) offers a free pair of Beats Solo2 On-Ear headphones to qualifying students. Instead, look for Mac deals at Best Buy, eBay, and Micro Center. There you'll find the 2015 MacBook Air 11" Laptop for around $700, and the 13" for around $750 — a better value than a full-price laptop with headphones. Textbooks Many students will head to college for the first time this September, and while it may be too late to apply for new scholarships, there are still many ways you can reduce your college expenses. For instance, these days students can find cheap college textbooks online, by either comparison shopping or using social media to trade/borrow books from other students in their college. The earlier you begin your search, the greater your chances of scoring a deal. Previous-Generation iPhones September wouldn't be the same without Apple's fall keynote, where we're expecting the debut of the iPhone 7. Look for sales that discount the previous-generation iPhone — since that's where you'll find the deepest price cuts — rather than the just-released model. For instance, on the day of the keynote, Apple will shave $100 off the subsidized cost of an iPhone 6s. But it won't stop there. In the weeks that follow, you can expect retailers (such as eBay, Walmart, and Best Buy) to offer iPhone 6s deals with prices around $50 (with a 2-year contract). For unlocked models, you'll find the best deals on eBay where prices for an unlocked iPhone 6 could hit $500 (it's been around $610 all summer). Remember, you can always sell your old iPhone to help offset the cost of a new unlocked model. 3 Things to Wait to But Newly Announced iPhones While September will be a great month to buy an iPhone 6s, it's not the best time to score a deal on the soon-to-be-announced iPhone 7. We don't expect to see deals on that model until November. And even then, we'll likely only see modest discounts that take $10 off the full price of the phone, or discounts that bundle a free $50 Apple Gift Card with the purchase of an unlocked iPhone 7 at full price. iPads For those waiting for a new iPad, you might have to wait longer. Fans have expected an iPad Air 3 for over a year, but the introduction of the 10" iPad Pro last spring could suggest an entirely different direction for this product line; there might be no iPad Air 3 at all as Apple shifts focus to the Pro line. If there is an iPad Air 3 coming, it certainly doesn't seem like it will arrive this fall. That means your best bet for now for iPad deals is still Black Friday. Walmart is definitely a leader in deals on the Apple Tablet, as well as usual suspects like eBay and Micro Center. Appliances Labor Day tends to offer excellent deals on large appliances, with sales that take up to 54% off items such as dishwashers and refrigerators. However, if you can wait until November, Black Friday will offer better sales, with discounts that take up to 75% off the same items. On average, about 35% of Black Friday appliance deals are marked Editors' Choice — only 15% of deals see that distinction throughout the rest of the year.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Articles PC Digital Foundry: Let's build a 1080p60 gaming PC New consoles are targeting 4K gaming - but what if we want higher frame-rates instead? By Richard Leadbetter Published 28/08/2016 It's been a while since we put one of these together but on the prelude of a new console generation, perhaps it's time. A while back, we asked the question - are ever-higher resolutions truly the best use for next-gen console technology? The response from you was emphatic - no, you'd prefer to stick to 1080p and improve frame-rates and visual fidelity. And that's why we've put together a PC gaming build specifically designed to deliver excellent 1080p60 performance. First up, let's be clear about the parameters here. We're looking to double console performance, bringing us up from 30fps to 60fps and while improved visual quality is nice, we consider that a bonus. What you shouldn't expect is a machine to offer a 60fps lock with everything ramped up to ultra - in many cases, this will result in depressed performance. The truth is, you're sacrificing frame-rate for a very limited return. It's nice if you can run those settings, but the reality is that 'one notch down' generally tends to look superb, matching or indeed exceeding console-level presets. We've been planning this feature for a while, but the timing is right now in the wake of Nvidia's unveiling of the three gig version of the GTX 1060. This marks the final potential card that should be assessed for a build of this nature. And this is important as the arrival of FinFET technology means great things for GPU performance. But the thing is, those older GPUs don't suddenly become obsolete overnight. They still perform well, they still offer excellent 1080p60 gameplay and maybe - just maybe - you'll find them aggressively discounted too. And assessing a wide range of GPU tech forms a crucial part of this feature - whether it's old or new cards, you're spoilt for choice. However, elsewhere in the build, choices are fundamentally limited. In the here and now, with AMD's Zen CPUs still months away from release, virtually all non-GPU aspects of our build are essentially no-brainers. With no effective competition on the market, you're looking at an Intel-based system, with a K chip the best option for future-proofing. If you want an overclockable processor (and you do), choices are further limited as a motherboard based on the Z170 chipset is essential. A complete video journal showing the build process of the Digital Foundry 1080p60 gaming PC. Modern PC are very easy to construct and it's very hard to make a kit-breaking mistake. Beyond that, choices for surrounding components are basically up to you - though we do recommend investing a little more money in faster DDR4 memory - it does help in CPU-bound scenarios, and helps to get the most out of your overclock in bandwidth-intensive games. Here's a breakdown of the components we chose, and why: The core: MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Carbon, Core i5 6600K, 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 Out of the box, the Intel Core i5 6600K [?] is fast. It may lack the hyper-threading of the i7, but a 4.4-4.5GHz overclock should be sustainable, as long as you can keep temperatures down. Bumping all cores up to 4GHz is a walk in the park and shouldn't impact your thermals. The i7 is faster and a minority of games will benefit in certain areas, but for hitting 60fps on most titles, the i5 will do just fine and it should have the legs to keep you future-proofed for a long while. If there's one piece of advice we have for ensuring longevity on a gaming PC build, it's not to skimp on the motherboard. We've opted for a MSI Z170A Gaming Pro Carbon [?] board here. Most, if not all, Z170 boards enable a healthy overclock for your K chip and will operate overclockable RAM at their rated speeds. Our build is going to have a clear side-panel, so it doesn't hurt to have a good-looking board with customisable RGB lighting. M.2 SSD support and USB 3.1 Type-C and Type-A functionality is helpful, along with CrossFire and SLI support. It might sound a little nuts, but we really like MSI's LED lighting for rear ports. In terms of memory, we'd recommend spending a little extra on fast DDR4. In CPU-bound scenarios, the faster your memory, the less constricted your processor is. This goes against the conventional wisdom that 'any RAM will do' but you can see the evidence in the Core i5 2500K video embedded further down in this piece. The 3000MHz-rated Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 [?] is fast enough but overclocks to 3200MHz with laughable ease. Beyond that, additional DDR4 bandwidth offers limited returns based on our testing. Eight gigs of DDR4 will do for now, but 16GB is the more future-proof option. Pro-tip: don't forget to enable XMP in the BIOS to actually enable your faster RAM. The core of our system is an overclockable Skylake i5 paired with a motherboard using the Z170 chipset. We're using fast DDR4 here, and we're managing CPU temperatures with a closed loop water cooler. Cooling, power, storage - and the case It's no secret at this point that a good mid-range heatsink and fan offers comparable results to a closed loop water coolers. However, we like the Corsair H60 [?] for its aesthetics here; the internals look clean and it's very quiet. We stuck with the same firm for our power supply, opting for a Corsair CX600M [?]. It's semi-modular, so the only cables coming out are the main power input for the motherboard and CPU power. This allows you to add further cables as you need them. Modern CPUs and GPUs are very power-efficient: our final build draws just 220W at max gaming load (even with a 4GHz overclock in place on the i5!) so we have plenty of capacity here. In terms of storage, by all means add a mechanical drive as a secondary backup, but with SSD prices collapsing, we highly recommend a decent-sized solid state solution for gaming. It's not just frame-rates and quality settings we can improve here - loading times are a major bugbear on consoles and they're much reduced on PC. We're using an OCZ Trion 150 SSD [?] in our build and it performs well, but most cheap 480/500/512GB SSDs work great for gaming and have capacity for a reasonable bunch of games. And finally, we've opted for the Corsair Carbide 400C [?] for our case - it's beautifully designed with a full-size side window, great cooling and some really nice touches - we particularly liked the SSD bays under the motherboard for hiding your storage - just slide them in and you're good to go. Cable management is a breeze here and we also liked the cut-away beneath the CPU socket for easily installing custom coolers that utilise bespoke mounting brackets. A look at the final build. The 400C has highly generous storage areas behind the motherboard - great for hiding away untidy cables. Three SSD bays are also located at the rear of the case, tucked away from view - a lovely feature. Which graphics card should you buy for 1080p60 gameplay? When we started to plan this article, the selection of graphics cards we wanted to test was limited - and obvious. MSI supplied us with GTX 970, GTX 980, R9 390 and R9 390X. Generally speaking, the GTX 970 and R9 390 provided the best bang for the buck, while the GTX 980 and 390X offered a relatively small boost for a larger amount of cash (much larger in the case of the GTX 980 - prices fell nicely on the 390X). However, what's clear is that the colossal success of the GTX 970 has resulted in many, many more products to replace it, with the arrival of the next generation of GPUs. These undercut it in terms of both price and often exceed it in performance. AMD has three products: RX 470 4GB and two RX 480s (4GB/8GB), while Nvidia has two GTX 1060s (3GB/6GB). All of these cards represent a significant leap over the current-gen consoles, to the point where the Polaris 10 chip in the AMD cards is the core GPU component of the PlayStation Neo's new processor. Prices start at $180/£180 for the RX 470, reaching $250/£240 for the six gig GTX 1060. There are no GTX 980 and R9 390X equivalents now (GTX 1070 is on a completely different level really) - everything is slotted into a very tight price range. So here's a look at how the benchmarks for each of them stack up. To be frank, there's not much in it, but generally speaking, it's the GTX 1060 that is the faster card. If you have an existing PC and are looking to upgrade on a tight budget, the RX 470 and the cheaper 480 and 1060 may have merit, but when building a PC from scratch, it just makes sense to spend the extra $50 on the cards with more VRAM. The GTX 1060 in three gig form takes on RX 470 and RX 480, plus its six gig sibling, in our video benchmarks above. 1920x1080 (1080p) GTX 1060 3GB GTX 1060 6GB RX 480 4GB RX 480 8GB RX 470 4GB Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 55.2 58.2 50.4 50.8 48.8 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 46.8 45.9 45.9 47.7 45.2 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 74.8 78.7 68.8 70.1 68.0 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 54.3 56.6 53.6 54.8 51.3 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 63.1 65.6 54.7 57.1 58.7 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 57.7 65.8 71.4 73.2 68.6 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 74.2 75.1 65.4 66.0 64.1 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 64.7 68.4 60.5 61.2 57.9 There's one thing to point out with regards to benchmarks - they are not representative of the gameplay experience. All of these titles are running at ultra settings or equivalent, but they are tested fully unlocked, with results that present as averages. Their purpose is in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the hardware by judging relative performance. During actual gameplay, your aim should be to target 1080p60 for the vast majority of gameplay and that requires making trades in terms of quality levels. Those compromises needn't impact the quality of your experience unduly, and they stabilise performance - which is of more importance. Generally speaking, 60fps console titles can run at 1080p60 on these cards with ultra settings (think: Star Wars Battlefront, Doom 2016, Mirror's Edge Catalyst etc) or close to it but 30fps games tend to require dropping down to high presets and often a degree of further tweaking is required. For example, running The Witcher 3 at 1080p60 involves dropping the most taxing settings down to high and turning off the wasteful HairWorks feature. Deus Ex: Mankind Divided? It's a classic case of simply dropping down to high and letting the GPU do its thing. We'd be quite happy with either the Radeon RX 480 8GB [?] or GeForce GTX 1060 6GB [?] for our build, but titles such as No Man's Sky do still seem to suggest that AMD's single-threaded OpenGL and DX11 drivers can still hold back the generally excellent hardware in certain titles. Combine Nvidia's driver advantage here with its small speed bump and right now, we'd be opting for the higher-specced GTX 1060 as the GPU of choice. So how do the latest and greatest mainstream AMD and Nvidia cards stack up against their predecessors? What if an older card is available at a temptingly low price? The table below should give you an outlook on relative performance if you spot a bargain. Stacking up the old with the new. In this video, the GTX 1060 6GB and RX 480 8GB take on the outgoing GTX 970 and GTX 980. 1920x1080 (1080p) GTX 1060 6GB RX 480 8GB GTX 970 4GB GTX 980 4GB R9 390 8GB R9 390X 8GB Assassin's Creed Unity, Ultra High, FXAA 58.2 50.8 51.3 58.7 48.6 52.7 Ashes of the Singularity, Extreme, 0x MSAA, DX12 45.9 47.7 40.5 48.3 52.1 55.8 Crysis 3, Very High, SMAA T2x 78.7 70.1 72.5 83.7 75.4 81.4 The Division, Ultra, SMAA 56.6 54.8 50.2 57.8 49.8 53.5 Far Cry Primal, Ultra, SMAA 65.6 57.1 56.2 63.3 65.1 67.8 Hitman, Ultra, SMAA, DX12 65.8 73.2 59.0 66.9 75.6 81.9 Rise of the Tomb Raider, Very High, High Textures, SMAA, DX12 75.1 66.0 69.7 80.4 66.6 71.7 The Witcher 3, Ultra, Post AA, No HairWorks 68.4 61.2 60.7 65.6 55.6 60.2 Overall, there's not really a massive amount in it. The GTX 980 remains a highly potent force and overclocks significantly beyond GTX 1060, but the more modern Nvidia card offers a generally equivalent experience at stock in most cases and has an additional two gigs of VRAM. On top of that, the simultaneous multi-projection tech in Nvidia's Pascal line could offer a big, big boost to VR performance, assuming developer support. Generally speaking, the GTX 970 is out-performed by the GTX 1060 - but it can still do the job required in delivering 1080p60 gameplay, and it overclocks like a demon - but we'd only recommend one if you can find it at a seriously good price. On the AMD side, the RX 480 can beat its predecessor - the R9 390 - in several titles, but it's actually a touch slower in some cases. However, in terms of form factor and power efficiency, the new Polaris card is light years ahead of its predecessors. The R9 390 was a great performer for its time, and its eight gigs of VRAM was always 'nice to have', but the lack of power efficiency and the resultant heat generation was a real issue that always made us feel a little concerned. The R9 390X was actually hotter and thirstier still, so we find it hard to recommend these when much more refined designs are available. Our conclusions here are pretty straightforward - both Nvidia and AMD have worked hard to bring GTX 970/980 performance to a mainstream price-point. The old guard were great for their time and still hold up well today (particularly the GTX 980) but for a new PC, a modern GPU with more VRAM and more focused driver support makes more sense. Hands-on testing: does our system meet expectations? The first order of business on any higher-end gaming system is to enter the BIOS and turn on XMP - a process that enables your overclockable RAM to operate at its rated speed. It's remarkable how many people buy premium RAM but forget to actually run it beyond stock speeds. We also jump into the MSI overclocking menu and change 'CPU ratio' from Auto to 40. This locks our 6600K to 4.0GHz on all four cores, significantly faster than any locked i5 on the market. The 6600K should overclock significantly higher, but pushing harder involves voltage increases that may impact processor longevity owing to much greater heat generation. That said, once we get going, we find that CPU temperatures barely break 40 degrees Celsius, even when the CPU is under heavy gaming load - the Corsair H60 water-cooler is doing a great job here, even in a room with 27 degree ambient temperatures. As you can see in the hands-on video below, we achieve some sterling results from our Core i5/GTX 1060 combo. Turning off HairWorks and cutting a couple of settings down from ultra to high gives us a 1080p60 lock in The Witcher 3. Both Star Wars Battlefront and Mirror's Edge Catalyst also stick doggedly to 1080p60 on ultra settings (and on the latter, we have the VRAM available to invoke hyper quality textures). Doom 2016 didn't waver in our testing, even with all settings pushed to the limit. We could push beyond ultra here with 16x anisotropic filtering and nightmare-level texture paging. We spent a good part of a day running a bunch of games and tweaking settings in order to produce the locked 1080p60 experience that is so rare on the current-gen consoles. Grand Theft Auto 5 - leaving aside the advanced graphics settings for a moment, 1080p60 with all standard settings bar MSAA maxed gave a completely locked experience, even with the challenging grass setting pushed up to ultra. However, Io Interactive's Hitman dipped to a meagre 36-38fps in its taxing Paris stage. The console version operates at medium quality levels with high textures. We locked to 60fps by following that template, though we found that we could raise level of detail up to the high level. Even with these compromises, the game still looks great and silky smooth gameplay is clearly preferable to visual improvements that are only relatively minor in nature. The Core i5 6600K is a great chip, but we did find some scenarios where an i7 would improve performance. Crysis 3 on very high settings (shadows dropped to high) could still stutter below 60fps in the jungle areas, or when heavy alpha and intense physics were deployed. Even with the i5 at 4.0GHz, the vintage 2013 title still causes issues for modern hardware. We've played this game a lot, and even older generation i7s hand in smoother performance on the very high preset. We also noted that the village stage in Rise of the Tomb Raider could max out the i5, causing stutter (a touch reduced in DX12), while galloping through Novigrad City could also tap out the i5 to its limits (though the 60fps lock remained intact). The big question: how long will this PC last? The aim with this build isn't to skimp on quality, we want to produce a PC with plenty of longevity here - and realistically we should expect to see several GPU upgrades before we touch anything else in the system. In terms of just how long-lived this PC could be, check out our article on whether it's time for existing PC owners to upgrade from the classic Core i5 2500K - a vintage 2011 processor still widely in use today and still performing fairly well. This is a frankly remarkable state of affairs bearing in mind that virtually every other five-year-old PC component is now virtually obsolete. The reality is that buying a K chip and an overclock-capable board to run it is the gateway for keeping your PC viable for years to come, via extra performance gleaned by combining CPU overclocking with faster memory. In the case of the 2500K, overclocking it to 4.6GHz and pairing it with 2133MHz DDR3 gives performance in the same ballpark as a modern Core i5 6500 running at 3.2GHz in tandem with 2666MHz DDR4. Obviously it's nowhere near as power efficient, but it's certainly more economical than junking an entire system. Careful parts selection in the here and now can future-proof your PC for years to come, as we demonstrate here by re-evaluating the Core i5 2500K up against contemporary gaming PC set-ups running the same, modern GPU. It holds up remarkably well considering that it's five years old! Helping to prolong the life of PCs past, present and future is the fact that current - and indeed, future - consoles are based on relatively weak AMD CPU cores designed primarily for mobile applications. PlayStation Neo features the exact same CPU set-up, albeit with a 31 per cent clock-speed increase. We feel fairly confident that an i5 6600K can keep up for a good few years yet. On top of that, the Z170 board should be compatible with the future Intel Kaby Lake CPUs, plus you can upgrade from an i5 to an i7 for further gaming performance. Again, that's something we covered for 2500K owners, who can conceivably upgrade to an i7 3770K from the next Intel generation - Ivy Bridge. Everything we know about Nintendo Switch From detachable controllers to games, here's what's next from Nintendo. In short, the core of this PC should have plenty of longevity. However, what's clear - and we'll stress it once again - is that the key to a long-lived system is investing in that all-important K chip and an overclock compatible board. Clearly, this does add significantly to the initial build cost. However, it's fair to say that we've been fairly lavish with some of the kit we've put together here - and in terms of the motherboard, chassis and cooler in particular, there are significantly cheaper options. However, the overclockable nature of the CPU and the all-important Z170 chipset motherboard are non-negotiable. The core component you should expect to upgrade every couple of years will be the graphics card - realistically, you can look towards the GeForce GTX 1070 to get an idea of what next year's sub-£200/$200 GPU will offer and towards the epic Titan X Pascal for a similar preview for mainstream graphics power a couple of years from now. If the future is indeed 4K in nature, as Sony and Microsoft believe, the good news is that this PC is one upgrade away from supporting that at 60fps too.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 28 August 2016 Hongkongers are living large in tiny homes Tiny home: In Hong Kong, it’s common to have tiny apartments that are among the smallest in the world in terms of living space per occupant. — South Morning China Post MOST Hongkongers live in tiny apartments that are among the smallest in the world in terms of living space per occupant. All praise to the shoebox dwellers. We’ve learned to be creative with regards to our domestic arrangements ­– and even those who have, by choice, downsized into more compact digs are reaping the benefits. A couple for whom Hong Kong architectural firm LAAB Architecture redesigned a tiny Central flat say they are as snug as a bug in a rug in their 309 sq ft (28 sq metres) microhome ­ – dubbed Small Home Smart Home. They can live comfortably, entertain and even accommodate a family of “fur” children (their three cats), and the occasional overnight guest. Otto Ng, LAAB’s design director, says that with 50% of the world’s population living in cities, people are beginning to appreciate the advantages of living closely together – such as more job opportunities, a better social life, and the convenience of travelling shorter distances to work and places of interest. “Not until you’ve moved into a small apartment do you realise that you do not need to live in a giant house, because you own the city as your living room,” Ng says. Every detail of Small Home Smart Home was bespoke to fit the owners’ lifestyle, he adds. Its layout is convertible, adapting to the needs of the moment. A second tier of seating acts as a home cinema when groups of friends arrive; a bathtub “disappears” behind a screen; and the floor conceals handy storage compartments. The home even incorporates a full-sized kitchen. And it’s thoroughly organised, which the designer says is critical for keeping a space the size of a hotel room looking fresh and tidy. Ng considers the “smart home” a term for the new living culture, which entails “living smarter in a compact space, living greener in a comfortable environment, and living together in a shared home”, he says. Small but cosy: Hongkongers have become really creative in making tiny spaces ‘big’. — South Morning China Post  Smart technologies have a role, too. The design of the Small Home Smart Home incorporates a range of app-controlled smart-home technologies, such as Philips Hue light bulbs, which slowly brighten to gently rouse the sleeping couple each morning, and an August smart-door lock, which makes it possible for an electronic key to be sent, for example, to the cat-carer’s smartphone, allowing access to the home while the owners are away. Indeed, especially in a small home, technology is your friend. Intel created the Smart Tiny House to show what this might look like. A microapartment of just 24.5 sq metres, it allows the resident to control all of the home’s systems remotely from a single tablet app: just swipe to adjust the thermostat, change the colour and brightness of the lighting, and open the door for a repairman while you’re away. There’s facial recognition security at the door and sensors which can detect and alert you to maintenance issues. All this is achieved wirelessly, with cables neatly concealed in the walls. Various websites and blogs extol the virtues of living with less. According to Living Well Spending Less, the money saved on household running costs frees up cash to spend on things that you really want. Housework is halved, and it’s easier to do small jobs, such as painting, yourself. On Zero Waste Home, blogger Bea Johnson reveals that her family’s bonds are closer since they moved from an American mansion to a home half the size. She’s also proud of the fact that, by using fewer resources, the family is treading more lightly on the planet. As Shrink That Footprint points out, living small lowers heating and cooling usage, needs fewer furnishings, takes less time to maintain and requires less work to fund. — South China Morning Post Tags / Keywords: small apartments hong kong You May Be Interested Japanese Emperor greets New Year well-wishers Police detain tourist boat captain after deadly fire Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single Another viral video of another Ipoh 'daredevil' Traffic crawl along major highways Quality homes below RM400k Others Also Read All ready for the new school year Analysts negative on Felda deal Fund Managers' pick advertisement Latest News Floods worsen in Kelantan, number of evacuees rises to 3,774 At least 50 killed in Brazil prison riot - Globo Four rivers in Terengganu exceed alert level U.S. House Republicans weaken ethics body as they return to Congress South Korea pushes for extradition of daughter of President Park's friend Most Viewed in News Terror ride for Grab driver Eight-year courtship ends for Goh Malay boy only Year One pupil in Tamil school Doubles 'goddess' Goh is now single A loan with just one phone call Man falls to his death at UMMC How gruesome photos on a memory stick revealed identity of killer who died days after victim Traffic crawl along major highways Two married women among 30 held for khalwat ‘My feng shui master misled me into having sex for luck’ Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online   Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Or Will They Upgrade It? MacBook Air needs a major upgrade for it to compete in the market. However, there are reports claiming that the tech giant would just phase out the device and focus on the MacBook Pro instead. (Photo : Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Consumers are still waiting for the official release of Apple's MacBook Air 2016. Reports, however, claim that the tech giant might stop producing  the MacBook Air flagship and focus on the MacBook Pro istead. There are leaks that hints details about the future devices on Apple's flagship: from the MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch.  However the update about the MacBook Air is not gaining any popularity at all. It is could be that apple is terminating the MacBook Air flagship because the device did not get proper updates in the last years, BGR reported. In the modern lineup of laptops, the MacBook Air is being phased out slowly. The 11-inch MacBook air was already usurped by the Retina MacBook. On the other hand, The 13-inch version of the MacBook Air has inferior display as compared to a MacBook Pro with the same screen size. This means that the MacBook Air flagship needs major updates in order to compete in the computer market. Retina MacBook devices has been defeated by the Chromebook in the US market because it has limited capabilities despite its price. The Chromebook can do almost everything that the Retina MacBook is able to do. Since tech people are still waiting for the release of the Air model, there is still a chance that the MacBook Air will continue to live. Rumors claim that new versions of these devices will have 15-inch wide sizes while phasing out the 11-inch versions, according to Vine Report. The 2016 MacBook Air is rumored to have a Touch ID fingerprint recognition. It will also have Siri as an additional feature and will sport be lighter and thinner compared to the current Air models.

The Cupertino-based giant is sending out media invites for September 7 event where it is expected to launch the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus (may be iPhone 7 Pro as well) which will be accompanied by Apple Watch 2. Besides smartphone and wearable, Apple is likely to unveil a refreshed MacBook Pro lineup. The iPhone 7 launch event will take place in San Francisco at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium at 10 a.m. PT. If the rumors are to be believed, the upcoming iPhone 7 and 7 Plus won’t be a major overhaul in terms of design. Rumor mills indicate that the forthcoming smartphone would be devoid of a 3.5mm headphone jack and have an improved camera. The rumors have been widespread that the bigger iPhone 7 Plus would pack a dual camera setup and a LED Flash at front. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Specs, Price, Features Another set of leaks reveals that iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus will boast 4.7-inch 1080p and 5.5-inch 2K display. The front of the smartphone will do away with the traditional home button and will be replaced with the Touch-enabled home button. According to industry experts, Apple is saving bigger innovations in 2018 for its 10th anniversary. Another rumor doing the rounds is the Dual SIM capability on iPhone 7 series. Considering high-end smartphones offering dual SIM facility, it is highly anticipated on the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. Apple Watch 2 Features and Specs: Bigger Battery, GPS Another highly awaited product is the upgraded version of Apple Watch, the Apple Watch 2. A fresh round of leaks suggest 35% bigger battery than the first-gen Apple wearable, GPS, and barometer. The smartwatch is expected to sport rectangular dial with a micro-LED display, while the connectivity options coming with the smartwatch are inbuilt 4G LTE capability. MacBook Pro 2016 Features and Specs: Retina display, 4 USB Type-C ports Besides, Apple Watch 2 and iPhone 7 lineup, we may also see a refreshed MacBook Pro unveiling at the September 7 event after four years.

We expect the upcoming MacBook Pro to be thinner and lighter with smaller bezels and a compact overall frame. Apple is also expected to add four USB Type-C ports, and will be powered by Intel’s Skylake processors. There have been reports of Touch ID sensor on the new MacBook Pro, the integration of which ID would allow users to unlock the laptop without password.Things Things will be clearer when Apple will hold its event on September 7.

Now, to further fuel these speculations, it appears that Microsoft itself is teasing the upcoming "Surface Book 2" on its official Instagram account. Discovered by Windows Central, the images show off a considerably different hinge from the original Surface Book. While Microsoft obviously hasn't officially outed it as the Surface Book 2, the image is in line with previous reports which suggested that the company is working on improving the unusual and elaborate 'fulcrum hinge' of the Surface Book, to remove the gap created when the device is folded shut. The new design is said to allow the display to fold flat with the keyboard section, like a conventional notebook. Another noticeable detail in the image is the black color of the alleged device, which is considerably different from the silver/magnesium color of the current Surface Book. Windows Central reports that while internal prototypes of the upcoming Surface Book are indeed black in color - or a dark metal for that matter - it is not yet confirmed if the device will be available to the public in the aforementioned color. With that being said, it is important to keep in mind that nothing can be said for sure about the upcoming high end device. Rumors indicate that the arrival of the new Surface Book will depend upon availability of Intel's Kaby Lake chips, pointing to a Spring 2017 timeframe, which coincides with the release of Windows 10 Redstone 2. Additionally, the company is also expected to launch the alleged Surface Phone and possibly three iterations of the Surface All-in-One desktop PCs. Update: It appears that the image Microsoft posted on its Surface Instagram account is of a Surface Book after all. Prolific Windows phone developer Rudy Huyn has just posted an image on Twitter which indicates that previous one is from an earlier Surface Book promo and not from an internal Microsoft "sizzler reel" as the original source had speculated. Hey @verge and @windowscentral, sorry but it's a promo image of the original Surface book... ;) pic.twitter.com/jTav2tJjwv — Rudy Huyn (@RudyHuyn) August 29, 2016 Indeed the two images are rather similar and it now seems likely that Microsoft isn't teasing images of the Surface Book 2 after all.
