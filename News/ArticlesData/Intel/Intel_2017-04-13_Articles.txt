These enthusiast level chips, used primarily in gaming systems, won’t hold back a single GPU setup, and are very capable of light photo or video production work in a pinch. The Ryzen 5 1600X stands out as the least expensive chip to ever offer more than four cores. At $250, it undercuts the Core i7-7700K by almost a hundred dollars at full price, and is only $20 more than the Core i5-7600K. As attractive as Ryzen 7 was, it’s the Ryzen 5 processor line that fits in the budget of most PC enthusiasts. Can it become the people’s champion? A refresher on the architecture The mid-range Ryzen 5 Series is the second to arrive with AMD’s new Zen architecture. The red team started over from the ground up for these chips, and it really shows. The previous design, Bulldozer, set AMD back by pushing core count in exchange for per-core efficiency. With most games and demanding applications only making use of four cores, there wasn’t a big incentive to take the offer. For more information on the Zen architecture and platform, head over to our review of the flagship chip, the Ryzen 7 1800X. Six cores, 12 threads, plenty of go Though its 3.6GHz base clock is only slightly higher than the Ryzen 5 1500X’s 3.5GHz clock, the Ryzen 5 1600X has two distinct advantages over its slightly cheaper sibling. Most notably, the Ryzen 5 1600X sports two more cores for a total of six, which brings it to support for 12 threads (two on each core). It also has a 95-watt thermal design power, as opposed to the 65-watt TDP on the 1500X. Theoretically, that thermal headroom may allow for better overall performance due to higher dynamic clock speeds. Those two factors give the chip a massive advantage, bringing multi-core tests in line with even the Ryzen 7 1700. It takes a strong lead over the Ryzen 5 1500X in every single test — not bad considering it only costs $30 more. Still, that big performance jump is a pleasant surprise. In particular, we see a big gain in the Handbrake 4K conversion test, which runs almost 35 percent faster on the higher-end chip than on the entry-level option. It should come as no surprise that the Intel Core i7-7700K, with its 4.2GHz base clock, charges ahead in every single-core test. The exchange comes with the extra cores, where well-distributed workloads can take full advantage of the extra threads. Tasks that use all of the Ryzen 5 1600X cores tend to perform better than on the Core i7-7700K, despite the latter’s price, which is about $90 higher. We did not have a Core i5-7600K on hand to test. However, we expect that it would maintain a lead in single-core tests, at the cost of a major defeat in multi-core tests. The Core i5-7600K does not have Hyper-Threading, which means its four cores can each handle only one processing thread. The 1600X, meanwhile, can handle 12 threads. Overall, the Ryzen 5 1600X packs a lot of performance into a slimmed-down price point. Its numerous cores and threads may not matter in all situations, but they matter a lot in some. And the 1600X’s disadvantage in single-core performance isn’t so drastic that that it becomes uncompetitive with Intel’s hardware. Gaming Mid-range enthusiast hardware is often built for gaming. It’s a demanding task, and one that requires the right balance of performance across many components. We hooked up both an EVGA SC GTX 980 Ti and an AMD Radeon RX 480, and ran the internal benchmarks in For Honor and Sid Meier’s Civilization VI, as well as the 3DMark Time Spy test, the latter two of which were run in DirectX 12. The GPU is always the biggest factor in most modern games, and none of the CPUs in our test results should limit a single-GPU setup, particularly with our mid-to-high performance test cards. For Honor demonstrates that, as the gap between worst performance and best performance is less than 10 percent. A difference that’s likely to go unnoticeable. The Ryzen 5 1600X games almost as well as the Ryzen 7 1700 and Intel Core i7-7700K. Sid Meier’s Civilization VI is a different story. It puts a lot more strain on the CPU than most games, and the differences between the chips are clearer. The Ryzen 5 1600X sets itself apart from the less expensive 1500X once again, particularly with the graphics turned to extreme, where it only falls in second to the Intel Core i7-7700K system. The extra cores and power also come in handy running the 3DMark Time Spy benchmark. The final score takes CPU performance into account to an extent, and the Ryzen 5 1600X falls, once again, closer to the Ryzen 7 chips than the Ryzen 5 1500X. Overall, there’s little to no risk of the Ryzen 5 1600X holding back performance in most modern titles, unless they’re particularly demanding for the CPU. It’s clear that the 1600X is not the fastest gaming processor around, but its price easily excuses its minor disadvantage compared to Intel hardware. Overclocking We tested the Ryzen 5 1600X with the AMD Wraith Max cooler. It had a modest sized fan atop a generous heatsink, turned on its side to keep a low profile. There was even an RGB ring around the interior edge of the fan — fancy! Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Ryzen chips come out of the box in normal mode, with XFR enabled, and automatic voltage regulation. A bevy of sensors runs a quick check of the thermal and power limitations on the chip, and sets the clock speed of the chip accordingly. With our 750 Watt power supply, X370 chipset, and Wraith Max cooler, it ran at 3.7GHz base, 100MHz over its base clock. When Ryzen Master adjusts the settings on the chip, it disables XFR and automatic voltage regulation in favor of user settings. Overclocking is easy thanks to the Ryzen Master software. It allows users to tweak clock speeds, voltages, shut off cores, and load all the settings into presets that are easy to flip between without resetting the system. We pushed the Ryzen 5 1600X from its base clock to 3.9GHz with a bump to 1.4 volts on the chip, and 1.0V on the chipset. Overclocking provided some benefits in our tests, but not nearly the kind of stunning boosted performance we saw on the Ryzen 7 1700. The downsides, at least with a stock cooler, seem to outweigh the benefits. Disabling XFR prevents potentially higher clock speeds during single-core tests, and temperatures were much lower, and more consistent, without enabling the overclock mode. Unless fit it with an aftermarket cooler, you’re better off leaving it in normal mode, unless there’s a specific situation that necessitates turning off cores temporarily. Warranty information AMD covers the Ryzen 5 1600X with an industry standard three-year warranty. That doesn’t cover damage due to installation issues or improper overclocking, so make sure to handle with care. Our Take AMD continues to strike at Intel’s most popular chips with the Ryzen series, and the Ryzen 5 1600X renders a powerful cleave to the unlocked enthusiast Intel Core i5 and Core i7 chips. Packing competitive performance, extra cores, and a modern feature set into a $250 price point is no small feat, but the red team has taken on the challenge with noteworthy success. The DT Accessory Pack Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO CPU Cooler $30 Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB DDR4 DRAM $125 ASUS ROG Crosshair VI Hero Motherboard $255 Samsung SM951 M.2 NVME SSD $200 Is there a better alternative? Within AMD’s own ranks, the Ryzen 5 1500X sits at just $190, with a lower 65W TDP and only four cores. The performance doesn’t keep up with this chip though, and the minor savings it offers isn’t worthwhile. Intel offers the Core i5-7600K for $20 less, but with the Ryzen 5 1600X falling so close to the Intel Core i7-7700K in terms of performance, AMD’s six-core option is worth considering. How long will it last? With six cores and a modern feature set, the Ryzen 5 1600X is built to last. Six cores may not mean as much now, but if multi-core reliance increases, this chip will be sitting pretty. AMD has also promised to continue using the AM4 socket at least through 2020, so you have a clear upgrade path a few years down the line. Should you buy it? Yes. Whether you’re encoding video, streaming and recording while gaming, or compressing and uncompressing large files, you’ll see a benefit from the extra cores and higher power draw on the Ryzen 5 1600X. Add that to a precisely targeted price point, and the result is a mid-range champion that’ll appeal to just about everyone looking to put together a powerful, yet affordable, PC.

And that was the logic behind the launch of AMD's Ryzen CPUs, with the chip manufacturer aiming to offer more performance by selling CPUs with more cores and threads than their Intel counterparts for less money. But as Australians well know, what represents good value overseas often represents something else entirely once the Australia Tax is applied. And just how good is the performance, anyway? I've been testing three of AMD's new CPUs: the Ryzen 7 1800X, the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1500X. The first is AMD's challenger to Intel's Broadwell-E chips, with 8 cores and 16 threads running at a base clock speeds of 3.6GHz, boosting up to 4Ghz when needed. An 1800X will set you back around $670 or $680 from local retailers, before shipping. By comparison, Intel's 8-core Broadwell E CPUs cost at least $1470 locally. The 5 series chips are targeted at the more mainstream market, particularly those looking at buying an i5 series CPU for gaming. The 1600X is a hexacore CPU running at the same clock speeds as the 1800X, with 6 cores and 12 threads. Starting from $359, it's priced in between Intel's four core, four thread i5-7600K CPU (from $314), and the slightly beefier 4 core, 8 thread i7-7700 (from $392). The challenger to Intel's i5-7600K, as far as price is concerned anyway, is the Ryzen 5 1500X. Running at 3.5GHz/3.7GHz and sporting four cores and eight threads, you can get the 1500X for $275 from local retailers. That puts it directly in competition with Intel's locked i5-7500 4 core/4 thread CPU, and also makes it an attractive buy over the quad-core i5-7400, which runs at 3.0GHz/3.5Ghz and has the same amount of cores and threads. The Ryzen 5 1600X CPU. (Image: Techspot) The main thing to takeaway, and one of AMD's angles of attack, is the idea of the amount of cores, and threads, your CPU has. The more cores your CPU has, the more workload your system can handle at once, at least in theory. In practice, games and programs have gotten better at using more cores and threads in a users system. They've still not quite become as efficient as non-gaming applications at gobbling up extra cores and threads, like the Adobe suite, specialist video encoders, 3D renders and heavy computational tasks can. If you've got more cores, all of these tasks run noticeably faster. From a gaming perspective, however, the most important factor still is clock speed. And while some games are better equipped to take advantage of systems with more CPU cores and threads, like Ashes of the Singularity and the ever-growing crop of games with DirectX 12 and Vulkan support, the majority still run just fine on quad-core systems. And herein is the biggest problem facing gamers with AMD's Ryzen. Team Red might have a good argument when it comes to people who do a little bit of everything, but just how good are the Ryzen CPUs for the thing gamers do most? Specifications AMD running a side-by-side test of a Ryzen system against an Intel CPU One of the big advantages of AMD's new platform for Ryzen CPUs, AM4, is that every CPU uses the same socket. That basically means you can use the one motherboard and not worry about having to replace it in a few years time when you want to get the latest Ryzen CPU. AMD has promised to keep using AM4 all the way until 2020, although most people don't typically upgrade their machine within three years anyway. On a more practical note, this makes testing a little easier since only the CPU has to be swapped out. Here's the testing machine used. Note that I had to use a beta version of the BIOS for the Gigabyte motherboard for better support, although AMD has since released an AGESA update to all manufacturers and your motherboard manufacturer should have an update available on their website. Ryzen 7 1700X (3.6GHz/4.0GHz) / Ryzen 5 1600X (3.6GHz/4.0GHz) / Ryzen 5 1500X (3.5Ghz/3.7GHz) Gigabyte AX370 Gaming 5 (F5d BIOS) GEIL EVOX 16GB DDR4-RAM 3200Mhz Samsung 850 EVO 1TB SSD Gigabyte GTX 1080 G1 Gaming Windows 10 Pro 64-bit All three CPUs were tested with the DDR4-RAM running at 2933MHz, as recommended by AMD. There were some issues when the Ryzen 7 CPUs first launched with memory stability, but those have been improved since launched and the latest BIOS updates should rectify them completely. Benchmarks Image: The Game Awards/Youtube Every system is different, and every part of a system can have an impact on that system's performance. So factor that into account - and if you're looking at purchasing a system, read as many benchmarks and graphs as you can! No two CPUs, GPUs, sticks of RAM, or hard drives are the same. Performance can vary from one component to the next, but the more information you have the better overall picture you'll get. Most of the tests here focus on Ryzen's gaming performance, although there are a couple of synthetic benchmarks to help build out a broader picture. I'm not fortunate enough to have access to multiple generations of AMD and Intel CPUs to do a wider set of testing. Some notes about the above: the Cinebench R15 test was the multi-threaded version, not the single threaded performance variant. The latter does a better job of highlighting the power of the higher clock speeds on Intel CPUs (or read another way, the weakness of Ryzen CPUs), but it's also less realistic in regards to how people would actually use programs of that ilk in a working environment. For what it's worth, the Cinebench speeds were pretty in line with the performance achieved by Techspot, which allowed their Ryzen 1600X and 1500X review to be republished by Kotaku. We'll post that in full over the public holiday, but here's a shot of their Cinebench score so you can get a better picture: Image: Techspot Making Sense Of It All Image: Twitter (@amd) What the Ryzen CPUs really excel at right now is tests and programs calibrated to take advantage of as many cores and threads a CPU has. That's Photoshop. Premiere Pro. Video encoders like Handbrake. Streaming software. Excel. 3D renderers. Games are getting there, and the performance in DOOM is a taste of the future. As my previous testing showed when the Radeon RX 480 and 470 launched last year, playing modern titles at 4K doesn't necessarily have to come with massive compromises in image quality. But in general, and this is something that's borne out by every piece of news I've seen about Ryzen over the last two months, Intel still holds an edge when it comes to out and out performance in video games. It's understandable: games tend to benefit more from higher clock speeds than they do an increased amount of CPU cores and threads. Quad-core CPUs, according to Steam's monthly surveys, are the most common processors amongst the gaming populace, and it makes sense that developers build their games on hardware, and for hardware, that accommodates for that. Over time, however, that situation will change. It's a natural technological evolution - but it's also a forced one, thanks to the competition AMD has brought to the market. The Ryzen CPUs are more competitive at the higher end in Australia, although that's partially due to Intel cutting the price of their mid-tier CPUs and also releasing the i3-7350K, which overclocks superbly and can offer solid, affordable performance in games. But here's the major catch. As soon as you stop gaming and try to do anything else - unzip a major file, do some image work in Photoshop, encode a video or two for YouTube, or try to stream anything - the i3-7350K becomes a lot less appealing. It's good at doing one thing well, but far less so if that application has good support for multi-threading, and especially if you use your PC like everyone else does - a machine that can perform multiple demanding tasks at once. And this is where the argument for the Ryzen CPUs start to kick in. If you're someone that just uses your PC to game, and does nothing else besides a bit of light browsing, then the Intel CPUs offer the best performance outright. But it's not necessarily the best value, especially where the 1800X is concerned. And as more games adopt more modern APIs like DirectX 12 and Vulkan (the former especially, as anyone developing a game for Project Scorpio will want to take advantage of the features hard-baked into the console), systems with more CPU cores and threads will shine. There's also the reality that the vast majority of developers are more accustomed to building games on, or for, Intel hardware. The PS4 and Xbox One is obviously built using AMD hardware, but most PC gamers use Intel CPUs and NVIDIA graphics cards. AMD has played second fiddle for the last few years, and with good reason. Valve's Steam Survey: Windows 10 Is Popular, VR Is Not Steam has finally published its latest findings across its gargantuan platform, and as you'd expect there's some interesting tidbits about millions upon millions of gamers who use the service. Read more But since the launch of Ryzen, the dial has changed a fraction. A fortnight ago, Stardock issued an update for Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation that added a noticeable bump to performance. Some sites saw a 20% or 30% increase in performance at 1080p, while others saw more limited gains around 10%. Systems vary, of course. But what was interesting was this quote from Oxide Games' Dan Baker, who hit the nail on the head when it comes to the reality for AMD fans: Every processor is different on how you tune it, and Ryzen gave us some new data points on optimisation ... we’ve invested thousands of hours tuning Intel CPUs to get every last bit of performance out of them, but comparatively little time so far on Ryzen. Another side of the same coin: having had the market advantage for aeons, Intel has lots and lots of money to throw at edge case scenarios that result in better performance, tuning and familiarity with game engines and developers. AMD doesn't have that same luxury, and with good reason: their previous CPUs weren't good enough. In other words: if you've just built a PC in the last year or two, you definitely shouldn't be thinking about an upgrade. Over the next year or two, that will change. I'd expect the situation within studios to change a little as well: developers are one of the target markets for whom the Ryzen CPUs, especially the 1800X, make the most sense. Not are they only playing games as much as anyone else, they're also programming, building complex 3D renders, compiling builds, streaming, encoding video. Put simply: more developers will be likely to buy the 1800X, because the performance is good enough and the difference in price is substantial enough. That will result in more familiarity with the Zen architecture that will result in improved performance, and stability, for AMD systems. That said, there's also an unspoken rule to PC building: you should always make a judgement on today's performance at the price you can afford. There are no guarantees that driver updates or developer patches will get you the extra frame rate you need to play Watch Dogs 2 at 4K. Or ArmA 3 at 60fps. Or whatever game it is you're interested in. But you don't have to look far into the future to know that a CPU with 4 cores and 8 threads will hold up much better in 2018, 2019 and 2020 than an i3 or i5 dual-core or quad-core system. And there's another advantage I haven't mentioned either: the flexibility of the AM4 platform. AMD has pledged to support Zen all the way out until 2020, meaning you can build a Ryzen system today and then grab a new CPU in 2019 or 2020 without having to upgrade the motherboard, RAM, and so on. Enthusiast PC gamers upgrade their GPU every two or three years, but they don't upgrade their CPU as often. Part of the reason is practicality: swapping a GPU in and out is far less of a pain in the arse than swapping out a CPU. And many PC fans will often upgrade their CPU in tandem with their motherboard, partially due to compatibility (needing a new CPU socket, for instance). But this matters little to people today, so let's simplify the pitch. First of all, AMD is back. There's no doubt about it: having been in a position where there was no reason to consider an AMD CPU before, there are now plenty of reasons to do so, across multiple points in the market. Intel still holds the lead in gaming, however. A good example can be seen in our benchmarks from last year. Our testbench machine was an i7-4790K with much older parts, but the improvement using the newer Ryzen CPUs, and faster RAM, isn't that substantial. If you're upgrading from that generation of hardware, you can comfortably wait until Intel's Cannon Lake CPUs come out, or until 2018 when the next Zen CPU hits the market. For those building a PC now, it's worth considering the 1500X and 1600X. The 1600X runs at the same base and boost clock speeds as the 1800X, and performs just as well in today's games for almost half the price. And having the six cores and 12 threads gives it a leg up on the price-equivalent Intel rivals in streaming and all-around productivity. The i7-7700K is a touch faster in games - but it also costs at least $100 more, money that could be spent on a better GPU. (The difference between an RX 470 and a RX 480 or GTX 1060, for example, is around $40.) So the end question is, are you a gamer? Or are you a gamer who likes to stream, likes to record video, spends time in Photoshop, touches up photography on the side, and so forth? The more you find yourself falling in the latter camp, the better value a Ryzen CPU becomes.

Note - if you game and multitask something else (as in gaming whilst recording/encoding/streaming/other tasks) then the gaming performance of Ryzen can eclipse Intel. Reply 0 justachap @justachap Apr 14, 2017, 1:06pm Nooby question: I'm gonna assume upgrading from a i7 3770 to a Ryzen 5 1600X would be a good upgrade? Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Apr 14, 2017, 1:20pm It'd be a decent one, although not a massive one in games (but certainly in every other facet of your system). You'd have to replace RAM and motherboard as well though, so it'll be a replacing a fair chunk of your PC. Reply 0 riddick @riddick Apr 14, 2017, 1:32pm The 1600x comes with no cooler, so slap on a extra $30-60a for that. I'm thinking of just getting the 1600 because it comes with cooler and people have been getting 3.9-4.0 out of them quite easily. The 1600x has been maxing out at 4.1ghz so the extra $80-100a expense isn't worth it in my opinion. Just waiting for some ITX boards to show up. Reply 0 Alex Walker @alexwalker AUTHOR Apr 14, 2017, 2:57pm You're pretty much in the same boat with any CPU you buy though; you should always get an aftermarket cooler, even if it's something budget (Hyper 212 usually does the job). Reply 0 Camm @camm Apr 14, 2017, 4:57pm Heh. And then you fall into my camp, waiting to see AMDs HEDT platform likely launching mid year. 16 cores quad channel with a larger fabric would be yummy.

Then you don't want any fixes 13 Apr 2017 at 23:37, Shaun Nichols Microsoft has cut software updates and tweaks for computers powered by Intel and AMD's latest-generation processors and running old versions of Windows. The Redmond giant is no longer serving software fixes to PCs and other systems that run Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on Intel's fresh new Kaby Lake or AMD's hot-off-the-fab Ryzen chips. Those machines will now be required to update to Windows 10 in order to obtain future improvements. Critical security patches will still be offered for now, though. Microsoft argues this is all because it can't be bothered supporting the latest silicon, such as Intel's 7th-gen Core series, on anything other than Windows 10. To us, it looks like a convenient way of forcing people onto the newest build of its operating system. According to the software goliath, the situation is this: 6th Gen Intel Core devices on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 will be supported with all applicable security updates until the end of support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. This change is made possible through the strong partnership with our OEM partners and Intel who will be performing security update validation testing and upgrade testing for 6th Gen Intel Core systems running Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 through the end of support dates. As previously communicated earlier this year, future silicon platforms including Intel’s upcoming 7th Gen Intel Core (Kaby Lake) processor family and AMD’s 7th generation processors (e.g. Bristol Ridge) will only be supported on Windows 10, and all future silicon releases will require the latest release of Windows 10. Embarrassingly, Redmond's update code has locked out some sixth-generation AMD Carrizo chips and reportedly some recent-ish Intel CPUs, even though those components are still eligible for bug fixes and tweaks for Windows 7 and 8. Microsoft is working on resolving this, apparently. The whole policy was enforced from this week onwards, coinciding with Microsoft releasing its badly organized April patch bundle. Those angry about the new rules can't say they weren't warned. Microsoft announced back in January of 2016 and again in September that seventh-generation Intel and new AMD CPUs would be blocked from running older versions of the operating system. "As new silicon generations are introduced, they will require the latest Windows platform at that time for support," Microsoft says on an FAQ page for its support lifecycle. "This enables us to focus on deep integration between Windows and the silicon, while maintaining maximum reliability and compatibility with previous generations of platform and silicon." The ruling will no doubt irk some users – such as PC gamers – who have until now opted to run Windows 7 on their new machines and prefer the interface of the older OS over that of Windows 10. For Microsoft, however, the policy will mean fewer headaches for its programmers and less time spent wrangling code to work with various configurations. By making sure all new PCs run Windows 10, Redmond will also be able to further inflate the usage numbers for its latest OS – something that the marketing department will welcome. ® Tips and corrections 36 Comments MORE Amd Intel Windows 10 More from The Register Microsoft kindly offers VMware-to-Azure backup 'Back up the whole data centre just by connecting to vCenter!' but it's no Virtzilla-killer Callisto Group snoopers wreak havoc with leaked HackingTeam spyware Surveillance firm's toolset goes rogue in hands of cyberspooks 6 Comments Nvidia says Google's TPU benchmark compared wrong kit You're faster than the Kepler, but what about the newer and better Pascal? 8 Comments Adieu pour toujours!

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Windows 7 and 8.1 systems built with the latest… Windows 7 and 8.1 systems built with the latest CPUs will no longer receive security updates By Mark Coppock — April 13, 2017 3:44 PM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you If you're running Windows 7 or 8.1 on a machine with the latest Intel or AMD processors, then you'll need to upgrade to Windows 10 or risk losing security patches. No operating system lasts forever, as evidenced by Windows Vista reaching the end of its support life cycle just the other day. That’s probably well understood by most computer users, but some might be surprised to learn that even an operating system that’s officially supported can still have its options limited. Such is the case with Windows 7 and 8.1, which are still receiving either extended or mainstream support from Microsoft and remain popular among Windows users. However, as some people are discovering, if you’re running a machine equipped with a newer CPU, then you’ll want to give more serious consideration to giving them up and finally making the move to Windows 10, as Ars Technica reports. The reason is simple if still slightly hard to swallow for affected users — Microsoft considers the newest Intel and AMD processors to be “designed for the latest version of Windows,” which, of course, means Windows 10. Accordingly, the company announced in January 2016 that Windows 7 and 8.1 would stop receiving updates if they’re running on machines using Intel’s seventh-generation Core processors, also known as Kaby Lake, and AMD’s just-released Ryzen processors. Some systems using sixth-generation Intel Core processors, known as Skylake, also fall under the same policy. Although Microsoft wasn’t precise on exactly when that policy would go into effect, we now know the answer to that question. As some users are discovering, Windows 7 or 8.1 systems built with Kaby Lake, Skylake, or Ryzen processors are generating pop-ups letting users know that those systems “will miss important security updates.” The reason for the change is that Microsoft hasn’t verified that Windows 7 and 8.1 support all of the new capabilities of the newest processors, such as recent improvements in power management starting with Ryzen and Skylake processors. In addition, the new processors and their associated chipsets include other components, such as USB Type-C and NVMe, that may not have drivers for older operating systems. Some original equipment manufacturers have undertaken the process of verifying that Windows 7 and 8.1 will run just fine on their Skylake-based systems, and so that’s why some Skylake systems support those operating systems and some don’t. But otherwise, all of Microsoft’s due diligence with the newest systems has been performed with Windows 10, and so this latest action is basically the company’s way of letting people know that they’ll want to make the upgrade sooner rather than later. People have various reasons for staying on Windows 7 and 8.1. Larger organizations that have many systems to upgrade have delayed their Windows 10 upgrades due to cost and logistical concerns. Starting now, however, those users won’t have any choice in the matter — it’s upgrade to Windows 10, or risk running into security issues caused by an unpatched operating system.

He has been interviewed by and provided analysis for RT, the BBC, and Press-TV. His articles have been published in the Security Assistance Monitor, Washingtons Blog, OpedNews, the Saker, RT, Global Research, and RINF, and the Greanville Post among others.He has been cited and republished by various academic blogs including Defending History, Michael Hudson, SWEDHR, Counterpunch, the Justice Integrity Project, among others.The Vault 7 exposé by WikiLeaks neglected to mention the most important part of the disclosure. Sure, the CIA has all these tools available. Yes, they are used on the public. The important part is; it’s not the CIA that’s using them. That’s the part that needs to frighten you.The CIA, by the definition of its mission, cannot use the tools in Vault 7, and definitely not on Americans. All the tools are unclassified, open-source, and can be used by anyone. It makes them not exactly usable for secret agent work. That’s what makes it impossible for them to use Vault 7 tools directly. Because of the possible exposure for the agency, use of the tools was farmed out.Instead, they are there for subcontractors to use. Are you worried about your TV watching you? Has your car developed the habit of starting itself in the morning?If these tools were solely in the hands of a US agency, you would be much safer. The agencies have limits on what they can do and agencies have oversight providing protections.Instead, intelligence and counterterrorism tools are in the hands of people that make most of their money pushing political agendas forward. And there is no oversight for what they are doing with the tools.In March 2015, I started writing about private NSA guns for hire. These hired guns work in the revolving door between government Intel and counterterrorism and private intel and counterterrorism. What it showed was the same people that worked for US agencies and trained them were using the same tools and methods on Americans that they used for terrorist hunting. And they brag about it in social media.The same people that take counterterrorism measures against Al Qaeda, are free to use those tools on you. According to CNN, Aaron Weisburd models his methods on the no-holds-barred Al Qaeda model.From CBS News-“sources close to U.S. intelligence as saying that “hackers knocked out Al Qaeda’s online means of communication, thus preventing them from posting anything to commemorate 911 anniversary.” The paper also said Western intelligence suspects two hackers were responsible: Aaron Weisburd from Internet Haganah and Rusty Shackleford from the web group My Pet Jawa.”According to Sputnik News “As much as 80 percent of the US National Security Agency’s (NSA) budget is privatized, demonstrating the merger between Washington and corporate organizations, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Tuesday.”This means that up to 80% of that budget is going to people in the private sector that are also working on other agendas, including their own. That’s why we see more headlines like “NSA staff used spy tools on spouses, exlovers:watchdog.” or “The Crazy Emails That Took Down NSA Spook John Schindler.” Both articles show contractors use Vault 7 tools for their own domestic spying or revenge.In May 2015, the Nation published an article that is a must read to grasp how dangerous this has become. I’ve written intensively on how these tools are used to create news and policy from a ground and company level for NGO’s and lobbyists. This article ratchets it up by looking at the policy makers and former agency heads that go into the private Intel and policy crafting business for hire.According to The Nation “These are the people—often referred to as “intelligence professionals”—who do the actual analytical and targeting work of the NSA and other agencies in America’s secret government. Over the last 15 years, thousands of former high-ranking intelligence officials and operatives have left their government posts and taken up senior positions at military contractors, consultancies, law firms, and private-equity firms. In their new jobs, they replicate what they did in government—often for the same agencies they left. But this time, their mission is strictly for-profit.”What does this have to do with overhauling the ODNI and 17 Intel agencies? Everything. From oversight to policy, the level of non-partisan professionalism needed to conduct unbiased intelligence work is no longer there. The Vault 7 leak could well be an inside attempt to address these issues.“In the intelligence community in the United States, there are certain disgruntled individuals [concerned] about the way operations are being run, and it’s obvious that material has come out that was felt by some of these individuals needed to be discussed,” Kampmark explained.”The ODNI and its agencies descent into shambles have been three presidencies in the making. Why a shambles? When intelligence is based on political agendas, rumor, or speculation instead of facts, it’s in trouble. All of it was done in the name of getting faster intelligence and making actionable Intel available to members of Congress that had no business getting involved with classified, need to know basis intelligence.The second part of this article will address how much effect these intel releases have on breaking story news over the years.Many of the Intel experts hired as contractors are not Intel experts. As you’ll soon see, a housecleaning at the agency level and contractors is both unavoidable and necessary.I asked Michael Jasinski, Assistant Professor Department of Political Science University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh about this. Professor Jasinski had oversight over researchers that were later hired by US Intel agencies and provided evaluations of them prior to their employment.His comments show why a radical cleanup in both intel and counter-terrorism needs to happen. With the following statement he also added that their obvious patriotic feelings were real, but: “Considering how the intelligence community is depicted in the media or in the movies (and clearly CIA “outreach” plays a role here), you’d think Jedi Knights. The Justice League. Gandalf. But if you ever had personal contact with the “three-letter agencies” for any period of time, you’d think different. My most recent experience with the “intelligence” community was at MIIS, post-9/11 when the agencies were coming there to hire, and they were hiring big. They hired many of my research assistants–I was doing what might be termed “open-source intelligence” on WMD proliferation–and in the process, they’d ask me, their immediate supervisor, for my opinion. So I’d tell them point-blank: can’t read, can’t write, can’t analyze. I don’t care what their CV says, the only language they can function in at any level is English. No matter, they’d get hired anyway. Drug convictions? No matter, they’d get hired anyway (at least at the time, the CIA would hire you if you didn’t have any drug convictions within the last 3 years). Scary political views they wore on their sleeve? No matter, they’d get hired anyway. All of my good assistants went to work for the UN, IAEA, major NGOs. The dregs went to “intelligence.” So now when I see a) the “Russian interference” stories and b) the inability to safeguard, and presumably use responsibly, your own cyber-warfare arsenal, I can’t say I’m exactly surprised. But there are no shortcuts in this kind of work. If you rapidly expand at the cost of dramatically lowering standards, you (and the country) are going to pay a price. We’re paying it right now..”When OSINT was pioneered, from the 1990’s into the 2000’s, none of the agencies had any experience with OSINT. It was a new concept. To get Intel gathering and online counterterrorism where it is today, US intelligence agencies relied on the methods and help of an out of work web-designer, a pornographer suffering from toxic black-mold induced delusions, a gift shop employee, a stay at home dad whose last job was selling underwear, and a man that heard coded intel messages in fax transmission beeps. Unfortunately, this isn’t a joke.One thing all these people have in common is that none of them have a background in intelligence or antiterrorism. In the years before and after 9/11, these concerned citizens took to the web and started pioneering a new form of intelligence called OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). This would later provide the basis for the establishment of the NSA and become the backbone of US intelligence gathering.All the intelligence gathering agencies rejected it at first because it relied on social media. At best this intelligence can only be looked at as unsubstantiated or rumor level information. While it’s OK for pointing to a potential problem, it’s limitations are that it provides unproven and possibly compromised and tainted information. The CIA was focused on HUMINT (Human Intel, using human agents or trusted sources) and SIGINT(Signals Intel/ communications).These Open Source Intel pioneers started gaining ground by emailing community leaders and US Congressmen. They pushed OSINT to the forefront of US intelligence by sending it to anyone they thought would listen and forward their Intel to the US government. At first, they worked on the War on Terror.Along the way, they collected letters of recommendation which they flashed around to the next prospective clients in government, Intel agencies, military, and lobbyists. This is important because letters of recommendation from people not in the Intel business became the basis for this new internet, Google search based, cottage industry.Some of them work directly with Israeli intelligence. Most of these pioneers found ready help by sending their Intel to Israeli embassies that sent the info to US government agencies. At the same time, with the help of the connections they were making, they published news stories in major publications before US agencies had time to digest the information that they received. This forced the US government to react to their online Google-driven research.Because it was Open Source Intel, these pioneers figured out quickly that they could send or sell the information BEFORE it was reviewed by an agency and classified. All Intel the CIA receives is given a classified rating whether it is open source or not. This one point increased the status of the practitioners.Congressmen, Governors, and news outlets that were interested started getting the same “Intel” the CIA was. It also became clear quickly that the new Intel could be framed on whatever bias you chose. This meant it could be used to create policy.Lobbyists and Congress quickly figured out that by using these sources, they could push pet or paid foreign policy forward. Because it was a private effort, OSINT operators got paid to deliver Intel for groups looking for specific insights. For instance, during the Gulf War, they searched for WMD and Al Qaeda connections.From the mid-1990’s this became a boom industry thanks to pioneers Steve Emerson and Rita Katz. Emerson’s big break came with CNN after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. He was sure Islamists were behind it. Being wrong didn’t slow him down.Before 9/11, Emerson and Katz open source Intel was being spread far and wide and thanks to personal networking efforts it made then president Bush’s daily briefings about Al Qaeda. Emerson and Katz provided erroneous open source Intel to support Ahmed Chalabi’s drive for invading Iraq. This was personal to Katz and Intel agencies noted that most of her Intel is one-sided and politically charged.Katz made it a habit of bombarding agencies and media with new social media findings that came so fast news cycles couldn’t keep up with it. To ignore her meant you could be scooped by another news agency. To publish it meant that it was unsubstantiated information.For Katz, this came to a head in 2007 when she posted an Osama bin Laden interview online before Al Qaeda had a chance to. How many conclusions does this point to? Al Qaeda got the video from Katz.According to the Washington Post, “A similar event occurred Friday when another group beat al-Qaeda by nearly a full day with the release of the first video images of bin Laden to appear publicly since 2004. That group, the SITE Institute, provided the tape to government agencies and news organizations at a time when many well-known jihadist Web sites had been shut down in a powerful cyber attack by unknown hackers.”According to the Newsweek article “How Richard Clarke Outsourced Terrorist Intel,” both  Emerson and Katz became the go-to companies for OSINT. US intelligence had no experience with it until this period. And US intel and law enforcement didn’t want any.“Emerson and Katz furnished Clarke and his staff with the names of Islamic radical Web sites, the identities of possible terrorist front groups and the phone numbers and addresses of possible terror suspects–data they were unable to get from elsewhere in the government.This private pipeline of information–which began under President Clinton and continued under Bush even after September 11–irritated top officials at FBI headquarters, especially when much of the private research bore fruit and was later used to help develop a U.S. government list of banned organizations whose assets were frozen by the Treasury Department.”After the Patriot Act, it was these two in particular and contractors like them that caused the “no-fly” lists to fill out so quickly. The search for terrorists had begun and it looks like it was paid on a piece-work basis. The more potential terrorists there were the more money in government contracts that could be had.Until this point, Emerson and Katz research was funded by unnamed wealthy donors and foundations who had an interest in finding Islamic terrorists operating in the US online.  In his book “Against All Enemies” Clarke writes “Within days” of his first request in late 1999, Clarke writes, Emerson provided him “with a long list of Web sites sitting on servers in the United States.” Clarke then passed along the list to the Justice Department and FBI. But officials there balked at using it and complained at the time about “how difficult it was to prosecute ‘free speech’ cases.”While all of this sounds good and noble, the reality was and is that most of the targeted websites were American citizens expressing free speech. The only qualification to get on their list for a news site or a website was to print anti-Zionist articles, pro-Palestinian articles, or write something against the policies their donors or lobbyist bosses were against. When the government refused to act, OSINT pioneers took it upon themselves to shut down, hack, makeup, and plant evidence on websites to try to get convictions.Big media and the agencies themselves did their job letting the public know what was going on. Because no one understood the technology and therefore didn’t care about this, the problem grew to where it is today. As early as 2003 in the Chicago Tribune, the FBI gave warnings like this one about a particular website it was asked to investigate, “The site is not illegal in any way [nor does it condone] illegal activity,” said FBI spokesman Frank Bochte in Chicago. “We cannot be the Orwellian thought police. If it is mere words and nothing beyond that, there’s nothing we can do.”The proof terrorist hunter Aaron Weisburd offered was simple. “It talks about the “Zionist” rope over American leaders and lists 45 Jews in top positions of U.S. government. A photo gallery features the burning of the American flag, and one section is called “Know Your Enemy.”In 2005, the Washington Post interviewed Weisburd and he unabashedly states his group uses the same tactics as Al Qaeda. He goes on to say that not everything they do is legal. According to his victims, he used the tools, access, and criminal activity to destroy their lives. They had nothing to do with the war on terror. They wrote human rights articles.The Guardian made the point in November 2014 saying “Our choice isn’t between a world where either the good guys spy or the bad guys spy. It’s a choice of everybody gets to spy or nobody gets to spy.”The privatized NSA makes its living off building hate. They are hired to drive headlines and policy. A longtime partner of Rita Katz and Aaron Weisburd drove these headlines in the UK.‘Terror expert warns of ‘new 9/11’’, The Express, 1 January 2009; ‘Attack on US ‘soon’’, The Sun, 1 January 2009, HATE HIT LIST’, The Sun, 7 January 2009In her 2003 book “The Terrorist Hunter,” Rita Katz went as far as to say “the F.B.I., didn’t “possess one-thousandth of my knowledge on the relevant issues.”Through agency overhaul in 2004, Congress set the stage and legislated the method that agencies and media warned would result in politically motivated, goal oriented reports loosely defined as intelligence. All of it affects policy today because a lot of it is designed to.Because of the overhaul the US Government hired an out of work web-designer, a former reporter that was really bad at finding terrorists, a gift shop employee, and a man who dropped out of college to jump into the fray with no terrorism expertise to teach government agencies how to conduct OSINT.With over 20 years of experience, Steve Emerson must deliver crazy good OSINT intel to the US government. Just how good is the god-father of US government OSINT intel?“Senior officials in the U.S. administration called Emerson’s claims “incorrect and misleading.”“Steven Emerson: the Fox news expert who thinks Birmingham is ‘totally Muslim’”“David Cameron: US terror ‘expert’ Steve Emerson is a ‘complete idiot’“Unfortunately, this isn’t a joke. These same experts taught NATO, the FBI, CIA, NSA, and related agencies their expertise in the business through 6-week courses and seminars. They also testify as expert witnesses for Congress and supply an endless stream of Intel built on the policies their clients or prejudice dictates. Today’s DNI is filled with people that learned his methods.How serious are they taken? The Information Operations Newsletter Vol. 12, no. 06 (April 2012) Compiled by: Mr. Jeff Harley, US Army Space and Missile Defense Command Army Forces Strategic Command G39, Information Operations Division quotes the above-listed OSINT pioneers as the experts to listen to.Throughout 2015 and 2016, I followed a team of these OSINT pioneers setting up to attack people in the USA using these technologies. Because no one had ever cared before, they were very open about what they were doing in social media if you knew where to look. They geo-located victims, collected information, and added hackers in the group to attack American news websites.I followed this group as they destroyed the income of news websites and started to destroy the reputations of owners and journalists. After documenting enough of the facts, I tried to contact the concerned parties directly and indirectly. I wrote a couple articles describing how it was happening and even quoted the group doing it describing what they were setting up for. This even included screen shots.Why would they go as far as geo-location? Vault 7 makes that clear. The pioneer in this area also helped set up the Peacemaker website for Ukraine. This site provides kill lists with all the information known or needed to find someone. Within a month of my first article about Peacemaker in March 2015, the first victim was murdered.It raises some serious questions about what is occurring in 2017. When it’s clear the people using Vault 7 tools don’t think of you as anything more than an enemy in a “Call of Duty” video game and they get paid for results, it’s time to question the legality.When they do it for foreign governments, it’s time bring up treason. When they turn around, work for government and then put the same people and news site on lists; Are they working for their private clients or for the US government? If you disagree with their employers politics, they get paid to destroy your life. They are a privatized NSA attacking you.Part 2 of this article will show the second fork using these tools took. Understanding who is behind the stories about Russian election influence, hacking, and even the MH-17 disaster in 2014, and why they did it is an eye opener.This dissects fake news and shows how prominent fabricated intelligence is in mainstream media. The article shows the methodology and the technicians that ignited and pushed the biggest controversies of the past few years.These are the tools and these are the players that built the election interference and Russian hacking story.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Automated vehicle systems developer Peloton Technology has landed $60 million in funding to accelerate development of its technology that coordinates truck driving controls so they can cruise in highly efficient pairs called "platoons," Peloton said Wednesday. The deal swells Mountain View, Calif.-based Peloton's venture capital bank account to a total of $78 million and will help it roll out the market's first commercial two-truck driver-assistive platooning system later in 2017, as well as development of more advanced automation solutions to follow, Peloton said. Peloton's technology allows truck fleets to enhance their aerodynamics and improve fuel consumption by having two trucks platoon as they cruise the highway, while human drivers handle the steering and navigation, the company says. The system links the accelerators and brake pedals of two trucks through a wireless connection, allowing the driver in the lead truck to control the acceleration and braking of the following vehicle. Peloton will use its new funds to accelerate vehicle integration projects with automotive suppliers such as Volvo Trucks North America and with suppliers of brake systems and connected-vehicle platforms, the company said. Several U.S.-based Fortune 500 freight transportation fleets plan to trial the system within the next year, according to Peloton. The investment was led by fleet management solutions vendor Omnitracs LLC, which first announced in February that it would partner with Peloton to offer truck platooning technology to transportation and logistics companies. Additional funding came from big names in the technology industry, such as existing Peloton investors Intel Capital, DENSO International America, BP Ventures, Lockheed Martin, Nokia Growth Partners, UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund, Volvo Group, Sand Hill Angels, Band of Angels, and Birchmere Ventures. The deal also included new Peloton investors B37 Ventures, Mitsui USA, Okaya, Schlumberger, US Venture, and Breakthrough Fuel. In addition to granting new funding, the deal also reinforces the link between Peloton and Omnitracs. The partners will now expand their cross-fleet platooning opportunities by integrating Peloton's system with the Omnitracs Intelligent Vehicle Gateway telematics platform and developing new joint telematics solutions, according to Peloton. "The transportation industry is going through a massive change," Omnitracs CEO John Graham said in a release. "Macro-level trends like the Internet of Things, cognitive applications, faster delivery of goods, and new levels of customer service are at the core of our new partnership with Peloton. We want to expand the possibilities of truck automation on the nation's highways and set new standards in integrated dispatch, tracking and routing, as well as driver-facing applications to maximize and optimize the orchestration of both same-fleet and cross-fleet platooning." #Software & Systems #Logistics Resources Mentioned In This Article BP Ventures Breakthrough Fuel DENSO International America Intel Capital Lockheed Martin Nokia Growth Partner Omnitracs Peloton Technology Sand Hill Angels UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund Volvo Group Volvo Trucks North America Related Articles GlobalTranz launches freight management platform Report lists three ways to get more value from your WMS MercuryGate launches collaborative freight exchange platform Freightos raises $25 million investment for logistics software Making the right connections More Videos » Technology Videos Orchestrating Your Next Best Move With Real-Time Visibility Logistics technology tools that matter Ruan: A Culture Enhanced by People, Process and Technology Join the Discussion After you comment, click Post.

The Boston Globe Comment on this Tweet this Facebook President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday. Associated Press FACT CHECK Fact-checking President Trump’s speech to Congress By Calvin Woodward and Christopher S. Rugaber, Associated Press April 13, 2017 WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump boasted in his speech to Congress that new money ‘‘is pouring in’’ from NATO partners, which it isn’t. He also took credit for corporate job expansion and military cost savings that actually took root under his predecessor. A look at some of his claims Tuesday night: On NATO TRUMP: Speaking of the NATO alliance, ‘‘Our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice. Very nice.’’ THE FACTS: No new money has come pouring in from NATO allies. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made a strong case when he met with allied defense ministers at a NATO meeting last month, pressing them to meet their 2014 commitment to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. He and other leaders said the allies understood the message and there was some discussion about working out plans to meet the goal. Advertisement Only five of the 28 member countries are meeting the 2 percent level, and no new commitments have been made since the NATO meeting. In fact, Germany’s foreign minister said Wednesday he is skeptical about his country’s plans to increase defense spending, saying it could raise concerns in Europe by turning Germany into ‘‘a military supremacy.’’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said her country will meet its commitment to raise defense spending by the 2024 deadline. In any event, the commitment is for these nations to spend more on their own military capabilities, which would strengthen the alliance, not to hand over money. On immigration TRUMP: ‘‘According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America’s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.’’ Advertisement THE FACTS: That’s not exactly what that report says. It says immigrants ‘‘contribute to government finances by paying taxes and add expenditures by consuming public services.’’ The report found that while first-generation immigrants are more expensive to governments than their native-born counterparts, primarily at the state and local level, immigrants’ children ‘‘are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.’’ This second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis, for example, than did the rest of the population in the period studied, 1994-2013. The report found that the ‘‘long-run fiscal impact’’ of immigrants and their children would probably be seen as more positive ‘‘if their role in sustaining labor force growth and contributing to innovation and entrepreneurial activity were taken into account.’’ On military spending Get Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Enter email address: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here TRUMP: ‘‘We’ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price’’ of the F-35 jet fighter. THE FACTS: The cost savings he persists in bragging about were secured in full or large part before he became president. The head of the Air Force program announced significant price reductions in the contract for the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet Dec. 19 — after Trump had tweeted about the cost but weeks before he met the company’s CEO about it. Pentagon managers took action even before the election to save money on the contract. Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the aerospace consulting firm Teal Group, said there is no evidence of any additional cost savings as a result of Trump’s actions. On new jobs Storm clouds began to form over the White House. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press Advertisement TRUMP: ‘‘Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.’’ THE FACTS: Trump is taking credit for corporate jobs decisions that largely predate his election. In the case of Intel, construction of the Chandler, Arizona, factory referred to by Trump actually began during Barack Obama’s presidency. The project was delayed by insufficient demand for Intel’s high-powered computer chips, but the company now expects to finish the factory within four years because it anticipates business growth. Some of the job announcements have come after companies, such as the wireless carrier Sprint, reduced their numbers of workers. More important, even as some companies create jobs, others are laying off workers. The best measure of whether more jobs are actually being created is the monthly employment report issued by the Labor Department, which nets out those gains and losses. The department will issue its report for February, the first full month of Trump’s term, on March 10. On the budget TRUMP: His budget plan will offer ‘‘one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.’’ THE FACTS: Three times in recent years, Congress raised defense budgets by larger percentages than the $54 billion, or 10 percent, increase that Trump proposes. The base defense budget grew by $41 billion, or 14.3 percent, in 2002; by $37 billion, or 11.3 percent, in 2003, and by $47 billion, or 10.9 percent, in 2008, according to Defense Department figures. On taxes TRUMP: ‘‘We will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.’’ THE FACTS:Trump has provided little detail on how this would happen. Independent analyses of his campaign’s tax proposals found that most of the benefits would flow to the wealthiest families. The richest 1 percent would see an average tax cut of nearly $215,000 a year, while the middle one-fifth of the population would get a cut of just $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint project by the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute. On infrastructure TRUMP: A White House fact sheet on the nation’s infrastructure issued with his speech describes ‘‘a desperate need for improvement’’ of public infrastructure ‘‘in poor condition.’’ It cites a report from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association that over 55,000 bridges are ‘‘structurally deficient.’’ THE FACTS: Trump and many Americans love to complain about their highways and bridges, but data show that the country isn’t that bad off when compared either with its global counterparts or the recent past. The World Economic Forum ranks the U.S. seventh out of 138 countries for its transportation infrastructure, ahead of countries such as Germany, Spain, Canada, Britain and China. Countries ahead of it on the list are smaller, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Netherlands. By the nation’s own measurements, bridges have improved over the past decade or so. The trade association for road builders, using government data, indeed says there are 55,710 structurally deficient bridges — those carrying more traffic than they were designed for. But that number represents a 34 percent decline since 2002. And the share of miles driven on national highways with pavement offering ‘‘good ride quality’’ rose from 50 percent in 2002 to 57 percent in 2012. On unemployment TRUMP: ‘‘Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.’’ THE FACTS: That’s true, but for the vast majority of them, it’s because they choose to be. That 94 million figure includes everyone aged 16 and older who doesn’t have a job and isn’t looking for one. So it includes retirees, parents who are staying home to raise children, and high school and college students who are studying rather than working. They are unlikely to work regardless of the state of the economy. With the huge baby boomer generation reaching retirement age and many of them retiring, the population of those out of the labor force is increasing and will continue to do so, most economists forecast. It’s true that some of those out of the workforce are of working age and have given up looking for work. But that number is probably a small fraction of the 94 million Trump cited. On terrorism TRUMP: ‘‘According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home — from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.’’ THE FACTS: It’s unclear what Justice Department data he’s citing, but the most recent government information that has come out doesn’t back up his claim. Just over half the people Trump talks about were actually born in the United States, according to Homeland Security Department research revealed last week. That report said of 82 people the government determined were inspired by a foreign terrorist group to attempt or carry out an attack in the U.S., just over half were native-born citizens. Even the attacks Trump singled out weren’t entirely the work of foreigners. Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his Pakistani wife killed 14 people in the deadly 2015 attack in San Bernardino, California, was born in Chicago. It’s true that in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, the FBI’s primary concern was with terrorists from overseas feared to be plotting attacks in the United States. But that’s no longer the case. The FBI and the Justice Department have been preoccupied with violent extremists from inside the U.S. who are inspired by the calls to violence and mayhem of the Islamic State group. The Justice Department has prosecuted scores of IS-related cases since 2014, and many of the defendants are U.S. citizens. The 100 highest paid city workers in 2016 Figures are rounded to the nearest whole dollar. Total pay includes base salary, overtime, retroactive, detail, and other pay, including educational incentives and injury pay. Read more about these numbers in today's Globe.

One of the two major components of the Affordable Care Act has seen a spike in premiums and a drop in participation from insurers. But the other component, equally important, seems to be working fairly well, even if its costs are a concern. Trump and congressional Republicans want to repeal the whole thing, which risks leaving millions of people uninsured if the replacement plan has shortcomings. Some critics say GOP rhetoric itself is making things worse by creating uncertainty about the future. The health law offers subsidized private health insurance along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income people. Together, the two arms of the program cover more than 20 million people. Republican governors whose states have expanded Medicaid are trying to find a way to persuade Congress and the administration to keep the expansion, and maybe even build on it, while imposing limits on the long-term costs of Medicaid. While the Medicaid expansion seems to be working, the markets for subsidized private health insurance are stressed in many states. Also affected are millions of people who buy individual policies outside the government markets, and face the same high premiums with no financial help from the health law. Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says ‘‘implosion’’ is too strong a term. An AP count found that 12.2 million people signed up for this year, despite the Trump administration’s threats to repeal the law. But a health care blogger and industry consultant, Robert Laszewski, agrees with Trump. He says too few young, healthy people have signed up to guarantee the stability of the insurance markets.

Edward TaylorPaul Lienert development of self-driving cars demands experts in AI, robotics, computer programming and digital networks. Photo: Reuters Frankfurt/Detroit: The race to develop and exploit autonomous vehicle technology is reshaping the hierarchy of the automotive industry, replacing traditional top-down manufacturing relationships with complex webs of alliances and acquisitions. Deal-making in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world’s biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG’s Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a co-pilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. “Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming and digital networks, who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co. are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. Co-pilot approach Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the centre for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc, competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house — as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together,” said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. “These different approaches will have to pass the test of time,” he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.” Reuters Edward TaylorPaul Lienert Topics: self-driving cars Mercedes Intel Mobileye Bosch More From Livemint READ MORE TCS, Carnegie Mellon University to set up facility for cutting edge research Mayawati appoints brother Anand Kumar as BSP vice-president No empty space First Published: Fri, Apr 14 2017. 01 23 AM IST Editor's Picks Is the end of the road near for Tata Nano?

Sporting a 6-core 2.2GHz D-1531 Xeon, the RS3617xs+ supports DDR4 memory and comes with dual embedded copper 10-Gigabit (10GbE) ports. Launched at the end of 2015, Intel’s Xeon D family of SoCs (system on chips) are designed for embedded storage applications. They feature 14nm Broadwell cores, support for 2,133MHz DDR4, integrated USB and SATA controllers plus dual 10GBase-T interfaces. Expansion is good as along with quad embedded Gigabit ports, the RS3617xs+ offers two PCI-e Gen3 slots certified for standard Intel and Emulex dual-port 10GbE adapter cards. The price includes a decent 8GB of DDR4 memory which can be upgraded to 64GB using four 16GB SO-DIMM modules. It also has two ports at the back for external storage expansion using Synology’s RX1217 or RX1217RP 12-bay disk shelves. The latest 10TB drives from Seagate, HGST and Western Digital are all certified by Synology so maximum capacity can be pushed to a very usable 360TB.   We used Seagate’s massive 10TB IronWolf NAS drives for performance testing Speedy NAS performance The RS3617xs+ is no slouch in the performance stakes and for testing we used a triplet of 10TB Seagate IronWolf SATA drives configured as a massive 18.2TB RAID5 array. With a NAS share mapped over 10GbE to a Lenovo System x3550 M5 rack server running Windows Server 2012 R2, we watched Iometer record good raw read and write rates of 9.2Gbits/sec and 7.3Gbits/sec. With a dedicated share mapped to a second E5-2600 v4 rack server, we saw cumulative Iometer read and write speeds of 18.4Gbits/sec and 10.7Gbits/sec. The CPU looks capable of handling much higher workloads as utilisation never went above 22 percent.  For real world testing, we copied a 25GB file between the Lenovo server and appliance for sustained read and write speeds of 3.8Gbits/sec and 3.5Gbits/sec. The RS3617xs+ makes a speedy backup target as our 22.4GB test folder with 10,500 small files was secured at 2.5Gbits/sec. Synology lets you create encrypted folders – most others only support entire encrypted volumes. The D-1531 Xeon and its embedded AES-NI engine delivers the goods too, as our 25GB file copy averaged 2.4Gbits/sec with CPU utilisation at only 12 percent.   The Snapshot Replication app provides a superb set of data protection features  Backup central The RS3617xs+ works for us as a backup device as we used the Hyper Backup app to manage all our jobs. It’s easy to configure as it provides wizards for 18 different types of tasks including backups to cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft Azure. We also used it as a central network backup repository for our remote Synology appliances. We loaded the Hyper Backup app on a Synology DS716+ and created a job to secure data in selected folders to the RS3617xs+ at regular intervals. The Hyper Backup Vault app made light work of data restoration. Loading it on the RS3617xs+ allowed us to restore selected files and folders to new locations or download them directly onto the management host.   Synology’s Docker runs light-weight containerised apps and other instances of DSM  Protect and virtualise  On appliance data protection is handled by the Snapshot Replication app which we used to create snapshot schedules for NAS shares and iSCSI LUNs on BTRFS volumes and run them as often as every five minutes. For each schedule, we could decide how many to keep and apply a retention policy for hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly snapshots.  Snapshot replication between source and destination Synology appliances is another very useful feature. We used this on our remote DS716+ appliance to replicate its snapshots to the RS3617xs+ and also used the import feature to copy initial data across to the target volume using removable media. The Docker app makes the RS3617xs+ a great virtualisation host as it can run a big selection of business apps in isolated lightweight containers. The Docker DSM feature is also very useful as you can virtualise other DSM instances in their own containers and protect them with snapshots run from the primary Snapshot Replication app.   If you value your hearing keep the appliance’s fan mode set to ‘quiet’   A noisy customer So far, so good but we weren’t impressed with the noise levels from the appliance’s four hot-plug cooling fans. The DSM software offers three fan modes but even on the ‘quiet’ setting, the SPLnFFT iOS app on our iPad recorded an annoying 60dB at one metre away from the appliance.  On ‘cool’ mode, noise levels rose to 66.5dB while the ‘full-speed’ mode had them shrieking at 74dB. We monitored the CPU temperature and saw it settle comfortably at 39 degrees C in ‘quiet’ mode with both ‘cool’ and ‘full-speed’ modes only dropping it to 37 degrees C. Usefully, the fans are easily accessible from underneath a removable hatch so they can be replaced without powering the appliance down. The price includes dual hot-plug PSUs although we noticed their cooling fans are also very noisy. Conclusion The RS3617xs+ is quite unique as it’s the first 12-bay rack NAS to deliver dual embedded 10GBase-T ports. The closet competition is Qnap’s TS-EC1280 R2 12-bay box which is nearly a grand cheaper but only has a dual-port 10GbE SFP+ fibre adapter card included. The appliance’s Xeon D CPU delivers top NAS performance and clearly has more headroom for demanding storage apps. Synology’s DSM software offers a superb range of data backup and protection features but the appliance’s excessive noise levels make it a candidate for a server room or sound-proofed cabinet.

Peter Bright - Apr 13, 2017 5:41 pm UTC Enlarge reader comments 274 Share this story We knew Microsoft was planning to block installation of Windows 7 and 8.1 updates on systems with Intel 7th Generation Core processors (more memorably known as Kaby Lake) and AMD Ryzen systems; we just weren't sure when. Now, the answer appears to be "this month." Users of new processors running old versions of Windows are reporting that their updates are being blocked. The block means that systems using these processors are no longer receiving security updates. The new policy was announced in January of last year and revised slightly a couple of months later: Kaby Lake and Ryzen processors, and all new processors on an ongoing basis, would only be supported in Windows 10. Windows 7 and 8.1 would continue to support older processors, but their chip compatibility was frozen. Awkwardly straddling the two policies are Intel's 6th Generation Core processors, aka Skylake. Some Skylake systems will continue to be supported in Windows 7 and 8.1. Others will not. Certain Skylake models shipped by 16 specific OEMs will continue to receive update support. But other Skylake systems will also need to upgrade to Windows 10 to receive ongoing updates. Microsoft's policy does not strike me as objectionable per se. In practice, I would imagine that Windows 7 and 8.1 would run fine on Kaby Lake and Ryzen machines. But Microsoft can't just shrug its shoulders and assume that everything will work just fine on the old chips. The company would have to test and validate the old operating systems on the new hardware, and I can see why it would rather not do so. For Skylake systems, the 16 OEMs have undertaken to perform some of this testing themselves: For each of the supported systems listed on the OEM pages, the OEM has committed to additional testing, regular validation of Windows Updates, and publishing drivers and firmware for Windows 10 on Windows Update which will help unlock the security and power management benefits of Windows 10 once the systems are upgraded. No such arrangement has been put in place for Kaby Lake or Ryzen. But the manner in which the change in policy is being introduced is what leaves the worst taste in my mouth. Microsoft argues that the new processors include new capabilities and hardware that makes compatibility with the older operating systems difficult or undesirable. There are elements of truth to this; both Ryzen and Skylake made some important changes to features, such as processor power management, and on some level I can accept that Microsoft may not fully support these capabilities on older operating systems. Windows 7 also has no built-in support for USB 3 and NVMe, which can make the mere act of installing it onto a modern system a little tricky. Dropping support for Windows 7 is also arguably consistent with Microsoft's support policy. Windows 7 has been in extended support since January 2015. Products in extended support are due to receive security updates, but no new functional or other improvements will arrive. Limiting support for processors that were introduced after this time does not seem entirely unreasonable. But Windows 8.1 is a different story. Windows 8.1 is still in its mainstream support period, during which it should receive not just security fixes, but also functional improvements. Unlike Windows 7, Windows 8.1 already includes native support for USB 3 and NVMe, so the installation headaches that can occur with the old operating system are avoided. Refusing to support the latest processors in an operating system that's still fully supported feels distasteful. It feels like something of a bait-and-switch—Microsoft's "mainstream support" promise apparently has no real meaning. Windows 8.1 is only in mainstream support for about another year. It does not seem tremendously burdensome for the company to have extended its new processor support to Windows 8.1 until that mainstream support period ended. Windows 8.1 users had a reasonable expectation that their operating system would be fully supported for the duration of the five-year mainstream support period. In making this change, Microsoft fails to live up to its end of the bargain. It really won't be too long before the only Windows version that's in mainstream support is Windows 10.

Intel Wants A Piece Of Android Action, Ports Android To Run On Atom CPUs, Goes After ARM Artem Russakovskii Follow View All Posts 2010/04/13 1:34am PDTApr 13, 2010 0 Plus 1 on G+ 3 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares3 News Most, if not all, Android phones on the market run exclusively on an ARM architecture and Intel wants a piece of the action. On Tuesday (that is today), Intel announced that it had ported Android to run on its Atom CPU line. Intel calls Atom its smallest chip, built with the world's smallest transistors. Atom is aimed at portable devices and consumes only 1-2.5W of power. To make things even more interesting, Renee James, general manager of IDF (Intel Developer Forum) in Beijing, said the company has plans to port *all* mobile operating systems, not just Android, to run on Atom CPUs. Edit: Really - all mobile operating systems? Even the iPhone OS? Didn't think so, Renee. Direct quote though, guys - don't shoot the messenger! That is surely a daring and disruptive announcement, if Intel can pull it off. ARM has enjoyed a 98% exclusivity in the mobile device world (data as of 2007), and Intel is obviously seeing huge opportunities in the mobile space. Some well-known ARM CPUs used in Android devices include NVIDIA's Tegra and Qualcomm's Snapdragon. This is great news for pretty much everyone but the CPU manufacturers using the ARM architecture - Intel always brings extreme performance and tough competition wherever it goes - just ask AMD. Only one question remains now - will it run Crysis? Sources: PCWorld Tags ARM Atom CPU Intel processor subscribe ...

I'm interested in seeing how they stack up and how much power each uses. Otherwise, let's hope Intel knows what it's doing and either way this is great news. Artem Russakovskii Greg, this isn't really a valid comparison but the phones running the new Atom chips that Anandtech got to play with were described as faster than anything ARM based: http://www.anandtech.com/show/2913 steve Nice work intel, had been wondering for a while how long it would be until we see intel trying for the atom or something new for the phone market zinc1024 Remember that Atom is from an ISA perspective "just an x86". That's important because the instruction set constrains the implementation re: power consumption, memory size of apps and performance. So the question is, how competitive will (can) Atom be in all these dimensions? As for porting of the iPhone OS, well it's basically MacOS underneath so it already effectively runs on x86. The real question is will Atom ever compete at the level of the big boys (Apple, Mot, Nokia, Samsung, and let's not forget newcomer Google) switching over to it? ARM has advantages in being designed at the ISA level for small memory footprint and low power. It'll be an interesting battle. Urmil Shroff Hello, 7 years from the future.

Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. Popular Searches Fresenius SE & Co KGaA FSNUY ▼ 19.84 -0.19 -0.95% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 884.67 -11.56 -1.29% Infosys Ltd INFY ▼ 14.48 -0.78 -5.11% World Wrestling Entertainment Inc WWE ▼ 21.38 -0.25 -1.16% That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O) acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV (MBLY.N), and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG (BMWG.DE) develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. "Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programing and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co (GM.N) are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH.N) are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems.

BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together," said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. "These different approaches will have to pass the test of time," he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.” (Reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis) Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The platform is designed primarily for low-power entry-level PCs, but the manufacturer decided to tailor its J3455N-D3H also for customers who need various legacy I/O technologies, indicating that this board was perhaps orignally designed for a specific customer but is now being released to the wider public. The mainboard is equipped with a host of older interfaces, including COM, LPT, PS/2, D-Sub and PCI. Just like the name suggests, the GIGABYTE GA-J3455N-D3H is based on the the Intel Celeron J3455 processor (four Goldmont cores clocked at 1.5/2.3 GHz, 2 MB cache, dual-channel DRAM controller, HD Graphics 500, 10W TDP) that feature Intel’s ninth-generation graphics architecture (Gen9) as well as a refined media playback engine with hardware-accelerated playback of 4K video encoded using HEVC and VP9 codecs. The Mini-ITX motherboard is equipped with two DDR3L SO-DIMM slots (supporting up to 16 GB of DDR3L-1866), two Realtek GbE controllers, four SATA connectors (two controlled by the ASMedia ASM1061), one HDMI 1.4 output (up to 3840×2160 at 30 Hz), a connector for a TPM module, USB 3.0 headers (additional USB 2.0 ports are supported using the internal header and a Genesys Logic USB 2.0 hub) and so on. In addition to the aforementioned regular I/O capabilities of a modern PC, the GIGABYTE GA-J3455N-D3H also features a number of legacy interfaces. The latter includes two COM ports, an LPT port header, PS/2 connectors for keyboard and mouse, a D-Sub output for displays, as well as a PCI slot for various add-on cards (and such cards may carry additional legacy interfaces, such as PATA, etc.). While the presence of the connectors makes the motherboard a viable candidate for a system running legacy applications, it should be noted that Intel’s Apollo Lake is not supported by Windows 7, 8, Vista or XP. Windows 10 does support legacy hardware, including COM, PCI and other interfaces, but the problem is those old software applications that use COM ports or PCI cards might not work in Windows 10, or require VMs and abstraction to do so. Therefore, to use them, one will need to install Windows 7 or XP on a virtual machine, which is not always convenient. Failing this, a Linux distribution might be a preferred option. GIGABYTE's Intel Apollo Lake Motherboard   GA-J3455N-D3H CPU Intel Celeron J3455 4C/4T Goldmont 1.5 - 2.3 GHz 2MB cache 10 W TDP Graphics HD Graphics 500 12 EUs 250 - 750 MHz PCH Integrated into CPU Memory 2 GB DDR3L-1866 pre-installed Two SO-DIMM slots, up to 16 GB of DDR3L-1866 Ethernet 2 × Realtek GbE controllers Display Outputs D-Sub (implementation unclear) HDMI 1.4 Storage 2 × SATA 6 Gbps (SoC) 2 × SATA 6 Gbps (ASM1061) Audio Realtek ALC887 7.1 channel audio USB 2 × USB 3.0 Type-A 2 × USB 2.0 Other I/O 2 × COM ports LPT internal header 2 × PS/2 PCI Form-Factor Mini-ITX OS Windows 10 Detailed Specifications Link While the GA-J3455N-D3H motherboard is heading to retail, the presence of two GbE ports indicates that GIGABYTE either plans to offer the platform to corporate customers, or is already shipping it to interested parties. If the latter is the case, it looks like GIGABYTE has clients who need more or less modern low-cost PCs with legacy interfaces in their corporate networks. It's always easier to replace a $500 PC connected to a $500k machine than to replace the machine, after all. GIGABYTE has not announced MSRP of its J3455N-D3H motherboard or its actual release date. Keeping in mind that the COM, PS/2 and LPT controller, the additional SATA controller as well as a PCIe-to-PCI bridge all cost money, we expect GIGABYTE’s Apollo Lake-based platform to cost more than the base Apollo Lake solutions available.

More cores and more threads than a Core i5 for the same price By Jim Martin | 13 Apr 17 Specifications Type: 64-bit desktop processor Cores/threads: 6/12 Base clock: 3.6GHz Boost clock: 4.1GHz (with XFR) TDP: 95W See full specs Expert's Rating Price when reviewed £249.99, US$249 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Price comparision from , and manufacturers AMD Ryzen 5 1600X review We said it before and we'll say it again, this really is an exciting year for desktop PCs. We haven't been able to say that since, well, forever. It's mainly because Intel has been so dominant in the CPU arena, but AMD Ryzen is turning everything on its head. We've already reviewed the Ryzen 7, which offered essentially the same performance as Intel's best at half the price. Now it's the turn of Ryzen 5. Because mid-range processors are much more competitive on price, we weren't expecting Ryzen 5 to come in and undercut Intel's Core i5 by half. No, here AMD competes by offering more cores and threads at a similar price to Intel. We've tested the Ryzen 5 1600X against the Core i5-7600K because of their prices. But the Intel chip has only four cores to play with and doesn't support Hyper-threading which doubles the number of threads. The 1600X, on the other hand, has six cores and does support AMD's version of Hyper-threading, which is called SMT. This gives the 1600X 200 percent more threads than the 7600K. So it should be an easy win, right? AMD Ryzen 5 1600X: Price and availability Before we get to the benchmark results, let's talk price and features. You can buy a Core i5-7600K for £224.99 from Overclockers UK. The Ryzen 5 1600X costs a bit more: £248.99, also from Overclockers UK.  That's £1 less than the RRP: it's brand new, so don't expect to see any discounted prices for a while. Here’s a summary of the Ryzen 5 range to show you how the 1600X compares with its siblings: Model Cores / Threads Base Clock (GHz) Boost Clock (GHz) TDP (Watts) Included Cooler Price Ryzen 5 1600X 6 / 12 3.6 4.0 95 N/A £249 / $249 Ryzen 5 1600 6 / 12 3.2 3.6 65 Wraith Spire £219 / $219 Ryzen 5 1500X 4 / 8 3.5 3.7 65 Wraith Spire £189 / $189 Ryzen 5 1500 4 / 8 3.2 3.4 65 Wraith Spire £169 / $169 Separately, we've compared the latest Core i5 range with the Core i3. AMD Ryzen 5 1600X: Features Look closely at the specifications, and you'll quickly realise that the 1600X seems a lot like a Ryzen 7 1800X. And there's a reason for that. The 1600X is basically an 1800X with two cores disabled. The 1800X is configured as two quad-core chips. AMD calls these Core Complex (CCX) units. In a 1600X, one core from each CCX is turned off, effectively making it a dual-tri-core CPU, if that's not too confusing. These cores run at the same frequency as the 1800X: 3.6GHz base, rising to 4GHz (or 4.1GHz when using XFR). For more details on XFR and the SenseMI features, read our Ryzen 7 review. The Intel 7600K is also a 14nm chip like Ryzen, and runs faster at 3.8GHz, with a boost frequency of 4.2GHz. Both chips are also unlocked and therefore overclockable. AMD Ryzen 5 1600X: Performance How we tested Rather than using the X370 motherboard as for the Ryzen 7, AMD sent us an Asus Prime B350-Plus board with a newer BIOS that would allow for the best performance. (The tweaks in this BIOS version have subsequently been made available for X370 boards, we’re told.) The B350 is the other chipset which supports overclocking and is a better match for the cheaper Ryzen 5 chips as it costs just under £100. We used the stock AMD cooler on the 1600X and installed a pair of GEIL 8GB DDR4 memory modules, setting the timing to the figures AMD specified, and found they were stable at 3200MHz. Then we stuck with the same GTX 1080 Founders Edition graphics card that we used for the Ryzen 7 tests. Windows 10 was clean installed on a 256GB Kingston HyperX SSD, again just as we did for the Ryzen 7 review. For the Core i5-7600K, we used an Asus ROG Maximus IV motherboard, 16GB of Corsair DDR4 RAM at 2933MHz, a GTX 1080 Founders Edition and a 256GB Kingston HyperX SSD with a fresh install of Windows 10.   Benchmark results As you’d expect, the Cinebench single-thread result for the 1600X is pretty much identical to the 1800X as the individual cores are the same. But armed with just six instead of eight of them (and 12 threads rather than 16) the 1600X could muster ‘only’ 1246 in the multi-threaded test. The i5-7600K, with only four cores and no Hyper-threading is around half as quick, scoring just 691. 7-Zip’s built-in benchmark also shows the benefit of those extra cores and threads, with the 1600X being – almost –twice as quick as the i5-7600K. The Ryzen’s advantage lessens in the synthetic Geekbench 4.1 test, but the 1600X still commands a good lead. But again, when only one thread is used, the Core i5 skips back in front. PCMark 8 is a much more real-world test, and here the Ryzen 5 displays its prowess in the Creative test (which includes encoding, photo editing and other ‘creative’ tasks). It doesn’t out-punch the i5-7600K in the Work test which is made up of those undemanding tasks  like web browsing, spreadsheet work and Skyping. When it comes to gaming, 3DMark offers some insight as to how Ryzen has the advantage when games take full advantage of every core and thread. Overall, the FireStrike scores are similar, with Ryzen having a small lead. The Physics test (not shown in the graphs) demonstrates the theoretical performance advantage: the 1600X scores a whopping 16688 against the i5-7600K’s 6687. But this isn’t a real-world test, and until real games start using all 12 threads, it’s rather a moot point. In Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation, which has been optimised for Ryzen since the 1800X came out, the scores are virtually identical. But when you lower the graphics quality and use the mode which tests the CPU more than the graphics card, Ryzen pulls further ahead. In the DirectX 12 mode of Mankind Divided, Ryzen loses, but not by much. As AMD has been at pains to point out, games are being optimised for Ryzen and performance will improve. If you’re concerned that developers might not bother doing this with older titles, it’s nothing to worry about since – as long as your PC is equipped with a decent graphics card, games from a few years back should run smoothly no matter which processor you have: Ryzen 5 or Core i5. AMD Ryzen 5 1600X: Specs Type: 64-bit desktop processor Cores/threads: 6/12 Base clock: 3.6GHz Boost clock: 4.1GHz (with XFR) TDP: 95W L3 cache: 16MB Type: 64-bit desktop processor Cores/threads: 6/12 Base clock: 3.6GHz Boost clock: 4.1GHz (with XFR) TDP: 95W L3 cache: 16MB OUR VERDICT Although a little more expensive than the i5-7600K, it’s easy to see that the Ryzen 5 1600X is better value for demanding tasks such as 3D- and video rendering, video editing and compressing and decompressing files. The Intel chip still has an advantage for gaming, but as games are optimised for AMD’s new processors the gap will narrow.

The fastest way to get things done on a geopolitical level has become hiring the private Intel and policy-making professionals and letting them loose as experts to the mainstream media. Who is using chemical weapons on the Syrians? Who was involved in the Russian election interference and fake news during the 2016 elections? Who shot down MH-17 in 2014? Someone, somewhere had to be doing something, right? - Advertisement - In part 1 of this article, I detailed the rise of privatized Intel . Their history clearly shows that it wouldn't have been possible without a helping hand from Congressional members that found out they could get their hands on top secret Intel if, and only if, they got it before it was labeled classified. Although the impact on policy is the subject of another article, both lobbyists and Congress found they could build or destroy any administration's foreign policy by hiring the right Intel providers from the private sector Intel community. Lobbyists found out they could run their own foreign policy to a degree by hiring some members of the Intel community that were in the policy-making business. Using the same people, members of Congress figured out the same method to run around the State Department and get the Executive branch to react to their fabricated/paid for by lobbyists Intel. They provide their employers the facts they were paid to find. They provide their employers story to the media by stretching the connecting dots or fabrication. It's become a huge ($Billions) cottage industry and these experts won't be challenged. - Advertisement - As I detailed in part 1, they all started out by emailing someone they knew about something they found on the internet. As they became a little more adept at Google search techniques, they found obscure facts that they sold as Intel. They emailed their Congressman and the press about their facts. They gathered "letters of recommendation" from anyone that would listen to them, everywhere they went. As the doors opened they found they could make tons of money connecting the dots to whatever it was their clients hated and wanted to be changed. When the Iraq war rolled around, some of them were part of the President's daily briefing. We couldn't have had the Iraq war without them. Mainstream media was inundated with material from these sources that were employed by lobbyists to get the USA to go to war. Here we go again, same story, their story. The Senate Intelligence Committee hearings on Russia and the 2016 elections couldn't have come at a better time for me. A quick look at the experts testifying shows they can be traced back to an out of work web-designer, a pornographer suffering from toxic black-mold induced delusions , a gift shop employee , a stay at home dad whose last job was selling underwear , and a man that heard coded intel messages in fax transmission beeps . Unfortunately, this still isn't a joke. These are the Intel experts that provide most of the Intel available in media today. According to CNN , Clint Watts, the terrorism expert that gave the expert testimony to the Senate got involved in cyber almost by accident in 2014. With Aaron Weisburd, he is a senior fellow at the Center For Cyber and Homeland Security at The George Washington University. Starting with no experience in Intel or Russian Influence Operations Watts was able to "watch and track the rise of Russia's social media influence operations starting in 2015 and witnessed their update of an old Soviet playbook known as Active Measures." - Advertisement - Clint Watts great breakthrough moment came when he got incensed that a Kardasian look-alike Syrian girl spoke against Obama's Syrian policy. He just couldn't have that. It was...anti-American.

They go over how the Maple Leafs last two games effect the Bruins. Ty also joins from the Garden later. You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. All right the Bruins are men they are and thanks to that six game winning streak late in the season. 188. And one under Bruce Cassidy and 47 games after the coaching change. Barry in the regular season as the day how are you feel about it they'll. Say backing in but sort of tumbling in with a couple of major injuries to discuss rear admirals to join us here about ten minutes or so he's make his way over the facility. Tai Anderson RB report WEEI dot comes at TD garden data card old reliable is here stick in for civility and a the any you've got the Intel the recruit is indeed out from first round at least likely out I guess that wanna put words in your mouth yeah. I know I'm climate now it's not good at all and I think whenever you dealing with these cypress knee injuries. Obviously at some point it comes down a pain threshold that's not to knock anybody that that. Looks at it and says hey I can't play its usage is not working for me but it all went when you get a diagnosis and they put a timetable on it you know at some point. Yeah you can't just rush back wit and I don't care what would be pain threshold this cell. I went on the arron is that this is worse than data de annaly said data they right away. I Cassidy said that putt on here this is worse than day to day and expectations at least that he's gonna miss a first round series. Possible first second round series if they get fair but if they're planning capitals in the first drop out and expected in the second round. Well we don't ultimately capital yet if you lay out the and your show them and Toronto's got two games left against teams that really have not much to play for Pittsburgh tonight. Columbus tomorrow both of those teams are locked in with their currency things like if police get three out of four points. Able pass Boston and play Ottawa in round one. If they get two out of points or less the Bruins will stick it they'll play the senators Wednesday or Thursday. We saw the capitals at least it'll form of that today they were a total full strength now that they're obviously in good pressure trophy team for a reason. Is it possible new look back wellness and we're gonna blame that Brad marshy and growing tapped for cost liberal is an easier first round matchup but also happy I tested tap the am trying to be nice under the pile on at this point. They've looked shell last two games offensively they're a mess without marsh in a lineup they don't bring much. Com telling into the got reporting it's laudable but that's that was an Ottawa team right for the beating Thursday night without Erik Karlsson in the lineup so it's a it's a bit disappointed back in. This way and if indeed Toronto passes yeah I think you look back at marsh and situation and say. What are your leaders terrible time I don't want to gain the clinch that titan but it cost you may be in Ottawa series steady going appear as the number one. Yes and I know because this game it is going to be fresh in everybody's minds go into the playoffs and if you play Washington in the first round it'll be yet even more fresh in everyone's minds. But when it comes at a much chance suspension which by the way I started said multiple times like I think the league got it right. As it was more than a tap he knew he was joined and he's a repeat offender but that said I don't want Dan I would get with his two game suspension is Thursday night against Ottawa. I mean it's a one goal game. And when you on this in yard top goal scorer and a winnable gamut almost. Not only did you mission in regulation you miss moshing and all the time and animist and again in the shootout. And on top of that if you want to point the finger and put some glam on the Bruins in that loss to Ottawa the other night is if they. And again. This kid days may once they clinched the rate dipped plan the senate is again. Who cares what happens today against Washington right you'll should've won that game the other night and even without washing and we in this console much. I had an opportunity and assured Arnold can you tell me. It IU is upset about that shoot out order against the senators the other side is I am Drew Stafford and Ryan's opponent to begin. That's a did when you leave Bergeron Krejci on the bench for that. And they're looking back at the coach don't you got. We got awareness that this is what's going on. I don't understand how you you go through that game and don't give at least one of those two guys a shot to win it especially it seemed like the strategy was gulf rival. Everyone try to go 50 just what you know would want five all Patrice Bergeron we sit on the benching him a shot. It's we can say we can complain all we want about this game against the capitals thing. It's that game against Ottawa Thursday night that to maybe. Really gets me fired up when we look at these Bruins team and perhaps look at them now haven't played the capitals in the first trying to we don't know for sure. Toronto does handle their own a in a bid they control their own destiny now. Blind you know you kind of want one of these last two landing to gain a more fired up dated when was that Indians on. Its interest imposter not with third rate yes he was it was stabbed a bit more impostor knocked. Yeah and today they didn't start Rask which was ahead throughout your if you if this was a game. You absolutely felt like he needed to win to avoid the capitals the wise to delve into and out they're not that he's been bad lately is obviously and it was six and oh. Since the recall committed to escape today. Bought Rask it's in the third period only because of flu symptoms so yes it's a little bit of on that. Yeah Jeremy amendment to cover the Red Sox had a bad bad bad block you know once causeway and they went the new practice facility next though does somebody. That's spread the floor of the Red Sox and the Bruins into the media are we saw employment immediately I don't. They just yeah just keep it go away from the T 30 I know that I hope. And and I mean if they would spot you would do this. They took adult and out he did not come back open at third but I hope that they disinfected the entire room while the team result plane third period. Because the last thing you should wanna get a Bruins is to have to deal with the Red Sox don't right now that's the last thing you want. Because it's already going to be an uphill battle you know what even if they play Ottawa. I know we would prefer Ottawa over the capitals at least I do and it probably due to. But let's not make it sound like that series is going to be a lock in the pocket esteem it's not going to be. Now 03 wanna get subtle this year they play that's a sale what from entertainment point of view idols rather see Boston Washington. Just from the just the pure entertainment value because he negotiates style hockey meant just. 0131 market up in the neutral zone and those are gonna be 21 games refer the whole series. Yeah and I guess. Just to get back to what happened today with Adobe and obviously being sick I don't I don't have. Intel on the decision. It says Scott Dohmann over asked what I what I can't say though is I came to arrest defense. I won a couple weeks ago after at Tampa Bay game you know not happen again media let a couple to our bottles and at Tampa Bay again but any missed the next one Brooklyn. And people looked crushing sameness is a must win you know they gold backed an auto game last year. I came to his defense because. He has been the only sound and it's been an injury that he softening game one that. On the regular season and wrestling did and it they're odd times in which you know lot. He can't call. I don't know what happened today. What given affected couple weeks ago against Brooklyn there was something bothering him still to a point where you know he needed that extra day. I guess I just wonder if the Bruins a look at this staying on we don't have moshing and we're playing the best team only been on a much and we don't have proved we don't have a Jahri and you can roll your eyes that comment I want. But if you watch the Bruins are in his win streak a chart was buzzing around he was when battles he was Bruins hockey. Yeah and and when noticing him on top of those things. Yeah well I guess I wonder if they look at it and said what's more beneficial to us roll in to get in this game or is certain. And and and still it's going to be tough for us to win this one given all the other bodies when this and. Or maybe. We jazz see how good I don't I don't even plan put it. And that hope to get to get some rest and and also hope that maybe Toronto loses one of the next two. I wonder if that's what if I don't put money on a strategy that they took that would be it. But I do know that duke has been dealing with something and people roll their eyes at that but you know when you get injured the first game of the season and it forces you to play. I think it's only four of the eight games in the first month. You know it's it's not. It is not anything that is. Eye rolling worthy in my opinion. While if that's the case and you could be right now he's obviously he says he's you know going back earlier he's deal was something I am I mean I have. Yeah I mean I I have been told that he's been dale it's still is nothing serious that he can't play if he really pushed it. But it's obviously serious enough to cause the missile was a critical game there in Brooklyn as you pointed out at today's game. Actuary for the playoffs just in and of itself as he gonna be able hold up over seven game series play every other tighten it's it's something snagging them to that extreme. It's it's there it's gonna be here throughout the series will be played there not sell throw battle solvency to recruit and losing Brenda Carlton if we don't know along true. But I think that today's decision and again on CNN it's only. Wit with the knowledge that I Knoll. Tuukka has been Dylan something. Not I think today's strategy. Was more of a group decision. I I feel that way she you know all the bodies that they were mentioned. Nolan that they're playing the best team in the league I understand it's easy to get worked up about all playoff implications and you want it yet they wanna play Ottawa to end and they put their best foot forward to be able to play Ottawa in the first round. But that said. They knew they were thrown into this game they warn not gonna put their best foot forward because you missed in net leading goal scorer and in this and another couple key pieces in a char. So I mean. I have to. Us in the game yet to catch you off I'm not surprised Washington put. Their best foot forward today other than well they have ruled out they have hope they get my whole beat them but let's get in the full they were out there you read it and it art they were trying to send a message I think early. Well we'll while we take W guys out. For the series possibly starts Wednesday authors what's the message there no I mean I'm looking back on they wanna play the Bruins in the first round like apple. I don't know they were caught a plane again and I know it and they want it and and you wanna watch more than I did because I had a shell go on I was watching the masters we were doing some red sock your view. But from what I saw. You know outshot hoping I'll play in the capitals who play in this game in the finished in jacks you now mocking. Like a team that wanted to play this Bruins team in the first round of the plant. Was beaten and online zero. Nine times Euro yen close the last series they played which is it's a long time you know what when he eleven or whatever was that the seven gamer rear admiral sits in now. Russia Boston for a nicely done lets anybody that. That is the game actually tap ramadi has gone so the only kick me face out exit Jane let the city comes in real at a guy you know like any hey this isn't the first time we've gone. Nine and not at all Indiana you know little little reunion little exactly little little catch a reunion and we all or psyched about the proms are. Issues the Bruins I should prompt is you called this a couple weeks ago when the chips are down admiral you still had faith he thought they were gonna get in the have a me to have their dollar economies. Should. I don't give you may props audit and much credit but this in this case I do they they want six and wrote again in our you feel like they're a dangerous team as they head into the play out when they get martian accompanied back. I would help a lot better of them butterball open had to know last two with a defensemen I mean hundreds anything anomaly in the groove probably not be in the first round. Palo probably got a concussion that it lets face of these Magnus out of the boards and come back maybe precautionary but it did look like a good hit. I mean that's often means with a BC and act of what we thought we weren't gonna see him because a regular season ended but. I don't know him I got a couple of games of Providence they might get desperate and all we hear is how did that it is on the big stage what was the big stage of the NHL playoffs they might from doubles I think to be great. Pretty good story I wonder if they'll direct you to do that is still a grizzly in no Garrett I would guys that adapter I would analysts yeah I mean. It's yes one person they see he's ready and other presidencies and close I don't know I haven't seen him I'm not gonna pretend you know but. If if not you know it's going to be tough that's you know Cowell had been struggling quite a bit lately I think he hit the rookie wall and was competitive climate over. Crucially huge loss its he's he really had a great season agree it's a lose him it's it's a huge blow man I mean. You know you can see on the power play it is they miss him big time sooner than last couple games they've been. In the struggle and it is an Indy defense was the big issue going through the area and it in and you know they you should tip it's yet to be captain because they really did a pretty good job considering. You know the talent level and how you know how good they did he just played agree DT defense not of spectacular bulk of but guilty do the job they play solid hockey. But you know you lose like a guy that cal what two guys of that caliber and you know obviously breaks it makes everything now levels so. Now man not a good way to be going to be about a whole Toronto. Keeps his keeps the dramatics comfortably generously with Toronto they may well go to. Guys they've while they play Pittsburg. Tonight right right and and a point Columbus tomorrow correct. It's looking like Columbus is probably not gonna. It didn't Columbus. Isn't gonna bring. Except for the fact they've lost six in a role in need this sort of pat you know. Get that bad taste out of their mouth and and just try to right the ship the Padilla but I Crosby's play tonight but there are a lot of other penguins that are not so beaten half their lineup is in. I think Toronto wins tonight I think it's an economic gain tomorrow it'll be it'll be Toronto needing a point tomorrow against Columbus at least in overtime appearance. The past Boston play out round one which it's hard to predict. Release are young team they're way ahead of schedule anyway so. Exactly and you know they had a couple opportunities earlier this week to steal things and could do it in you know and only apparently caught popular refrain is not in a playful but. A tie yeah I sailed ten teams that there have corn corn up and play funny love nothing more than a spoil another team's season. You know we got guys like they always say trying to offer rolls next year trying to hit centers outside the bank eyes are gonna play you know that you know did you know behind the HL I mean. You know teams errors it seems the playoff shall look kind of like lolly gag through the motions but the team do you think I'm on the plate for the ones that go off the likely sport. Jump on Alicea on Saturday skates excellent 77797937. What got the Bruins back in and what do you make of the chances here as they do handy and without looks like. According to a gate guard to recruit likely for the first round we'll see about Carlo. The rest of the team. You know if they get our ship back. Which they will they are expected to in game one lines will fill out a little bit nicer sell the team that you saw the last the if you seen last couple games is it's obvious again be dramatically different from. When they get out there on the ice and rom one but it is the capitals. They are loaded and that includes the use Kevin Chad Kirk Lippold what it today we talked a lot about him at the trade deadline guys and to the Bruins obviously were interest and a pain in the high price. First round pick. Conditional second round pick in two players. But he's hoping to see the difference maker and he's. What it grows the love to have him now know Whitman but the mention any. Healthy defense that at this point with Krugman Carlo out that the any any bitter regret the dating to laughter. Chat anchored in Washington paid the price on him a couple Arctic. Now because they're a much better position to kind of golfer at all and they clearly did that if he has every single had let retains a part in jockey said they traded form. And abroad is on quite a it's all for the Burleson to kind of mortgage dot much of the future full a guy who's gonna bring you from middle of pacts on. Closer to a contender but not quite not it's not worth it I mean you know Washington gave up a lot Foreman the pro always have some great prospects and and I don't know that bring in Jack Corcoran got an obvious he would make the more dangerous but is gonna make them one of the top even three contenders in the east I don't banks also. You know it's it's one of those let's just you know role we got in and until we have. Yeah I think that leads to the other question we discard Bruins team when they didn't do something like that a deadline and it's like I even went some of the stuff they deal with let's say. Crew was LP let's say Colin Garrett today. And let's say blushing and didn't get suspended he finds a way to put in a goal insomnia night nailed a three seat plane senators in the first round. What would be a successful season for the Bruins. And I guess I look at it and I go all you know what just the fact that they got it from made us successful what I look at is next year. Which you can't bring Mac blowing up you know JFK. You know who knows who else is part of this team next year but what I wanna see this year is possibly knock Spooner. Fallen Milla follow the young kids much are you get them some playoff experience even averaged just one round. And to me that's a successful season for the Bruins and then next year you roll into it. Maybe you have a back up that can win more than one game of the first four months of the season. Don't look at a division winner and you look at a team this time around next year that has more experience on the Blue Line that might want the favorites to win at all I mean you have to go. I don't people have crush me for going back the first four months and using that to defend to grass but. This that is amazing to me win your first. 186. Wins to add 25 of those winds to the first four months you any production audio backup goalie. The division this year that's deploy and and the I would feel about the team that I mean I think next year at this time they can win the division. And it they might be a team that that is one of the favorites to to win the Stanley Cup with some of the depth they have up the middle. And with the goaltender who I still think is one of the best in the league into grass so to maybe expectations this year a little bit different right now based on how they finished. Based on the young kids that they have any organization. But get them the playoff experience and it's it's a success may. Just to get in. If they win a series a joke I say what joke mean I. But if they won one it's a it's a bonus from. You know what I agree with you sitting here now but they get swept by the capitals in Ottawa gets past Toronto around one you're gonna be it's going to be hard to say that it's two weeks right you're gonna be sand. I Ottawa team is not that good the Bruins. Could should have played Ottawa from one could have beat them then they're on a route to play in the Canadian hustle the like Danny this out of a great series. I guess Claude Julien and his new team so I think you're right though it is the success but it's going to be tough to say that they get swept in four games like capitals. Yeah I mean anything out if they Wear pebble so when the first round editing app that is gravy means of the first from playoff. When would be huge here I I expect them to become a third to division that's premature predicted and obviously in the playoffs the review gonna be dad all of them. The second while god shall I mean as a full point as basic no difference between the two of them. You know I I don't hold that adult again elephant with a gonna play Ottawa. They should be don't I mean did I don't hinted that he did have much success in the regular season but they're Derek. But at that not a great team they've you know at the plate applauds violent rely on radios and a lot but. You know if they were to get swept by Washington I mean. It up they lose. Four games by a collective five goals is that you know Hussein is out of its unsuccessful things sometimes I mean. You know I've seen some fighting series over the years being that some bad some of the more entertaining series and you know three or four games go to all the time and they can go either way so unique he can just log they lose in five games it's it's a bust because you know a lot of those games go shall. And Ohio is a lot to be determined I think I didn't Iran does not only when one of the next two games they still think the bronze in Plano or. We get out your Dana let me ask you this if indeed date. The organization views it that way too is this is a great it's a success for an even though the owner said he expects a deep playoff run and I probably deep down he's thrilled they got into the playoffs are a couple of gates saw. Do they make any dramatic changes with the core now that they're in now they they showed under castigated wants six in a row. Char still got a little bit in him you know it's not. Recorders or tanks still great defensively the PK whatever or my embarks next jets are yet as his price goes down creaky compliant. I mean all Rask greats he's the same corkum struck back out again next year no matter of one. I mean everybody's got a price. I mean. What does somebody offered for preaching what somebody offered for Zdeno Chara and he knows things need to be considered idled that you look at it and say. The entire teams untouchable. But I think if you are gonna. You know take a step to Lloyd's we needed to rebuild our line we didn't do it the way that maybe we should of I mean I shall go back to the way they lost boy chuck and Hamilton for draft picks and he dated retool the Blue Line. It the way they each the way they should of and now you've committed to the kids it seems and with the injuries all of mellow they like in an odd is going to be playing in the playoffs I'd love to see that. Ran and follow we mention Mac Voight. It's a nice little ritual with the Blue Line I would think that you want to keep you know if there's a way to get a talk for veteran defenseman. In the off season. Right then then I'll have to me you have to have that discussion with another team but if that's not available to yet. I think the acquisition you look at our McIlroy. You know the acquisition you look at may be used as she what you have with adult and I know he was pretty good down the stretch. And now people are doctors say they wanted to see in the number lie GNU is he's not number one and in fact the most of the season he was a brutal on the two. Posted a smoke and dust so I am just a brutal plummets so. If you can get a goalie a backup goalie that can win Wimbledon one game in the first months of the season you win the division. You win the division and soul when it comes to offseason moves to keep the keep the band together keep the boys together. Every man's gotta gotta priced you have to listen. But for the most part of the the acquisitions they make. Get McIlroy up and and get yelled gold it's like she's insane and I. We got the young kids playoff experience and I think already to attempt battle Montreal. And maybe even auto and actually a for the division title. DP thanks for second overtime half of admirals paycheck is coming your way at the end of the shelves are you ready for that we appreciate it this Saturday schedules sports rated a B I present about wise snacks AT&T also bring you to TO. And admiral you and I stick around Tai Anderson to check in from the guard industry gets out of the end of the I'm losing. It's not demoralized. Rumor there also could effect that. You could have a negative guys now are not at all I mean I think Kate I agree it is this is the successor India's playoff hockey come Wednesday or Thursday to let us know what you think what got a chance they have. What got to back your what got the Bruins it'll take your phone bills next six or 77797937. Saturday skate. It's hi Anderson in the mix here shortly from TD garden Kaliningrad Reuters studio at the Sports Radio to be I complex time admiral for our cheese doodles extreme player that we brought to my wise snacks were forced to be. Forced to be optimistic. With the pros and possibly which course there's the playoffs the Al record sure we're part usher who they will face in round one to be Washington could be Ottawa that will be determined by Toronto and how they perform here in the final two games of the regular season. Throws the Pittsburgh tonight. And Columbus tomorrow the three out of a possible four points to pass the Bruins. Otherwise the bees will play Ottawa but. This week as we last spoke admiral the when we were on last Saturday right after the Florida win the fight to win. Eight. Unexpectedly to be went to Chicago picked up a 32 win and it dates night game at 1230 game forty once say it's on delta and I picked it opened. Eight weeks at a tense on says the dog and with this week that was an unbelievable performance I did not expect to points for that back to back they got at that. Really when you look back on it was big win as any in the stretch. Obviously Tuesday's win over Tampa was huge as well special Marcia Angell out of the game they kill off the five minute major penalty and that they get four goals and Allen and you know Drew Stafford Kimmel live this week he scored a goal in Tampa when he scored the only goal in the Ottawa overtime loss which got them point. So I guess I'll go staffers went player of the week. Front you buy cheese doodles who we got. Odd look on with wood to audio boyhood build a night I think they'll win a lot of people didn't expect him to get that spot against Chicago. I stood in his head he was unbelievable at that game like he went six narrowed down the stretch so. He's a guy who eat like any dimension caddie come up bigger earlier in the to perhaps the Bruins will be about a position right now alas he didn't but. He he did come up big when a compass on an audience on Google this week. They get your t.'s total extreme players will be brought to my wife stacks hotter than 100 mile per hour slap shot to reach the show's 67779793. Said it's a weird season. Rask. On available in the win over the islanders. We lose big hubbub about it of course nobody comes in they get the win 21 marshy and goes out of the game with that growing spear. When it seemed like the worst possible time we need a win over Tampa clinch he Saudi missed two periods of the game five minute penalty they killed off so this team. Has its to its stars lay naked critical times of the season but the team rallies around one another they get the job done. I may be the end marshy and will be will be blamed for cost them a series against Ottawa and forcing them to have to play Washington around one. But he had a tremendous year otherwise Selby guys run pick them up a little bit and that's where you look at this Bruins teams say all right that they've got something they are little danger said the play out. Yeah absolutely I mean you know offensive blue note when their firearm or else also known as you know what they can do great she's up a proven playoff proforma. Shop cost and actually he seems like a tape if you don't give it to really have a raises leveled in the playoffs. Score is not the issue the goaltender is really not the issue I think. You know I think people wait like I mentioned go for the goaltender kind of break down all year and in Italy it they did it by committee well it certainly any should the stock. I don't erected Eminem a true number one on that defense anymore I mean jarrah is maybe he's a top tier guy but he's not the number one guy of fide musical for sure up. No they did it by committee but that's going to be did the real problem now again with the deal did he say and crew probably not going to be there for the first round. Frankly which some of our callers may. It jointly a lot of crew bashing the show throughout the year Daryn you know you don't agree with. Yeah he's out there it is by you know what I mean if you listen says it's enough of what we do and what checked Twitter or not you'll see. I mean everybody gets bashed its you know some rest and others but. Yeah I I don't know I don't know what people pick and a crew fought meaning that the guy plays well what what cotton balls like like you want he's obviously on the size he's going to be limited to what he can do physically his own and of course Shia. But he brings so much else to the table that you know in. And even that he he is undersized he still wasn't you know he still has worked on his game plan angles Morant play in the bawdy and a little bit born. You know he's he's he's he's dimmed the defenseman ma'am but you know people just gonna complain and people's comes to complain or ask in this town hall. Including our next scholar Fred New Hampshire I'm sure has got some a complaint said the policies of what's going on Freddie. It is nice guy knows what no icicle basketball today it we get to preempt at 730 is late. I've been. Jones in this. We are. The floor is yours very we run earlier last week. Yup. 3 o'clock they moves around yeah yes yeah bombs went to Simpson's. And anyway. These past they've gained you all night about it secondary school. I mean you can Nash. More walked Kevin Miller. Mean they stepped up and actually think this team deep into big time make it played like that. And but you know Tampa Bay that kill off a five minute major. In the crowd. Doesn't stand altogether. I'm wrong. Was dead there today Freddie looks like lifeless today. And you know why. We had not won eight okay. But you'd get to the shell you want to send this man is is the crowd. In this team wants to do it anyway. Crowded acted. They have. If any in this team that apple want I think I would like I don't stop and keep them don't want to beat people. Think you'll five minute penalty and no heavy stock split but the whole crowd should at the end. Why are you with the rank Freddie was less than you were down. It's been awhile. But is this situation is that this way and not do it but anyway. You know what he says. Content did not column that. Group now now now out oh how yes Carla said he. Matt is ten. Might you didn't smack at it from texting smacked it. If anything been done about every now and tripped and smack talking he went down markets but nothing could be done but that is the. Well it's the death penalty of the game it's I was interest and thanks the call for him to get some it's the wanna get in their Cassie against the a little shot at the rats after the game. Would you think of it it was he hooked it a little bit enough that knocked him off balance going into the wall that's gonna sneaky like the ice is its most plays way it could have been it probably should have been a penalty and. An F five hopeful for example of poker brat hush didn't it most certainly would have been a penalty I think. All bets in the heat it's it's you know it's a it's not a superstar league the NBA has but. You know you see Crosby gets away or allied. Real I don't bats and he's got to win a lot of over the years he's not I don't think he's dirty use credit cards Canada's notable behind the scenes stuff but. Well that's as a track record he's had some pretty dirty it's all so he does it hits and he still stick indicate he is big right armed. It one of those slip acclaim and it's is you know eighties one -- I got a hockey play in a raffle would've would've blown the whistle but yeah I was part of a little bit of a spot treatment yet. You don't marshy and got a little star treatment early in the year we thought he was getting some respect you remember he had coupled the width of borderline DeWitt to review he got away without it. It was impossible that that was soul. Visual but just. But that's the Tampa situation he had a black a couple of games services don't get around that. All of us via the speed yet and in Mike and I did people caught Kupchak like that that's not a Kupchak like first I mean I was SSP airmen were wherever. He landed him and I don't think eat. Necessary neck he meant to get an entity got their pretty square in the colonies but. He was scored a spare me the way I mean whether he Cohen solely Pollock Claude and they are not as a relevant he he spit the guy pretty bad weather in the belly button below. So that's just a bad day he either way and such an undisciplined penalty minutes. I think I did have I think his defiance of the passcodes is because he's just keep it in my shine you know like. You know I don't gay you don't like gets its TSE economy like Dan and I mean you know I get it is yet. You know you gonna take that mentality and beat out of five army but you know it was it was done I mean he. Does apple like a scholar at dom but you know it was a dumb penalty dot dump time that yet. May hypothetically of cost about a. Playoff position while if he is the capitals they got a couple guys including Tom Wilson whose son in action today Colin Miller put a good hit on him. It was at eagle came over and and boredom and got. Apparently fortune got five get through. And that Wilson went back at it if it's capitals and Bruins you'll you'll see some physical stuff that'll be a good series from that story like pointed at I wonder what martians like coming off the suspension. Capital saw the brewers today without margin in a way that could sort of law all the asleep going into game one of that series and that's what didn't have the I thought I would imagine marshy it is just that shot out of a cannon he is ready to go in game one. And it's going to be you know I was hair on fire and it in that game. Yeah I want that are gonna forget about these are you know an MVP candidate who. May have finished in the top three escorted via if you didn't you know have that spirit incident but right gusts of before Eagles season and today that show. But nobody watches are gonna anywhere awhile lives when he did today and they certainly didn't look while the ability available wild and it was liberal ones and I think that. He'll the last couple games they'd didn't have that the Spotify with particular Zdeno a lot of fight about I big advantages that a little bit of an exhale left them you know kind of almost play in must win games for. Although we will six and they were they 61 in and yell through before that there look essentially all must win games are lost or pretty close shall. I did was they they clinched a playoff spot they let they got down a little bit. Haven't said that you know. Yeah Marcia and he should come all fired up I mean after up against spent enough to put his team in a bad spot yeah I mean put that seemly faculty yeah and I think he's gonna do it anyways I mean he's been dynamic he's been such good play on here I mean he was unique kind of picked up back up apple a little bit of a dip. Are so he's simply admiral playing great before the suspension it's alive I yeah I would expect them just picked right picked out right up and he shoot enemies he was did the best offensive player on this on the team this year by fox. And I eighties that he do that to give my a chance regardless who they play too. Other points by for a New Hampshire one secondary scoring. Does this seem have or not. That final stats for the Bruins this year they had 910 goal scores okay. Martian 39 goals postured actress with 34. Crate she 23 Bergeron point wants it both at one Eagles seasons. That is a big drop off you'd doubts as Spooner and Dominic Moore both had eleven Chara in Frankfurt Toronto had ten. But Fred's right this week it was Stafford some big goals yet. The game winning goal Chicago was Kevin Miller the slight stumble for whoever else on that Kevin was unbelievable the great shot. Spiller had a goal in which got the game was a tip but yes and had a great season but he it was a big one but Sharia the breakaway goal last week to start the win over Florida. So they have had a bit or secondary scoring although the last two games they world noble one goal. You know each cell. I guess that would marching it was back and get the lines the way they want them they can spin it back to a couple of games and don't say we that's a better balanced scoring over the last two weeks. Immediately you're sitting at nine guys a double digit goals my ass and close to 4230. Goal scorers to twenty goal scorers back as you know is gonna end but seventeen that's only almost caught tunnels rocket about its when he. Yet Bryant's borrowed Dominic Moore those those guys are sport probation and a few locals out of the ship meal eleven goals. Think he should probably get between fifteen and twenty but you know who thought more was gonna get eleven this year. To Ciara chip they'll attend I think they got pretty pretty decent depth that it's not the best but. Basically you know the general to a solid front you know to shell lines and that's fourth line's been great lately you know that asks the Nash and at cherry. I'm dog mauled to talk more line that's that's been rolled pretty well lately shall basis that there are lines that almost that weakness right now and you know sometimes detective and a playoff content just kind of turn over to leave the old. Yeah team they play is gonna focus so much on the top two lines that of their environment you know what his salary and god knows what they're gonna do was Pulaski Stein isn't that reveals the show up to play it exactly ya you don't wanna be like you know what that the top two lines sadly it counted in this. I mean it's fun to allow open about it that it big twelve gauge being off at Sony faux. The third mind whoever. Cassie decides to use on it could step up and you know actually make of that I mean somewhat of a difference. You know it's a lot of time to see it would. Playoffs come around it and a guy like you only see blessed you've got and had a rough year did delighted it's a lot of times they they wipe out they do with the AJD drew. Like a Grand Slam lately kind of wipe out a bad deal once one. I will talk about some of the young guys suffer before back to Carlson got a lineup made his NHL debut. Broad persona his totals today will we see him again in the post season one about Mac avoid 617 sevenths and 97937. Its hi Anderson joins TD garden. Can't Lederer admirals Saturday skate Sports Radio that he. Ten Boston Bruins played their first NHL game this season and then the tenth was Jacob forced back a Carlson. With Boston University a couple weeks ago as twenty years old. Data out there any played a whopping eight minutes and 45 seconds they rear admiral wasn't they signature shelling and a sense he had a couple face us that sit in relief. Stand out to be much. But just back that he got in their pretty cool CM. Noble political local guy has successfully stay it local college guy as success in it you wonder. Whether Charlie Mack was going to be called up here in the post season now a couple of injuries not much clarity on Brandi Carlisle who left the game with the upper body injury looked like concussion. With a hit on from a desk in a period number one. And our date card says forget about to recruit in round one he's likely outlook the right knee injury for the whole series solar thin back there. Would you got a Mac voice in how about forced back to Carlson widget would each seat today do you think you'll see more of going forward here. I fought back a Collison from what I've you know read on prospect reports stuff he's not particularly flashy guy east you know woman that comparison. Will be total troop. To bigger and maybe use in this cup or trees spurs were on the style he plays or whatever but yet he needed really stand out today and our coaches you know he only played eight minutes I. I think today was just kind of frolicking out there and give get me to get some nerves out a way form now that first game and it's our league game but that was a while must win for the Bruins it was you know it was a boring game wasn't really a particularly exciting game. So you know to expecting kids are really do much of anything when the rest of his team really wasn't. Did too excited to watch I I don't I kind of puts a little bit of apart little bit of pressure on I figure you know we'll see more more of him and has as we do will seal a little bit more of what he can do. But yeah I would make anybody snap judgments on the kid and eight in eight minutes and 25 seconds of the game wears. Teammates look like it would've been rapist was some way have been rather idea that rather have been somewhere else the most began. As pro am sorry god smacked a boy Yani and that's the million dollar question right now like I said at. When we had an active role last week and he seemed to think you know McIlroy who's ready I know some other people who watch amount of Providence. Don't seem to think he isn't I don't you know I who knows what the draws attention. You know I don't yet know some people don't wanna bring that game right now for the energy level but it's like costs. You re gonna worry about potentially the half a million ball is a main involves privacy she is now wide right. Yeah of the three years and Alex gets paid quick ball the ball but he's the idea so that every year it gets paid more Jack Soviet tie him and he still you know what he's won it close and unrestricted which. You know what Mike. But don't act but actually he's not even see they still have his rights in Italy's police set right is currently forty years to correct or indeed the restricted free agent a year ago but it'll just be held at he'll get quicker to restrict the free agency in and make it more cash write it directly at a cost them some money down alignment its like. I don't think that's reason enough not you don't put the cattle there I understand you know the financial ramifications but. Him is that that if you need immediate exactly I mean if you're that age desperate and B think the kids ready. Roll hall yeah I mean and he's ready then you'll look great you look like oh you look like OK you made the right call if he's not so well lit up the only guy you know did little stake if he picked it turns out to be a sudden. You know he he makes great money restricted by the you know he's gonna make it anyways and I don't I just I just take a like worry five years now whine about potential. You don't muddy package might make you beat him at the cost of possibly the team now mean there's only while way to see if the kid is NHL ready and that's that's from all the. What here's the quote from last night where. Puts Cassie went down to Providence to watch the baby grows play last night Kevin dean the coach down their. Was asked how Mac of what looked after the game he said. Got him to present a couple times but didn't see him leaking oil in terms of closing in separating defending down low he held his own when he gets the puck on the stick it generally gets out of zone. I'd love to be a sediment he's on the ice he gave you the pocket full stride. So there's a guy. In the mold at least have to recruit that could spark some offense and Alaska Wii games without crew that was the game and a half they've missed. Yes and I mean I I wouldn't surprise me if they plug the kid radiant and it'll no one in the NHL seen him play in the NHL yet so that his element the surprised at. I mean he if he's as talented as well as we Arendt and like I said yell all we hear is that when that when the games on line this kid raises his level the you know he answers the call in the when the you know everything's on the lateral marbles on the line and he's like he did them to be you didn't win but screw that big goal he's. He shows up in big games and you know like I said has done does not a bigger than the NHL playoffs saw. If this kid is is that type of player now although he should private that vibe and he should you know he should want the park. And you know sometimes ignorance is Palestinian you know. Let's say who's been disappointing as a young guy any into the post season Frankfurt Toronto yes to date. Five minutes of final fight ice time. I forced back a couple sitting at 845 was like next lowest so you're you look at somebody barely played today. He's he's obviously in Cassie cdy council will but he hasn't scan me he was injured for four games he missed a little time there but before. He hasn't scored since February 26. This is a guy you are count on for some depth scoring it just has not been there is dried up he was hot for awhile and then. Bob it's often. Yeah he hasn't done anything he's he's kind of look like a one trick pony right now on this roster doesn't need any one trick ponies because. You know you got to do more than that yummy if he just going up and down of the wing and just snapping off I mean he does again only this is shot is NHL caliber but. You have to do more than that you have to you know you have to engage physically ought covered defensively and he's he's still are he's still learn his game we still young but. I don't know I don't know if they may be better of Iraq phone you know caught up out of brass from Providence and got back has been on fire. See what he has a mean if he's if he can bring a little more get to the game of the trial and throw in a market because they're trying to auto all these brave you know and and I don't even Ovie and his seven minutes that NATO with what we've seen of him lately right David he started with Krejci impostor night but also like a played with with that players he's just in Seattle one assists and swath from march 6 though now he's got one assistant a ball I think it was able fifteen games a so so. That's really it's not gonna be you're not doing federal for the team all they don't. I tie Anderson's out liberals locker Liggett his thoughts. See what he who we talked to a Stephen discounts he was in there yuk it up one million. Patriots Tom Brady was at the game yeah I already getting it right all he's you know I mean it's funny how assaults such likes look at vehement assault scheme event in Boston. And the draw is maybe they were all spot to be a little while the playoffs but the other don't have that right if you look at me I'm at this in fact but it bugged out of it's it was going to be a game three with the boroughs like the playoff return to TD garden they down 20 what's the applause what's it was to be near Tuesday night. DC flip a switch like yeah pretty New Hampshire was say no no atmosphere today in the other night. The building will be ready to thinks it out of Georgia even whether they opt to load balanced who all won one whenever I mean him you know may be alone services have been down regardless who they play but not have. 13 of all Bruins fans playoff time and they answered the bell this savages stated they spotted you know the penalty box the greatest Bob the north stock. All those places there are there early they get tired Taiwan on whether it's a Monday night or Saturday they'll be loud they'll be ready and they'll be rock and roll and. Tai Anderson joins us Ken their rear admiral Saturday skate Sports Radio WV. It's either the capitals of the senators around one for the Bruins. First time back here after a two year absence for stunt its 4014 to get a little playoff action will be Wednesday or Thursday night on the road. Senators have had eight straight road series in the playoffs for somebody to be hosting. For a long time since 2007 I think they hosted a series against the penguins make a case for Reno admiral. That you would rather play top seeded Washington in round one in Ottawa is there any discussion any debate here whatsoever which rather play auto or washing. I mean Ottawa and Washington is so stacked look you only pay rent for the league this year and it obviously the best team on paper on what they've done this year. I'm haven't said that you know a team like that it's just saying you know Bruins went brass stands in his head they steal two games in DC. All of a sudden all those ghosts from DC passers they creeped out and on these worries comes as an old Barry tried to try to put a put that story to bed. Would just press conference sustain you although that team has nothing to do it as you know that's not us Bob Bob Bob but it's like well. You have connective tissue with it to those teams and it's not just like a third a third line are all like us. The third period the units of it just dies you know yes stocks have been on these teams and of joked I mean no match can has a history. I'm not going far in the playoffs and and it's the capitals but he's there he's been the face of the capitals for a a ten years now have a cell. You know that that's that's a pile of their persona that's the capitals they they don't do we get a Donna playoffs and it's only do that's going to be it is so. The Bruins yet it would need to get an early jump I got to play the capitals. I and then they they like it and it adds a little bit but yeah man Tuukka Rask can steal a series it's. It's these 20 probably if there are the two best goalies in the league every Carey Price obvious he is in the head do nick and broad brush yet it would gold could. Seasons but. Talking like the last say five years I mean. Real raskin Braden hoping it probably two of the best three goalies in the also Craig Anderson presents much of a more appealing challenge because he is true is just the records that show like let's go back short time growing as well Craig can go to little trivia how short. I he didn't even play game he dressed he dressed he actually was a backup on couple game I think two with three games he backed up but I mean he was on a roster was like. One of these emergency backups but we had on Spitzer was this week that Zia capitalists and noses. As you build what Whitney building nodal Whitney was on no we had this kid is Ericsson assemble askew is named as you'll know what does it. Well you don't open up in the NHL SI say our. Goalie gets sick or an appendectomy or his wife that goes into labor and they have the you know bring them back up up for more of a lawsuit to file they can't of their backup image grab a local college kid or something and he becomes emergency back up ball. They use you don't get in the game it did happen earlier in Carolina. What their equipment guy he get in just leave for the bench and it pulled goalie. Well this kid's a boy as he voted for Chicago he aren't gonna which he was emergency back for the Blackhawks back in the samba. Didn't get in the game but the Blackhawks and that a plane and his wife a four game begin mile Blackhawks equipment mapped goalie mask everything. Sold the same thing happened reason he was in Philly so what happened when the black Marshall plan of Philly will be out the other days some have with the flyers back up. And then what's his face annoyed worth it took entity during the game they had a take on the Eiffel this kid in that up haven't addressed. Become the emergency back up with 24 seconds left packs all put Jamal yeah. Just to get a minister that you know but dubbed the row eskimo mennesses no you can't do it as he was the second emergency back up and I guess she he couldn't eat. Wasn't supposed to come in the game a less the goalie was actually hurt. The coaches you know just try to give the kid a memory which is cool but the rest like put the kibosh on it. But he had a really great story don't mean this ecology he didn't play division when he played clubs hockey. And he says he's in the Roman and they are they are orchard adamant. And it so the second game but he played for the flyers he had all Chicago Blackhawks weapons of it would get all over that they have the equipment it was it was pretty funny was a real really good kids WD interview some different similar. A story out scientist got the job DG been at WB I dot company was spent sort of similar long story that we tied joins us now from TD garden is going on Tyrus. What's the mood in the room two losses in a row going into the post season but it's a very anomalous. Shake our right that's certain not to do that. And it did not trickle down there at Torrey situations where. You don't you like economic power output and they log in give it called let you know that they're shortly Don. There's the whole affects things of that nature and I think it's parliament that any means you mentally ready to the playoffs. Odds are that it seems Catholic they want to avoid any further damage or injury or any of that nonsense that they had the game and so I I did. They're ready to go big on the captives and not gonna is gonna lose that he should do it in the filed an area. Any update at all and Brandon Carr lower at Indian tell you could do it could glean. You know from from your own sources. I'm not in the upper body see you know supper but it is glorified it is today and Iraq and finding out and ask anybody and I didn't it looked like you in the head injury battle on our current concussion and let nature but. It would be surprising that is what it turned out to sea but you knock your upper body. It like that you know like ally I was it was worthy of at least you need get a kick her fired as well. Wasn't a fan of of a badge and colliding. At his head in to be little bored there. Odd then that intentional I eat airport pain believe that it was intentional. Doping that it is a penalty worthy as a very elite. So idea Dick that we we see Mac O Boyle why that's seems to be the million dollar question right now with allusion to defense in the last couple games. Not I somewhat ridiculous because. You're not you're not occurred and Carla figures expert Asians should change and quicker way. So it my opinions outward and because you know I like losing it you're fighting and looting here. And are importing capital might well I don't think it worked that I don't think that that he want act goes into red wrap. So I still wouldn't you at the same time I don't really ought to play Joseph moral and help its scratch. Now because you're simply too much rust on it weighed. Those poor decision but still I I would make I don't think you want I'm unleashed its and hackable or just yet. It didn't seem like Hewitt who engaged today announced he is taken they just got I don't complacent the correct word but after they got the playoff bid. They kind of just relax a little bit they they kind of way able exhale are the kind of plane must win games and so on that that I feel like you seem to you today it's I. I think I think that apple comes out are expected it like at you like about here now or so hard he won our next week. That. A little bit or from the apple are academic and Bobby are about her off early. At some what I want to pop a cap back that he wrecked Arlo went eagle wreck Colin Miller when he argued each week and speaking aboard. At a when I wanted to give the Bruins get emotionally involved especially. Ordered play in the first round and an eclectic apple really took advantage of them are eager. Apparently there are pop but never looked back up. What's so what are the lines look like when the it's for game one time and I obviously marsh is back you'd expect he would Bergeron together creature impostor like have been together what like I guess the third line to be the money line Newt. Who's in who's out the Toronto point five minutes of final five today. Yeah that's sort of at the big questioner. The third line and a weight become what I'd go with it or edit out. Greg Anderson it was a minus three eat eat quite quite a bit it. That trial out is that we get it a few minutes or pocket call and we played a little bit as well you don't think you're getting in the air release so. I do think that that third line is we're going to be cup become a fourth line and I think you can expect for Toronto lunar and Lackey. And then your fourth on an idiot Sharia or our running back Dominic Moore and those guys will end up like more minutes. That's been the airline well but it is an issue because it's equity capped the secondary scoring and that rely on the guys that are. It beauty response on the net and enters the player I'll call out it's like you can't do so they're there and figure it occurred at the trauma that. And upper what they are. Banking on the Euro at some point is that lunar orbit charmer and nickel temperature here cold you're gonna become that go to our line we haven't seen. We're running out partner. I'm one what to incite any whispers about. The birthday boy and his New York comment. So any time soon. There are going to be signing artists I don't know he curled right in America. You would be more ready and what are also. It's just a lock certain job right and such clout on the that have been generated ago. I would cry entered what was I don't know if it's something pat. Is it realistic to expect but given what we did sparkle that third line or it could be a picture that may keep an eight player trade secrets that. Voter trot out. You have a bit more about and that's sort of what they need it if they're gonna be capitals are there and I need to compete with auto by those in the auto immediate goal. It was not good you fork and it's not clear that defensive shell they play so well. So your score and it's not coming from your current library now Nagy expect I think a lot app. If you're open as the Bruins say it's either it's a ten was our help tonight in the beat Toronto if you wanna if you want the Bruins and Ottawa. You're the scratches for the penguins' Matt Murray is getting Malkin Patrick court was Karl hagel of Bryan rust Chris kudos to the needle Brian doable and still others that they look like they're ready to play tonight. Looks like Toronto win tonight I mean. What what kind of odds you give them the Bruins right now for forgetting a series of Ottawa. You know watching him get dot big of an assortment tagged in general in this game I mean elite they're gonna leave for it really say. I think the pressure on this scheme so in the inherent pressure well and a damper. So. There's a chance there Pradesh is if he if they went tonight. I think that good night and you're your take on the app for rob and Blue Jackets are produced and dismal lately. I know that parliament. I don't particularly when he ran into is so. I think you're you're the biggest pregnant camera world and I. That he would vote track it may be negative or architecture member Q you know doormat Ernie Boch market where a couple of the world so so maybe it still on their. Birds that look good actor birds and no doubt. How about so big biggest storyline if it's. Boston Ottawa biggest storyline of this Boston Washington what it would you be right about this week. Oh big storyline that the captain prequel. Sort of here sort I've talked or before and you've been airtight Eric for his entire career. The only thing those that constantly score goals on the here and we are also under one. Thirteen where he got that bird for so long but not quite thirteenth last year I was gonna. And they want it Menem winning that series so he ate it got finally start eating habits aren't are great for. So technical watch. It's tender figure out how to beat the speakerphone trap without Torre group. He has served at the Antarctic are strong first half our own. He greeted with a with a look at the offense which is a deliberate effort that's when they are practiced and turn their back and so. If they don't have group pert near Ottawa at felt major trouble something here you got like I'll not step up and play remote. Hockey career what you got a lot or haven't you. It's not nice to join as a federal psyche next Sunday Sunday's 8:8 AM sharp though. Barbaric Erica your arm absolutely CNN's. Margaret. Tonight I thought he would've said Doug. Butch Cassidy get revenge against Washington I thought that would have been his or nine. That's all I don't 120 has not yet to about that a hundred years ago public enemy intensity gap to Tampa Bay regardless of whether it they get the playoffs not what they pulled off at the trading. You know true middle six forwards in the base it and number one goalie is. Not the short of impressive for its ultimate stamp goes on for a that's exactly and it got kind of volume that the idea is to play a distillation demands that he had no stamp post notes island Johnson. And then big trade three guys and they go on on on a run like this'll become so whether they get an an audit side yet ticket caps are daily are they in the islanders don't around yes yeah slight chance yeah and you know what he said don't. Rod though young team has a lot of pressure and yell Pittsburgh's not gonna lean on I mean all those guys are lineup but. Ilya replace what kids who gonna try to impress Marc-Andre flurries not Iraq but the school you know. The B interest and. A zero quickly Dickerson Chelsea in the phones are able to. One ties points about playing against the neutral zone trapping missing to recruit. They're more likely to dress Mac oval if they play Ottawa. That if they played capitals now if your client if you play the capitals he wants EU wants to veterans season defenseman back there. It's Ottawa needs somebody to the boss threw a zone trap I I would give back a voice shot. I think departing every guy opposites who did it again I'm you know if they don't bring him up they gonna bring about jobs to begin any Iraq against big enemies defenseman. Chris sells its Saturday's games the lakers. Boy calorie egg great show as always thank the move your around the attic at it every. That it and whoever that where they got a lot of great thank you dot what the scene of the Bruin defense. That would surely got fired. They had he would support drafted northeastern Matt Bennett. Well and struck a fired. Betting. Upstairs guy. One across to admit it literally and then let spending go with him. On the player now that Benning played no games and it count went 3 for north eastern. Street Edmonton now is their top four in the top Ford. Like happens I go for nothing. Is respectable I understand that is beyond the debit in the organization though surely be Agile decree that. But the weight the draft pick another team that betting without clip plus ten and eat it up or shut down the stats in Edmonton. It has gotten to know one of the brewers. What a terrible job scouting Linda gaggle for nothing and now not to bite them in the rear and as players got to say about that. And so talkers it's interesting and the citizen interest in team not just from the surely. Angle but that just paint sort of like Toronto first time in a long time they're back in they could not on C economy David. Ali said the young talent all over the place now but yet again a local guy betting it's been playing and you wonder how they're gonna handle first round pretty tight. Conference over their two adult and I'm with a division. And I can unseat the significant and again it is complete San Jose in round one. Yeah I think just a little better jockey left to be done down the wild guides which will be determined in what what does he goes to what division but. Eyes are betting I mean you know I don't think he was of the biggest prospects in the business as but he was dropped a bit you know back in 2012. And yet sounds like denied of I don't maybe died of a favor because we was or whatever and yeah they're obviously. It should be piano a lot better than it looks like the Bruins thought so it looks you know immediately came back to haunt them. I don't maybe he just fitted with what the Edmonton was the one he just wanted to and that of their. I dizzy certainly wasn't ya I got you we heard about as much as other prospects around here I don't think the brought to particularly Iowa and yeah I mean maybe they just actually was Jim is uncle Jim Benning not satisfy the tentacles it was probably. There's I'm pleased to please the Bruins yeah I mean they've added drafted because of who we was so maybe. When the batting left to be made a little bit easy elect like all of them I mean he played a northeast which is hockey school it's you know it's not PUBC and yet we get some town about this so. The other part BD's part one of those guys that they they let go any of it up Caribbean I thought. While in the broad sense somebody defenseman in the system quote unquote prospect defense including a Garrett grizzly coop who could be the guys that are called up. Here to Philly and if indeed calls out for awhile will seats funny crosses another sort of veteran guys that played pretty well down their province solely they have some options but. For the matter who it is and it's going to be a bit of a gamble here into the postseason you wrote that he I dike on about the awards season my first thought when martian. Had via the not break there the good I think the buzz there goes the Hart trophy and it's gone. Not only from the sample and listened to was the two most critical games of the year but also just perception wise what's you're right they're probably gonna be left out of all the awards across the. Or less. I guess you could give Cassie some law but penalty and now all of a sample not to get Jack Adams consideration to a few games for us and I mean he may get voted to but he's not there when it. And it erode its its we usually think there's one or two like almost went away what is with the jacket as the this year it's kind of a lot of guys gonna do we expect them to there was no real like young up Stotts as you know any any coaches that. What with dad teams really. Did do what they spectacular don't dim Viles Molly's hobby be awful lot of taken a lead this year they didn't. But Mike Babcock he's I think he's gonna when the coach of the year I mean it's hard but it's in the playoffs nobody had them yet in this soon. And I think I think you'll see him get it he's obviously Toronto media in the broadcast his vote on Astro I I think it's on his to lose right now against Toronto doesn't play offs. Randall a little real quick here. Saturday's game was on renal. All of them want that argument that I knew that. Also get my question then is up the good and obviously not feeling well to be in what it's like. Why why it's brought sitting on the bench it. Quite easily the biggest industries that works in fact if you win you'll owe it all together. And and I don't know what marsh and you know today by. You know they destroyed we learn. And people pointed gave her a cult and it was going to be. Yet it's a fair point we touched on earlier in the show Randall thanks for the Colin. I agree it's perplexing cancel it. Danny brought up the shoot out order the other night was something he was scratching his head over to relating to crate she shot on in the shoot out. But what do we make harassed not obviously IBC's fighting something and they wanted to gimbal arrests have been depose. I take issue with caught the biggest game of the year and yet I that's that's it wasn't the big scheme India yachts they when they would avoid Washington but. I mean. To Adobe had won six in a row he'd been playing great Rask it's like OK let's get out number one some rest before the playoffs and aid. You know when do we know he's was wrong that cup which he was still have some irritation with whatever the lower body injuries this is what dot. I'm so yeah I had no issue and given the day off and look how they played I don't think it will win no matter who these are only those goals were to build its fault docile and Carla charter blown past. The ticked active their third goals a thing of beauty no no stop that's exactly it would end and that a look out of you liberals let him play well so it did it would need to matters rests out of today's sell. Because he ended it became anyways vetoes it and you know I don't what did the columns and what he was wasn't feel well but now we don't know what it's so weird message I would imagine a team like and this game doesn't matter all that much work. No sir because they had these based out of Chicago last week in that game went out that was at the time the biggest gave the governor bill would stop that so I don't think it sends a message to the team at all. I mean they had to the next game because it was a back to back situation this was different it's like there's no reason Rask if he's healthy wouldn't of played this game right. Now he's I'm sure it was all the again it was you know it's probably I would scandal a one game off we know it's not a must when we don't actually have to win this game. You don't brass may be his whatever his father and maybe it's not a just like OK I want an Ohio I don't wanna tax my goal he won one game. Especially you don't know what though the odds fluke injuries but what's happening you know would have approved maybe it's like you don't want an order wrist put in a multi. Some fluke he averages put Google didn't like in the lower on what afresh to pace of the game one where everyone while that's true to deal is play acted and Scarlett apoplectic. And I does that look to got hurt you missed the playoffs you'd need a game wide angle was bingo that we ask your city that I personally. And if all right we will socked his Sunday morning. After probably he's gained throughout an ominous is gonna be a Thursday Saturday and the security as you age twenty years ago for me to show off the stove and cook them instead of creating 88 right decision boys suck it up I know our beef to get tough that. Playoffs got a second out by now. I NBA NE SP a radius coming up clippers that spurs we thank our fine sponsors why snacks eighteenth tee and star market Tai Anderson will be back in the saddle with this as well. So Sunday morning playoff action for substance what are fourteen it's excited about it what noted they play. Good to see him back in the mix for some can't wait that's the best idea who have obviously the salts that not at the masters baseball for the people who love baseball is the best army in what was diabetic eleventh this ingredient are best passed out of country to be in the Stanley. This is sports traded Libya.

We explain which processor you should get By Jim Martin | 13 Apr 17 If you're wondering whether you need a Core i5 processor or can get away with a cheaper Core i3 we'll explain the differences and help you to make a decision. These days, even a basic dual-core processor is fast enough for undemanding tasks. This means that whether you're buying a laptop or a PC, Windows should run perfectly well on even a budget model. Undemanding tasks are just about everything bar gaming, video editing. (If you do want to do these, see our guide to the best processor for gaming and video editing. Essentially, if you just want to do all the normal things people do with their computers - email, web browsing, YouTube, editing and sharing photos, Microsoft Office - a basic processor is fine. If you're reading this during the process of trying to choose a budget laptop, know that one of the most influential components for overall responsiveness is the hard drive. It's worth sacrificing a Core i5 processor for an i3 if you can get an SSD instead of a traditional hard disk for the same sort of price. Check out our list of the best cheap laptops and buying advice, too. How many cores do I need? You rarely, if ever, see single-core processors any more and you should avoid these at all costs. More cores means more performance, plus the ability to run multiple applications at the same time. Many programs can also take advantage of multiple cores so even if you're only running that one program, you should see an improvement in its performance compared with running it on a computer whose CPU has fewer cores. Don't just look at the number of cores, though. Intel processors often support Hyper-threading which effectively allows it to handle twice the number of 'threads' and is a bit like having double the number of cores, albeit virtually. So a dual-core processor with Hyper-threading will be seen by Windows as a quad-core CPU. However, don't forget speed. Each Core i3 and i5 runs at a base 'clock frequency' and can temporarily go faster at their 'boost frequency' when more performance is required. A dual-core processor running at a faster speed than a quad-core processor could have similar performance overall. Here's the current range of 7th generation Intel Core i5 chips for desktop PCs. These have the codename Kaby Lake. They're all quad-core CPUs, but don't support Hyper-threading: Model Core i5-7600K Core i5-7600 Core i5-7500 Core i5-7400 Price £239 £219 £199 £189 TDP 91W 65W 65W 65W Cores/Threads 4/4 4/4 4/4 4/4 Base Frequency 3.8GHz 3.5GHz 3.4GHz 3.0GHz Boost Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 3.8GHz 3.5GHz Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 6MB 6MB 6MB 6MB View the Intel Core i5 Kaby Lake processors on Amazon here. And here's the range of Core i3 desktop processors. These are dual-core but do support Hyper-threading. They don't have a boost frequency, but run at fairly high base frequencies. Model Core i3-7350K Core i3-7320 Core i3-7300 Core i3-7100 Price £185 £159 £149 £119 TDP 60W 51W 51W 51W Cores/Threads 2/4 2/4 2/4 2/4 Base Frequency 4.2GHz 4.1GHz 4.0GHz 3.9GHz Boost Frequency N/A N/A N/A N/A Unlocked Yes No No No Graphics Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Intel HD Graphics 630 Smart Cache 4MB 4MB 4MB 3MB View the Intel Core i3 Kaby Lake processors on Overclockers UK here.  Confusingly, the 7th generation laptop processors don't follow this pattern. There are a couple of Core i5 models (the 7300HQ and 7440HQ) which are quad-core without Hyper-threading, but the rest are dual-core chips with Hyper-threading. The three Core i3 models are also two-core, four-thread CPUs, but as with the desktop versions, have no boost mode. Most cheap laptops, however, have slightly older Intel chips from either the 6th generation or earlier. You can easily tell which generation a chip is from by the first number in the model name. So a Core i5-6200U is a 6th-gen chip. Which is best: i3 or i5? You'd be forgiven for being confused at this point. It's not possible to look at a processor's specifications and make a decision about which is fast enough for you.  That's why we rigorously benchmark every laptop and PC we review. This tests the whole-system performance, not just the CPU. It's the processor, plus the memory (RAM) and hard drive - along with the graphics card, too - which determines how quick a PC or laptop is. So it's crucial to read reviews before you buy one. Here are the best laptops you can buy right now and also the best PCs. There are other factors besides performance, such as amount of power a processor uses. Newer processors are generally always more power efficient, which is important in laptops. You either get more battery life for the same performance, or more performance for the same battery life. But to answer the question, a top-of-the-range Core i5 is going to offer the best performance than any Core i3, but a top-of-the-range Core i3 could be enough for you compared to the slowest Core i5 from the same generation. If you're after the best battery life, look for a processor with a model number ending in U, or with a Y in it. These use the least power, but also deliver slower performance. Finally, don't forget AMD. It's new range of Ryzen processors for PCs are excellent value and the Ryzen 5 chips are better value than Intel's Core i5.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The race to develop and exploit autonomous vehicle technology is reshaping the hierarchy of the automotive industry, replacing traditional top-down manufacturing relationships with complex webs of alliances and acquisitions. Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV , and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. "Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co. are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. COPILOT APPROACH Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc, competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd For a graphic on self-driving vehicles, click here. The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together," said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. "These different approaches will have to pass the test of time," he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.” © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Intels Director of Business Solutions, Jim Henrys explains the importance of understanding how people work and how to make technology support that. He states, We want to know how technology can enrich [peoples] lives rather than limit them. According to Mr. Henrys there are three ways people like to work. First, they like to work on the go, which means they must have digital work tools that enable them to connect wherever they are in a versatile and secure way. Second, they need to collaborate. Workplace collaboration is essential to an organisations creativity and productivity, and the technology should work to facilitate it with high quality visuals and audio, giving people the ability to seamlessly share ideas. And finally, people need a quiet focused, personal workspace, with technology that is simple and adaptable so the mind is inspired to wander and concentrate freely.   When businesses focus on the adoption of technology from a user centric point of view, working to enhance the different ways people work, they can expect to see benefits in terms of the investment in those new systems and the increase of efficiency and creativity within their organisation. Thus, as Mr. Henrys states, The tech supports the workstyles Ive described, its NOT the workstyle itself. The tech is the means by which people can work the way they want to, and need to. Do that and user adoption wont be a problem. Your investment in technology will yield a return: financially and in a very human way.   The most important thing to understand is that the divide that traditionally existed between the tech we use for play as opposed to work is becoming increasingly negigible. Businesses must work to make work tools more agile so they can attract and retain the talent they need to make their workplaces thrive. When workplace applications are not intuitive systems, or are not given proper introduction, people feel the tech is against them. As soon as you need to think about how to use technology it becomes a barrier, says Mr. Henrys. While many companies are seeking to integrate more intuitive software, they also need to focus on technology adoptionthat is, how to bring the people along with the new systems. Business leaders need to ask, What are the barriers to adoption of new technology? And then they need to break those barriers down. Computacenter and Intel are collaborating to show them how.   Learn more!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Sponsored Intel/VentureBeat content collaboration focuses on game development VB Staff April 13, 2017 4:10 AM Tags: game developer, GamesBeat Summit 2017, Intel, VentureBeat Image Credit: Shutterstock Presented by Intel VentureBeat is proud to announce a new collaboration with Intel Corporation that will offer a broad, informed perspective on the current state of PC game development. The PC continues to be a highly important platform for gaming. A recent survey from the Game Developers Conference indicates the PC is the most popular platform with 53 percent of developers currently creating a PC/Mac game — providing developers with a continuously expanding and enthusiastic market for their games. This joint venture seeks to pull back the curtain on how games are created in 2017, revealing what drives individuals and teams to become game developers, how they tackle the hurdles and challenges of their craft, what inspires them to innovate with technology, and the ways they can share their creations with the world. “Intel has long been an advocate for and adviser to game developers, with the mission of helping them thrive – because when developers do well, the whole ecosystem benefits,” said Doug Fisher, senior vice president and general manager of the Software and Services Group at Intel. “This exciting project with VentureBeat will provide a cache of valuable information for developers, which will aid them in their pursuit to create quality games and succeed in the marketplace.” Intel and VentureBeat will collaboratively create content in many areas with emphasis on three centerpieces available on the PC Gaming Channel under VB’s GamesBeat umbrella: Developer Spotlight will profile some of today’s most innovative and inspiring game developers, highlighting what they’re doing that impacts and influences the gaming industry. Inspiration Videos will put a spotlight on impassioned developers and publishers through video profiles that introduce readers to the companies, their creative staffs, and their current projects. Visionary Veterans will take a look at game-industry educators who share what they’ve learned in their careers through training and mentoring to help drive the next generation of developers to be all they can be. The Intel/VentureBeat project will launch just ahead of the upcoming GamesBeat Summit (held May 1–2 at the Claremont Club & Spa Hotel in Berkeley, California, and sponsored in part by Intel). GamesBeat Summit attendees will be able to meet and learn from experienced members of the Intel Game Dev Program. “Games are a source of entertainment and inspiration the world over, and so making games easier to develop is meaningful,” said Matt Marshall, VentureBeat Founder and CEO. “We’re delighted to join with Intel to create what we hope will be a leading and source of information for PC game developers — from how games are conceived, to how they’re built, tested, and launched.” The Intel Game Dev Program collaborates with key game industry experts to give nascent developers access to tools, such as SDKs and code libraries, as well as performance analyzers to help optimize game software, and introductions to test partners. Providing a wealth of information, this program also offers opportunities for developers to differentiate their product and achieve success in the video-game business. The Intel Game Dev website takes a non-partisan approach that helps developers identify problems and mutually find solutions, regardless of the technology behind the screen. Intel also provides assistance and advice to the game-development community, not only through its own technology and tools, but also by offering a vast support network that enables developers to get news and information on current events, and to discuss their issues and seek advice with each other. The barriers to entry for game development have lowered significantly, and more people are seeking to join this exciting and creative industry. This new offering between Intel and VentureBeat will help developers get a leg up on topics such as the ever-changing landscape of gaming platforms; new and evolving technology, such as virtual reality (VR) and eSports; progress in software engines and middleware tools; and changes to the business of PC game development, publishing, and monetization so that developers can make their PC games the best they can be.

Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator - sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. "Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don't have it, they're going to partner, invest or purchase," said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc's Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. COPILOT APPROACH Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG's Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and "deep learning" software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc, competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd. The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. "At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together," said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG's Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. "These different approaches will have to pass the test of time," he said. "In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach."

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Peloton raises $60 million to improve truck platoon safety and efficiency through automation Paul Sawers@psawers April 13, 2017 1:47 AM Tags: funding daily, Peloton Peloton Technology (“Peloton”), a connected and automated vehicle startup that’s setting out to improve the safety and efficiency of freight transportation, has closed a $60 million Series B funding round led by fleet management giant Omnitracs, which spun out of Qualcomm a few years back. The round included participation from a handful of notable names, including Intel Capital, Nokia Growth Partners, Volvo Group, BP Ventures, Lockheed Martin, and UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund. Founded out of Mountain View, California in 2011, Peloton’s platooning platform is designed to help fleets of trucks address what it says are three of the industry’s major challenges: safety, fuel consumption, and operational efficiency. Platooning, for the uninitiated, is when trucks drive in close proximity at a constant speed, which helps lower fuel consumption and emissions. Trucks within Peloton’s system connect using direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, which allows the rear truck to react automatically to the actions of the front truck — if it has to brake or slow down suddenly, for example. So, in effect, the trucks brake and accelerate in tandem, allowing them to operate more safely at closer distances. Peloton’s “driver-assistive” system links the safety systems of paired trucks with a cloud-based network that limits platooning to appropriate roads and conditions. Peloton had previously raised around $18 million, and its fresh cash injection will be used to expedite growth, the rollout of its platooning system in 2017, and the “development of more advanced automation solutions,” according to a company statement. The company is currently working to integrate its smarts with a number of truck manufacturers, including Volvo in North America, which partly explains Volvo’s involvement in this latest funding round. Lead investor Omnitracs is also looking to integrate Peloton into its own platform. “The transportation industry is going through a massive change,” said Omnitracs CEO John Graham. “Macro-level trends like the Internet of Things, cognitive applications, faster delivery of goods and new levels of customer service are at the core of our new partnership with Peloton. We want to expand the possibilities of truck automation on the nation’s highways and set new standards in integrated dispatch, tracking, and routing, as well as driver-facing applications, to maximize and optimize the orchestration of both same-fleet and cross-fleet platooning.” Intel’s involvement, via its venture capital arm, is also notable. Just last month, Intel revealed plans to pay $15.3 billion for Mobileye, a computer vision firm specializing in autonomous cars. A number of other startups are working to improve long-distance road freight logistics. Swedish company Einride recently unveiled T-pod, an autonomous electric truck that can also be controlled remotely. This was shortly after Embark launched its self-driving truck tech to ease driver fatigue on long highways. Elsewhere, Uber-owned Otto reckons self-driving trucks will be cruising U.S. freeways within a decade, though both Uber and Otto are facing the heat from Alphabet over alleged patent infringements. “Making cars and trucks safer and more efficient, with increasing levels of active safety equipment, is critically important to the global economy,” said Kathy Winter, vice president of Intel’s automated driving division. “Advanced driver assistance solutions such as Peloton’s, that are based on scalable, secure computing platforms, are a key element on the path to fully autonomous driving.” Sign up for Funding Daily: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.

Intel-based processor market held the largest size in 2015 Intel-based processor led the market for micro server IC in 2015. Intel has been the early mover in the micro servers market. It has a wide range of partners and customers that deploy Intel based ICs because of the availability of better software support. The major reason for the larger share of Intel-based ICs is the availability of various kinds of ICs and the use of 14 nm process technology to manufacture chips, thus making chips faster while using operating power as low as 7 W. Data center application market is expected to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period Data center is a facility used to house computer systems and associated components such as telecommunications and storage systems. Micro servers are gaining popularity in data center applications because they are less expensive and consume less power and space than traditional enterprise-class rack servers. They can easily be grouped into clusters and are well suited for tasks that do not require multiple CPUs. The growing need for data centers in various business domains such as IT & telecom, banking, healthcare, agriculture, and government, among others would drive the data center application to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. North America held the largest share of the micro server IC market in 2015 The presence of key market players and the early adoption of new technological advancements such as machine-to-machine learning and IoT-enabled devices in North America have created the need for more cloud-based services and the installation of new data centers to support these services, thus leading to the dominance of North America in the global micro server IC market.

Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV , and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. For a graphic on self-driving vehicles, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. "Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programing and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. COPILOT APPROACH Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and “deep learning” software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc , competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. “At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together," said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG’s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. "These different approaches will have to pass the test of time," he said. “In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach.” (Reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Matthew Lewis) Comments Top Stories Superior Fire Destroys Garage Thursday, April 13 Bent Paddle Brewing Distribution Expands In Wisconsin Thursday, April 13 Police Looking For Robbery Suspects Thursday, April 13 Duluth Steam Plant To Reduce Coal Use Thursday, April 13 Virginia Pays Penalty For Air Quality Violations Wednesday, April 12 News Sections Local State National World Local Sports Sports Politics Business Health Science Technology Entertainment Station Information © 2017 710 WDSM - WDSM The Talk of the North 710 WDSM on Facebook Facebook logo 710 WDSM on twitter Twitter logo Listen 710 AM in Duluth, Minnesota 98.1 FM in Duluth, Minnesota Contact Studio Line 1: 218-722-7500 Text Us at 39327 Advertise With Us Job Opportunities Contact Us More Privacy Policy (PDF) Terms of Use (PDF) Contest Rules EEO

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:20 PM, April 13, 2017 Updated: 1:40 PM, April 13, 2017 FRANKFURT/DETROIT - The race to develop and exploit autonomous vehicle technology is reshaping the hierarchy of the automotive industry, replacing traditional top-down manufacturing relationships with complex webs of alliances and acquisitions. Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's <DAIGn.DE> Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator — sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp <INTC.O> acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV <MBLY.N>, and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG <BMWG.DE> develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. For a graphic on self-driving vehicles, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. "Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don’t have it, they’re going to partner, invest or purchase,” said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programing and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co <GM.N> are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc’s <GOOGL.O> Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc <DLPH.N> are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles <FCHA.MI> <FCAU.N> that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. COPILOT APPROACH Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG’s <VOWG_p.DE> Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp <NVDA.O> has a partnership deal.

Dealmaking in the automotive and technology industry is driven by the rapid transition of self-driving vehicles from research projects to major elements of near-term product plans at several of the world's biggest automakers. That shift is behind deals like one announced last week between Robert Bosch and Daimler AG's Mercedes. Bosch and Mercedes said they will collaborate on development of self-driving vehicles, with Bosch in a broad role as a systems integrator - sort of a copilot with the automaker in speeding up deployment of self-driving vehicles. Bosch also expects to sell the jointly developed systems to other companies. Separately, Silicon Valley chipmaker Intel Corp acquired automotive vision technology leader Mobileye NV , and has a deal to help German luxury car maker BMW AG develop autonomous vehicles around Intel and Mobileye systems. The first fully self-driving cars are expected to go into production by 2020-2021. Analysts have said self-driving cars will not be in wide use before 2030. "Everybody is trying to understand what skill sets are required to be first in the game (and) if they don´t have it, they´re going to partner, invest or purchase," said Xavier Mosquet, a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group and an authority on autonomous vehicles. Major auto companies are rich in engineers schooled in the physics of combustion and collisions, materials science and mechanical systems. The development of self-driving cars demands experts in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer programming and digital networks who work mainly outside the auto industry. Automakers are following different paths to acquire engineering talent. Some are relying on partnerships like the Bosch-Mercedes pact. Others such as General Motors Co are going it alone, buying self-driving vehicle startups and building technology in-house. Alphabet Inc´s Waymo and auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc are offering turn-key systems to companies such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that are choosing not to invest in their own autonomous driving systems. COPILOT APPROACH Some of the car companies and large suppliers could wind up as competitors. BMW has said it wants to sell its self-driving systems to other manufacturers, as does Delphi, which is developing a system of its own. Intel and Mobileye are partners in both ventures. The Dutch provider of high-definition maps, HERE, has taken a position at the center for several supplier webs. HERE is jointly owned by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen AG´s Audi. Intel owns a minority stake in HERE, and rival chipmaker Nvidia Corp has a partnership deal. Nvidia itself wants to be a provider of powerful computer chips and "deep learning" software for self-driving cars to a broad array of customers, including rivals such as Mercedes and Tesla Inc, competing mega-suppliers such as Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen AG and Chinese tech companies Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd (For a graphic on self-driving vehicles see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc) The vehicle manufacturers are divided on how much self-driving development and integration to farm out to the parts makers, or whether to keep most of that in-house - as they have done for decades with much of their core engine technology. "At the moment, the carmaker is at an advantage since it knows how the components all fit together," said Mercedes executive Christoph von Hugo. BCG´s Mosquet believes the industry may not settle on a single template for collaboration, given the complexity of autonomous vehicles and their underlying technology. "These different approaches will have to pass the test of time," he said. "In two or three years, we will see who has been successful with which approach."

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Apr 12, 2017 at 7:03PM After launching the high-end Ryzen 7 line of PC CPUs in March to somewhat mixed reviews, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is now taking a crack at the mainstream portion of the market. Ryzen 5, comprised of four CPUs featuring either four or six cores, is aimed at Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i5 family of chips. Priced between $169 and $249, Ryzen 5 offers more cores and threads than Intel's comparable chips. But the same trade-off that made Ryzen 7 a mixed bag persists: Single-threaded performance is a weakness for Ryzen, and AMD's pricing may not be aggressive enough to overcome that issue. A look at Ryzen 5 The highest-end Ryzen 5 chip, the 1600X, is priced at $249, offering six cores and 12 threads. The 1600X is essentially the Ryzen 1800X with two cores and $150 lopped off, making it a good budget option for those who use applications that can take advantage of that many threads. Like the 1800X, though, the 1600X falls short when single-threaded performance is important. Image source: AMD. The 1600 also has six cores and 12 threads, but it comes with a lower clock speed and a $219 price tag. The 1500X and 1400 both come with four cores and eight threads priced at $189 and $169, respectively, with the 1400 having a lower clock speed and half as much L3 cache as the rest of the Ryzen 5 lineup. The competition is Intel's Core i5 line of chips. All of Intel i5 chips come with at most four cores, and those quad-core chips don't support hyperthreading, meaning that the number of threads is equal to the number of cores. All the Ryzen 5 chips have a major advantage when it comes to multithreaded performance due to this discrepancy -- the same story that played out with Ryzen 7. Good at some things, not so good at others Like Ryzen 7, Ryzen 5 is at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to single-threaded performance. In its review of Ryzen 5, Anandtech puts that disadvantage at about 10% to 15%. The upside is that the two higher-end Ryzen 5 chips have 50% more cores and triple the threads compared to Intel's i5 chips. In situations where single-threaded performance matters greatly, like opening PDF documents and in games that don't make great use of more than a few cores, Ryzen 5 gets trounced by Intel's Core i5 chips. The i5-7600 is 16.7% faster at opening a PDF document than the 1600X, according to Anandtech's review, a difference that will be noticeable to users. Ryzen 5 falls well behind in some games. Anandtech's test of Rise of the Tomb Raider has the 1600X with a 28% lower frame rate at a 1080p resolution. That gap disappears at a 4K resolution, but that's only because the GPU becomes the bottleneck. Ryzen 5 fares far better in other games, though, thanks to its core count advantage. Anandtech's Civilization 6 benchmark has the 1600X well ahead of the i5-7600 at both 1080p and 4K resolutions. When it comes to gaming, Ryzen 5 seems to be more competitive than Ryzen 7, which was beat by cheaper Intel chips in most gaming benchmarks. Ryzen 5 shines in applications that can make full use of its cores. Applications like compressing files, encoding video, and 3D rendering all benefit greatly from a higher core count. Anandtech's 7-Zip compression benchmark, for example, has the 1600X scoring nearly 90% higher than the i5-7600. Ryzen 5 is the runaway winner for these types of applications. Pricing might be a problem The 1600X priced at $249 is a no-brainer for users that benefit from more cores. But as a mainstream gaming CPU, the 1600X is more of a mixed bag. Intel's i5-7600 is priced around $213, and the unlocked i5-7600K sells for around $242. The cheaper Intel chips outperform the 1600X in quite a few games, although they get beat in some CPU-intensive titles. AMD's pricing isn't very disruptive, especially considering that Ryzen 5 is at a disadvantage when it comes to everyday tasks that benefit from better single-threaded performance. The 1600X is certainly a viable alternative to Intel's chips, but it comes with a lot of trade-offs and a higher price. If AMD's goal is to win back considerable market share from Intel, it will likely need to do better than this. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

Clear Linux Switches From ACPI CPUFreq To P-State Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 12 April 2017 at 07:56 PM EDT. 2 Comments Intel's Clear Linux distribution has switched from using the ACPI CPUFreq scaling driver for recent generations of Intel hardware to now using the P-State CPU frequency scaling driver. Intel's P-State driver has been around since the Sandy Bridge days, but the results have been mixed with sometimes P-State working out well for conserving power use but not necessarily delivering expected performance. Linux gamers, server administrators, and others have generally long avoided P-State. While many Linux distributions have been defaulting to P-State for years, Clear Linux has been one of the few still preferring to use CPUFreq for delivering the best out-of-the-box experience (and performance). As a sign though of P-State's maturing in recent kernel releases, they are now defaulting to P-State. Those running Clear Linux on newer Intel hardware will find P-State is used in place of CPUFreq while "performance" is the default governor choice. Great to see this happen and a further indication of P-State finally getting into shape. My tests of P-State on recent Linux kernel releases have been in good shape while there is more P-State tweaking and improvements slated for Linux 4.12. Stay tuned for benchmarks. Clear Linux as of today is on Linux 4.10.9, GCC 6.3.0, LLVM Clang 3.9.1, Mesa 17.1-dev, X.Org Server 1.19, and Beignet 1.4. 2 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

The leading-edge high-tech companies of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and even the early 2000s — like Intel, Apple and Google — were housed in corporate campuses in Silicon Valley. Microsoft had its headquarters in suburban Redmond, Washington; other high-tech companies clustered along the Route 128 suburbs outside of Boston, in the suburbs of Austin, Texas, or the office parks of North Carolina’s Research Triangle. Back in the late 1980s, when I conducted my early studies of the geography of venture capital and high-tech industry with Martin Kenney, the lion’s share of venture capital backed start-ups were in these suburban areas. That geography has become much more urban. With nearly $6.5 billion in such investment, San Francisco topped the $4.2 billion that the San Jose metro (which encompasses Silicon Valley) received in 2012, ranking as the world’s number-one location for venture capital investment that year. Greater New York took in more than $2 billion, the bulk of it in Lower Manhattan. Those figures grew even larger in 2013. In that year, the San Francisco metro took in a whopping $8.5 billion in venture capital investment, with $6.2 billion of that flowing into the city itself, compared with $4.8 billion in the San Jose metro. Venture capital investment in Greater New York grew to more than $3 billion. Across the US, more than half of this investment and nearly six in 10 start-ups were in urban ZIP codes in 2013. Roughly 60 per cent of venture investment in the Bay Area went to dense, walkable neighbourhoods in urban ZIP codes, and in New York, more than 80 per cent did. In the ZIP codes that received venture capital investment nationwide, the share of workers who walked, biked or used transit to get to work was nearly twice the national average (16.6 per cent in venture capital neighbourhoods, versus 8.4 per cent overall). More than a quarter of venture capital investment nationally was concentrated in neighbourhoods where more than half of all workers walked, biked or used transit, and more than a third was located in neighbourhoods where more than 30 per cent did so. Indeed, urban density has become one of the most important factors in the propagation of high-tech start-ups and the attraction of venture capital investment. The amount of venture capital invested in start-ups is more strongly correlated with population density than it is with either the concentration of highly educated people or the concentration of the creative class, and only slightly less strongly correlated with population density than it is with the concentration of high-tech industry — which is the very thing that attracts venture capital investment to begin with. Even when such investment flows to start-ups in smaller cities and suburbs, it tends to go to the ones that have the most urban characteristics. With more than $1.5 billion in investment, the leading centre for venture capital investment in Silicon Valley is the densest part of Palo Alto surrounding Stanford University. Cambridge, Massachusetts, home to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, attracted close to $1 billion, more than the suburbs out along Route 128. Dense, walkable Santa Monica attracted double the amount of venture capital that the much larger but more sprawling city of Los Angeles received. The urban shift in technology start-ups extends beyond the US. Once a high-finance centre with little in the way of tech, London is now home to thousands of high-tech companies and tens of thousands of jobs. Its start-ups pull in more than $800 million a year in venture capital, more than in Seattle or Austin. Beijing and Shanghai, Mumbai and Bengaluru, Toronto, Paris and Moscow all number among the world’s 20 leading locations for venture capital investment and start-up companies. Urban start-up hubs are also emerging in Berlin, Amsterdam, Liverpool and Munich in Europe, and Tel Aviv and Amman, Jordan, in the Middle East. Start-ups and cities are a natural match. Urban areas provide the diversity, creative energy, cultural richness, vibrant street life and openness to new ideas that start-up founders are looking for. While many large, well-established tech companies require large headquarter sites and remain in the suburbs, start-ups can make use of the adaptable work spaces that urban industrial and warehouse buildings provide. In the past, the most successful start-ups were those that focused on developing and manufacturing software or hardware, and the large facilities and campuses they required could be more cheaply accommodated in the suburbs. Today’s hottest start-ups involve digital and social media, games and creative applications, which draw on the deep pools of designers, composers, scenarists, musicians, marketers and copywriters that can be found in cities. Other companies, such as Uber and Airbnb Inc., were set up to actually make some aspect of urban life work more efficiently — transportation and short-term housing, respectively. Cities aren’t just locations for these companies, but the sites of the very problems their technologies aim to solve and the platforms for innovation itself. Indeed, the cultural creativity of great cities has proved to be a big draw for talent. New York venture capitalist Fred Wilson told me of a meeting he had with Etsy Inc.’s founder, Rob Kalen. Wilson found him sitting in his office playing his guitar. When Wilson remarked that he hadn’t realised what a talented musician he was, Kalen said: “Fred, you know I’m really an artist. If I had grown up in the 1960s, I would have been a folk musician. If I’d grown up in the 1920s, I would have been a painter. But I grew up in this generation, and my art is making websites.” Wilson added, “There’s more art than science in this kind of tech, and artists, for the most part, congregate in cities.” Back in 2002, in “The Rise of the Creative Class”, I noted the connection of bohemian values, vibrant art and music scenes, and the places that incubate high-tech start-ups. San Francisco was a font of 1960s psychedelia and the home of bands like the Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother and the Holding Company. Seattle was the birthplace of Jimi Hendrix, who had such a powerful influence on Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen that Allen opened the Experience Music Project downtown; the city was also the birthplace of the grunge scene that later produced Nirvana. Austin, too, has a vibrant alternative music scene that grew up alongside its tech scene. New York and London are among the world’s artistic and cultural leaders. These are not mere coincidences: Great cities are creative and innovative across the board. In fact, my research shows empirically that artistic and cultural creativity acts alongside the high-tech industry and business and finance to power economic growth. The trend is not so much a startling reversal as a correction of a historical aberration. The venture capital icon Paul Graham saw the writing on the wall in 2006. For all its advantages and power, he wrote, Silicon Valley had a great weakness. This high-tech “paradise”, with its roots in the 1950s and 1960s, had become “one giant parking lot,” he observed. San Francisco and Berkeley are great, but they’re 40 miles away. Silicon Valley proper is soul-crushing suburban sprawl. It has fabulous weather, which makes it significantly better than the soul-crushing sprawl of most other American cities. But a competitor that managed to avoid sprawl would have real leverage. He was right — that’s exactly what happened.

The Intel deal may be the harbinger of more Israeli auto tech companies' success. Richard Drew/AP The Israelis who survived the wolves of Wall Street In big day for Israeli high-tech, Valens raises $60 million, Dapulse $25 million Why can’t Israel's army profit from all the tech developed by its soldiers? When Intel agreed to buy Mobileye for $15.2 million last month, a lot of people stood to make money. But few of the beneficiaries were Israel’s institutional investors, the companies that invest the public’s savings. Not long after, the missed opportunity prompted a meeting between Israel’s high-tech and venture capital leaders and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon. They urged him to take measure to correct the long-festering problem of Israeli savings failing to get a piece of the country’s high-tech action because Israeli institutions have traditionally shunned investing in the country’s venture capital funds. With investment capital so hard to raise, Israeli VCs have been crowded out by foreign funds: Only 13% of all money invested in high-tech companies last year came from Israeli funds. Kahlon was sympathetic to the problems, but perhaps that is because he didn’t know the whole story. The fact is Israeli VCs have not turned in competitive returns over the years, a survey by TheMarker has founded. Among other things, none were invested in Mobileye, the biggest exit ever by Israeli tech company. As private investors, VC funds do not have to disclose their performance metrics, but some of the funds’ returns can be discovered by looking into the financial reports of the few institutions that have invested in them.

Close The Capital Markets Authority reports that Israeli institution had just 3 billion shekels ($820 million) invested in VC funds, 2.5 billion of it in domestic funds at the end of last year. That is just 90.2% of their assets TheMarker compared VC performance with the Tel; Aviv Stock Exchange’s TA-125 index, although that is an unfair comparison because the stock market is a liquid investment while VCs are long-term ones. Ordinarily the premium for having funds tied up for so long should be 20% to 30%. In addition, it’s the nature of VC funds that they invest in their early years and only see the returns much later when their portfolio of companies exit. TheMarker avoided this problem by surveying older funds. Moreover, venture capital funds collect management fees of 2-2.5% annually, which is much higher than provident funds collect (1.05% from the principal and 6% on deposits) or pension funds 0.5% and 6%, respectively). All of that works against institutions investing in VCS. “At the end of the day, the goal of institutions is to achieve the best possible retain for its investors at a reasonable level of risk – it’s not our money,” said on institutional investment manager. Looking at funds that were formed around the year 2000, there’s a big different in performance. The best of them, with a 60% return was the Delta Fund, while the worst, Hyperion), had a negative return of 63%, including management fees. In any case, investing in the TA-125 would have yielded a return of 156%. Two funds dating from 2002-02 both showed poor performances – Aviv 1 had a negative return of 42% and Vitalife had a negative return of 18%, while the TA-125 generated a 180% return. For 2005-05-vintage funds, the top-performing JVP 4generated a 778% return – good but less than the TA-125’s 96%. Funding firmed in 2007 have generated negative returns of between 38% and 72%, versus 35% for the TA-125. “In the past institutions invested not a little money in VC funds, said one institutional investors, who asked not to be named. “The problem with these funds is that the level of risk is very high mainly because they are investing an in industry where only 5% of the companies succeed. In addition, then funds are volatile. One bad year is enough to ruin yields for years following. And because it’s a fund, it’s not an investment that you can exit – your stuck for 10 years.” That said, he said he saw signs that the Israel’s VC industry was maturing. In the past too much VC money was chasing after two few companies, raising valuations and making it harder to earn returns. “Now they’re raising significantly less money,” he said.

Moore's Law is an observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that has helped make devices smaller and faster. It predicts that the density of transistors would double every 18 to 24 months, while the cost of making chips goes down. Every year, computers and mobile devices that are significantly faster can be bought with the same amount of money thanks in part to guidance from Moore's Law. The observation has helped drive up device performance on a predictable basis while keeping costs down. But the predictions tied to Moore's Law are reaching their limits as it becomes harder to make chips at smaller geometries. That's a challenge facing all top chip makers including Intel, which is changing the way it interprets Moore's Law as it tries to cling on to it for dear life. Williams is the latest to join a growing cadre of scientists who predict Moore's Law is dying. The end of Moore's Law "could be the best thing that has happened to computing in decades," Williams wrote in a research paper published in the latest issue of IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering. The end of Moore's Law will bring creativity to chip and computer design and help engineers and researchers think outside the box, Williams said. Moore's Law has bottled up innovation in computer design, he hinted. So what's next? Williams predicted there would be computers with a series of chips and accelerators patched together, much like the early forms of superfast computers. Computing could also be memory driven, with a much faster bus driving speedier computing and throughput. The idea of a memory-driven computer plays to the strength of HPE, which has built The Machine along those lines. The initial version of The Machine has persistent memory that can be used as both DRAM and flash storage but could eventually be based on memristor, an intelligent form of memory and storage that can track data patterns.  Memory-driven computing could also break down the current architecture-based and processor-centric domination of the computer market. In the longer term, neuromorphic chips designed around the way the brain works could drive computing. In the longer term, neuromorphic chips that are designed around the way the brain works could drive computing. HPE is developing a chip designed to mimic a human brain, and similar chips are being developed by IBM, Qualcomm, and universities in the U.S. and Europe. "Although our understanding of brains today is limited, we know enough now to design and build circuits that can accelerate certain computational tasks," Williams wrote. Applications like machine learning highlight the need for new types of chips. IBM has benchmarked its neuromorphic chip called TrueNorth as being faster and more power-efficient than conventional deep-learning chips like GPUs. Williams suggested ASICs and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) could play a role in driving computing beyond Moore's Law. These technologies will use superfast interconnects like Gen Z, which was introduced last year and will be supported by major chipmakers and server makers like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Quantum computers are also emerging as a way to replace today's PCs and servers, but are still decades away from running everyday applications.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads Google’s dedicated TensorFlow processor, or TPU, crushes Intel, Nvidia in inference workloads By Joel Hruska on April 6, 2017 at 9:48 am Comment Several years ago, Google began working on its own custom software for machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads, dubbed TensorFlow. Last year, the company announced that it had designed its own tensor processing unit (TPU), an ASIC designed for high throughput of low-precision arithmetic. Now, Google has released some performance data for their TPU and how it compares to Intel’s Haswell CPUs and Nvidia’s K80 (Kepler-based) data center dual GPU. Before we dive into the data we need to talk about the workloads Google is discussing. All of Google’s benchmarks measure inference performance as opposed to initial neural network training. Nvidia has a graphic that summarizes the differences between the two: Click to enlarge. Teaching a neural network what to recognize and how to recognize it is referred to as training, and these workloads are still typically run on CPUs or GPUs. Inference refers to the neural network’s ability to apply what it learned from training. Google makes it clear that it’s only interested in low-latency operations and that it’s imposed strict criteria for responsiveness on the benchmarks we’ll discuss below. Google’s TPU design, benchmarks The first part of Google’s paper discusses the various types of deep neural networks it deploys, the specific benchmarks it uses, and offers a diagram of the TPU’s physical layout, pictured below. The TPU is specifically designed for 8-bit integer workloads and prioritizes consistently low latency over raw throughput (both CPUs and GPUs tend to prioritize throughput over latency, particularly GPUs). Click to enlarge Google writes (PDF): “Rather than be tightly integrated with a CPU, to reduce the chances of delaying deployment, the TPU was designed to be a coprocessor on the PCIe I/O bus, allowing it to plug into existing servers just as a GPU does. Moreover, to simplify hardware design and debugging, the host server sends TPU instructions for it to execute rather than fetching them itself. Hence, the TPU is closer in spirit to an FPU (floating-point unit) coprocessor than it is to a GPU.” Click to enlarge Each TPU also has an off-chip 8GiB DRAM pool, which Google calls Weight Memory, while intermediate results are held in a 24MiB pool of on-chip memory (that’s the Unified Buffer in the diagram above). The TPU has a four-stage pipeline and executes CISC instructions, with some instructions taking thousands of clock cycles to execute as opposed to the typical RISC pipeline of one clock cycle per pipeline stage. The table below shows how the E5-2699v3 (Haswell), Nvidia K80, and TPU compare against each other in various metrics. Click to enlarge Before we hit the benchmark results, there are a few things we need to note. First, Turbo mode and GPU Boost were disabled for both the Haswell and Nvidia GPUs, not to artificially tilt the score in favor of the TPU, but because Google’s data centers prioritize dense hardware packing over raw performance. Higher turbo clock rates for the v3 Xeon are dependent on not using AVX, which Google’s neural networks all tend to use. As for Nvidia’s K80, the test server in question deployed four K80 cards with two GPUs per card, for a total of eight GPU cores. Packed that tightly, the only way to take advantage of the GPU’s boost clock without causing an overheat would have been to remove two of the K80 cards. Since the clock frequency increase isn’t nearly as potent as doubling the total number of GPUs in the server, Google leaves boost disabled on these server configurations. Google’s benchmark figures all use the roofline performance model. The advantage of this model is that it creates an intuitive image of overall performance. The flat roofline represents theoretical peak performance, while the various data points show real-world results. In this case, the Y-axis is integer operations per second, while the “Operational Intensity” X-axis corresponds to integer operations per byte of weights read (emphasis Google’s). The gap between an application’s observed performance and the curve directly above it shows how much additional performance might be gained if the benchmark was better optimized for the architecture in question, while data points on the slanted portion of the roofline indicate that the benchmark is running into memory bandwidth limitations. The slideshow below shows Google’s results in various benchmarks for its CPU, GPU, and TPU tests. As always, each slide can be clicked to open a larger image in a new window. Google’s TPU isn’t just a high performance engine; it offers substantially improved performance per watt as well, both in the original TPU and for improved variants Google has modeled (TPU’). Click to enlarge The chief limiting factor between Google’s TPU and higher performance is memory bandwidth. Google’s models show TPU performance improving 3x if memory bandwidth is increased 4x over current designs. No other set of enhancements, including clock rate improvements, larger accumulators, or a combination of multiple factors has much of an impact on performance. The last section of Google’s paper is dedicated to dispelling various fallacies and correcting misunderstandings, a number of which relate to the choice of the K80 GPU. One section is particularly worth quoting: Fallacy: CPU and GPU results would be comparable to the TPU if we used them more efficiently or compared to newer versions. We originally had 8-bit results for just one DNN on the CPU, due to the significant work to use AVX2 integer support efficiently. The benefit was ~3.5X. It was less confusing (and space) to present all CPU results in floating point, rather than having one exception, with its own roofline. If all DNNs had similar speedup, performance/Watt ratio would drop from 41-83X to 12-24X. The new 16-nm, 1.5GHz, 250W P40 datacenter GPU can perform 47 Tera 8-bit ops/sec, but was unavailable in early 2015, so isn’t contemporary with our three platforms. We also can’t know the fraction of P40 peak delivered within our rigid time bounds. If we compared newer chips, Section 7 shows that we could triple performance of the 28-nm, 0.7GHz, 40W TPU just by using the K80’s GDDR5 memory (at a cost of an additional 10W). This kind of announcement isn’t the sort of thing Nvidia is going to be happy to hear. To be clear, Google’s TPU results today are applicable to inference workloads, not the initial task of training the neural network — that’s still done on GPUs. But, with respect to Nvidia and AMD both, we’ve also seen this kind of cycle play out before. Once upon a time, CPUs were the unquestioned kings of cryptocurrency mining. Then, as difficulty rose, GPUs became dominant, thanks to vastly higher hash rates. In the long run, however, custom ASICs took over the market. Both AMD and Nvidia recently added (Nvidia) or announced (AMD) support for 8-bit operations to improve total GPU throughput in deep learning and AI workloads, but it will take significant improvements over and above these steps to address the advantage ASICs would possess if they start moving into these markets. That’s not to say we expect custom ASIC designs to own the market — Google and Microsoft may be able to afford to build their own custom hardware, but most customers won’t have the funds or expertise to take that on.

At the time, this included Intel's sixth-generation Skylake chips and anything else going forward, providing a date of July 17, 2017 for when the updates would stop. Due to significant backlash, Microsoft extended its support for Skylake by a year, and by August, promised to continue supporting the platform as it would for previous generations. Still, that leaves Intel's seventh-generation Kaby Lake and AMD's new Ryzen processors on the chopping block. According to Ars Technica, updates are finally being blocked for anyone on Windows 7 or 8.1 that's using one of the new chips. The move isn't surprising, as Microsoft did announce this some time ago, but it is still a bit peculiar, as Windows 8.1 is still under mainstream support until January 9, 2018. Mainstream support means that new features are still added to the OS; once it's over, it goes into extended support, when the company will only release security updates and fixes for it. Windows 7, on the other hand, hasn't been eligible for mainstream support since January 13, 2015. Of course, there isn't exactly a massive demand for Windows 8.1 licenses right now, so we'll just have to chalk this up in the "it is what it is" category. If you're using a new PC and you're finding that you can't get updates now though, you might want to consider Windows 10, or Linux.

An optional IR camera is being offered as well which will enable users to take advantage of the Windows Hello feature of Windows 10. HP Pavilion x360 series is now available in 11.6, 14, and 15.6 inch sizes. Some of you may have noticed that HP has decided to discontinue the 13.3 inch model. It’s going to charge $399 for the base model of the 11.6 inch version which is powered by an Intel Pentium N4200 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM and 500GB 5400 rpm SATA had drive. Those who want more power will be better off with the larger Pavilion x360 models. The 14 inch and 15.6 inch models come with options for Core i3, Core i5, and even Core i7 processors with high-resolution displays and support for SSDs. There’s even a USB Type-C port in these models. The normal Pavilion series has been updated as well. The specifications are similar to the x360 series but the Pavilion also gets options for AMD processors in its 14, 15, and 17 inch flavors. Prices for the new notebooks start at $600 and go up quite a bit depending on the configuration that the customer opts for. HP is going to start shipping these new notebooks within a few weeks.

We have to move forward, so I’m not giving up,” he told Computer Weekly. As long as there is value in data, he says attackers will go after it, but data defenders have to find a way of winning because they cannot give up. “We have no alternative but to keep investing and keep getting better at what we are trying to do,” says Young, who points out that cyber security is a relatively new and immature board-level issue. “Cyber security is only around 15 years old as a discipline, compared with other board-level issues like audit and finance that are backed by centuries of practice.” As a result, Young says there are still no well-established, definitive ways for measuring success, and until these are developed and established, there is no way of knowing who is winning. Young, on a visit to the UK and Europe, says a lot of businesses in the region are paying close attention to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), what that means from a security perspective, and what they need to do differently. Read more about McAfee McAfee report reveals five challenges to cyber threat intelligence. McAfee re-established as independent cyber security firm. Reborn McAfee looking to generate more channel opportunities. Expert Bill Hayes takes a closer look at McAfee Total Protection for Data Loss Prevention. Anyone who is selling security is also paying a lot of attention to GDPR because compliance is always a driver of how people think about cyber security and the purchase decisions they make. But, he says, there is still a “chunk” of the market that is “a bit behind” and not focused on it yet. While Young agrees that GDPR will generally have a positive impact by pushing data security up the agendas of company boards, focusing attention on the topic and driving more security spending, he fears it could also have some unintended negative consequences. “Cyber security is an overarching problem. It does not confine itself to a single domain. And inevitably in cyber security, when you focus in one place, you get attacked in another. While there is certainly the need for a greater focus on data protection, you run the risk that the focus on data might move budget and focus away from other areas where organisations may need to be paying attention to security.” Adopting a cloud first strategy After the GDPR, there is a lot of talk about cloud in the UK, but Young says that while there appears to be a lot of companies adopting a “cloud first strategy”, only a small percentage of the market are making real investments in this area and actually moving workloads into the cloud. On the question of Brexit, Young admits he has not been getting many “definitive” responses about what Brexit could mean for McAfee’s business, but he says because it is a global company he does not expect Brexit to have much of an impact at all. “One UK banking customer told me they had made a lot of the structural changes that will allow them to keep operating [post-Brexit] largely the way they are already operating. “There has certainly been no panic and most organisations are taking it in their stride. They are neither sceptical nor optimistic, but just looking to see what changes they can make now that won’t impact business operations but put them in a better position for the future.” In terms of attack types, Young says the UK is facing basically the same things as the US and other countries, but that the geo-political landscape is constantly shifting. “I don’t think you can ever take your eye of the ball in terms of being vigilant about any unique geo-political items that might affect the threat landscape. For example, as the UK adopts new ways of currency management – as we see bitcoin taking off – I am sure it will be different in the UK than it will be in the US and even parts of continental Europe, and that may or may not offer up opportunities in terms of how attackers go about attacking the UK market.” Getting ahead of changes in the market Asked about the UK’s controversial Investigatory Powers Act that seeks to give law enforcement and security agencies access to electronic communications, Young says McAfee always pays attention to new legislation and trying to get ahead of changes in the market. On the question of encryption, Young says he believes that it is important. “It is a foundational element of trust in all online transactions and interactions where there is an expectation of privacy, and encryption is crucial to that. “We all need to look for creative ways to balance the need for maintaining privacy with the need for law enforcement to be able to do their jobs.” In this regard, he says McAfee is “in dialogue” with various governments about encryption and what the company sees the security tool of encryption impacting how other security tools work. “One of the things you have to be careful of is that you don’t drive unintended consequences. You have to think about the balance between security and privacy. If you tip the scales too far in one direction, there are consequences on the other side. “I think real transparency is important. It is a transparent approach to the problem that I think will ultimately make the biggest difference. It is not an easy subject to manage, but it is important.” Going forward as a standalone company Turning to the decision to spin out of Intel as a standalone business, Young – who was previously senior vice-president and general manager of the Intel Security Group – says that in the light of the changes in the cyber security market in recent years, it became clear to everyone involved that it made more sense for McAfee to pursue new market opportunities as a standalone company. “In terms of your priorities and decisions you make, there is a big difference between having your whole company focussed on cyber security, versus being one group within a much bigger company that does a lot of things, where cyber security is just one of those things.” This means being able to provide all 7,500 employees with a new computer with the latest version of all McAfee’s products “without having to argue with an IT organisation that supports 100,000 people about their priorities in rolling that out.” However, Young points out that Intel has maintained a 49% stake. “They believe in the upside of this organisation and they believe there are places where we should have stronger partnership and continue to make those investments together.” McAfee will also continue the work it has been doing with Intel such as the collaborative work with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and channel partners as well as collaboration on technologies such as the Secure Home Platform developed in conjunction with Intel’s Connected Home division. Another area of continued collaboration will be on security features and functions Intel is building into silicon chips. A tradition around innovation A key takeaway from Intel, says Young, is Intel’s strong tradition around innovation. “Intel is also very disciplined in how they approach their business, they are good at analysing markets, and they are good at making good long-term strategic bets, which are some of the positive things we’re taking with us.” At the same time, he says McAfee leaves behind a very positive ethos around security within Intel, which is still doing a lot of foundational security throughout its product portfolio. While there are benefits to being independent at a company level, Young firmly believes in collaboration across the cyber security industry, including with competitors. McAfee already has a track record of collaboration through integrating third parties into its ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) security management framework, which Young regards as one of McAfee’s key value propositions. More recently, McAfee has extended that collaboration through its data exchange layer (DXL), which the company has made open source to enable everyone in the security industry to do threat intelligence sharing in real time between and among the different point products in their infrastructure. “In making DXL open source we have put real technology investment into the collaborative and architectural approach we are taking with security,” says Young. He also points out that in 2016, as Intel Security, McAfee was a founder member of the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) along with Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks and Symantec. Identifying challenges to intelligence sharing In February 2017, the CTA announced the addition of Cisco and Check Point as members, the appointment of former Whitehouse cyber security co-ordinator Michael Daniel as the organisation’s first president, and the organisation’s formal incorporation as a not-for-profit entity. In April 2017, McAfee’s latest threat report identified five key challenges to cyber threat intelligence sharing, and Young says the CTA is one way of tackling those obstacles through real investment on the ground, but says it is “early days” in threat intelligence sharing and there is certainly more to be done. “CTA is more of a private sector oriented approach, but there is opportunity for more of a public-private partnership both nationally and internationally, and there needs to be more technology involved, which is why we open-sourced DXL because we wanted to give people an automated way of sharing threat intelligence and making it actionable.” McAfee’s new slogan is “together is power”, and behind this, says Young, is the belief that through better-integrated technology, organisations can get to responses faster. “A common impediment to effective cyber security is the complexity of all the tools and technologies, with the average large company having 50 to a 100 different technologies in their infrastructure, and so part of what we are doing with DXL and the integration and collaboration work we are doing is to try to drive a faster, more intelligent response to cyber threats.” The channel response to the “new McAfee” has been “very positive” says Young. “Our channel partners are out there competing for business and they really value the pure-play McAfee cyber security brand. Being able to go to market jointly with us is valuable to them. “They are also interested in an integrated approach because they are trying to deliver outcomes to customers, with many of them pivoting from being value-added resellers to being solutions providers, selling a combination of product and people, so they want technology providers that can give them both depth and breadth as well as integration, which makes their lives easier.” McAfee name remains a trusted brand Despite the potential association with controversial John McAfee, founder of McAfee Associates that was acquired by Intel, the company is confident in the brand, which was retained in the names of several products even after the acquisition and rebranding as “Intel Security”. “We did a lot of research into this and we found that McAfee is one of the most well-known and trusted brands in cyber security, and the value of what McAfee is and what our customers want us to be far outweighs any of the noise that comes along people who used to be involved with it,” says Young. Looking ahead, he says the security market is growing and so McAfee will be making investments for growth, which includes investments to make the company more effective in the way it operates as well as investment in technologies through acquisitions. Cloud is an area that McAfee is already investing in to fill out its portfolio relative to pure cloud companies, with plans to introduce a cloud access security broker (CASB) software tool in 2017 and cloud-based integrated data loss prevention (DLP) on the horizon. “Relative to our traditional competitors, we are pretty far along – if not further in some cases on cloud than they are,” says Young. And when it comes to managed services, another area where some analysts have said McAfee lags behind its competitors, he says McAfee’s strategy is to work with partners on that. In other efforts to align with competitors in a changing security market, McAfee has begun offering subscription options. Young says most customers still prefer to purchase products in the traditional way, but as McAfee adds more cloud-based services, it is moving more offerings to subscription-based licences and consumption-based pricing models. “What is interesting about consumption-based pricing and even term licences is that more organisations like to say they want it than are actually willing and able to buy it that way, because while large organisations like to commit to a new direction, it usually takes time for the organisation to change, especially in the public sector and regulated industries,” he says. Calls for a new approach to information security In the past two years at the RSA Conference in the US, there has been a much stronger call by most of the key players for a new approach to information security across the industry than ever before. Asked if McAfee’s strategy is consistent with that push in a new direction, Young says he believes that it is. “The work we are doing is trying to usher our customers and the industry into a different way of doing things, and automated threat intelligence sharing across the different domains of organisations’ cyber security architecture is just one example. “In today’s world, most people don’t have a mechanism where their network appliances can signal their endpoint and their cloud and have that show up automatically in the security operations centre. That doesn’t exist. Each one of those tends to be in silos, with organisations typically collecting logs in a security operations centre to decide what to do. “We are making investments in automation and in real threat intelligence sharing, and that is a different way of operating to what most security shops are doing today,” he says. “This notion of an integrated ecosystem, bringing different pieces together, trying to drive more of a solutions orientation, is a real change course – not only for industry suppliers, but also for customers in terms of how they buy, deploy and use technology.” CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

Intel's Beignet Lands LLVM 4.0 Backend Support Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 13 April 2017 at 07:27 AM EDT. Add A Comment While Intel's Beignet is a terrific project especially when it comes to being a leading open-source OpenCL implementation that works with OpenCL 2.0 on GPUs (something that can't be said for Radeon with its open-source OpenCL stack consistently lacking and Nouveau not really being usable either), the sad part of it is that Beignet is consistently slow in supporting new versions of LLVM. Beignet leverages LLVM for its OpenCL implementation for Intel HD/Iris Graphics hardware. As we've seen with past versions, it's usually not until well after the latest upstream LLVM release that we see support in this Intel open-source project. The latest example is that LLVM 4.0 was released one month ago while finally overnight we see LLVM 4.0 support land in Beignet Git. Now when this LLVM 4.0 support for Beignet ends up in a released version of the OpenCL driver remains another question. With around 200 lines of code changed, Beignet should now work with LLVM 4.0. Great to see this happening and am excited to try this Intel OpenCL stack with the updated LLVM. At the same time, they've dropped support for LLVM 3.3 and older. Hopefully with LLVM 5.0 later this year we'll see a quicker turnaround time on Beignet support.

We like this definition. VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 13, 2017 / YDreams Global Interactive Technologies Inc. (TSXV: YD) (OTC PINK: YDRM) (FSE: APY) (“YDreams Global” or the “Company”), a creative and technology supplier for Fortune 500 brands such as Cisco, Qualcomm, Intel and Coca-Cola, released a new project for Bob’s, one of the most traditional fast-food chains in Brazil, that recently celebrated its 65 anniversary alongside its franchisees by taking a dive into virtual reality. Bob’s, the Brazilian fast-food giant, created a concept store through Virtual and Augmented Reality. Store owners were invited to the brand’s biggest event in Brazil and experienced an immersive 3D exhibition in order to learn more about the project. With over a 1,000 stores in three countries, Bob’s is the third largest fast-food chain in Brazil, where they are part of the BFFC group which also owns KFC and Pizza Hut. For their 2017 convention, they invited more than 1,000 franchisees and their families to introduce them firsthand to Bob’s new concept store. YDreams Global was Bob’s creative and technology partner for this experience. The public received Virtual Reality (“VR”) goggles for a deep immersion experience. With a simple head movement, they could explore the entire 3D environment of the new concept store and choose specific points whenever they wanted more details. The 360&#186; scope of the VR environment brought everything to life right from the main entrance and it was possible to interact with hotspots to learn more about the new concept store and its features. “The idea was to display the new store in a creative way, since it will be the main model for future stores of the Bob’s brand,” stated YDreams Global’s CEO, Daniel Japiassu. “The client’s efforts in seeking innovative solutions, alongside our experience in implementing projects such as this with short deadlines, were key to a successful event. This concept could be a strong recurring growth driver for YDreams in the future and highlights our continued ability to work with Fortune 500 companies and highly recognizable branded companies.” At the YDreams booth, the public could also view the new store’s plan through an Augmented Reality (“AR”) application. According to YDreams CEO, “VR and AR experiences are a perfect way to demonstrate YDreams’ “Sensorial Technology” business pillar in a more engaging fashion. We feel that a conventional presentation would not convey the intended message for this project. By showcasing the new store through VR and AR, the public had a much better perception of the end result and all the effort made by Bob’s.” Ana Ven&#226;ncio, from Bob’s Development Division, stated: “The event was really a success; I believe we reached a new level in the way we showcase and present our business.” About YDreams Global YDreams Global Interactive Technologies Inc.

Montage Tech plans to set up a new production base for the manufacture of CPU solutions targeted specifically at data center and cloud computing applications in the Kunshan Economic and Technological Development Zone, according to company CEO Howard Yang. The facility will be ready for commercial production of the chips in 2018. Montage Tech is committed to participating in the local IC industry development in Kunshan, said Yang, adding that the company is looking to partner with other companies located in the area to expand its business in the data center and other emerging markets. Montage Tech's Jintide-series processors and the company's proprietary HSDIMM (hybrid security DIMM) memory technology are the core of Montage Tech's CPU solutions for data centers and cloud computing, Yang indicated. Montage is developing its Jintide chip platform jointly with Tsinghua University and Intel. Intel in early 2016 disclosed it had formed strategic collaborations with Tsinghua University (TU) and Montage Tech to bring locally developed, indigenous solutions to meet specific requirements for data center infrastructure in China. Montage Tech will commercialize its new products that use Intel's Xeon processors and TU's reconfigurable computing processor (RCP) and deliver them to the China market in 2017, according to Intel. Montage Tech is expected to use 28nm process technology to build its new CPU solutions for data centers and cloud computing, according to industry sources. Based in Shanghai, Montage Tech was founded in 2004 specializing in analog and mixed-signal ICs. The company was acquired by state-owned Shanghai Pudong Science and Technology Investment in 2014. In other news, the Kunshan Economic and Technological Development Zone in early 2017 launched a CNY10 billion (US$1.45 billion) IC industry investment fund. About CNY1 billion will be initially poured into the development of the local IC industry to support chipmakers located in the Kunshan Economic and Technological Development Zone and attract new investments. The funds are also meant to enourage local chipmakers to carry out M&A activities.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel’s X299 HEDT Platform with LGA 2066 Socket Codenamed ‘Basin Falls’ – Launch Pushed Forward to Computex 2017 in June By Usman Pirzada Apr 9, 2017 197Shares Share Tweet Submit Overview of Intel's X299 HEDT platform codenamed Basin Falls. It looks like Intel’s upcoming X299 platform will be codenamed Basin Falls and will be launching sometime in June. The leak stems from Benchlife.info, a very reliable source we have been using for almost a decade. Not only has the code-name been leaked, but in typical benchlife style, they have also given a lot of details regarding the platform as well. Intel’s upcoming X299 HEDT platform codenamed ‘Basin Falls’  detailed, launching in June at Computex 2017 The previous date for the release of HEDT X299 platform was rumored to be around Gamescom sometimes in August, but Benchlife claims this is going to happen by Computex this year – and they have a very good reason for doing so as we will soon see. The event is going to be held from May 31 to June 3, and it looks like Intel is planning on launching the brand new Basin Falls X299 platform at that time. Related Rumor: Intel Could Commercialize A 12 Core/ 24 Thread Skylake-X CPU To Fight Ryzen – Reports Italian Publication Production schedule of Kaby Lake X and Sky Lake X. Skylake-X processor production is slated for the 25th week of the year, or late June (19th – 25th). Kabylake-X processor production is slated for the same time span as Skylake-X. Qualification of the samples will take place between May 29th– June 4th.  Since this is pretty much the same time frame as Computex, we can see why Benchlife is claiming an unveiling event at Computex. We should also expect to see a showcase of motherboards from various manufacturers. Advertisement The HEDT launch lineup will include at least four SKUs that will make their way to the X299 platform. All processors will utilize the 14nm process node, however, the Kaby Lake-X chips may have a slight edge due to the process optimizations. This would result in better clock speeds with reduced power consumption, adding to the efficiency. The four SKUs will include a 10 core, 8 core, 6 core and 4 core model. The 10, 8 and 6 core models will be based on Skylake architecture. The 4 core model will be based on the Kaby Lake architecture which launched on mainstream platforms earlier this month. All Skylake-X chips will feature a rated TDP of 140W while the Kaby Lake-X chip will feature a TDP of 112W. All chips will be marketed as the Core i7-7000 series processors utilize the LGA 2066 socket. The LGA 2066 socket of the HEDT Basin Falls platform is called Socket R4. SKL-X will have up to 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 68 lanes) while as Kaby Lake-X will have only up to 16 PCIe 3.0 lanes (a total of 40 lanes). Skylake-X will have qud channel DDR 4 memory up to 2667 in 1DPC mode and up to 2400 in 2DPC mode. Kabylake-X on the other hand will only have dual channel DDR4. The Kaby Lake PCH will have 24 PCIe 3.0 lanes, 8 Sata Gen3, 10 USB 3.0 pots and connected via 4 DMI 3.0 lanes to the processor. Intel LAN (Jacksonville PHY) will also be present on the chipset.

Since Windows ME (which, I’ve been reliably informed, doesn’t stand for ‘Mistake Edition’)? Ever? From this point onwards, those still using Vista are on their own. Microsoft will no longer issue bug fixes and security updates. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY Those who continue to use Vista essentially put themselves at risk. For most people, this isn’t an issue. Scarce few people still use it. According to NetMarketShare, its user-base totaled 0.72 percent of operating systems in March. It’s interesting to note that the response to Vista’s discontinuation is subdued – especially when compared to Windows XP, which even today continues to command a sizable market share. Nobody really cares. There’s scarce moaning, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. But that’s because Vista was shit. Actually, honest-to-god awful, and the team who worked on it should be made to sit in a corner to think about what they’ve done, like naughty schoolchildren. I suppose our little retrospective should start at its launch. Initially, Microsoft made confident claims about how most computers on the market would be able to handle Vista, and how consumers would be able to use their old hardware. There would be no need to buy a new computer, or fork out for upgrades. Yeah, that was a lie. At launch, Vista’s hardware support was spotty, with the operating system lacking support for major and mainstream hardware components. At the time, The Register’s Thomas C Greene wrote an entertaining post about how Vista couldn’t support even the most vanilla of internals. … imagine my surprise when the [Vista Update] Advisor reported that several devices might not be compatible with Vista. And just look at how mainstream these “questionable” items are: nVidia GeForce 7900; Creative X-Fi Audio Processor; Intel 82566DC Gigabit Network Connection; Intel ICH8 Family USB Universal Host Controller; Intel ICH8 Family USB2 Enhanced Host Controller. Others were less stoic about the situation. A visit to YouTube shows the strength of feeling from those who actually forked out for it, only for it to fail to install. Worse, some laptops shipped with Vista Capable stickers, and marketed as such, when they actually weren’t. This lead to a lengthy legal battle between Microsoft and several pissed off consumers, which Microsoft eventually won after the judge stripped the claim of its class action status. Those that eventually got the OS working quickly found that it ran like a dog – a bloated, wheezy, snoring, asthmatic dog. With three legs. And arthritis. And a 40-a-day smoking habit. You get the idea. Yes, folks. Vista was slow. It ran tasks measurably slower than Windows XP, with those who opted to activate Aero and its other visual bells-and-whistles facing the brunt of its performance issues. Sure, you could turn them off, leaving you with a more austere Windows XP-like experience. But given the major selling point of Vista was the fact that it was a novel and visually pleasing take on the Windows experience, this kinda defeated the point. As a partial defense of Vista, Microsoft did try things here that remain in later versions of Windows. Vista pioneered UAC (User Account Control), which remains a cornerstone of Microsoft’s strategy for Windows security. But it did so in a way that was so ill-conceived and ham-fisted, that it pissed off a lot of people. In fact, UAC on Vista sucked so much, people started to routinely disable it, which ironically made them more insecure. The biggest kick in the teeth was that Vista was really expensive. A fresh install of Vista Ultimate Edition would set you back $399, while the cheapest version, Vista Basic, retailed for $199. Essentially, people paid huge sums of money for an operating system that was slower, and was arguably worse, than its predecessor. And that’s just skimming the surface. Although it feels ages ago now, at the time, Vista was a deeply unpopular product, with a seemingly countless number of flaws. Thankfully, Microsoft has moved on. Windows 7 showed that the company was responsive to feedback, and improved on the errors of its predecessor. Windows 8 was a bit of a mixed bag, although it it was nice to see the company take seriously the increasing pivot to touch-based interfaces. And then there’s Windows 10, which is a very solid operating system indeed. It could be argued that it represents Microsoft’s finest hour, and hows that the company can be ambitious, while also caring deeply about the end-user experience. Given this impressive progress, I don’t think anyone will really miss Vista.

Privacy RSS Steam Twitter Facebook Login RPS Feature Your Nvidia Titan Xp has little to fear Home Hardware What Xbox ‘Project Scorpio’ means for PC gaming By Jeremy Laird on April 13th, 2017 at 9:00 pm. Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Microsoft has dished the deets on its upcoming ‘Scorpio’ hardware update for the Xbox console, and in what amounts to uncharacteristic detail and candour given the ruddy thing isn’t going on sale until the end of 2017. But what are we poor PC peasants to make of the Beast of Redmond’s latest game box and its towering on-paper capabilities? In short, what influence will Project Scorpio’s trick new hardware have on future PC games? As ever with such developments, there is no single and simple answer. Scorpio’s hardware is at the very least a tale of two halves even if they are crammed into a single computer chip or SoC. I speak, of course, of the critical CPU and graphics elements. The media razzmatazz has largely centred on the graphics half of the equation and there’s no denying Scorpio packs some serious pixel-pumping power for a grotty little games console. The headline figures for the GPU rock in at 40 so-called compute units running at 1,172MHz. That compares with ye olde Xbox One’s 12 units at 853MHz and the One S with the same number again, albeit running at 914MHz. It’s AMD, of course, who supplies both the graphics and the CPU designs for the Xbox and, in the Red Team’s standard parlance, a compute unit packs 64 of those, er, shader thingies that make the pixels look so very pretty. We’re talking 768 shaders in the Xbox One and 2,560 of the bump-mapping blighters in Scorpio. If that sounds impressive, AMD’s current fastest GPU, the elderly Radeon R9 Fury X packs 4,096 shaders. And lest you forget, the Fury X is a generation behind and not nearly as fast as Nvidia’s best GPU du jour, the preposterous Titan Xp. On the CPU side of the Scorpio equation, Microsoft has stuck with eight low-power AMD Jaguar-derived cores, albeit running upclocked from 1.75GHz to 2.3Ghz and benefiting from several detail tweaks. The other major part of the package involves the memory and bandwidth combo, which in these consoles is a little more complex given the single-chip architecture means shared memory for GPU and CPU. Anyway, there’s a healthy uptick here too, from 218GB/s and 8GB to 326GB/s and 12GB. The very first observation to make is that while Scorpio moves the game on massively for consoles, it is not exactly frightening today’s high-end PC hardware, much less what will be available when Scorpio actually arrives and, in turn, the PC hardware that will appear over Scorpio’s lifetime. For some perspective, consider that main Scorpio CPU-GPU-SoC thing as a whole clocks in at seven billion transistors. That’s for everything – the CPU, the graphics, the other SoC gubbins, the lot. Nvidia’s biggest GPU, as found in the silly new Titan Xp and indeed the slightly more sensible 1080Ti, packs no fewer than 12 billion transistors. Add billions more for Intel’s finest CPU and a bleeding edge PC’s CPU and GPU alone are more than twice as complex. Even the next tier down in Nvidia’s GPU range, the GTX 1070 and the vanilla GTX 1080 are alone about on a par for complexity with the unified Scorpio chip. So while consoles tend to do more with less, there’s a limit to that philosophy. The PC’s performance and fidelity advantage isn’t being challenged. That’s especially true when it comes to the CPU side of things. Put simply, Scorpio’s CPU cores continue to suck. A fair bit of Microsoft guff has been regurgitated by the tame media regarding Scorpio’s modified cores, the reduced internal latency, 31 per cent faster core clocks, how the new SoC is more customised than before. But I’m not terribly impressed. Clearly, they’re still mostly the the same crappy low-power cores as before, not proper desktop cores. Ermegerd, is that a magnetic hard drive? Put another way, remember what a kicking AMD got for the poor performance of its outgoing FX PC processor? Well, it’s a hell of a lot better than the CPU in any Xbox, including Scorpio. Even AMD’s new Ryzen CPU has been taking a bit of a beating for supposed iffy gaming performance. It would completely obliterate the feeble cores in Scorpio. That’s the disappointing bit, then: That the initial development target for a lot of games for several years to come will still be a system with pretty pathetic CPU cores. The rub here is that while it’s relatively straightforward to add at least some graphical detail to a game when porting for the PC (just chucking in some high res textures can do a power of good for the look of a game), taking advantage of additional PC processor power tends to require a more fundamental rethink of the game engine and indeed the game itself. Which, let’s be honest, isn’t usually going to happen. The exception to all this and what might – just might – prove a saving grace, is the new so-called GPU Command Processor in Scorpio. It’s basically a section of dedicated circuitry on the main SoC design to run DirectX 12 API invocations. In English? Think of it as a DX12 hardware accelerator for some of the more CPU-intensive bits of the game engine like draw calls. It could be a game changer by freeing up even Scorpio’s weak CPU cores to do interesting and innovative things. But it’s far too early to say for sure. If that’s the bad and yet-to-be-proven news, the good is that Scorpio’s focus on pukka 4K capability means that developers will put a lot of effort into making games look great at high resolutions. To pinch a quote from Kevin Gammill, Group Program Director of the Xbox Core platform, “it’s about delivering those pixels with 4K assets, so they look great. It’s about delivering those pixels with HDR and wide colour gamut fidelity. It’s about delivering those pixels with no loss of frame-rate compared to the 1080p version of that title – that’s super-important to us.” In other words, proper high-res textures, geometry and effects that on the one hand really make the most of the detail 4K can deliver and on the other are optimised to reduce performance overheads. And, of course, Scorpio should accelerate the development of games with proper HDR support, which is just another string in developer’s bows when it comes to making games look awesome. Of course, you very likely don’t have a 4K PC screen and you almost certainly don’t have an HDR monitor. But all that should still benefit PC-relevant resolutions like 2,560 by 1,440, otherwise known as 1440p, that sit in between full 4K and 1080p. One part of the Scorpio graphical package for which the benefits to the PC remain to be seen involves tweaks to the graphics engine that go beyond simply adding more functional units. Apparently, Microsoft and presumably AMD took a good look at how developers actually make game engines and then tweaked detailed aspects of the graphics architecture to suit. That’s not going to help existing PC graphics cards. But will we see any of those same hardware tweaks in AMD’s new Vega GPUs, due later this year? My guess is that we may see some similar elements, but probably not everything. So the benefit-cost calculation for the PC in that regard remains to be seen. Overall, Scorpio looks like it’ll be a great thing for PC gaming in terms of plain old eye candy. Whether it will enable more innovation and complexity at the core of game engines is a tougher question and will likely depend on how that funky hardware DX12 setup engine in the Scorpio SoC pans out.

There are still better Intel chips (usually for more money) but with R5, Ryzen looks to be at LEAST comparable price/performance wise. It’s a shame that Scorpio doesn’t seem to be enjoying the Ryzen improvements.

When all you can do is slightly upgrade the power and add useless features like social media, you prove there is no next gen. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 00:38 particlese says: They’re supposedly also stuffing all the Freesync 2 stuff into the thinger, which should mean low-faff HDR/high-bpp/wide-gamut capabilities will (hopefully) catch on sooner than if it were just AMD pleading with display companies to make things lovelier for us. It’ll spread the joy of non-proprietary variable refresh rate around a bit more, too, although I haven’t myself found that to be the revelatory feature some profess it to be. On the minus side, that’ll all supposedly be implemented exclusively via HDMI, so they’re missing the opportunity to encourage display manufacturers to bung our lovely royalty-free display port into their super-sized photon launchers. Not that it makes a ton of difference in practice, but HDMI is the only display interface which has ever caused me problems, and it did so for a while in various ways, so I tend to be a jerk to it when the opportunity presents itself. So basically, I’d love to someday see a 50″+ screen with Display Port, high (120Hz+) refresh rates which aren’t just marketing “features”, and user-friendly HDR/bpp/gamutStuff; and this newfangled thinger looks to be encouraging much of that.

I know you covered the standards themselves in a previous article, but I’d be interested to know your thoughts on the effects of this support on the PC / Monitor market. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:46 Jeremy Laird says: Good question. First part of the answer would involve the extent to which games use monitors on consoles. I don’t know the answer to that, but my hunch is the heavy majority of consoles are hooked up to TVs. That said, I happen to know from some corporate work I did recently that at least some monitor makers are very keen to sell screens to console gamers. So, I’d expect at least some to try to crack the market by offering a ‘full’ console experience. Whether TVs will fully support it all is a separate question. Do TV makers engineer for console specifically? Honestly, I don’t know. My knowledge of that aspect of the TV market is pretty thin. That said, HDR is quickly becoming the norm as is HDMI 2.0. My experience recently with an HDR TV is that everything works much more seamlessly than before. Hooking a modern PC up to a 4K TV is a non issue in terms of the res, if not perhaps HDR functionality, for now. That said, I think that most of the features of Freesync 2 if not necessarily Freesync 2 itself along with higher bandwidth interfaces are going to become pretty common. Things have been developing pretty fast in the last couple of years and I don’t see that stopping. Displays just keep getting better.

All Xbox and PS4 games till now are built from the ground up for the Jaguar CPU architecture. They wouldn’t run on Ryzen’s “Zen” architecture without an update for every current gen game ever made. Log in to Reply 14/04/2017 at 01:36 Jeremy Laird says: Jaguar is x86. Ryzen is x86. They are cross compatible except where Ryzen has additional extensions. Ryzen is in effect a superset of Jaguar in terms of the instruction set. So basically, no.

It’s about delivering those pixels with no loss of frame-rate compared to the 1080p version of that title – that’s super-important to us.” It’s odd, how they expect to get more than 4 times more work out of less than 4 times the computational power.

This is not a new generation of consoles, it’s not an Xbox 4, in the same way a PS4 Pro is not a PS5. The baseline/lowest common denominator for game development (excluding the Switch) is still the original Xbone. Games are still going to be developed first and foremost to run on that and the original PS4. All Scorpio will do is (notionally) provide some higher framerates and resolutions (and the jury is out on just how well it will actually perform in practice). So nothing will change for PC going forward in the short to medium turn. We’ll still get the same poorly optimised ports that, on a design basis, are hamstrung by the hardware limitations of the Xbone. Log in to Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Windows 7 has ended its mainstream support such as functionality improvements since January 2015.  As a result, Microsoft will only be releasing security related updates for those with earlier processor models.  Although Windows 8.1 is still in mainstream support, Microsoft has for some reason chosen to discontinue support for new processors even though it remains in mainstream support until January 2018. Users that tried spoofing a Kaby Lake processor inside a VirtualBox running Windows 7 were able to trigger the same issue.  Once they install the April 2017 security only or roll-up update, Windows will no longer check for updates.  Each time the computer is booted, it displays the “Unsupported Hardware” after a few minutes.  It appears that manual standalone updates are also blocked, such as the following screenshot MrBrian posted on AskWoody: Based on his testing, once he uninstalled the April 2017 security update or roll-up, he was able to install other updates again, including standalone updates.  One workaround another user suggested is to install the monthly/roll-up update last.  Then when Microsoft releases the next monthly roll-up, uninstall the last roll-up update, then install the other security updates and finally install the new monthly roll-up.

Supplier Talks About A11 Chip Tech This new technology, which promises performance and area benefits over its older tech, is ready to produce Apple's next chips. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Apr 13, 2017 at 7:00PM Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) reported its first-quarter earnings and held a conference call discussing the results, outlook, and technology development progress and ramp-up plans. It is widely believed that Apple's A11 chip, which will power the company's iPhone lineup this year, will be manufactured by TSMC using its brand-new 10-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel. The 10-nanometer technology, TSMC has indicated previously, should enable performance and power benefits, as well as a significant transistor area reduction, relative to its 16-nanometer technology, which is currently used to produce some of Apple's A9 chips and all its A10 chips. On TSMC's first-quarter earnings call, the company provided some insight into its progress and revenue expectations vis-a-vis the 10-nanometer technology. Let's go over what the chipmaker had to say. Qualified for production, ready to ramp TSMC co-CEO C.C. Wei said that the 10-nanometer technology, referred to as N10, from "[research and development] to operation in both Fab 12 in Hsinchu and Fab 15 in Taichung and is ready for high-volume production." Wei conceded that this technology is "very challenging," but claimed that the company's manufacturing yield progress is "slightly ahead of schedule" (although it's important to point out that without knowledge of the original schedule, this statement doesn't mean much). Wei also explained that the production ramp-up of its 10-nanometer technology "will be very fast in the second half of this year" and said that the company expects 10-nanometer wafer shipments to contribute "about 10%" of the company's wafer revenue during 2017. That's a lot of iPhone chips Consider that TSMC's revenue from 10-nanometer chips in the first quarter was zero and that its revenue from 10-nanometer chip shipments in the second quarter is likely to be small. For it to make up 10% of the company's total revenue for the year, TSMC is going to need to ship a gargantuan amount of 10-nanometer wafers in the second half of the year. There are only two potential chip vendors that could consume enough leading-edge wafers to drive the kind revenue that TSMC seems to be expecting, and one of them is already known to not be using TSMC, so we know it must be Apple. What this means for Apple For three product generations in a row, Apple has been forced to use manufacturing technology with roughly the same manufacturing density -- 20 nanometer for the A8, and 16 nanometer (which was 20 nanometer with higher-performance transistors grafted on) for the A9 and A10. Apple has managed to increase the amount of performance and functionality of its chips in that time through architectural innovations, transistor performance improvements, and die size growth, but at some point, meaningful improvements without a bigger leap in manufacturing technology become harder to achieve. With 10-nanometer technology, Apple should be able to substantially increase the number of transistors that it allocates to the functionality baked into the chip. This, in a nutshell, means greater performance and feature potential than what would have otherwise been possible. It'll be interesting to see, come this fall, just how Apple chose to utilize this new 10-nanometer technology in its new iPhone models. Considering just how important this year's iPhones are, though, I'm expecting something awesome.  Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple.

Burger King's 'connected' ad triggers Google Home. Credit: Burger King Burger King's move this week to trigger a Google Home response from a TV ad proved that stunt marketing, when done right, still works, at least in terms of earning free media attention. But the feat also showed how audio, as much as visuals, is emerging as a critical branding consideration as voice-powered personal assistants like Alexa rise in popularity and so-called "hearables" -- like smart headphones -- enter the market. This new audio era is a throwback to the days when radio ads ruled, but with a twist: Instead of simply talking at consumers, new technologies have allowed brands to have a two-way voice dialogue. "There are definitely a lot of very solid fundamentals and best practices from communicating with people via radio that we can take into this space, but then there are some things that are new," said Tom Kelshaw, director of creative technology at WPP media agency Maxus, who is working on a white paper on the topic. "Radio doesn't know anything about you. It's not addressable. It's not context aware." Related Stories The Whopper Lives! Burger King's 'Connected' Ad Triggers Google Home Once Again Perfecting your brand's sound is also important in traditional media because viewers are more distracted than ever before. "You might be supposedly watching a TV show but actually you are texting your friend and looking up something online," said Colleen Fahey, U.S. managing director of audio branding agency Sixième Son. But "if you avert your eyes, your ears are still hearing and you don't have to be listening to be hearing." Below, some audio branding tips: Define your audio DNA Everyone knows about audio logos, like Intel's familiar four-note signature. But Fahey, co-author of "Audio Branding: Using Sound to Build Your Brand," advocates that brands go further to create an audio style guide that can be used to create a consistent sound across everything from ads to on-hold music and the sound played at trade show booths. Brands run into trouble when they make these choices in isolation. Huggies once used different sounds all over the world. But Sixième Son recently created a 46-second audio DNA soundtrack for the brand combining playful music, a baby cooing and a mother humming meant to replicate the sound of a mother and child bonding. The sound identity is now being used in ads all over the world. Here is the audio logo played at the end of ads: When Coke launched its new global campaign last year, it paid close attention to sound, creating a new audio signature with vendor Deviant Ventures that combines audio of a bottle opening with "ahhhh" and the "Taste the Feeling" song verse. "The sound of a brand sticks with people and becomes part of pop culture," said Coca-Cola Group Director of Global Entertainment Marketing Joe Belliotti. He added that sounds "can endure longer than most other pieces of marketing. This gives brands a great opportunity as consumer attention turns to new ways of engaging with technology." In a Tumblr post on the topic, Belliotti issued the following brand sound quiz. Can you name each brand? (*Answers at bottom of this post.) Be the default Picture an online product search. It returns plenty of choices visually. Now imagine that same search only using audio. "If you ask Siri to order you a pizza, it doesn't doesn't reel off every pizza brand that is available. It just goes and does it based on some configuration that you have," Kelshaw said. Voice interaction is "going to privilege the leader or the default, or the pre-selected," he added. So "get ready to start having the discussion with the people who control or aggregate audiences such as Amazon or Google," he said, noting that these discussions are typically held in the sales department, not marketing. Try augmented audio Kelshaw predicts we could soon reach "peak screen" in which people can't use screens like smartphone displays more than they already do. So brands must be prepared to reach consumers in other ways, including via augmented audio powered via smartphone sensors or wearables. He pointed to technology like a wireless smart earbud brand called Here One by Doppler Labs that allows listeners to control real-world sound. The brand recently partnered with the Cleveland Cavaliers, using its "layered listening" technology to allow fans to selectively filter out crowd noise, or stream play-by-play commentary and stats over the real-world sounds of the game. Give your chatbot a voice Most artificial intelligence-powered chatbots communicate via text, like the "TacoBot" Deutsch created for Taco Bell that allows consumers to place orders via Slack. Tacobot Credit: Taco Bell But Deutsch Chief Digital Officer Winston Binch envisions that bots will soon seamlessly toggle between voice and text commands. The need to communicate via voice is "going to catch a lot of brands by surprise," said Binch, whose agency has formed a new AI and bots division called Great Machine. "This is all theory but we do know that with the investments being made by the tech giants in voice and AI that this world is going to be there pretty quickly." *Brand sound quiz answers: Note: The NFL sound is actually the theme song for the NFL on Fox.

She pointed to special elections this year in Georgia and Kansas, where Republicans have faced closer than expected races, in arguing that resistance to Trump has already started. "Historically an unpopular president will cost his party seats in the house during midterms. We saw that in 2010 with Obama, and Trump is even less popular than Obama was," she explained. Snow plans to target Stewart's "problematic" support for Trump's proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border as one of her campaign's central issues, as well as air pollution in Utah, which she calls a "huge problem."  She argued that her failed Senate bid left her more equipped to run for national office. She won the Democratic Party's nomination for Senate in Utah last year but was soundly defeated by Lee. "I learned many things. I learned how to fundraise. I got much better at speaking, learned how to debate, learned how to get out the vote," she said, emphasizing the need to start campaigning earlier. Snow received national media attention for being the first transgender woman to run for Senate in the U.S. Her campaign platform was similar to that of Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / Virtual Reality / HP is finally launching its vaunted portable VR system, the Omen X VR Backpack HP is finally launching its vaunted portable VR system, the Omen X VR Backpack Paul Taylor 11 hours ago Virtual Reality Almost a year after the initial news broke, HP’s foray into VR technology will finally reach shops come June this year, reports PC World. Little is known of the device’s specs, however. HP has disclosed it will weigh 4.5 Kgs (10 lbs), include dual batteries for hot-swapping without powering down the system. The batteries are carried at waist-level as part of the backpack’s harness. It will use a low-power Intel CPU but an as-of-yet unknown GPU. The shell includes two type-C USB 3.0 ports and one HDMI port for connectivity. It will also have audio out and a power plug for your VR headset of choice. The design was primarily created for the likes of the HTC Vive, but it should work with just about any VR headset. With the Omen X VR Backpack, the headset is connected directly to the device strapped to your back, leaving you with freedom of movement for VR/AR funtage. Omen X Backpacks will come in two flavours, according to Ron Coughlin, president of the Personal Systems Business at HP – one for gamers and another for more commercial applications. HP is actively pursuing VR development and inviting app developers and gamers to come up with new apps and uses for the device, but it is a safe bet the military-industrial complex will be happy to contribute. The military are particularly interested in the device for training purposes, according PC World. The company has not yet announced any pricing, but according to the article it’ll carry a hefty price tag due to the component requirements – a powerful CPU and GPU, together with other more robust components that can handle being strapped to your back. Some competitors are already shipping competing products, such as the Zotac VR Go ($1,750) and MSI’s VR One ($1,899), while Dell will be showing off its Alienware-branded model soon. KitGuru Says: Expect an Omen-branded backpack PC/VR system to cost an arm and a leg, HP is making no fuss about it, but (apart from military applications) these devices still need a “killer app” to give them the boost they need.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft starts blocking updates for Windows 7 and 8.1 on new processors 1 by Mehedi Hassan  @mehedih_ Apr 13, 2017 at 19:02 GMT12 hours ago Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it won’t be supporting old versions of Windows on new processors. The company clarified its plans regarding supporting older versions of Windows on new processors last month. As we reported, Microsoft is going to stop updates from Windows Update on new processors running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. And now, Microsoft has finally started blocking updates for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 on PCs with new processors. So for instance, if you have a PC with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and use Windows 7 on it, you will no longer get updates on it — including all of the important security updates. Microsoft is also blocking updates on AMD’s Ryzen systems, as well as some Intel Skylake systems. When you try to download updates via Windows Update on a PC that’s running the new processors, you will simply see a message from Windows Update saying: “Your PC uses a processor that is designed for the latest version of Windows. Because the processor is not supported together with the Windows version that you are currently using, your system will miss the important security updates.” Microsoft dropping support for older Windows versions on new processors isn’t surprising to see at all. Windows 7, for instance, is currently in extended support since January 2015 and it’s been more than 2 years since mainstream support for the OS was dropped. Windows 8.1, on the other hand, is set to leave mainstream support early next year. Extended support for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 is still not going to end before 2020 — but you’ll be making a huge mistake if you decide to continue using the older versions of Windows until then due to all the security issues.

The University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo will compete against each other and six American schools with the goal of autonomous driving in an urban setting by 2020. General Motors and SAE International, an engineering association, have launched the competition designed for undergraduate students that they’ve dubbed the “AutoDrive Challenge.” Tim Barfoot, an engineering professor with the University of Toronto who is overseeing his school’s team, said student demand is intense just days after last week’s announcement that the university had been accepted as a competitor. “There’s something about turning a robot into a vehicle that really captures people’s imaginations,” Barfoot said, adding 250 students have expressed interest in joining the team. “When you can sit inside the robot and it’s driving around, that’s a totally different experience than watching it from the outside.” The other schools competing are Kettering University, Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, North Carolina A&T University, Texas A&M University and Virginia Tech. Each school will receive a Chevrolet Bolt, General Motors’ new electric car, to work on. Intel will provide the computers needed and third parties will provide sensors. The rest will be up to the students. Next spring the schools will enter the first phase of the competition that will test straight roadway driving and object avoidance. By the third and final phase, which will take place at General Motors’ test facility in Yuma, Ariz., the cars will be navigating a complex urban setting, according to General Motors Canada spokesperson Uzma Mustafa. The upshot for General Motors is simple: they’re looking to create a pipeline of well-trained engineers to hire in the company’s big push towards self-driving cars and related technologies. At an event with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last June, the Detroit-based car company announced it was looking to hire about 700 engineers in the next few years, many of whom will work at a new automotive software development centre in Markham, Ont. “We have cars being tested in the United States and this is a good talent pool to see where the ideas are,” Mustafa said. Derek Rayside, an electrical and computer engineering professor at the University of Waterloo who is overseeing his school’s team, said the competition is unique because it is geared for undergraduate students. Artificial intelligence research is a booming field at his school, he said, with at least 20 professors working on various aspects of it, including many in the automotive area. But much of that research is limited to professors, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students. “At the undergraduate level, it’s often difficult for those students, to get into that area of research,” Rayside said. “You can’t just do this on your own _ you need all this infrastructure, like the car, the computers, the sensors.” Both schools say their teams will be large. Barfoot thinks his team will have 100 students, but he’s now scrambling to figure out how to accommodate everyone who is interested. Rayside thinks his team will be upwards of 50 students, but admits that could number could grow. “There is huge, huge interest here, in just a few days,” Rayside said, noting his university has already selected a name for the car: WATonomous. The goal is to achieve what’s known as “level four” autonomy by the end of the competition, Rayside said. “That’s a very ambitious goal, but it’s good to have ambitious goals,” he said. Level zero is no automation, Rayside explained. “Level one is stuff like lane-keeping, so you start drifting out of the lane and the car can nudge you back into the lane and that’s on the market now,” he said. “Level two is stuff like the car senses there might be a collision and it applies emergency braking before you can get your foot down. That is on the market now and there is data that shows that this is making the world a safer place.” At level three, the car starts driving on its own, which isn’t available to the public, but exists at research facilities, he said, including at the University of Waterloo, where the self-driving “Autonomoose” _ developed by a team of professors, researchers and graduate students _ is being tested. “For levels three and four, the car is allowed to ask the human for help, if it’s confused and not sure what to do,” Rayside said. “At level five, the car is not allowed to ask for help. Nobody can do level 5 and nobody is even close to level 5.” Like Us Follow @cdnbiz Subscribe with Texture Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy.

This novice-oriented tool lets you view and organize all your video clips shot on an iPhone, GoPro action cam or high-resolution videocam in one place and create movies with a polished sheen. With iMovie, you can edit movies at up to 4K and 1080p and 60 fps. You can stabilize and fine-tune each clip with color correction and special video and audio effects for realistic action footage. With its built-in trailers and themes, iMovie provides the scaffolding to assist budding filmmakers.   Interface While iMovie is easy to use, it's not as initially intuitive as some might expect from Apple software. Like Photoshop Elements, Corel VideoStudio, CyberLink PowerDirector and other competitors, iMovie builds in a library of title styles, transitions and audio tools. Unlike Photoshop Elements and VideoPad, the iMovie interface is subtle, with multiple ways to accomplish tasks and no obvious way to get started. It's helpful to consult the documentation first. Themes provide an automatic way to give your videos some polish. Trailers forces you to storyboard your work in a professional way, supplying a structure for different kinds of clips and movies. As expected, iMovie is directly interoperable with macOS via the Import command, offering access to your entire file system where you can access all your images, videos and tunes. An uncluttered interface masks a plethora of controls.One potential obstacle to newcomers is that iMovie rejects direct import of DRM-protected files. So if you are using protected audio or video imported from your iTunes library, you may need to convert those files to a nonprotected format first. MORE: Best Video-Editing Software Under $100 Features The Trailers feature on iMovie inspires creative presentations and offers a template on how to organize and present your videos, even if your specific movie does not neatly fit into Apple's prefab categorical styles. Why? Because Trailers literally forces you to storyboard your work in a professional way, supplying a structure for different kinds of clips and movies. The program's themes are also useful, especially since they provide as much or as little direction as you want. Introduce your cat video with a Hollywood-style movie trailer.Not interested in a trailer? No problem. Just click the Create New button in the Projects browser and start pulling in your clips. iMovie's simple interface tucks most of the app's controls under nine icons on the upper right of the window. A universal enhancement button offers single-click improvement to selected clips, while more-granular controls for color balance and correction, cropping, stabilization, volume, noise reduction, speed, and special effects are also available. Newer versions of the software now support the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar.Trailers are a cool way to ease into the moviemaking process, but you still need the right kind of footage to make these short pieces look good.If you need features like motion tracking, you'll want to consider shelling out for Adobe Premiere Elements. And if you're intent on handling 360-degree video or multicam editing, you'll need to switch to Windows and use CyberLink PowerDirector, Corel VideoStudio or Magix Movie Edit Pro Plus. Performance I tested iMovie on a MacBook Air (late 2013) with a 1.7 GHz Intel core i7 processor, an Intel HD Graphics 5000 system and 8GB of RAM running MacOS 10.12.1 (Sierra). You can share directly to YouTube at up to 4K resolution, publish movies directly to Facebook and Vimeo, and share any video frame as an image. Unlike most consumer apps, iMovie offers little flexibility in output options. There's a limited choice of resolutions and quality settings to save a file. I saved out to 720p and could choose only 60fps, the resolution of the source video. With the lowest-quality settings, I was able to render a movie in 5:37. With better-quality settings, it took nearly twice that long, at 10:59. To be fair, the Air is Apple's least-powerful laptop, so times should improve on a MacBook Pro. MORE: Best Action Cameras Sharing It may be preferable to save projects to your hard drive first, but if you're pressed for time, and need to post a video to social networks immediately, iMovie has you covered. You can share directly to YouTube at up to 4K resolution, publish movies directly to Facebook and Vimeo, and share any video frame as an image. iMovie Theater coupled with iCloud lets you view your productions on any Apple device or via Apple TV, or alternatively, transfer videos between the desktop and mobile devices via Mail Drop. You can also share a movie, trailer or clip to your iTunes library, where you can watch the movie via  iTunes on your Mac or add the video to other devices like Apple TV, iPad, iPhone or iPod touch. iMovie specifically offers the most popular sharing options. Bottom line Apple's free iMovie has gained some cinematic cred over the years, and while new videographers may need some time to get used to the interface, it quickly becomes intuitive and fun to use. Novices get the benefit of iMovie's flexibility, convenient drag-and-drop action, handy access to multimedia files, and deft but subtle educational features that automatically offer clues on how to shoot and construct a solid story.

X.Org 2017 Election Results Written by Michael Larabel in X.Org on 13 April 2017 at 10:45 AM EDT. 2 Comments The 2017 X.Org Elections have ended. Here are the results. Quick summary: They managed to squeeze out enough voter participation and yes-votes to approve the changes to the membership agreement. The voting for the four new board seats were carried out of the five participants, but due to the by-laws mandating that not more than two board members be from the same organization/company, that clause was hit. As usual, Intel has heavy participation by X.Org developers. The newly-elected members include Daniel Vetter, Martin Peres, Rob Clark, and Taylor Campbell. Others sitting on the board who have terms expiring next year are ALex Deucher, Egbert Eich, Keith Packard, and Bryce Harrington. Below is the election results in full for those that are not X.Org Foundation members' mailing list: Total membership 89; total votes 72, which makes for an 82% voter turnout. Here are the results: Do you agree to the changed Membership agreement? Yes 68 No 0 Abstain 5 68/89 = 76.4% Yes 5/89 = 5.6% Abstain Two-thirds majority required to pass. The membership agreement changes pass. Board members: Name 1 2 3 4 5 Score Matt Turner 10 11 12 16 17 179 Martin Peres 18 12 19 10 6 221 Daniel Vetter 23 21 13 10 4 262 Rob Clark 14 17 17 12 5 218 Taylor Campbell 6 8 9 14 20 137 Since Daniel, Martin, and Matt all work for Intel, that would be more than two from one organization. The bylaws don't allow more than two board members from the same organization. To handle that we drop the one with the lowest vote total of the candidates from the same company and replace them with the person with the highest vote total remaining. So that means our new board members are: Daniel Vetter Martin Peres Rob Clark Taylor Campbell Please welcome our new members to the board!

Suppliers IBD STAFF 4/13/2017 Reprints Loading the player... The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite tested key support levels amid geopolitical tensions and concerns about President Trump's agenda. United Airlines (UAL) suffered a PR fiasco, and Apple (AAPL) buzz roiled iPhone suppliers. Tesla (TSLA) became the most valuable U.S. automaker, briefly. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) headlined big bank earnings, while Wal-Mart (WMT) is making physical stores an asset in its online battle against Amazon (AMZN). Stocks Undercut 50-Day The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all fell below their 50-day moving averages on Wednesday. Investors worried about tensions with Syria, North Korea and Russia, while President Trump said tax cuts will have to wait on health reform. Steel, mining and other infrastructure-related stocks kept falling. Many chips fell on Apple uncertainty, while fiber-optic stocks rebounded Thursday on blowout preliminary earnings figures from Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI). JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) fell after reporting earnings. Wal-Mart stepped up its battle with Amazon, with both retail stocks in buy zones. The 10-year Treasury yield continued to slide, hitting its lowest level since November. United Airlines Tries To Repair Brand United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz apologized multiple times after a video of Chicago police dragging an elderly Asian man off an overbooked flight sparked outcry on social media. Weibo users in China questioned if the incident was racially motivated and called for a boycott of the airline. In an earlier a memo to employees, Munoz blamed the passenger for being "disruptive and belligerent" and said that United had "followed established procedures." In March, the carrier came under fire for turning away two teenagers for wearing leggings while flying under a special friends-and-family ticket. United Airlines shares fell 2.55% for the week, not much more than the airline stock group. RELATED: United CEO Apologizes After Racism Claims Sparked China Backlash Delta Upbeat On Q2, Defends Overbookings Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported mixed first-quarter results but forecast positive Q2 unit revenue, an important efficiency metric Wall Street has long wished would improve. As airlines confront higher fuel and labor costs, Delta said that it expected "the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure" to have occurred during Q1. The carrier said the roughly 4,000 flight cancellations that resulted from thunderstorms around Atlanta would cost it $125 million in Q2 pretax income, but it said it was not understaffed. In light of the forcible removal of a passenger from a packed United Airlines flight, Delta said extra regulation wasn't needed and that it handled overbookings better than rivals. Delta shares rose 4% intraday Wednesday but reversed to close slightly lower, and continued to slide Thursday, closing at their lowest levels since Nov. 9. RELATED: Delta Says It Handles Overbookings Better Than Rivals; Outlook Strong Apple Chips Unsettled Apple's internal chip development efforts grabbed the spotlight, raising investor worries that some iPhone suppliers could be phased out after a report said the Dow-industrials tech giant will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. The Dialog report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors that Apple could replace its graphics chips in iPhones. A Pacific Crest analyst said Apple is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency or audio chips for iPhones. Shares in Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sold off. In a countersuit, Qualcomm (QCOM) claimed Apple covered up how iPhone 7s equipped with its chips outperformed those with Intel (INTC) chips. Qualcomm also alleged that Apple lied to regulators to spur investigations of the wireless chipmaker. Apple on Jan. 20 filed a lawsuit vs. Qualcomm over its technology licensing practices. RELATED: Apple In-Sourcing Hit List To Spare Cirrus, Skyworks: Analyst Apple iPhone Chip Report Hits Dialog, Rattles Supply Chain Qualcomm: Apple Misled On Intel Chip Performance In iPhone 7 Wal-Mart Offers Pickup Discount Dow component Wal-Mart will begin offering price discounts for 10,000 goods picked up at a store location, expanding to one million items by the end of June. It's the latest evidence the discount giant is driving e-commerce innovation under new online chief Marc Lore, leveraging its brick-and-mortar locations vs. Amazon.com. Wal-Mart will offer varying discounts, using technology developed by Jet.com, which Lore sold to Wal-Mart last year for $3.3 billion. Heavy but inexpensive items will get bigger price cuts. Earlier this year, Wal-Mart began offering free two-day shipping with $35 minimum orders and also set up curbside pickup for online grocery orders. Whole Foods (WFM) spiked 10% on Monday after Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake, hinting that it wants the natural-foods grocery giant to pursue a sale. Amazon reportedly had mulled buying Whole Foods last year, Bloomberg reported. RELATED: Wal-Mart Will Pay You To Pick Up Your Online Orders; Your Move, Amazon This Stock Is Up On News That Amazon Even Thought About Buying It Whole Foods Jumps On Jana Stake As Private Equity Eyes Grocers JPMorgan, Citigroup Earnings Top JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup both reported first-quarter earnings well above analyst estimates, with revenue also better than expected. Wells Fargo modestly topped Q1 EPS views but fell short on revenue. JPMorgan and Citigroup reversed from early gains to fall about 1%. Wells Fargo tumbled 3.3% to its worst levels since November. In addition to its mixed results, Wells was hurt by news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is selling 9 million shares to keep its Wells stake below 10%. Bank stocks have been under pressure as Treasury yields have fallen and flattened. RELATED: JPMorgan, Citigroup Beat Q1 Views; Wells Fargo Revenue Misses Oil Prices Rally U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.8% for the week to $53.18 a barrel, helped by a seven-day winning streak through Tuesday. OPEC reported lower production in March and signs grew that the cartel and some nonmembers would extend production cuts past midyear. OPEC's production fell by 153,000 barrels per day in March, according to secondary sources in the cartel's monthly oil market report. Saudi Arabia said its production fell to 9.9 million barrels per day, but secondary sources said its output actually rose. The International Energy Agency said global crude supplies are nearly balanced due to the OPEC-led cuts. The Energy Information Administration said weekly U.S. oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell, but U.S. production hit a 20-month high. Looking ahead, the EIA expects gasoline to average $2.46 per gallon during the peak summer driving season vs. $2.23  last year. The EIA lowered its 2017 and 2018 outlook on crude prices and raised its forecast on U.S. output.

As Tesla gains moderated, however, GM regained its status. Tesla overtook Ford (F) on April 3. Meanwhile, a group of institutional investors want more independent directors on Tesla's board to avoid "groupthink" members that sign off on all of CEO Elon Musk's plans. Musk, Tesla's top shareholder, suggested that investors who aren't happy should buy Ford instead. RELATED: Tesla Under Pressure To Add More Directors Independent Of CEO Musk Tesla Hits New High, Tops GM's Market Cap Teens Love Disney, Adidas And The iPhone Kids these days, what do they love? Dow component Disney (DIS) movies, Adidas (ADDYY) sneakers and Apple (AAPL) iPhones, among other things, according to Piper Jaffray's semiannual teen survey. Disney flicks took four spots on the list of nine most-anticipated films in the upcoming year, though Universal Pictures' "Fate of the Furious" topped the ranking. Nike (NKE), another Dow stock, remains dominant by share, but Adidas is the fastest growing in popularity; Under Armour (UAA) topped the list of downtrending brands among upper-income teenage boys. But Apple is only growing its lead: More teens than ever (81%) expect their next phone to be an iPhone.

AT&T paid 95.63 per share, a near 160% premium. The companies anticipate a closing within 12 months, subject to Federal Communications Commission review. Straight Path owns spectrum in the 40 largest markets across the U.S., including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta.

The combined Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings will trade as KNX. Swift and Knight shares soared on Monday, then gave up much of their gains. Meanwhile, Hub Group (HUBG) warned that it expects Q1 earnings per share of 30-32 cents vs. current views for 36 cents, citing "a soft pricing environment due primarily to excess truck capacity and extraordinarily aggressive intermodal pricing."   Share this: Related news Trump Surprises Sink Fed Expectations And Bank Stocks 4/13/2017 President Trump's stalled policy agenda and shift on Fed chief Janet Yellen have hit bank stocks and rate-hike expectations. 4/13/2017 President Trump's stalled policy agenda and shift on Fed chief...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Asia’s Largest Spring Electronics Fair and ICT Expo Open Today HONG KONG, Apr 13, 2017 – (ACN Newswire) – The HKTDC Hong Kong Electronics Fair (Spring Edition), the largest spring electronics event in Asia, and the concurrent HKTDC International ICT Expo opened today. The four-day fairs (13-16 April), are both being organised by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. More than 3,500 exhibitors from 23 countries and regions are showcasing an assortment of cutting-edge technologies and smart products at the fairs, including innovative solutions and products presented by start-ups. – Startup zone showcases creativity of 100+ companies – A growing force in the business arena in recent years, start-ups number more than 1,900 in the city, according to an Invest Hong Kong report last year. Many young entrepreneurs are introducing new ideas and distinctive products resulting from their creativity and technological expertise. In view of this trend, the HKTDC introduced the Startup zone at the Electronics Fair and ICT Expo this year to feature the innovative technologies, products and services of more than 100 start-ups from Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland, India, Japan, the United States and Taiwan. The zone features a panoply of innovations from start-ups including an all-in-one real estate digital platform incorporating Virtual Reality (VR) technology (Booth: 3CON-240), an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered data analysis platform for monitoring pet health (Booth: 3CON-240), an audio streaming box that digitises audio and transmits it to a smart device (Booth: 3CON-169) and a smart cloud-based temperature and humidity monitor for cold chain logistics such as cargo containers carrying food and beverages (Booth: 3CON-216). A series of start-up themed events are being held at the fairs. These include sharing sessions featuring representatives from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, the crowdfunding platform FringeBacker, successful entrepreneurs, angel investors and start-up online media. There are also Pitching and „Startup, Smart Launch” sessions for start-ups to pitch their solutions and project ideas to potential investors, buyers and media. At mentoring sessions, mentors will help start-ups connect with potential partners at the fairs. Two events to be held on the last day of the fairs (16 April) – the „Together Stronger: Creating Impact via Regional Collaboration” sharing session and the APEC Startup Ecosystem Roundtable – will explore ways that start-ups from around the world can collaborate for greater innovation and impact. – 170+ buying missions to generate business opportunities for exhibitors – To help exhibitors capture more business opportunities, the HKTDC has organised over 170 buying missions comprising more than 12,900 buyers from over 9,400 companies to visit the fairs. Participants include major global importers, distributors, retailers and IT consultants, such as Amazon from the United States, Brazil’s JTI, Argentina’s Mas Singergia SA, France’s Groupe SEB, the United Kingdom’s Ukbigbuy, the Czech Republic’s Enreco Trade, Russia’s Bars Group, Australia’s Catch of the Day, the Chinese mainland’s Wangfujing Department Store, Thailand’s 24 Shopping, Korea’s Hyundai and Japan’s Mindfree. To meet buyers’ growing need to source in small orders, the Spring Electronics Fair once again features the hktdc.com Small Orders zone, where some 300 showcases offering close to 3,000 products are available in minimum order quantities of between five and 1,000 pieces. In view of the popularity of e-commerce, the hktdc.com Small Orders online transaction platform (http://smallorders.hktdc.com) is also available for global buyers to source products and complete transactions online. The online platform currently features over 120,000 products from more than 11,000 suppliers, and has generated more than 2.1 million business connections to date. – Inaugural Tech Hall, Virtual Reality zone at Spring Electronics Fair – The Hong Kong Electronics Fair (Spring Edition) is the largest spring electronics fair in Asia. In its 14th edition, this year’s fair features more than 2,900 exhibitors from 20 countries and regions, including first-time exhibitors from Singapore and Spain. Major electronics production centres such as the Chinese mainland, Korea and Taiwan have also set up group pavilions to showcase a broad selection of innovative electronic products and services. New to this year’s fair is a Tech Hall with four themed zones: the new Virtual Reality zone and the returning Connected Home, Robotics & Unmanned Tech and Wearable Electronics zones. The Virtual Reality zone features a range of VR headsets, video cameras and related technology. The Connected Home zone features an infrared transceiver, which connects all infrared-controlled household appliances in a home, such as air-conditioners and audio systems to a single smart home system. Another popular zone is Wearable Electronics, where highlighted products include a personal safety alarm pendant that sends emergency text and email messages with the user’s location data to prearranged contacts. At the Robotics & Unmanned Tech zone are various aerial cameras and robots, including a DIY Building Blocks Drone that allows users to design and build their own drones. Wi-Fi FPV (First Person View) cameras and air pressure sensors can be added to the drone to improve its altitude stability during flight and capture higher quality video. During the first three days of the fair (13-15 April), the HKTDC is organising a series of seminars under the „2017 Tech Trends Symposium”. Industry experts and academics from universities will examine the latest technology and application trends in such areas as wearable tech, VR, Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR), smart home and robotics. Speakers comprise experts from Hong Kong, the mainland, France, Germany, Taiwan, Singapore and the US, including representatives from Fitbit, Foxconn, Intel, Unity Technologies, university professors and successful start-ups. – Hall of Fame gathers global renowned brands – Another highlight of the Spring Electronics Fair is the Hall of Fame, which features more than 570 internationally renowned quality brands, including Intel and Motorola from the US, Bigben from France, Leplus from Japan, Desay from the mainland and local brand Holga. In terms of market development, the overall HKTDC Export Index rebounded strongly from 33.7 in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 47.1 in the first quarter of 2017. The electronics industry index recorded an even higher reading, jumping from 34.2 to 48.2 during the same period, an indication of exporters’ steadily improving confidence. The electronics industry is Hong Kong’s largest merchandise export earner, accounting for 65 per cent of Hong Kong’s total exports in 2016 with a value of HK$2.35 trillion, up 2.5 per cent year on year. – International ICT Expo showcases diverse solutions – The International ICT Expo is one of the signature events of the „International IT Fest 2017”. This year’s expo has attracted approximately 600 exhibitors from 10 countries and regions, including first-time exhibitors from Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Japan. Launched last November, the Innovation and Technology Commission’s Technology Voucher Programme provides funding of up to HK$200,000 to subsidise local SMEs that use technological services and solutions to improve productivity and stay competitive. The ICT Expo helps SMEs and other larger-scale enterprises by gathering the latest relevant services and ICT solutions under one roof, including Internet security systems, e-commerce platforms, third-party payment, logistics management and O2O business solutions. This year’s expo continues to feature the SME IT Clinic, where experts from Alibaba, Google Premier Partner and hktdc.com offer complimentary professional consultation services on-site to help SMEs select suitable ICT systems and solutions to enhance business efficiency. Winners of the Hong Kong ICT Awards 2017, organised by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, will also be at the fairground to showcase and demonstrate their outstanding products and solutions. – ICT Expo opens to tertiary students on last day to offer career information – A series of seminars and forums are staged at the ICT Expo with daily themes: „e-Commerce & FinTech” (13 April), „Startups” (14 April), „Disruptive Technology” (15 April) and „Career Development” (16 April). Leading industry experts from Accenture, Cyberport, Google, the Innovation and Technology Commission and the Retail Technology Adoption Assistance Scheme for Manpower Demand Management (ReTAAS) Secretariat will discuss such hot topics as Fintech, cybersecurity, e-commerce, Technology Voucher Programme, the ReTAAS, big data, the Internet of Things and sharing economy. For the first time, the expo will open to tertiary students free of charge on the last day (16 April), with representatives from the Hong Kong Computer Society, the Hong Kong Productivity Council and the MTR Corp Ltd giving talks on prospects for the ICT industry and career opportunities.

I see this as nothing more then a strong arm tactic to force people to windows 10 . While I might understand blocking optional proformance updates , sercurity updates are nessary . IMO this is unacceptable business practice shoving a OS down someones throat . I have run hours and hours on my 7600k with no real problems ( except for the drivers which I updated and solved my issues) I also have to wonder if windows 7 is no longer supported then why do intel supply vid drivers and chipset drivers ready to download off of most motherboard manufactures for the Z270 boards ? Something is fishy here and and reaks of coruption ! Anyone know a workaround ? Even if I could bypass windows update MS will still flash the message ," Your cpu is not supported" even if only just browsing the web , JERKS !!

I could have went with a 6600K and MS would not have done nothing . The difference between skylake and kabby lake is min. AND x86 is still X86 their is no reason it will not work So your compairson with a old vid card vs my CPU is at best flawed MS is just loosing money on windows 10 and I refuse to be used to sell my info to 3rd partys for advertising . Windows 7 is still outdoing windows 10 by a longshot and that is a fact .

Upton Funk: what’s next for the man behind the Pi? Share twitter linkedin facebook google+ email Adam Shepherd In-depth 13 Apr, 2017 Raspberry Pi founder Eben Upton on charity, chips, and the changing face of tech Walking into the Raspberry Pi Foundation's offices, you wouldn't think it housed one of the most influential tech companies of the last decade. The organisation's headquarters are situated on one floor of a small building in Cambridge that resembles a 1970s university library more than anything else and is flanked by impressive, modern buildings owned by Microsoft, Deloitte and KPMG. Don't be fooled, though; the company behind the £30 microcomputer has gone from strength to strength. It recently celebrated three milestones, hitting its 5th birthday, its eighth product launch and its 12 millionth unit sold virtually all at once. One of the driving forces behind this success has been Eben Upton, the founder and mastermind behind the Raspberry Pi. With stints at Broadcom, Intel and IBM - not to mention a three-year tenure as Cambridge University's director of studies for computer science - Upton has an impressive technical pedigree behind him. Talking to him, it's immediately clear that the Raspberry Pi is the definition of a passion project. He lights up when talking about engineering problems and has boundless enthusiasm for all things technical. Habitually dressed in jeans and rolled up shirtsleeves, Upton's demeanour is a cross between a well-liked sixth form teacher and a starry-eyed Silicon valley programmer. One gets the impression that this isn't the carefully-crafted look of artificial nonchalance commonly worn by tech CEOs but a genuine result of Upton getting his hands dirty with the day-to-day grunt work of engineering alongside the rest of his staff. He dismissed the idea of working on shiny new technologies like AI, saying (with obvious relish) "the stuff we're good at tends to be grungy, low-level systems programming". It's this passion that has driven the Raspberry Pi Foundation since the beginning. Founded as a way to get more kids into computing at an earlier age, the Foundation has always been motivated by its values rather than its bottom line. Nowhere is this more evident than with the Raspberry Pi Zero - a fully-functional computer that Upton sold for a mind-boggling $5. Roughly the size of a packet of chewing gum, the Zero is Upton's favourite product - a fact that is given away by the beaming grin that breaks out across his face when we bring it up. "I made a million computers," Upton points out, "and I turned over five million dollars." For any other tech company, selling a product that cheaply would be lunacy, but the fact that the very concept of it's howlingly insane is part of the reason Upton is so fond of the Zero. "I love that we were able to do it," he says; "I love that it worked." In many ways, the Raspberry Pi Zero is emblematic of the company as a whole. The first Pi models were a runaway hit, but rather than resting on their laurels, Upton and his team went out and built the world's smallest commercial PC - for fun. "It was just wonderful to be able to take a business that was going well and still be aggressive enough to say 'what happens if we just tear it up and do something else?'" With all this hardware innovation going on, though, it's easy to forget that devices like the Zero are effectively a side project for the Raspberry Pi Foundation. "You've got to remember that actually, in the end, we're a charity," Upton says. The foundation was set up with the aim of getting kids into computing, but its efforts don't stop at making cheaply available hardware for them to practise on.

Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - April 13, 2017) - YDreams Global Interactive Technologies Inc. (TSXV: YD) (OTC Pink: YDRM) (FSE: A2AP0L) ('YDreams Global' or the 'Company'), a creative and technology supplier for Fortune 500 brands such as Cisco, Qualcomm, Intel and Coca-Cola, released a new project for Bob's, one of the most traditional fast-food chains in Brazil, that recently celebrated its 65 anniversary alongside its franchisees by taking a dive into virtual reality. Bob's, the Brazilian fast-food giant, created a concept store through Virtual and Augmented Reality. Store owners were invited to the brand's biggest event in Brazil and experienced an immersive 3D exhibition in order to learn more about the project. With over a 1,000 stores in three countries, Bob's is the third largest fast-food chain in Brazil, where they are part of the BFFC group which also owns KFC and Pizza Hut. For their 2017 convention, they invited more than 1,000 franchisees and their families to introduce them firsthand to Bob's new concept store. YDreams Global was Bob's creative and technology partner for this experience. The public received Virtual Reality ('VR') goggles for a deep immersion experience. With a simple head movement, they could explore the entire 3D environment of the new concept store and choose specific points whenever they wanted more details. The 360º scope of the VR environment brought everything to life right from the main entrance and it was possible to interact with hotspots to learn more about the new concept store and its features. 'The idea was to display the new store in a creative way, since it will be the main model for future stores of the Bob's brand,' stated YDreams Global's CEO, Daniel Japiassu. 'The client's efforts in seeking innovative solutions, alongside our experience in implementing projects such as this with short deadlines, were key to a successful event. This concept could be a strong recurring growth driver for YDreams in the future and highlights our continued ability to work with Fortune 500 companies and highly recognizable branded companies.' At the YDreams booth, the public could also view the new store's plan through an Augmented Reality ('AR') application. According to YDreams CEO, 'VR and AR experiences are a perfect way to demonstrate YDreams' 'Sensorial Technology' business pillar in a more engaging fashion. We feel that a conventional presentation would not convey the intended message for this project. By showcasing the new store through VR and AR, the public had a much better perception of the end result and all the effort made by Bob's.' Ana Venâncio, from Bob's Development Division, stated: 'The event was really a success; I believe we reached a new level in the way we showcase and present our business.' *About YDreams Global* YDreams Global Interactive Technologies Inc.

Leadership Theories Essays Mapping the PRAM Model onto the Intel SCC Many-core Processor 7nd International Workshop on New Algorithms and Programming Models for the Many-core Era APMM 7567 As part of the International Conference BA Theses It seems to me that underneath is the question of why people behave in good and bad ways, and so you need to explicate your views on that. I learned two very important rules about sentence/slogan composition: the first was from Strunk and White : use terse, powerful words rather than prepositions and the like. The second was from WJ Kennedy: The most important words in a sentence are the first and the last: make them count. Good point: intention versus actions. 'Trust, but verify' - no contradiction. You trust intentions, but still verify actions, because good intentions not always generate good actions - just human nature. I'm thinking something alone the lines of "Security and Trust: Societal Glue" but that doesn't quite work. Maybe the rest of you can help tweak this idea? Not making this link would also cover the evolution of certain security measures as society develops, without these measures contributing directly to the development. "Modern Society" instead of "Complex Societies" would also work, probably a matter of style. I'd stay with "complex". It may be more formal, but once some time passes, an old book on "modern society" will look outdated, whilst an old book on "complex society" might still seem worth to read. I second all those that suggested going without subtitle. I thing the brand "Bruce Schneier" is by now strong enough that a subtitle will not make any difference.

Since Intel's new Kaby Lake processors launched in January but failed to attract strong demand, and major game designers have not released any new games during the first quarter, motherboard and graphics card sales in the PC DIY market were weak. For the second quarter, motherboard and graphics card players are now hoping AMD's new Ryzen CPUs and its Vega GPU, which is scheduled to be released at the end of the second quarter, will help boost their sales. The sources also noted that motherboard and graphics card demand from China, Europe and North America all suffered declines in the first quarter, but motherboard players' product ASPs were up slightly thanks to strong demand for high-end models from the gaming sector. With AMD's Ryzen 7 launched in early March and Ryzen 5 in April, the motherboard players believe the CPUs will be able to attract price-oriented consumers because of their high price/performance ratios. Although Nvidia recently launched its new GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU and cut the GeForce GTX 1080 price from US$699 to US$499, weak demand has created high channel inventories, especially in China. Because of weak demand, some graphics card players believe overall graphics card shipments may drop over 15% sequentially in the second quarter, but if AMD's Vega series GPUs are able to arrive on time and have stable supply, the percentage may be smaller, the sources noted.

In other words, it's a demonstration of a potentially viable alternative to silicon. The keyword here is alternative, as opposed to a replacement. Silicon is at the heart of almost all electronic devices, and engineers are constantly shrinking circuits printed on the material to cram more transistors onto dies and more dies onto wafers. Intel reckons it can squeeze up to 100.8m 10nm FinFET transistors onto a single square millimeter. To do this, it has to build up 3D transistors. The resulting chips are powerful but not particularly bendy or flexible, instead entombed in chunky packages often with fans and heatsinks close by. The Vienna team is keeping it strictly 2D: a simple low-density design in comparison, but one that can be printed onto plastic film and used to slip miniature electronics into clothes, tiny objects and the Internet of Things. Their paper, published on Tuesday in Nature Communications and available for free on arXiv, shows how a molybdenum disulfide semiconductor packed with 115 transistors measuring about 280nm thick, can be integrated into a microprocessor 0.6mm2 in size. It can execute programs stored in an external memory and perform logical operations. Crucially, as we said, the transistors are 2D and flat as opposed to today's intricate 3D FinFETs designs. This primitive layout means the MoS2 transistors can be printed on a thin-film plastic and embedded into devices a lot more easier than silicon chip packages. The paper's abstract explains: Since then, microprocessors have been made almost exclusively from silicon, but the ever-increasing demand for higher integration density and speed, lower power consumption and better integrability with everyday goods has prompted the search for alternatives. Germanium and III–V compound semiconductors are being considered promising candidates for future high-performance processor generations and chips based on thin-film plastic technology or carbon nanotubes could allow for embedding electronic intelligence into arbitrary objects for the Internet-of-Things. Here, we present a 1-bit implementation of a microprocessor using a two-dimensional semiconductor—molybdenum disulfide. The device can execute user-defined programs stored in an external memory, perform logical operations and communicate with its periphery. Our 1-bit design is readily scalable to multi-bit data. The device consists of 115 transistors and constitutes the most complex circuitry so far made from a two-dimensional material. These MiS2 semiconductors won't replace silicon anytime soon, as the number of transistors pales in comparison to the billions squeezed into the latest microprocessors today. The described system is only a one-bit CPU with four possible instructions, however, we're told the blueprints can be ramped up to a multi-bit design. Schematic of MoS2 semiconductor and its place in the design of a flat microprocessor (Image credit: Wachter et al and Nature Communications) “We estimate that scaling our design to simple 8-bit processors should be rather straightforward, provided that the uniformity of the MoS2 films can be improved,” Thomas Mueller, coauthor of the paper and an associate professor at Vienna University of Technology, told The Register. "Going to more complex circuits will require to replace our current NMOS-design with CMOS. Also the contact resistance of MoS2 transistors needs to be reduced to obtain good current saturation (which is required for circuits) in transistors with tens of nanometer channel lengths." A major roadblock in the feasibility of silicon alternatives is in manufacturing. Today's silicon-churning microchip factories cost billions to set up and operate, and new materials will have to be compatible with the manufacturing systems. We're told that the MoS2 chips can be built using standard semiconductor etching processes. Unfortunately, fabricating molybdenum disulfide components right now is trickier than using silicon: the design at this stage isn't particularly tolerant of imperfections in the material, resulting in low yields. "As our circuits were made more or less by hand in the lab, such complex designs are of course pretty much beyond our capability. Every single one of the transistors has to function as planned in order for the processor to work as a whole," Mueller explained. There are other advantages to having a flat semiconductor. It means the material is more flexible, making it useful for things like medical sensors or bendable displays. All in all, this is still very much an interesting and definite work in progress. ® Tips and corrections 15 Comments MORE Microprocessor More from The Register Oracle teases 'easy-to-absorb' platform updates, wants 'all' your infrastructure biz Big Red admits to a lost half-decade in silicon, promises melding with software real soon 17 Comments Intel is shipping an ARM-based FPGA.

X Cork-based firm tackling the data deluge – with DNA Helixworks working on commercially viable system to store digital information in DNA Thu, Apr 13, 2017, 06:01 Claire O'Connell Helixworks Technologies founders Sachin Chalapati and Nimesh Pinnamaneni at tech fest South by Southwest after winning the “most innovative” award for its work to make a commercially viable system to store digital information in DNA Previous Image Next Image         Getting noticed at the massive tech fest South by Southwest is no easy task. A maelstrom of talks, pitches and stands, the conference sprawls across numerous locations in downtown Austin, Texas, where a mix of established giants and energetic young hopefuls vie for attention. So when Cork-based company Helixworks Technologies got the chance to speak at the SXSW Accelerator Pitch Event, they made the most of it. And it paid off – the company won the “most innovative” award for its work to make a commercially viable system to store digital information in DNA. “Twitter was buzzing,” says Helixworks co-founder Nimesh Pinnamaneni of the reaction to the win. New twist on DNA storage Preserving digital information in DNA is not a new idea. The molecule that makes up our genomes has encoded information for billions of years, and advances in the technology to sequence (read) and – importantly – to write or synthesise DNA have opened up the prospect of converting digital data into a molecular code of DNA’s bases or “letters” that can be stored and then read when needed. Recent years have also seen the surge of big data, and expected global data is estimated at 44 trillion gigabytes by 2020, according to Dr Aisling O’Driscoll, a lecturer at Cork Institute of Technology. Can DNA absorb the digital demand? “DNA provides the first viable alternative to silicon,” says O’Driscoll, who has no connection to Helixworks but who is aware of their approach. “[DNA] offers a cheaper, long-term alternative that wouldn’t consume much physical space, would require little energy to maintain and has greater longevity as it won’t degrade like traditional data storage solutions. All the world’s data could be stored in DNA weighing less than one kilogram.” Life’s law In 2013, O’Driscoll and CIT colleague Prof Roy Sleator co-wrote a paper in the journal Bioengineered where they pointed out that Moore’s law – the famous dictum by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore about the growth of computing power – is making way for “life’s law”. At present though, DNA is not a “silver bullet”, notes O’Driscoll, and technical and commercial challenges remain. Key among them are the need to build a usable, reliable and affordable system for both writing and reading the encoded data. “It won’t be widely utilised unless it’s cost effective – not just data storage but also retrieval,” she says. “It won’t be cost effective until it’s widely commercialised, which won’t occur until the technology is sufficiently mature, fit for purpose and there’s competition in the market.” Steps to DNA storage Developing synthetic DNA as a storage medium is an active field of research for heavy hitters such as Microsoft, IBM and Harvard, so where does Helixworks fit in? The small company is striving to make “writing” information into artificial DNA simple and more affordable. “We are showing how we can try to bring this to a commercial product,” says Pinnamaneni. He and Helixworks co-founder Sachin Chalapati were inspired to explore DNA storage themselves when they were masters students in Sweden. They attended a talk by Craig Venter, a pioneer of human genomics and synthetic DNA, and they spoke to organisations that needed to store large volumes of data. The combination set the cogs in motion. “If you could throw the information into DNA, it would take up less space,” says Pinnamaneni. “This was an engineering problem.” They created a prototype that caught the eye of accelerator IndieBio EU (now RebelBio) in Cork, and they moved to Ireland. With backing from SOS Ventures and Enterprise Ireland’s New Frontiers programme, Helixworks has since been developing their technology, using a “Lego block” approach to assemble DNA in order to drive down costs. Early lessons The process has not gone without a hitch though. Last summer Helixworks offered a commercial product: 512 Kilobytes of data storage (enough for a poem or a small photo perhaps) in specially encoded DNA, packaged in a gold capsule. The orders came in – including one from a biotechnologist who wanted to encode an anniversary message for his wife – but the fledgling company soon realised it would take too long to fill them. “We learned a very important lesson,” says Pinnamaneni. “We were eager, but we didn’t understand the timeline it would take to deliver. When you are starting up things happen, and we learned this the hard way.” Now the focus is on automating their platform, according to Pinnamaneni, and the company has taken the open-source approach, freely sharing technical details on its website. “We want to get people excited,” he says. And while much remains to be proven about DNA storage, Pinnamaneni envisages that in years to come we could have a small DNA-based device in our homes to store the enormous amounts of data we generate. “[It would have] one writing part, one reader and one part for storing,” he says. “And it would just be there, a bit like the wifi router is now, just sitting there doing its job.”       Topics: Aisling O Driscoll Craig Venter Roy Sleator Sachin Chalapati Carlow Institute of Technology Cork Institute of Technology Enterprise Ireland Eu Harvard Helixworks Technologies IBM Intel Microsoft Sos Austin(US.TX) Ireland Sweden Read More Read my lips: Irish start-up gets teeth into verification tools If a new ID solution from SaaS start-up iDly Systems succeeds, plastic ID cards will be history Buymie gets your groceries to you when you need them Black Twist’s coffee and whiskey blend targets millennials Irish food sector must look to greater innovation The AI apocalypse: will the human race soon be terminated?

By: Shilpa Published: Thursday, April 13, 2017, 8:00 [IST] Though smartphone does quite a lot of stuff done by computer, there are few other areas where people rely solely on their personal computers. How about having a device that works both as a smartphone and PC? This sounds interesting, right? Shane Lewis has come up with such an idea where a device named as Trinity runs Android Operating System and also functions as a Windows PC. Now he wants everyone to crowdfund this idea so that he can start with the shipping process by the end of 2017. That is, if he gets $767,000 on Indiegogo, he is having a plan of beginning the shipment in December. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Design: The design of this device is not so appealing. It is very thick compared to smartphones available in the market. It is having a thickness of 17.5mm. Also Read: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 likely to use Intel Kaby Lake processor It might reach 19mm once the project gets completed. The entry level device has a 5-inch display with 800 x 480 pixel capacitive touch screen. Features: One should not confuse this device with the dual-boot model. Trinity is having separate hardware for both Android and Windows 10 operating systems. But runs it simultaneously and allows you to switch between them without turning the device off. It comes with full-sized USB and HDMI ports in it which can be used to plug in a display, keyboard, or other accessories. Another interesting thing is, you can also plug in two different displays at the same time such as one for Android OS and another for Windows. Also Read: It is time to wave Goodbye to Windows Vista The Windows supported here is powered by an Intel processor, minimum of 4GB RAM, and 128GB of mSATA solid state storage. On the other hand, Android OS is powered by an ARM-based processor, 2GB RAM, and also a support for microSD card. The basic version of Trinity comes with a 13MP rear camera. For now, the device does not offer a good battery capacity. That is, only 4 hours of battery life under Android OS whereas, an hour if you use both the operating system simultaneously.   Availability: The entry level model of Trinity is priced at $699 whereas, an advanced model by name Trinity Turbo will be made available for $869 and powers Pentium N3710 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. Also Read: Android stands out as a World's Most Popular OS by surpassing Windows If the price is not a concern for you, then you go for Trinity Ultimate which is priced at $959. It offers you Pentium N3710 processor with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.   Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

The company submitted its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple's lawsuit, which was filed back in January. Among Qualcomm's five complaints is the allegation that Apple intentionally hobbled Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 7 so they wouldn't outperform those provided by Intel. Legally speaking, it has been a difficult year for Qualcomm. The initial lawsuit, filed in the US, was followed by additional suits in China and the United Kingdom. Before the Apple lawsuits, the company faced litigation from the US Federal Trade Commission for unfair business practices. In its countersuit, Qualcomm alleges that Apple "chose not to utilize the full performance of Qualcomm’s modem chips in its iPhone 7," misrepresenting the difference in performance between iPhone models packing Qualcomm chips and those powered by its competitors. The company also claims Apple made threats in an attempt to keep it from making any public comparisons that might hint at the allegedly superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones. With respect to the ongoing legal battle, Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel, said: "After a decade of historic growth, Apple refuses to acknowledge the well established and continuing value of those technologies. It has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm." In addition, the countersuit claims Apple breached agreements and mischaracterized its negotiations with Qualcomm, interfered with longstanding agreements with Qualcomm licensees, and encouraged regulatory attacks against the company around the world by misrepresenting facts and making false statements. With total damages sought be both parties quickly racking up, it remains to be seen who will end up having to bear the ultimate cost should an out-of-court settlement not be reached.

Soft FP64 Patches For Intel Sandy Bridge Allow ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 12 April 2017 at 08:48 PM EDT. 4 Comments Elie Tournier, the GSoC student developer who last year worked via GSoC on "soft" FP64 double-precision support for older GPUs lacking the hardware capabilities, has posted patches wiring up his soft implementation for Intel "Gen 6" (Sandy Bridge) graphics thereby allowing ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 support. Tournier was hired by Collabora earlier this year for continuing his work around soft FP64. Today he's posted some "request for comments" patches on implementing soft FP64 support in NIR for handling ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 with the Sandy Bridge era hardware. Ivy Bridge and newer can have native FP64 support. Wiring in ARB_gpu_shader_fp64 could allow Sandy Bridge to expose OpenGL 4.0+, albeit FP64 isn't too relevant for games and thus Linux gamers finding a GL4 game playable with SNB graphics could already override the extensions / GL level. The work-in-progress patches can be found on Mesa-dev and amount to just under two thousand lines of code, nearly all of which is the NIR support for this emulated double-precision support. Hopefully we'll see R600g have similar support eventually as there are many GPUs missing out on FP64 / OpenGL 4.0+ support due to not having this capability. Collabora though tends to not focus much on Radeon drivers specifically and R600g doesn't make use of NIR. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source | April 12, 2017 -- 23:43 GMT (16:43 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software When Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical and Ubuntu Linux leader, stepped down as CEO in favor of COO Jane Silber in 2010, no one was too worried. Silber may not have been flashy, but she knew how to keep the company moving forward. In a way, it was like Tim Cook taking over Apple after Steve Job's death. Jane Silber, Canonical CEO, will be moving to the company board while company and Ubuntu founder, Mark Shuttleworth, returns as CEO. Like Cook, Silber was a smart choice. Under her guidance, as she said in a recent PC Magazine interview, "Ubuntu has industry adoption that is both broad and deep. Companies such as Walmart, Netflix, and eBay build their infrastructure on Ubuntu. Telcos such as Deutsche Telekom, AT&T, and NTT build their next-generation telecom capabilities on Ubuntu." In addition, Ubuntu became the go-to operating system for all clouds. Even on Microsoft Azure, by last summer one in three Azure virtual machines were running Ubuntu. Moreover, Silber continued, "Companies such as Google and Intel use Ubuntu on their developer workstations. Further, Internet of Things (IoT) device manufacturers of gateways, networking devices, robots, and drones all use Ubuntu at scale." What Canonical could not do was make Ubuntu a major desktop player. Windows still dominates the desktop. What bothered Shuttleworth even more was that his dream of making Ubuntu a converged end-user operating system that could use the same Unity interface on smartphones, tablets, and PCs didn't come true. It was time for a change. what's hot on zdnet Windows XP: Why it won't die for years to come US border searches of phones and laptops have almost doubled A big shift towards DevOps adoption is coming ​Samsung unveils customized enterprise versions of Galaxy S8 Shuttleworth still isn't giving up on the Linux desktop. He has reason, and as Windows transforms from a true desktop operating system to Windows-as-a-Service, Linux still has another shot at the desktop. He has also decided to focus Canonical's efforts even more on the cloud and IoT. How he will be doing that is changing. While details are still sketchy, Canonical insiders tell me that Shuttleworth, for the first time in the private company's history, will look for outside funding. For that job, Shuttleworth wants to be in charge. So, Silber explained in a blog post, "We're now entering a new phase of accelerated growth at Canonical, and it's time to pass the baton to both seasoned hands and a new generation of Canonical leaders." While this look like a sudden decision from the outside, it's not. Silber said she'd "originally agreed to be CEO for five years and we've extended my tenure as CEO by a couple of years already." She also won't be leaving the job immediately. She'll remain the CEO until June 2017. She also won't be leaving Canonical. She will move to the Canonical Board of Directors. The dynamic Shuttleworth will take charge in July 2017. Before then, however, we should have a better idea on what his plans are for Canonical's next steps.

Lau Chung-kee, 33, was granted a retrial after he successfully appealed against his conviction in November on the grounds that the ruling judge had erred in directing the jury. During his retrial at the High Court on Wednesday, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob. In sentencing the following day, Madam Justice Susana D’Almada Remedios ruled that Lau receive a reduced sentence for pleading guilty, but said he was not entitled to an even greater discount because he did not come forward at an earlier stage. Mainland businessman found guilty of failing to pay employees of defunct Hong Kong broadcaster ATV on time On November 4, 2013, Lau was driving mainland businessman Yang Gengjie to various places around Hong Kong to pick up goods, which included a large number of iPhones and Intel computer processing units. After learning they were high-value items, the driver planned to rob the businessman. Lau faked a collision while driving Yang to Kwun Tong, with the electronic products on board. He told his passenger that he needed to check the damage and exited the vehicle before two other men jumped into the van. Yang’s head was pressed down and a knife held against the back of his neck while the van was driven off. The businessman was later dropped off on a nearby street. Lau and two other men were later arrested for the planned robbery. In mitigation, Lau argued that no actual physical force had been used and the mainland businessman had suffered no injuries. But the judge took note of the driver’s role in the plot. “[Yang] was held hostage. This abduction must have been a frightening experience for Yang,” D’Almada Remedios said. She said Lau had breached the trust placed in him by his employer and noted that he had also attempted to mislead police by pretending to be a victim of the robbery. “This is a further aggravating factor,” she said.   Most Popular Viewed 1 The 10 minutes with Xi that changed Trump on N Korea 2 China’s nuclear get-out clause over defence of North Korea 3 Daughter ‘horrified’ by United passenger’s dragging as lawsuit looms 4 Woman falls from seventh floor at Hong Kong airport 5 Six memes about United Airlines incident that have gone viral Shared 1 The 10 minutes with Xi that changed Trump on N Korea 2 China’s nuclear get-out clause over defence of North Korea 3 Woman falls from seventh floor at Hong Kong airport 4 Annoyed with noisy neighbours?

Hall of Famer Joe Greene embraces Steelers chairman Dan Rooney. Image: Gene Puskar/AP/REX/Shutterstock By Sam Laird2017-04-13 23:17:24 UTC Dan Rooney ran the Pittsburgh Steelers as team president back in the 1970s, when they won four Super Bowls in six years. He was team chairman when the Steelers surged back to modern prominence, with Super Bowl wins in 2006 and 2009. He was already an NFL legend by that point, having been voted into the Hall of Fame in 2000. But when Rooney passed away Thursday at age 84, the football owner and executive left a legacy that goes much deeper than wins and losses, one that even surpasses the glory of Super Bowl trophies. Ever heard of the "Rooney Rule"? Yeah, that's named for him.   SEE ALSO: The NBA must really think the Warriors are unstoppable if this scheduling conflict tells us anything Rooney's death was reported Thursday, although further details of his passing were not immediately disclosed. He began managing the Steelers in 1969, helping guide the team to iconic status among NFL franchises. News of his death immediately became a top trending topic on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/CpFftQR0Gv — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) April 13, 2017 Without him, there is no Steelers. Thank you for everything, you will be missed. #WinItForMrRooney #SteelersNation R.I.P Mr. Dan Rooney. pic.twitter.com/m2NrfkdLk7 — SteelersNation (@SteelersKillerB) April 13, 2017 We've lost the heart & soul of Steeler Nation.

Thank you for all that u have done. I'm honored to have called you my friend. #RIP — Dan Marino (@DanMarino) April 13, 2017 RIP Dan. My Mentor & friend. Thank you for your Guidance & Wisdom.

We will miss you dearly! Love you DMR! — Ben pic.twitter.com/94jtHKKeFO — BigBen7.com (@_BigBen7) April 13, 2017 Rooney's legacy goes beyond football In 2003, the NFL established what's called "the Rooney Rule," stipulating that franchises must interview at least one minority candidate when seeking to fill head coaching and senior front-office positions. The rule was born out of a diversity committee helmed by Rooney — hence the name.  The "Rooney Rule" has since become shorthand for similar policies in fields beyond the world of pro football. It's now considered, as The Undefeated reported last year, "a blueprint for corporate America to improve its poor hiring record when it comes to diversity. Facebook, Pinterest, Intel, Xerox and Amazon are among the major companies that have instituted their own version of the rule. Even the Pentagon has explored using some form of the rule to diversify its officer corps." A rule meant to increase diversity but named for a white man might seem problematic to some in 2017, but the NFL to that point had an abysmal record. When Art Shell was hired to coach the Los Angeles Raiders in 1989, he became the league's first black head coach since the 1920s.  Certainly, the Rooney Rule isn't perfect. It's not a panacea.  But it still represents an important step for progress in the American workplace — and it's the reason many fans of social good, not just good football, will raise one for Dan Rooney on Thursday night.

With it being non-LTS (Long-Term Support), 17.04 will only be supported for nine months. As of Ubuntu 17.04, the distribution is still using the Unity desktop despite announcing a switch to GNOME as the default desktop environment. Commenting on the new version, which includes updates to cloud components, Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical's founder said: The breadth and pace of open source innovation has made it the center of gravity in technology today, and the Ubuntu community has once again delivered the most reliable way to consume that innovation. While containers are the name of the game in cloud today, I would also highlight the speed at which snaps are enabling developers to deliver the very best bits to Linux machines on Ubuntu and other distributions, from the desktop to the cloud and beyond, at the edge of computing. There are some features that users might notice in this release, the first of which is the inclusion of swap files. New installs of Ubuntu 17.04 no longer require a swap partition that's at least twice the size of RAM, instead, Ubuntu 17.04 uses a swap file by default and uses less space that swap partitions. This change was prompted by the larger amounts of RAM available in computers today. The release ships with Linux Kernel 4.10, which has support for AMD Ryzen and Intel Kaby Lake systems. Gamers will also notice benefits from the inclusion of MESA 17.0.2 and X.Org Server 1.19.2. As for bundled applications, 17.04's GNOME apps have been bumped to GNOME 3.24, LibreOffice has been bumped to 5.3 (featuring a ribbon interface), with Firefox and Thunderbird being on version 52 and 45 respectively. Despite GNOME apps being updated, the Nautilus file manager and Terminal emulator have remained on version 3.20. You can download Ubuntu 17.04 from the Ubuntu website, or upgrade using the software updater if you're using 16.10. Those on Ubuntu 16.04 will probably want to stay on the release until 18.04 LTS is out next year, as it'll be more stable and is supported for five years.

In addition to being a presenting sponsor, PG&E employees, friends, and family will be on hand at 10 state parks. More than 4,000 volunteers are needed to help with environmental improvement projects statewide. California’s state parks receive great benefits from the work completed by volunteers during CSPF’s annual Earth Day Restoration and Cleanup. This year, food storage lockers at campgrounds will be installed prior to the busy summer season, fencing and gates will be repaired, native and drought tolerant vegetation will be planted, rain barrels will be installed and trash will be removed to create a more welcoming and sustainable environment for visitors. Businesses and individuals are needed to actively participate with their communities to help steward and care for California’s 280 treasured state parks. “Earth Day is definitely one of my favorite days of the year. I am deeply moved to see people from across California working together to restore our treasured parks that are near and dear to us all,” said Susan Smartt, interim executive director of CSPF. “The out-pouring of support during this annual celebration makes a difference everyone can feel great about when they visit their favorite state park,” said Smartt. PG&E is providing a $200,000 grant to CSPF for the supplies and materials needed to complete 10 Earth Day projects in Northern and Central California. Other sponsors include Target, Oracle, Edison International, Union Bank, Intel, The Nature Conservancy, and Microsoft. “Over the many years that I have been involved with this event, I have been especially impressed with the dedication of my PG&E colleagues and how they involve their children and neighbors.  It teaches all of us respect for the parks and outdoors and instills a sense of good stewardship which is critical for the future of these resources,” said Tom Esser, a PG&E employee and volunteer who has participated for 15 years.

Andrew Cunningham - Apr 13, 2017 6:12 pm UTC reader comments 102 Share this story The earliest version of iOS 10's 64-bit app warning, as seen in an early beta. Andrew Cunningham Later versions of the warning became more oblique, referring to the symptoms of running 32-bit apps rather than the root cause. Andrew Cunningham The full list of incompatible apps was introduced in iOS 10.3. Andrew Cunningham Among many other things, iOS 10.3 makes it clear that the end of the road is near for 32-bit iOS apps. This has been coming for a while—all apps and updates submitted for App Store approval since mid-2015 have needed to include 64-bit support, and Apple has been pledging to purge the App Store of abandonware since last fall. Pretty soon, Apple will simply go one step further and make it so that older 32-bit code simply can’t run on iDevices. Putting aside that this spells the end for all kinds of old, unmaintained games and other apps from the early days of the smartphone and App Store, Apple’s complete transition to 64-bit is a unique and interesting technical achievement. Here’s the complete timeline of the transition, to date: September 2013: Apple introduces the iPhone 5S. Its Apple A7 chip makes it the first 64-bit iDevice. iOS 7 is the first 64-bit version of iOS, at least when running on the A7. October 2013: The iPad Air and what is now called the iPad Mini 2 are introduced. Both include the Apple A7 SoC. March 2014: iOS 7.1 is released. It resolves most of the memory-related crashes in 64-bit iOS. September 2014: The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are released. Their Apple A8 chip is Apple's second 64-bit SoC. Apple stops selling the iPhone 4S, making the iPhone 5C the last of the 32-bit iPhones. October 2014: The iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 are released. Both include 64-bit chips (the A8X and A7 again, respectively). The fourth-generation Retina iPad, which had been on sale for $399, is discontinued. The original iPad Mini is the last of the 32-bit iPads. February 2015: All new apps submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support. June 1, 2015: All app updates submitted to the App Store must include 64-bit support. June 19, 2015: Apple quietly discontinues the original iPad Mini. The only 32-bit iPads Apple now sells are refurbished. September 9, 2015: Apple announces the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and stops selling the 32-bit iPhone 5C in favor of the 64-bit iPhone 5S. All new iPhones Apple sells from this point on are 64-bit. June 13, 2016: Apple announces iOS 10. Beta versions generate a warning about 32-bit apps, though this is removed in the final release. iOS 10 drops support for the Apple A5, making the Apple A6 and A6X the last supported 32-bit iOS SoCs. October 24, 2016: iOS 10.1 restores the 32-bit app warning. March 27, 2017: Apple releases iOS 10.3. One of its features is a list of installed 32-bit apps that won’t work in future iOS versions. To this list, I’d add a couple of predictions. In June at WWDC, we’ll get our first look at iOS 11, which is almost certain to drop support for the last 32-bit iOS hardware (the iPhone 5 and 5C and the iPad 4) as well as 32-bit iOS apps. And when that update comes out in September-ish, it may be accompanied by the first iPhone that can’t run 32-bit iOS apps (because it doesn’t have to be able to). The second supposition is based on a guess from prominent iOS developer Steve Troughton-Smith, who regularly discovers hidden or semi-hidden iOS features and is often in position to hear things from people near and inside Apple. It’s not a guarantee of Apple’s future plans and of all its products, especially since the company generally keeps the tightest lid on the design of its A-series chips. Still, an iPhone without 32-bit iOS apps would present a unique opportunity for Apple to use its control over its software to streamline its hardware a bit. The 64-bit ARM instruction set, also called AArch64, is unique in that it is totally separate from the 32-bit (and ARMv7-compatible) AArch32 instruction set. In the PC world, the x86-64 instruction set is an extension of the 32-bit and 16-bit instruction sets—it was designed that way on purpose, and its easy backward compatibility gave it a decisive advantage over Intel’s 64-bit-only Itanium architecture. As a side effect, it has drawn out the 64-bit transition on PCs for years. Even today, every x86 PC supports 32- and 16-bit code that it will only rarely need to run. Further ReadingARM’s Cortex A32 is a tiny CPU for wearables and Raspberry Pi-like boardsSince ARM separates the instruction sets and since Apple has total control over iOS and its app ecosystem, Apple could be the first company to build an ARM CPU architecture that only supports 64-bit code. ARM has already demonstrated that this kind of thing can be done with its tiny AArch32-only Cortex A32 CPU core. On the hardware side, this could mean freeing up a small amount of space in a hypothetical A11 SoC for more CPU cores, larger CPU cores, or a better GPU or other features. This is the kind of thing that other SoC vendors would have a harder time doing—most SoCs in the Android world either use ARM’s Cortex CPU cores or designs substantially based on the Cortex cores. To maintain maximum compatibility and flexibility, it’s unlikely that ARM will ship anything without 32-bit support any time soon. Even if this doesn’t happen, Apple can still achieve some streamlining on the software side, stuff that will also benefit phones with hardware support for 32-bit apps. With 32-bit support cut out, Apple will be able to rip out any remaining 32-bit code in iOS, as well as 32-bit software libraries and things that allow 32-bit apps to run within 64-bit iOS. This may save some small amount of storage space, though it may be used for new iOS 11 features and not passed on to users. It can also help with memory usage in a few cases, since iOS won’t ever need to load 32-bit libraries into memory (thus ejecting other apps or Safari tabs from RAM and slowing down load times when you’re switching between tabs or apps). Whether Apple ever actually talks about any of these benefits publicly is anyone’s guess. The company does seem to be a little more open and a little less secretive on some fronts these days, but it’s still difficult to get Apple employees on the record talking in detail about its chips or low-level tech (beyond the stuff developers can learn at WWDC, anyway). But it will be a first for a mass-market consumer operating system: not only has iOS transitioned from 32-bit to 64-bit, but it will soon completely end 32-bit backward compatibility altogether, something that has remained in the 64-bit versions of Windows, macOS, Linux, and other OSes. Even if the benefits to users and to Apple are relatively small, the fact remains that only Apple has enough control over its hardware and software to realize those benefits.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     HP Launches Its New Pavilion Laptops At Coachella 2017 Posted: Apr 13 2017, 12:35pm CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, Updated: Apr 13 2017, 12:37pm CDT, in News | Technology News   HP Pavilion x360 Convertible New Pavilion PC convertibles and notebooks with premium features power amazing experiences at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival Gallery 12 images   At Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival 2017, HP as a company has arrived with its Pavilion laptops which are quite practical and nitty-gritty in their basic nature. HP has selected a funky venue for the release and launch of its Pavilion laptops. This is none other than Coachella. While this may sound far out in fact the firm has a solid rationale behind this choice. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com The showcasing of the laptops’ novel stylus input support may be a subject of intense interest for the artistic and bohemian crowd of creative people. That is because they are the ones who normally haunt Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival 2017 for its psychedelic musical aura.  “Coachella is the perfect venue to launch and show the inking capabilities in our new Pavilion line up because of the festival’s strong focus on music and art. Attendees can use the inking platform to create their own memorable experience at the show,” said Kevin Frost vice president and general manager of consumer personal systems, HP Inc. “Our latest Pavilion is a convertible offering features typically reserved for our premium products, including pen for those who want to draw or take notes directly on the screen, so students and aspiring digital creators can interact and create on our PCs in new and unique ways.” HP is furthermore luring in the artsy people via its DIY bandana-designing stations at its cool stall in the festival. These Pavilion laptops are in the convertible x360 and non-convertible Notebook choices. One of the people who tested the x360’s stylus to design a bandana found it to be a smooth and successful operation. Stylish lines of varying thickness were produced with the instrument. This pen of sorts runs on Windows Ink. The laptop’s screen was technicolored and easy to decipher. Everything could be seen with crystal clarity on the viewing space.   Besides the stylus input support, the notebooks also feature Intel and AMD processors which go on all the way up to Core i7 or A10. Thus the performance is absolutely the best. It is better than all the rest. Also the choice of adding an infrared camera for Windows Hello facial-recognition logins will be available to anyone who wants to utilize this technology. However, for those comfortable with the standard web camera, this facility too should work just fine.  The design of the Pavilion laptops is where you can separate the men from the boys. The various colorful exteriors leave one amazed and amused. They comprise of blue, red, pink, gold and silver hues. The bezel is also slimmer near the display unit. You get to pick the screen resolution you want to in a jiffy. However, the lack of a high resolution feature is the only way these laptops let the consumer down. The smooth design and funky hues make the laptops the best that money can buy. They are also there for a number of purposes. Having several ports, these laptops are also quite configuration-friendly. The prices differ depending on which one catches your eye. The HP Pavilion x360 11", 14" and 15" convertibles are available now at starting prices of $349, $449 and $579 respectively. And P Pavilion 14", 15" and 17" Laptops are available now at starting prices of $699.99, $599.99 and $629.99 respectively. If a consumer happens to be in the environs of Coachella this year, a visit to the HP tent is a must for a gander at these cool and classic laptops.  Gallery 12 images This story may contain affiliate links.

Who hasn’t been influenced by great novels like Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, which gave us virtual worlds, or Tom Cruise’s data gloves and gesture-controlled computer in Minority Report? Now those things have become real, and we want to see what’s coming next. Our theme is about what inspires game developers, executives, and investors to be creative. Part of the event will focus on the inspiration cycle that is accelerating as the walls between science fiction, video games, and real-world technology come down. We don’t think there’s another conference that focuses on the seams between these industries. This event will focus on inspiration and creativity. So much of what used to be science fiction is coming true, and it is inspiring even more accelerated visions of the future in games and other entertainment. We hope to inspire you by taking you to the moments that led to great ideas across multiple industries. You’ll leave refreshed and ready to change the worlds of gaming, technology, and more. We think this conference will offer a rare chance for cross-pollination and networking between high-level people in different industries, and we believe that insights in one place can lead to inspirations in another. This conference is for high-end gaming executives, startup CEOs, developers, investors, publishers, marketers, tech experts, entertainment industry professionals, sci-fi experts, AR and VR executives, and other professionals. I should also point out that this is where we try to create an actual GamesBeat community with our supporters, readers, and attendees.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News System-on-Chip Test Equipment Market – Drivers and Forecasts by Technavio LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Technavio analysts forecast the global system-on-chip (SoC) test equipment market to grow at a CAGR of more than 2% during the forecast period, according to their latest report. The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global SoC test measurement market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, Technavio analysts consider the revenue generated from the sales of the SoC test equipment. The demand for SoC test equipment is increasing because of the increasing use of digitization. Digitization allows electronic devices to exchange information in a digital format, which drives the development of small portable electronic devices that consume less power by integrating different features, reducing the size of semiconductor ICs, and lowering IC power consumption. The increasing automation across industries is leading to higher electronic content in devices. As a result, the complexity of SoCs is increasing at a rapid pace, which is driving the demand for SoC test equipment. Request a sample report: https://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=57277 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio hardware and semiconductor analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global SoC test measurement market: Emergence of IoT Internet of things (IoT) is the system of interrelated devices or things embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. It involves machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enabling devices to exchange and act upon information by eliminating human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Navin Rajendra, an industry expert in semiconductor equipment from Technavio, says, “IoT devices are equipped with memory, a microcontroller, wireless connectivity, and sensors. All these four components can function together in an SoC designed specifically for the IoT. Initially, custom embedded solutions offered the possibility to design just the desired features at a higher engineering cost to minimize the total cost of the device.” Miniaturization of electronic devices Vendors are focusing on manufacturing small portable electronic devices that consume less power by integrating different features, reducing the size of semiconductor ICs, and lowering IC power consumption. At present semiconductors with circuit line widths in the 20-nm range are used in electronic devices. The introduction of ultra-miniature circuits, with line widths in the 10-nm range, has increased their distribution in electronic devices. “SoC field-programmable devices arrays constitute hard embedded processor cores and complex programmable logic devices. These devices are important in the miniaturization of electronic components. They offer lower power use and faster processing speed. Intel acquired Altera on December 28, 2015, specifically to acquire this FPGA technology,” adds Navin. Increased demand for SoC test products in consumer electronics The consumer electronics industry is growing significantly due to the rising demand for smart devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices. Continuing growth of mobile phones and tablets has led to changes throughout the semiconductor supply chain and automated test equipment industry. Qualcomm introduced Snapdragon Wear 2100 SoC on February 11, 2016. This Snapdragon Wear platform extends its progress in wearables technology by providing sleek designs, long battery life, smart sensing and connected experiences in the next generation of wearable devices.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 April 2017 by Military News Ubuntu 17.04 Supports Widest Range of Container Capabilities LONDON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Ubuntu 17.04 released today, supporting Kubernetes, Docker, LXD and Snaps. This is the 26th release of Ubuntu, the world’s most widely deployed Linux OS and the leading platform for cloud and IoT operations. “The breadth and pace of open source innovation has made it the center of gravity in technology today, and the Ubuntu community has once again delivered the most reliable way to consume that innovation,” said Mark Shuttleworth, Founder of Canonical and Ubuntu. “While containers are the name of the game in cloud today, I would also highlight the speed at which snaps are enabling developers to deliver the very best bits to Linux machines on Ubuntu and other distributions, from the desktop to the cloud and beyond, at the edge of computing.” Containerization of applications and operations Ubuntu offers the most complete portfolio of container support in a Linux distribution, with snaps for singleton apps, LXD by Canonical for lightweight VM-style machine containers, and auto-updating Docker snap packages available in stable, candidate, beta and edge channels. The Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes 1.6, representing the very latest upstream container infrastructure, has 100% compatibility with Google’s hosted Kubernetes service GKE. Snaps are now supported across 10 Linux distributions. More than 1,000 snaps have been published since the release of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS across a range of Linux devices and sectors such as IoT (eg Blue Horizon, openHAB), networking (eg Quagga, Free Range Routing, SONIC, Keepalived), desktop (KDE, web, libreoffice and GNOME apps), and cloud / server (for example Kubernetes, etcd, Rocket.Chat). GNOME Software supports snap installation directly from a link on a web page and Canonical is working with both KDE and GNOME to ensure smooth integration of snaps in those desktop environments. LXD version 2.12, has gained support for GPUs in container machines, including NVidia CUDA support, making for very high performance GPGPU computing at scale. The new storage API for LXD enables the creation of multiple storage pools and attachment of volumes from those pools to LXD machine containers. LXD provides almost instant launching of container guests of a wide range of Linux distributions. The Canonical Distribution of Kubernetes (CDK) is the easiest way to deploy and operate K8s across Google, Azure, Amazon, Vmware, OpenStack and bare metal infrastructure, using a single command: ‘conjure-up kubernetes’. The product is now based on Kubernetes 1.6 with a commitment to ongoing updates matching the upstream release schedule. CDK 1.6 brings federation of multiple Kubernetes clusters, increased number of Kubernetes workers, improvements to authentication and access control, and native GPU support. OpenStack Ubuntu 17.04 includes OpenStack’s latest Ocata release, which is also available on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS via Canonical’s public Cloud Archive. Canonical’s OpenStack offering supports upgrades of running clouds without workload interruption. The introduction of Cells v2 in this release ensures that new clouds have a consistent way to scale from small to very large as capacity requirements change. Canonical’s BootStack service is a full OpenStack build, operate and transfer capability, with the option for Canonical to provide long-term operations services for a fixed price per server or per VM. Ubuntu 17.04 also includes Manila, OpenStack’s shared file system capability, and improvements for LDAP integration. Beta snaps for OpenStack Nova, Cinder, Glance, Keystone and Neutron are also available giving users an exciting new way to deploy OpenStack control plane services. Network performance in clouds and guests Ubuntu 17.04 delivers the Linux 4.10 kernel, with Amazon’s Elastic Network Adaptor (ENA) driver which supports up to 20 Gbps network speed on AWS. SR-IOV support for Microsoft Azure allows Azure guests direct access to the hardware NIC which results in higher throughput and lower latencies. The 4.10 kernel will also become the LTS Rolling Kernel in 16.04 LTS, with initial support for IBM’s Power 9 and Intel’s Purley platform. Simpler to install, simpler to run With its 17.04 release, Ubuntu switches from swap partitions to using swap files by default. This means a simpler partition layouts during installation, disk space savings and easier adjustment of swap size. LibreOffice 5.3, is the new default office suite. Driverless printing makes the installation and configuration of compatible printers automatic either when connecting via WiFi or USB. Ubuntu 17.04, with the widest range of desktop environments, compilers, stacks and tools, represents the efforts of thousands of developers across Debian, Ubuntu and many upstream projects. Our thanks go to everyone who makes this extraordinary platform for innovation possible. About Canonical Canonical is the company behind Ubuntu, the leading OS for container, cloud, scale-out and hyperscale computing. 65% of large-scale OpenStack deployments are on Ubuntu, using both KVM and the pure-container LXD hypervisor for the world’s fastest private clouds. Canonical provides enterprise support and services for commercial users of Ubuntu. Canonical leads the development of Juju, the model-driven operations system, and MAAS (Metal-as-a-Service), which creates a physical server cloud and IPAM for amazing data center operational efficiency. Established in 2004, Canonical is a privately held company.

"Following" : "Follow"}} April 13, 2017 11:42am   Comments Share: Toshiba Corp. (OTC: TOSYY) (OTC: TOSBF), teetering on the brink of death after an ill-fated foray into nuclear power, has no shortage of suitors for its lucrative flash memory chip unit, the second-biggest seller of the tech used in cellphones and many other electronics. The auction, which one analyst said involved four competitors, could get ugly. 4 Players Reuters reported Wednesday that California-based Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: WDC) was seeking to crash the auction, charging that Toshiba is violating a joint venture between the two, who together operate a plant in Japan. Western Digital urged that it should be given exclusive negotiating rights. Industry leader Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTC: SSNLF), U.S. chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ: AVGO), Taiwan's Foxconn (OTC: FXCOF) and South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (OTC: HXSCF) are among the reported suitors who have made offers. The Benefits Of Competition All the major NAND chip makers stand to benefit from the competition even if they aren’t involved in Toshiba’s chip business, including Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), which is ramping up production at a new plant in China, said analyst Thomas Diffely at DA Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. “If it goes under it’s a huge benefit to Micron, Hynix, Samsung and soon-to-be Intel,” he said. Analyst Commentary “I think in general that that market is very strong, but at the end of the day (the chip) is a commodity,” he added. “Once you take one supplier out of a tight supply, it is good for the makers and bad for the guys who buy them.” He said if Hynix succeeds in buying Toshiba’s chip business, it would vault into second place, behind Samsung. Toshiba is ailing because of the bankruptcy filing by its U.S. nuclear unit. Westinghouse Electric Co. It needs to sell all or part of its most lucrative asset to cover the writedown. Toshiba reported in Tokyo on Tuesday that “there are material events and conditions that raise the substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.” Related Links: Rumored Western Digital-Toshiba Deal Could Be Accretive To Earnings March PC Shipments Exceed Forecasts, Bode Well For Advanced Micro Devices And Intel __________ Image Credit: By The Conmunity - Pop Culture Geek from Los Angeles, CA, USA - CES 2012 - Toshiba, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons Posted-In: DA Davidson Reuters Thomas Diffely Westinghouse Electric CoNews Rumors M&A Tech Best of Benzinga © 2017 Benzinga.com.

The desert may seem like a bad place to set up a stand and show off your delicate computing hardware, but HP actually has a pretty good marketing idea behind this decision. HP is using the festival to show off the inking capabilities of its new Pavilion line, allowing users to stop into its lounge and design their own bandanas using Windows Ink. HP will then print off those bandanas on the spot, allowing Coachella attendees to take their designs with them. It’s a neat idea that seems like a good fit for Coachella, even if it is a little weird to see HP debuting new laptops there. Today’s announcement includes three new Pavilion x360 convertibles and three new Pavilion laptops. The Pavilion x360s are available in 11, 14, and 15-inch configurations with touchscreen options available, while the standard Pavilion laptops will ship 14, 15, and 17-inch models. Display size seems to be one of the only constants about these new notebooks, as nearly everything else is customizable to some degree. For instance, HP is including the range of Intel’s 7th-generation Core processors with these notebooks, as well as options for discrete graphics from either AMD or NVIDIA. You also have plenty of choices when it comes to storage – you can go with dual SSD and HDD storage, or choose single storage up to a 512GB SSD or a 2TB HDD. All models come equipped with a battery that offers up to 10 hours of life, with HP’s Fast Charge technology present in some models. All of these new Pavilions are available now, and if you’re going to be at Coachella this weekend, you can stop by the HP Lounge to try them out for yourself. The Pavilion X360 line starts at $349 for the 11-inch model, while the line of standard Pavilion laptops starts at $599.99.

Microsoft's next Surface may be a Chromebook competitor for schools Chromebooks rule the school, but a cheap Surface and cloud-based Windows could change that. Mark Hachman (PC World (US online)) on 13 April, 2017 21:00 0 - - - - print email If a low-cost Microsoft Surface with a cloud-based Windows operating system sounds a lot like a Chromebook, that’s probably no coincidence. Windows PCs have lost ground in the U.S. education market to Google’s browser-based laptops. As Microsoft sends out invitations for a May 5 event in New York, rumors suggest the company will announce a Surface for schools—among other things. Microsoft’s invitation to the event included the hashtag “#MicrosoftEDU,” framing the announcement within the context of the classroom. Microsoft is expected to weave together several announcements: a new Surface device, a new, managed Windows Cloud operating system, and probably a look ahead to the next major Windows update, dubbed Redstone 3. Other possibilities include a quiet refresh of the Surface Pro 4 with a new 7th-generation Kaby Lake chip, as well as an intriguing but unsubstantiated rumor that some form of Windows Cloud could replace Windows Mobile. Why this matters: Microsoft has repeatedly struggled to compete with Chromebooks. Little more than a year ago, for example, Acer, JP.IK, Lenovo all launched rugged clamshell PCs featuring spillproof keyboards, with prices beginning at $199. Microsoft launched Intune for Education, a version of its Intune management application that was supposed to make managing 30 or so PCs per classroom a snap. Apparently, it didn’t help: Chromebook momentum is still climbing, according to Jay Chou, who tracks PC sales for IDC.  Lenovo Lenovo’s ThinkPad 11e Chromebook. Microsoft wants to get hardware makers to start thinking of Windows instead. The target: Classroom Chromebooks Since bursting onto the scene in 2011, the Chromebook has excelled in academia, displacing Apple’s Macs and iPads, as well as Windows PCs. According to IDC, 7.5 million Chromebooks were sold into the U.S. education (K-12) market during 2016, versus 2 million Windows PCs. Microsoft must chip away at Chromebook’s heftier share before Windows PCs drop out of school altogether. First, though, Microsoft has to convince technology purchasers at individual school districts that Windows machines are a stronger value. It could be a tough assignment. “Chromebooks are successful in education for three key reasons,” Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder said in an email. “First, a great deal of educational software is now delivered over the web, which satisfies the precondition for using a web-based OS. Second, price—from a total cost of ownership perspective, which includes the device but also the manageability—has tended to come in lower for most schools. Third (and related), they are secure and manageable: As nearly zero-state devices, it’s easy to pass a Chromebook from student to student without security issues. And they are far easier to manage and deploy than existing Windows PC management tools.” Microsoft Microsoft’s Intune for Education attempted to overcome the limitations of Windows and attack Chromebooks.  Windows PCs do offer some advantages, however, according to IDC’s Chou. “The saving grace for Microsoft right now is that Chromebooks are having trouble at anything outside English-speaking markets right now,” he said. “They have good traction in the U.S. and Canada, and nothing much more beyond that.” The solution: a cheap, managed Surface? It’s unclear what kids themselves prefer (one source, cited by TechRepublic in 2014, said kids preferred using laptop keyboards versus tablets), which is why some believe a Surface for school could actually be a rugged clamshell. That seems likely if only because the Surface’s existing kickstand doesn’t stand a chance against an excitedly flailing third-grader. Detachable keyboards can get lost, too. If Microsoft does release a Surface two-in-one, I’d expect it to have rubber bumpers, at the very least. Rob Schultz It’s unlikely this Surface 3 could survive with kids in a classroom. Expect to see Windows Ink front and center. Microsoft’s said previously that its inking capabilities are a key advantage over Chromebooks. Most Chromebooks, anyway: Note that Samsung’s recently announced Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro have pen capabilities, though more primitive than those found in Windows 10.  Finally, there’s Windows Cloud. First discovered earlier this year, Cloud locks down the operating system to just UWP apps that can be downloaded from the Windows Store—great for administrators who want total control over what students can do on their PCs. Oddly, Cloud was later discovered to have an upgrade path to Windows 10 Pro, though that could be eliminated if it powers an education machine. A Windows Cloud-powered Surface clamshell or tablet with links to a managed version of the Windows Store seems likely. Here’s a quick rundown of other rumors around this event: A Surface Pro refresh built around Intel’s Kaby Lake chip is still expected at some point, but the scuttlebutt seems to be turning away from a launch at the May event. A more likely venue for a Surface Pro announcement might be Microsoft’s Build developer conference, starting just days later in Seattle. Though Microsoft’s Windows Mobile champion Joe Belfiore recently resurfaced from a nine-month sabbatical, there’s no buzz on a Surface Phone. Windows Mobile is apparently alive, if not well. “We continue to develop Windows 10 Mobile and support Lumia phones such as the Lumia 650, Lumia 950, and Lumia 950 XL, and phones from OEM partners like Acer, Alcatel, HP, Trinity and VAIO,” a Microsoft spokesman said recently. Could Windows Cloud replace Windows 10 Mobile? Probably not, but it’s an enticing thought if the rumored Surface Phone ends up being a foldable device. Microsoft is also expected to show off some of the features of its upcoming Redstone 3 release, which includes the My People feature and other improvements that fell through the cracks of the Windows 10 Creators Update. (More mixed reality? Let’s hope so.) Whatever happens, we’ll be onsite at both events to bring you the full report.  HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 More from HP Inc Join the Good Gear Guide newsletter!

Andrew Grant HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 I've had a multifunction printer in the office going on 10 years now. It was a neat bit of kit back in the day -- print, copy, scan, fax -- when printing over WiFi felt a bit like magic. It’s seen better days though and an upgrade’s well overdue. This HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 looks like it ticks all the same boxes: print, copy, scan, and fax. (Really? Does anyone fax anything any more? I guess it's good to know the facility’s there, just in case.) Printing over WiFi is more-or- less standard these days. Ed Dawson HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 As a freelance writer who is always on the go, I like my technology to be both efficient and effective so I can do my job well. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 Inkjet Printer ticks all the boxes in terms of form factor, performance and user interface. Michael Hargreaves Windows 10 for Business / Dell XPS 13 I’d happily recommend this touchscreen laptop and Windows 10 as a great way to get serious work done at a desk or on the road. Aysha Strobbe Windows 10 / HP Spectre x360 Ultimately, I think the Windows 10 environment is excellent for me as it caters for so many different uses. The inclusion of the Xbox app is also great for when you need some downtime too! Mark Escubio Windows 10 / Lenovo Yoga 910 For me, the Xbox Play Anywhere is a great new feature as it allows you to play your current Xbox games with higher resolutions and better graphics without forking out extra cash for another copy. Although available titles are still scarce, but I’m sure it will grow in time.

(Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Technavio has announced the release of their 'System-on-Chip Test Equipment Market 2017-2021' report. (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail April 13, 2017 11:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Technavio analysts forecast the global system-on-chip (SoC) test equipment market to grow at a CAGR of more than 2% during the forecast period, according to their latest report. The research study covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global SoC test measurement market for 2017-2021. To calculate the market size, Technavio analysts consider the revenue generated from the sales of the SoC test equipment. The demand for SoC test equipment is increasing because of the increasing use of digitization. Digitization allows electronic devices to exchange information in a digital format, which drives the development of small portable electronic devices that consume less power by integrating different features, reducing the size of semiconductor ICs, and lowering IC power consumption. The increasing automation across industries is leading to higher electronic content in devices. As a result, the complexity of SoCs is increasing at a rapid pace, which is driving the demand for SoC test equipment. Request a sample report: https://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=57277 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Technavio hardware and semiconductor analysts highlight the following three factors that are contributing to the growth of the global SoC test measurement market: Emergence of IoT Internet of things (IoT) is the system of interrelated devices or things embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity. It involves machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enabling devices to exchange and act upon information by eliminating human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Navin Rajendra, an industry expert in semiconductor equipment from Technavio, says, “IoT devices are equipped with memory, a microcontroller, wireless connectivity, and sensors. All these four components can function together in an SoC designed specifically for the IoT. Initially, custom embedded solutions offered the possibility to design just the desired features at a higher engineering cost to minimize the total cost of the device.” Miniaturization of electronic devices Vendors are focusing on manufacturing small portable electronic devices that consume less power by integrating different features, reducing the size of semiconductor ICs, and lowering IC power consumption. At present semiconductors with circuit line widths in the 20-nm range are used in electronic devices. The introduction of ultra-miniature circuits, with line widths in the 10-nm range, has increased their distribution in electronic devices. “SoC field-programmable devices arrays constitute hard embedded processor cores and complex programmable logic devices. These devices are important in the miniaturization of electronic components. They offer lower power use and faster processing speed. Intel acquired Altera on December 28, 2015, specifically to acquire this FPGA technology,” adds Navin. Increased demand for SoC test products in consumer electronics The consumer electronics industry is growing significantly due to the rising demand for smart devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other smart devices. Continuing growth of mobile phones and tablets has led to changes throughout the semiconductor supply chain and automated test equipment industry. Qualcomm introduced Snapdragon Wear 2100 SoC on February 11, 2016. This Snapdragon Wear platform extends its progress in wearables technology by providing sleek designs, long battery life, smart sensing and connected experiences in the next generation of wearable devices.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 13 April 2017 | MYT 3:30 PM In Google’s fight with Uber, everyone loses: opinion by elaine ou It’s understandable that Google would be unhappy about losing ground to the competition, but the self-driving car industry will end up better off as a whole. — Reuters Uber is currently in trouble for, well, a lot of things, but one particularly problematic thing is the claim that the ride-hailing company acquired trade secrets stolen from Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. It’s also a case where Uber isn’t the one behaving badly.  According to a lawsuit filed by Waymo, employees swiped files describing proprietary self-driving technology just before leaving to start a competing company. The startup, Otto, existed for all of seven months before it was acquired by Uber Technologies Inc.  During this time, Google’s car project experienced a larger employee exodus, with many key players leaving to start or join new companies. So whatever happens, it’s looking like Google has already lost the battle.  Silicon Valley’s most valuable assets are its people, not its intellectual property. In the pharmaceutical industry, businesses revolve around patent licensing because it’s expensive and time-consuming to take a drug to market. For technology companies, the opposite is true – the industry evolves so quickly that today’s valuable property could be obsolete by tomorrow. Resources are better invested in developing new ideas than protecting old ones. Litigation is generally seen as the domain of ailing dinosaurs – Oracle Corp has been suing Google for the last seven years over the use of Java, a programming language developed in the 1990s.  There’s an argument to be made that protecting intellectual property encourages investment in new technology, but it was liberation from those protections that created Silicon Valley in the first place. In 1951, a patent for the semiconductor transistor was awarded to William Shockley and assigned to AT&T Bell Labs. As part of a 1956 antitrust settlement, AT&T agreed to provide royalty-free licensing on all its patents. Shockley promptly moved to Mountain View, California, where he founded Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories and recruited some of the earliest engineering talent to the valley.  Two years later, eight of Shockley’s employees left to start a competing company called Fairchild Semiconductor. The traitorous eight then saw their own employees leave to found other semiconductor businesses, including Intel, AMD, Intersil and National Semiconductor.  This type of procreation still happens today. For many years, Google had a company-wide policy of allowing employees one day per week to work on side projects. Google makes a point of telling new hires that the company doesn’t sue former employees for patent infringement. Its employees have gone on to start Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest.  The ex-Googlers, or Xooglers, even have their own investment community and Demo Day. As a Google recruiter put it to me once, Google’s appeal isn’t the job that you have while working at Google, it’s the job you can get after you leave Google.  Some of today’s popular tech companies have a median employment tenure of less than three years. Anywhere else, this type of turnover might be seen as a horrible failing. Here, it’s what keeps companies innovative. Ideas flow to where they’re treated best, even if that happens to be the hands of a competing startup.  Otto wasn’t the only self-driving car company founded by former members of the Google car team. Two top engineers left to start Nuro.ai; the hardware lead received a US$1bil (RM4.43bil) investment from Ford Motor Co for Argo AI; and Chris Urmson, former head of the Google Car project, has his own self-driving company called Aurora Innovation.  It’s understandable that Google would be unhappy about losing ground to the competition, but the self-driving car industry will end up better off as a whole. A few years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk made the company’s intellectual property available for free use. He explained that Tesla’s real competition wasn’t the other electric car manufacturers, but industry inertia.  For Tesla to be successful, the sustainable transportation movement had to be successful. Self-driving cars require a similar paradigm shift, which is something Waymo can’t achieve alone. It should welcome the competition. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested As Samsung’s profit surges, some investors worry about peaking growth Your magnetic smartphone holder could be disrupting your reception Apple considering multi-billion dollar investment in Toshiba chip unit SP Setia to be largest owner of prime land in country (Update) Put the brakes on our road terrors Number of ultra-high-net-worth Malaysians growing Others Also Read Federal Court rejects appeal, orders extradition of Bangkok bombing suspect Costa relishing Hazard partnership at Chelsea Bowled over by their mee rebus advertisement Latest News Tesla's Musk tells disgruntled shareholders: Buy Ford Company behind bitcoin creator sold to private investors Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Microsoft says US foreign intelligence surveillance requests more than doubled Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints Most Viewed in Tech Your magnetic smartphone holder could be disrupting your reception Mere tilt of your phone could cost you security Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints Microsoft says US foreign intelligence surveillance requests more than doubled Samsung Electronics says Galaxy S8 pre-orders exceeded S7 Apple considering multi-billion dollar investment in Toshiba chip unit Everybody hurts as Australia gets yet another mobile network Watch out for the hidden costs of free-to-play games GM to add 1,100 jobs in California over five years at self-driving unit Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Supplier Dell www.dell.com/au Price $2798 AUD > Pricing info Specs Intel 7th Generation Core i7-7Y75 CPU (2-cores, HyperThreading) • 16GB memory • 13.3-inch 3800 x 1800 IPS display • 512GB PCIe SSD Tweet Email this Print this Feedback One of the best just got better. Dell’s XPS 13 blew us away when it first arrived at the PCTA labs, being one of the thinnest and lightest ultraportable laptops around. Yet it didn’t scrimp on quality in the process, with a beautiful screen, sturdy construction and relatively powerful hardware within. Well, Dell has figured out how to make this beauty even better; by converting it into a 2-in-1.  According to Dell, this is officially the world’s smallest 13-inch 2-in-1 convertible. In fact, it’s even thinner than the already-anorexic XPS 13, dropping to a mere 13.7mm. It’s also incredibly light, as you’ll only have to lug a total of 1.24kg around all day, despite the chassis being built from rugged machined aluminium. The impeccably accurate 13.3-inch touch-screen features Dell’s InfinityEdge borderless design, allowing it to squeeze the screen into a smaller chassis than other 13-inch laptops. The version we reviewed packed a Quad HD+ display, with a resolution of 3200 x 1800, and uses IPS technology for wide viewing angles and glorious colour reproduction. There’s also a stylus included, and the screen can detect up to 2048 different levels of pressure, perfect for digital artists whipping up a quick draft. While the screen initially looks glossy, an anti-reflective coating on the Gorilla Glass means it’s perfectly viewable in direct sunlight, where the 400 Nits of brightness also helps out.  As this is a convertible, the hinges that allow the screen to flip are incredibly important. It uses a twin hinge system, and Dell claims these have been tested during the R&D phase through 20,000 full rotations without failing. They’re also extremely stiff, so you can use the touch screen without having to worry about the screen flailing about.  Given the extremely thin chassis, it’s no surprise that I/O options aren’t exactly numerous. There’s a standard USB 3.1 Type-C on one side which doubles as the power input, while on the other side a similar port also adds Thunderbolt 3 for ultra-fast transfers. Dell has included a USB Type-C to Type-A adaptor so you can use your older peripherals. The MicroSD slot will come in handy for quick storage upgrades, while the tiny Noble Lock slot means it won’t go missing from your work desk. Finally, a single headphone out delivers audio; you’ll want to use this, as the puny speakers within aren’t particularly impressive, distorting easily and lacking any form of bass.  So what has Dell managed to pack inside such a tiny machine? As with all Dell products, you can choose a huge variety of configurations, but the model we reviewed came in at $2,798, and featured the following. Powering it all is Intel’s 7th Generation Core i7-7Y75 CPU. This power-sipper is only a twin-core design, but does include HyperThreading. The tiny TDP of 4.5W means Dell could build a fully fan-free system, so it’s utterly silent in operation. The base speed of 1.3GHz isn’t blazing, but it does burst up to 3.6GHz when necessary. Paired with 16GB of memory, it’s a potent duo, but most impressive of all is the storage. A chunky 512GB PCIe SSD means applications open at the click of the silky smooth touch pad, and you can easily add a MicroSD card to add even more storage if necessary.   During our benchmarks, the machine posted a respectful score of 2670 in PCMark 8 Home’s Accelerated test. This puts it on par with Razer’s Stealth, but the battery life proved to be a real standout feature, lasting a whopping four hours in our extremely demanding PCMark 8 battery test. In real world use you can expect this to last for a solid fifteen hours of basic office productivity, while Dell claims it’ll stream Netflix for nine hours on a single charge.  To say that Dell has smashed it out of the park with the XPS 13 2-in-1 is an understatement. The XPS 13 was already a winner, but the latest version now has incredible battery life and is fully convertible, making it one of the most desirable ultraportables on the market.  Related Reviews Review: Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 Review: Asus ZenBook Flip UX360CA Review: Lenovo Ideapad Miix 700 Review: Dell Inspiron 15 5000 2-in-1 Review: Dell Inspiron 13 5000 2-in-1 delivers quality over battery Source: Copyright © PC & Tech Authority.

X The 95-year-old professor heralding a new type of long-lasting battery A new battery cell prototype may be the best chance tech has at creating faster, safer and longer-lasting rechargeable battery power Thu, Apr 13, 2017, 06:15 John Holden Prof John Goodenough (95): ‘I’m old enough to know you can’t close your mind to new ideas’         ‘Game-changer’ is an overused term in tech. But the development of a “low-cost all-solid-state battery that is noncombustible and has a long cycle with a high volumetric energy density and fast rates of charge and discharge,” is legitimately worthy of such a hackneyed phrase. What makes this breakthrough (sorry I couldn’t help it) even sweeter is that the research team responsible was led by Prof John Goodenough of the University of Texas in Austin. Now in his 95th year, Goodenough is no stranger to innovation in this field. In 1980, at the tender age of 57, he coinvented the lithium-ion battery, which shrank power into the tiny packages we are still familiar with 60 years on. Since the energy crisis in the 1970s, he has maintained an almost militant devotion to the defeat of pollution, principally caused by humanity’s over-dependence on petroleum and fossil fuels, leading him to focus on green science for most of his career. As the lithium-based storage provider became increasingly seen as dangerous, expensive and inadequate for the growing power needs of new generations, Goodenough searched for a solution through the development of safer, more solid batteries that were both low cost and lightweight. This was no easy task. Then he stumbled upon the work of Portuguese physicist, Maria Helena Braga, who had developed a kind of glass that replaces liquid electrolytes inside batteries. This, it transpired, was the missing part in Goodenough’s thesis. “I’m old enough to know you can’t close your mind to new ideas,” he says. “You have to test out every possibility if you want something new.” After two years of collaboration with Braga, Goodenough outlined the key elements which make their battery design novel. Low-cost alternative In a recent paper published by the journal Energy & Environmental Science, he described its significance in reference to existing electric car innovation: “Cost, safety, energy density, rates of charge and discharge and cycle life are critical for battery-driven cars to be more widely adopted. “We believe our discovery solves many of the problems that are inherent in today’s batteries.” This newest offering – a low-cost, all-solid-state battery that is noncombustible and has a long cycle life (battery life) with a high volumetric energy density and fast rates of charge and discharge – was completed in no small part with the contribution of now senior research fellow at UT, Maria Helena Braga. “It is safe, has very high energy density and it’s cheap to make,” she says. “We wanted to make a safe battery with a glass electrolyte and by trying certain approaches we found that we could make a new cell architecture. “It is a prototype but we are very optimistic that it can be commercialised soon. It does not depend on us anymore but on the industries that license.” The research team have demonstrated how their new battery cells have more than three times the energy density of modern lithium-ion batteries. In addition, no root-like dendrites form causing it to short-circuit – one of the biggest flaws of traditional lithium batteries. “No short circuits can take place in our prototype,” says Braga. “The electrolyte is not flammable, therefore no explosions or fires are possible.” The materials required are widely available and inexpensive. Any that aren’t, are cheap to synthesize and environmentally friendly. Tech-Xism Tech is fast becoming on par with the fashion industry for its reputation for ageism. From the 22-year-old Mark Zuckerburg becoming chief executive of Facebook, to the more recent news of 12-year-old inventor Shubham Banerjee securing venture-capital funds from Intel to start his own company, the idea that innovation and youth are joined at the hip isn’t going away. While it may be a fun yarn to spin, it isn’t true. According to an Information Technology and Innovation Foundation study from 2016, inventors “peak in their late 40s and tend to be highly productive in the last half of their careers”. Goodenough’s leading role in this tech innovation is a shining example of this. “I do not respect Prof Goodenough because he is 94 years old,” stresses Braga. “There are numerous other, more important reasons to respect him: his broad understanding of the complex fields of physics and chemistry, how he welcomes new ideas, his mental process during any scientific discussion: how he grabs life.” Most importantly is the practical scientific learning Braga has gained under Goodenough’s tutelage. “He may have taught me valuable life lessons about how we can still be active players in the future, but from a scientific point of view, I have learnt so much about batteries and magnetism.” The two are currently filing several patents and plan to work with commercial battery manufacturers in applying their new power storage approach to electric vehicles and energy storage devices.       Topics: John Goodenough Lin Lin Maria Helena Braga Mark Zuckerburg Innovation Foundation Facebook Intel Read More Ex-Army colleagues target handgun owners with new device Adidas plans to mass-produce 3D-printed runners Connemara seaweed ingredients firm eyes global markets Science breakthrough will let milk cartons send text messages Cork-based firm tackling the data deluge – with DNA If a new ID solution from SaaS start-up iDly Systems succeeds, plastic ID cards will be history Cork-based firm set to shake up global iron supplements market Read my lips: Irish start-up gets teeth into verification tools Axial3D secures £230,000 of new investment in seed funding Music industry starts to dance to streaming giant Spotify’s tune  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Apple reportedly considering bid for Toshiba’s chip business Work Preparation key to dealing with trauma of product recalls Sport Ireland ‘safest country in world’ to be an MMA fighter Economy Always-on world making people happier, survey claims Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Elaine Ou Google would be unhappy about losing ground to competition, but the self-driving car industry will end up better off as a whole. Photo: Bloomberg Uber is currently in trouble for, well, a lot of things, but one particularly problematic thing is the claim that the ride-hailing company acquired trade secrets stolen from Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. It’s also a case where Uber isn’t the one behaving badly. According to a lawsuit filed by Waymo, employees swiped files describing proprietary self-driving technology just before leaving to start a competing company. The start-up, Otto, existed for all of seven months before it was acquired by Uber Technologies Inc. During this time, Google’s car project experienced a larger employee exodus, with many key players leaving to start or join new companies. So whatever happens, it’s looking like Google has already lost the battle. Silicon Valley’s most valuable assets are its people, not its intellectual property. In the pharmaceutical industry, businesses revolve around patent licensing because it’s expensive and time-consuming to take a drug to market. For technology companies, the opposite is true—the industry evolves so quickly that today’s valuable property could be obsolete by tomorrow. Resources are better invested in developing new ideas than protecting old ones. Litigation is generally seen as the domain of ailing dinosaurs—Oracle Corp. has been suing Google for the last seven years over the use of Java, a programming language developed in the 1990s. There’s an argument to be made that protecting intellectual property encourages investment in new technology, but it was liberation from those protections that created Silicon Valley in the first place. In 1951, a patent for the semiconductor transistor was awarded to William Shockley and assigned to AT&T Bell Labs. As part of a 1956 antitrust settlement, AT&T agreed to provide royalty-free licensing on all its patents. Shockley promptly moved to Mountain View, California, where he founded Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories and recruited some of the earliest engineering talent to the valley. Two years later, eight of Shockley’s employees left to start a competing company called Fairchild Semiconductor. The traitorous eight then saw their own employees leave to found other semiconductor businesses, including Intel, AMD, Intersil and National Semiconductor. This type of procreation still happens today. For many years, Google had a company-wide policy of allowing employees one day per week to work on side projects. Google makes a point of telling new hires that the company doesn’t sue former employees for patent infringement. Its employees have gone on to start Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest. The ex-Googlers, or Xooglers, even have their own investment community and Demo Day. As a Google recruiter put it to me once, Google’s appeal isn’t the job that you have while working at Google, it’s the job you can get after you leave Google. Some of today’s popular tech companies have a median employment tenure of less than three years. Anywhere else, this type of turnover might be seen as a horrible failing. Here, it’s what keeps companies innovative. Ideas flow to where they’re treated best, even if that happens to be the hands of a competing startup. Otto wasn’t the only self-driving car company founded by former members of the Google car team. Two top engineers left to start Nuro.ai; the hardware lead received a $1 billion investment from Ford Motor Co. for Argo AI; and Chris Urmson, former head of the Google Car project, has his own self-driving company called Aurora Innovation. It’s understandable that Google would be unhappy about losing ground to the competition, but the self-driving car industry will end up better off as a whole. A few years ago, Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk made the company’s intellectual property available for free use. He explained that Tesla’s real competition wasn’t the other electric car manufacturers, but industry inertia. For Tesla to be successful, the sustainable transportation movement had to be successful. Self-driving cars require a similar paradigm shift, which is something Waymo can’t achieve alone. It should welcome the competition.

"The truth is, what's happening here has much less to do with the semiconductor business than it does with the ... actual business of money management — the perception of what's a bargain versus what's expensive in a portfolio manager's eyes," the "Mad Money" host said. AMD and Nvidia both make graphic chips for gaming and have growing exposure to data centers. AMD also supplies the personal computer and virtual reality businesses, while Nvidia has ties with the connected car and artificial intelligence. Both of the companies stock's have also soared. AMD has shot up 362 percent in a year, while Nvidia has seen a 171 percent gain. But AMD slid over 16 percent from its February highs, and Nvidia is down over 18 percent since then. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer investigates why AMD and NVDA's stocks just got rattled    Wednesday, 12 Apr 2017 | 6:48 PM ET | 09:36 "If there's one thing money managers hate more than flat-out losing money on an investment, it's giving up tremendous gains," Cramer said. "After the amazing moves in Nvidia and AMD, you have to believe there were a ton of institutional investors out there who were looking for any excuse whatsoever to ring the register and take some profits." So when a number of analysts suggested investors should sell Nvidia and Goldman Sachs slapped a "sell" rating on AMD, the stocks became hard to own and funds shed their shares. Cramer also nodded to the rebounding popularity of cellphone-oriented chipmakers that were all but irrelevant on Wall Street until Apple began to regain its momentum. "It's live by Apple, die by Apple," Cramer said. "Lately, ... names like Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo, Micron — although much less lately — and Broadcom have come back into vogue, and all of these stocks remain way, way cheaper than Nvidia and AMD." If you are nervous about owning Nvidia or AMD despite nothing being wrong with the companies themselves, Cramer suggests picking up a diversified name like Broadcom. "I still like Broadcom, which I think has a lot more upside," Cramer said, adding that the company will soon complete its $6 billion acquisition of Brocade and has a good record of making deals. He also suggested going for Intel, which has an inexpensive stock and just made a promising deal with Mobileye that puts it front and center in the self-driving vehicle space. Or buy up the semiconductor equipment plays like Lam Research and KLA-Tencor, which are less susceptible to the market's moodiness and whose products are in steady demand. "You have to recognize that these two winners are suffering from severe profit-taking, and that's driving cash toward cheaper stocks," Cramer concluded. "[AMD and Nvidia are] doing great, but portfolio managers want to play the Apple cycle right now, provided Apple doesn't crush its suppliers, and they're using the proceeds from their big wins in AMD and Nvidia to do just that."
