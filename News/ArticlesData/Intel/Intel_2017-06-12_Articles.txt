Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page WASHINGTON -- A business partner of former national security adviser Michael Flynn took part in sensitive hiring and policy discussions involving U.S. intelligence as a member of President Donald Trump's transition team, but failed to inform Trump's team that he had conducted political work on behalf of a foreign client of Flynn and might have to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Internal records for Flynn's partner, Bijan Kian, indicate he had not disclosed his work on behalf of a Turkish businessman last year with the Flynn Intel Group or provided any warning that he planned to file as a foreign agent, a current Trump transition official told The Associated Press. Kian, a little-known figure active on the presidential transition team, is emerging as a key player in the political controversy involving Flynn, Trump's fired national security adviser. "He did not indicate that to us in his transition documents. We would have no reason to know," said the transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Kian's role during the post-election period. Almost two months after the transition period, both Kian and Flynn filed in March as foreign agents with the Justice Department, acknowledging their political work for Turkish-run Inovo BV could have principally benefited the government of Turkey. For Kian, who led most of Flynn Intel Group's research and lobbying for a Turkish businessman, the Trump transition role offered influence in the selection of intelligence agency candidates and access to internal discussions of U.S. national security policy. But Kian's participation in the transition -- following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey's government -- reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration's vetting process. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is co-sponsoring a bill to toughen regulation of Americans performing political work for foreign interests, said Tuesday it was "very troubling that an unregistered foreign agent was playing a key role in the Trump administration's transition." She added that "similar to General Flynn, someone working on behalf of foreign governments should never be put in a position where they're making important decisions within our government." An Iranian-American businessman whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, Kian did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Kian described his transition role on his LinkedIn profile as "deputy lead" assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided "policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare" candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials who met with Kian during that period said Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general's sounding board. One of the officials said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump's CIA director. The second official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition's work. Like Kian, Flynn also worked on the transition while he was under Justice Department scrutiny for the Turkish work. But, as the AP previously reported, Flynn did inform the Trump transition about his Turkish work through his attorneys, who notified the transition he might have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn joined the administration, his attorneys followed up with the White House counsel's office, disclosing that Flynn would indeed be registering with the government as a foreign agent. As Flynn's little-known business partner, Kian played a key role last year in supervising much of Flynn Intel Group's foreign work while the former U.S. lieutenant general campaigned for Trump. The research and lobbying they conducted for the Turkish firm has boomeranged on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Flynn's mishandling of his dealings with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing in February by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group's creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn's company and records submitted to the Justice Department.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > Intel’s newest Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X… Intel’s newest Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X CPUs coming as soon as this month By Mark Coppock — June 13, 2017 11:41 am Subscribe Share Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Intel and AMD are competing like crazy in making faster and cheaper CPUs, and your next PC will be more powerful because of it. The CPU wars have heated up recently, with AMD releasing its Ryzen chips based on its new Zen architecture and Intel responding with some price cuts and by accelerating its plans for faster Core processors. Now, Intel has announced a roadmap at E3 2017 for some of its most powerful CPUs ever. Specifically, Intel will be releasing its X299 chipset and a number of Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X processors to go with it that should better position it to compete with AMD’s fastest options. The new products should start arriving on June 19, 2017 and then continue to roll out through the summer and into the fall. The new Core-X processor family will offer between four and 16 cores with multithreading and will support the most advanced technologies such as its Intel’s Optane memory, Thunderbolt 3, and faster RAM. And as Anandtech reports, a range of new CPUs will be available starting on June 26, 2017 as part of Intel’s Basin Falls X299 platform: i5-7640X i7-7740X i7-7800X i7-7820X i9-7900X Cores: 4 Cores/4 Threads 4 Cores/8 Threads 6 Cores/12 Threads 8 Cores/16 Threads 10 Cores/20 Threads Base Clock: 4.0GHz 4.3GHz 3.5GHz 3.6GHz 3.3GHz Turbo Clock: 4.2GHz 4.5GHz 4.0GHz 4.3GHz 4.3GHz TurboMax Clock: N/A N/A N/A 4.5GHz 4.5GHz L2 Cache: 256KB per core 256KB per core 1MB per core 1MB per core 1MB per core L3 Cache: 6MB 8MB 8.25MB 11MB 13.75MB PCIe Lanes: 16 16 28 28 44 RAM Channels: 2 2 4 4 4 Memory Speed: DDR4-2666MHz DDR4-2666MHz DDR4-2400MHz DDR4-2666MHz DDR4-2666MHz TDP: 112 watts 112 watts 140 watts 140 watts 140 watts Price: $242 $339 $389 $599 $999 In addition, Intel is expected to start shipping 12-core processors in August and then 14, 16, and 18-core CPUs in October. That will allow the company to compete more directly with AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper chips with 16 cores that are due to ship over the summer. Many of these parts are multithreaded, meaning that we’re looking at processors with between four and 36 threads, which will provide for some serious computing power on the desktop. If you’re building a new PC, then you have a dizzying array of new CPUs to choose from. Given AMD’s upcoming Vega GPUs and Nvidia’s inevitable response, building a new PC any time in the next year is going to involve a number of important choices. It’s great, however, that all of this competition is going to result in even more powerful PCs for less money.

(Alfredo Flores via AP) WASHINGTON – A business partner of former national security adviser Michael Flynn took part in sensitive hiring and policy discussions involving U.S. intelligence as a member of President Donald Trump’s transition team, but failed to inform Trump’s team that he had conducted political work on behalf of a foreign client of Flynn and might have to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent.

The research and lobbying they conducted for the Turkish firm has boomeranged on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Flynn’s mishandling of his dealings with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing in February by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. But the inquiries spawned by Flynn Intel’s Turkish work pose added legal complications for both Flynn and his associates. Federal investigators are concentrating on possible criminal violations and a House oversight committee inquiry is examining Flynn’s records to determine whether he lied to federal officials about his foreign contacts and payments. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group’s creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn’s company and records submitted to the Justice Department. Kian connected Flynn with his Turkish client, helped to negotiate their $600,000 contract and oversaw a documentary and an op-ed aimed at an opponent of Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the client and several others who requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The client, Ekim Alptekin, also confirmed to the AP that Kian worked for one of his Turkish companies at the same time he was working for Flynn Intel. “Content-wise, it was Bijan handling the day-to-day details,” Alptekin said during a recent interview in Washington. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. “I’m very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing,” he said. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. Kian’s interests repeatedly intersected with Flynn’s business ventures and political activities after Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, left the government in 2014. Kian, a former director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, shared Flynn’s strong public opposition to Iran’s theocratic government and a common interest in the development of secure communications systems. Until Trump’s election, Flynn served with Kian on the board of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology firm Kian headed until April. Flynn and Kian co-authored a 2015 op-ed about ISIS militants, and attended galas put on by the Nowruz Commission, a non-profit run by Kian and his wife promoting the Iranian Nowruz holiday. Alptekin was named a board director of that group in 2011. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel’s linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn’s firm together last summer with Alptekin’s Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the “main one” representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn “wasn’t involved at all” in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo ended up paying Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Flynn Intel disclosed its contract and other details of its Turkish work last March to the Justice Department, which regulates lobbying and other political activities for foreign interests in the U.S. Flynn and Kian were the only individuals who personally registered as foreign agents for Inovo. Kian and Alptekin had an existing business relationship when Flynn Intel began its foreign work. Alptekin confirmed Kian had been vice chairman of his Istanbul-based aviation company, EA Havacilik, since November 2011. Alptekin said he and Kian regularly strategized to build an aviation customer base. Alptekin has denied that any of Inovo’s work was done at the direction of Turkey’s government, but he is a member of a foreign trade board managed by the country’s economic ministry. Alptekin said he first met Kian during Kian’s stint on the Export-Import bank board for the Bush and Obama administrations between 2006 and 2011. Kian promoted U.S. business interests abroad for the bank, meeting officials in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations, according to State Department cables released by WikiLeaks. In his supervisory role for Flynn Intel, Kian was not always explicit about his ties to the firm, said several people who worked with him. Kian led a lobbying meeting last October with a representative of the House Homeland Security committee on behalf of GreenZone’s secure communications products. But, as the AP previously reported, the session veered into a lobbying pitch for Flynn Intel, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the meeting. Kian and others involved pressed for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen but the request went nowhere, the official said. Kian never identified who he was working for, the official said. Kian also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey’s government as America’s “strongest ally” against terrorism and pressing for Gulen’s extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. “I assumed since Bijan was the one who hired me, that he had written it,” said Cox. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn’s name. “I was only vaguely aware of General Flynn at the time but I had no idea I was working for him or his company,” Cox said. Flynn’s firm told the Justice Department that Flynn, Kian and Cox drafted the op-ed based on the firm’s research for Inovo. The firm said neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government wrote or directed the op-ed, but Flynn Intel acknowledged it shared a draft with Inovo in advance of publication. Flynn’s op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on Election Day, drew scrutiny from the Justice Department’s foreign agent unit. Pressure from those officials forced Flynn and Kian to file as foreign agents and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Pace contributed to this report. ___ Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

By Jon Gold Senior Writer, Network World | Jun 9, 2017 10:30 AM PT Credit: Thinkstock Related IoT standards battles could get messy 15 IoT tools connected to Raspberry Pi 11 technologies developers should explore now Video Internet of tractors: how sensors and software improve farming accuracy It’s a Linux world, and the rest of computing is just living in it – often literally, thanks to containerization. IoT, in all of its manifold forms, is no exception, and the Linux Foundation lists these seven projects as the key players in the march of connected open-source systems. Here’s a quick rundown. Automotive-Grade Linux Started: 2012 Key Members: A mix of big car companies (including Mazda, Suzuki, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Ford), and a diverse array of well-known tech names. Everything from carriers (China Mobile, NTT), silicon makers (Intel, ARM, Nvidia) to electronics powerhouses like LG, Samsung and Panasonic. +ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: Experts: The future of IoT will be fascinating and also potentially catastrophic + Top 5 Reasons IoT projects fail Big Idea: The plan, which is evident from the extensive and wide-ranging list of official project members, is to create an overarching standard for all areas of automotive IoT – everything from telematics to instrumentation to self-driving cars to streaming Netflix for the kids in the back seat. AGL boasts that it’s the only such ecosystem that’s aiming at all those targets at once. EdgeX Foundry Started: 2017 Key Members: Big names like AMD, Dell/EMC and VMware, operating systems players like Canonical and Linaro, and a host of smaller companies, many of which are related to the cloud in some way. Big Idea: There are lots of projects and even companies floating around the technology industry with “foundry” in their names, possibly because it sounds industrious and hardworking. It’s arguably more appropriate than most usages here, because EdgeX Foundry is a project devoted to creating open standards for industrial IoT – not all the way down at the sensor level, but ensuring that the hubs, routers and servers that connect them are all speaking the same language. Tizen Started: 2012 Key Members: It was originally a Samsung project, but several other major East Asian tech giants are now members of the executive or advisory boards, including SK Telecom, LG, Huawei, KT and NTT. Oh, also Intel, Orange and Vodafone. Big Idea: Tizen started life as Samsung’s bargaining chip during its sometimes-tense relationship with Google Android on the way to the top of the global smartphone marketplace – Tizen was, ostensibly, a replacement operating system the company could turn to if it decided it didn’t like working with Android anymore. These days, Tizen is likelier to show up on Samsung-built smart watches and TVs than on smartphones (though the company does still have some plans to deploy it there), but there are some clouds on its horizon, with the recent revelation of a large number of serious security holes. Dronecode Started: 2014 Key Members: The big players are U.S.-based 3D Robotics and China’s Yuneec International, both unmanned aerospace companies. Also on board are Intel, Qualcomm and a raft of lesser-known names related to drones. Big Idea: You’ll be stunned to learn that the big idea is drones – Dronecode aims to deliver an open-source UAV platform, encompassing everything from flight control and autopilot to a custom developer API for “advanced use cases.” Dronecode’s codebase can be used to create software for custom-built drones, whether you’re making them to swoop around and annoy the neighbors or monitor complex atmospheric conditions. AllJoyn/IoTivity Started: 2016 (as joint) Key Members: Lots of different stakeholders here, including CableLabs, LG, Microsoft, Samsung and Cisco, in addition to the usual players like Intel and Qualcomm. Everyone from the cable ISPs to the wireless providers to smartphone makers to Lowe’s is on the Open Connectivity Foundation’s membership rolls. Big Idea: These were originally two different projects, but they merged in 2016 under the aegis of the Linux Foundation’s OCF. The idea is to combine IoTivity’s discovery and data management tools with AllJoyn’s service frameworks and router functionality for a complete, generic IoT platform. Zephyr Project Started: 2016 Key Members: Stop me if you’ve heard this one: Intel is a platinum member, along with Linaro, NXP Semiconductors and electronic design automation company Synopsys. Big Idea: Zephyr is a real-time operating system designed to be both highly secure and able to be run on devices with extremely limited computing power – i.e. lots of IoT endpoints. Everything from connected sensors to signage up to the wireless gateway level should be able to run Zephyr, and the current objective seems to be ensuring compatibility across the huge range of devices on which it could be useful. Yocto Project Started: 2010 Key Members: In addition to ubiquitous open-source names like Intel, AMD and Linaro, companies like Juniper Networks, Dell and even Comcast are participants in the Yocto Project. Big Idea: Yocto is a project designed to help users create customizeable Linux distributions that will run on whatever embedded hardware is available. The core of the project is a development environment that includes tools and guidelines for the creation of those systems, and methods to keep them up to date for any system that a user wants to run them on. The idea is to allow app creators to focus more on core functionality and less on adapting their software to run on particular platforms.

The investors were Norwest Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Microsoft Ventures, The Westly Group and USAA. PRESS RELEASE AUSTIN, TX–(Jun 13, 2017) – CognitiveScale, a provider of industry-specific machine intelligence software, today announced it has received an additional $15 million in funding, bringing the company’s total to $50 million raised to-date. This latest investment from Norwest Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Microsoft Ventures, The Westly Group and USAA, allows CognitiveScale to further develop its augmented intelligence products to deliver better business outcomes and customer engagement for leading global enterprises. “We are excited about the future AI-enabled enterprise, and believe no other company is better equipped to bring it to fruition than CognitiveScale,” said Promod Haque, Senior Manager Partner, Norwest Venture Partners. “We’ve seen how CognitiveScale’s unique, industry-tailored AI software can create value more quickly by transforming customer engagement and augmenting employee decision making, allowing enterprises to perform at levels they never thought possible.” As artificial intelligence evolves, becoming a bigger part of businesses’ and consumers’ daily decision-making, the fear that machines will displace much of today’s workforce has become more pronounced. CognitiveScale believes the real power and value of AI is not just automation of routine processes but in extending and enhancing human decision making and creative potential. According to a December 2016 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), augmented intelligence has the potential to create new jobs in fields that require creativity, social interactions and intelligence and general knowledge. In addition, a study from Accenture projects that AI will increase labor productivity by up to 40 percent and double annual economic growth rates by 2035 by changing the nature of work and creating a new relationship between man and machine. “This round of funding demonstrates continued confidence in our strategy to help businesses augment and extend human creativity and capabilities,” said CEO of CognitiveScale Akshay Sabhikhi. “We have delivered real and measurable outcomes with some of the largest banks, healthcare and retail organizations, and are delighted to see the great client and investor demand for our enterprise AI products.” CognitiveScale will use the recent funding to further advance the state of its two flagship products, ENGAGE and AMPLIFY, which are built on its open and extensible Cortex OS. ENGAGE focuses on transforming customer experience at the edge of the business through any digital touch point. It interprets user goals, preferences, and context and delivers individualized insights by reasoning across billions of curated industry data points while learning continuously. While ENGAGE works at the edge, AMPLIFY works at the core of an organization, helping augment knowledge workers with contextual insights and deploy self-learning autonomous processes modeled after human cognitive architecture. Both products learn from new data and customer interactions, and deliver future insights and advice that account for dynamic changes in goals, preferences, and the business environment.

(Alfredo Flores via AP) Posted: Tuesday, June 13, 2017 9:50 am Trump transition aide was key player in Flynn's Turkish work Associated Press | 0 comments WASHINGTON (AP) — As Michael Flynn spent last fall campaigning as Donald Trump's top national security adviser, his little-known business partner supervised much of the foreign political work for Turkish interests that has boomeranged on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Flynn's partner, Bijan Kian, joined the former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency on Trump's national security transition team after the election. For Kian, who led most of Flynn Intel Group's research and lobbying for a Turkish businessman, the Trump transition role offered influence in the selection of intelligence agency candidates and access to internal discussions of U.S. national security policy. Flynn's mishandling of his dealings with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. But inquiries spawned by Flynn Intel's Turkish work pose added legal complications for both Flynn and his associates. Federal investigators are concentrating on possible criminal violations and a House oversight committee inquiry is examining Flynn's records to determine whether he lied to federal officials about his foreign contacts and payments. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group's creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn's company and records submitted to the Justice Department. And Kian's participation in the Trump transition — following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey's government — reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration's vetting process. A current Trump transition official said Monday night that Kian's records did not reflect his foreign work for Flynn Intel or indicate he planned to register with the U.S. government as an agent for his work on behalf of a foreign interest. "He did not indicate that to us in his transition documents. We would have no reason to know," said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss Kian's role during the post-election period. Both Kian and Flynn filed in March as foreign agents for the Turkish firm. Kian connected Flynn with his Turkish client, helped negotiate their $600,000 contract and oversaw a documentary and an op-ed aimed at an opponent of Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the client and several others who requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The client, Ekim Alptekin, also confirmed to The Associated Press that Kian worked for one of his Turkish companies at the same time he was working for Flynn Intel. Kian, whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. "I'm very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing," he said. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. On the president-elect's transition team, Kian described his role on his LinkedIn profile as "deputy lead" assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided "policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare" candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials said Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general's sounding board. One official said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump's CIA director. Another official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added that Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition's work. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel's linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn's firm together last summer with Alptekin's Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the "main one" representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn "wasn't involved at all" in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo paid Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Kian led lobbying portions of the work and also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey's government as America's "strongest ally" against terrorism and pressing for Gulen's extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn's name. The op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on election day, drew scrutiny just weeks later from the Justice Department's foreign agent unit and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Pace contributed to this report. ___ Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press: http://www.ap.org/tips Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Kian, whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. "I'm very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing," he said. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. On the president-elect's transition team, Kian described his role on his LinkedIn profile as "deputy lead" assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided "policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare" candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials said Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general's sounding board. One official said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump's CIA director. Another official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added that Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition's work. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel's linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn's firm together last summer with Alptekin's Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the "main one" representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn "wasn't involved at all" in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo paid Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Kian led lobbying portions of the work and also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey's government as America's "strongest ally" against terrorism and pressing for Gulen's extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn's name. The op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on election day, drew scrutiny just weeks later from the Justice Department's foreign agent unit and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Pace contributed to this report. ___ Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press: http://www.ap.org/tips Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / Alienware is going all-in on Threadripper, Core-X and gaming peripherals Alienware is going all-in on Threadripper, Core-X and gaming peripherals Matthew Wilson 3 days ago Featured Tech News, Gaming PC Alienware arrived at E3 this year in force, with a slew of new gaming systems, new peripherals and even a high-performance 240Hz gaming monitor. Beyond updated X299 and X399 Alienware Area-51 desktops, there is also a new Alienware 15 featuring Nvidia’s new Max-Q technology, making it one of the company’s thinnest gaming laptops ever. Let’s get started with desktops. Alienware is updating the Area-51 desktop system with new AMD Ryzen Threadripper and Intel Core X processor options. This will be Alienware’s first 16-core system, which will come overclocked up to 4.5GHz across all cores. For those who prefer Intel, there will also be Core i9 options. The Area-51 Threadripper Edition will be available in September (we heard earlier today that Threadripper would launch in August), meanwhile, Intel Core X options will launch on the 22nd of August. Back at Computex, Nvidia unveiled its new Max-Q design initiative, aiming to usher in a new age of ultra thin but ultra powerful gaming laptops. Alienware will be right at the forefront with the Alienware 15 laptop, featuring a GTX 1080 and Max-Q design technology. At its peak, this laptop should only use 110 watts, which means you should be able to game for longer on a 99Whr battery. That said, I don’t imagine many people are planning to use their gaming laptops unplugged for lengthy sessions. This laptop will be available from early July with pricing to come later on. Finally, Alienware is also expanding its presence in the gaming accessory market. For starters, there will be a full range of gaming peripherals complete with AlienFX lighting. The Alienware Advanced Gaming Keyboard is a mechanical board with brown switches, mixing the best of both worlds when it comes to tactile feedback and swift actuation. This is available on the 14th of July. Pairing with the keyboard is the Alienware Advanced and Elite gaming mice. The Advanced is geared towards shooters with fast DPI switching while the Elite is geared towards MMOs with lots of reprogrammable buttons. Both are coming in July. Finally, Alienware is also launching its very own gaming monitor. The AW2518H and AW2518HF are 25-inch G-sync and Freesync monitors. Both feature a TN panel for 1ms GTG response times along with a massive 240Hz refresh rate. This is a 1080p monitor, as you might expect given its size and refresh rate. This monitor will be available in July but pricing is yet to be determined. KitGuru Says: Alienware seems to be going all out at E3 this year with all of these announcements. A gaming monitor was probably the last thing I expected to see from them. What do you guys think of Alienware’s new lineup?

Then the company surprised once again, when it disclosed pricing of the Predator 21X in early January: at $8999, the machine is one of the most expensive gaming notebooks ever. By now, the PC is available, but this Predator will be a rare beast because only 300 will be made. The final version of the Predator 21 X notebook got Intel’s quad-core Core i7-7820HK CPU with an unlocked multiplier and overclocking capabilities, two GeForce GTX 1080 GPUs with 16 GB of GDDR5 memor,  as well as 64 GB of DDR4 RAM — specifications that even few gaming desktops can match. The storage sub-system of the Predator 21 X also resembles that of an SFF or AIO desktop: the machine can fit in four M.2 SSDs (NVMe or SATA) and one 2.5” hard drive. Acer ships the system with two 512 GB PCIe NVMe SSDs working in RAID 0 as well as one 1 TB 7200 RPM HGST HDD, but the system is upgradeable and owners can install almost whatever they want eventually. They key selling point of the Predator 21 X is its curved 21” IPS display panel with a 2560×1080 resolution, a 120 Hz refresh rate, and NVIDIA’s G-Sync dynamic refresh rate technology. After trying out the Predator 21 X at Computex, I cannot say that curvature on a monitor of this size is any more immersive to me, but it may work in a very dark room. In addition to curvature, the notebook also has Tobii infrared eye-tracking sensors, which opens up different user experiences in games that support the appropriate tech. Meanwhile the audio sub-system is also worth mentioning as it has four integrated speakers and two built-in subwoofers. Acer Predator 21 X   GX21-71-76ZF Display Size 21" Type 21" curved IPS Resolution 2560×1080 Refresh Rate 120 Hz CPU Core i7-7820HK (4C/8T, 8 MB, 2.9/3.9GHz) Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 in SLI with G-Sync support RAM 64 GB DDR4 Storage M.2 4 slots, two 512 GB SSDs with PCIe 3.0 x4 interface in RAID 0 installed 2.5" 1 bay, 1 TB HDD installed Wi-Fi 2×2 802.11ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.x Ethernet GbE USB 4 × USB 3.0 Type-A (one supports charging) Thunderbolt 1 × USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 connector Display Outputs 2 × DisplayPort 1.4 1 × HDMI 2.0b Keyboard Mechanical backlit keyboard with programmable keys Other I/O Microphone, stereo speakers, audio jacks, webcam, Tobii eye tracking Dimensions Width 22.4" | 56.9 cm Depth 12.4" | 31.5 cm Thickness 2.71” – 3.3” | 68.8 mm – 83.82 mm Battery Li-ion, 6000 mAh Weight 18.74 lbs (8.5 kilograms) Price $8999 in the U.S. As one would expect from a laptop that is 2.71” – 3.3” (68.8 mm – 83.82 mm) thick and weighs 18.74 lbs (8.5 kilograms), the Predator 21 X has all the connectivity that one might ever need (just like high-end desktops), including 2×2 802.11ac + Bluetooth Wi-Fi module, a Gigabit Ethernet port, one Thunderbolt 3 (USB Type-C) port, four USB 3.0 Type-A connectors, an HDMI 2.0 output, two DisplayPort 1.4 headers, and an SD card reader. For input, the Acer Predator 21 X uses a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX switches with five programmable buttons. The numeric keypad does not have mechanical switches, but it can be flipped and turned into a touchpad. From performance point of view, the Predator 21 X has rivals from ASUS and MSI, but when it comes to its curved 21”/120 Hz display panel, it does not really have direct competitors (except desktops, of course). Meanwhile, the panel itself is custom, which adds to the cost of an already expensive machine. After considering performance, dimensions and price, Acer figured out that demand for a laptop that is priced at $8999 will be limited, and instead of trying to reduce the price tag, decided to make an ultra-exclusive product out of its Predator 21 X. The company will only produce 300 of such machines (referring to 300 Spartans?), each of which will have an individual number. The Acer Predator 21 X will ship in a Pelican-style case that can be “repurposed” and actually be used as a luggage. Despite the price and dimensions, the Predator 21 X is sold out at Amazon.com in the U.S., but is still available from Micro Center and Newegg.

The keyboard and keyboard top plate really look good. Reply Notmyusualid - Tuesday, June 13, 2017 - link Preaching to the pope here mate. willis / Dan / peter are not living out of a suitcase, or they'd instantly understand this machine. At $9k, its a bit too sweet for my tastes even, but the nail in the coffin is not the price, it is the 1080 verticle resolution. I'm still stuck with my Alienware 18, which is an 1080p 18.4" panel, because I *need* a large screen as this is my work tool. I broke, and tried to pull the plug on an Alienware 17 with GTX1080 last month when in the states, but Dell couldn't ship in time, gladly. I really want another large-screen laptop, but I want it thinner like the XPS 15, so I guess I'll be using this AW18 for the forseeable future then. Reply close - Wednesday, June 14, 2017 - link Then you'd be living out of 2 suitcases :). I get the whole "power on the go" concept but this? You can't carry it every day so I assume you have to be living in a hotel for months at a time. For $9000 you're better off buying a PC and shipping it where you need it :). It's a 9Kg laptop. Add to it accessories and the case and you end up with something that's simply not mobile. You can't use it without a (sturdy) table, you can't take it on the plane as hand luggage, most people would have a hard time carrying it comfortably from their house door to the taxi. This is not the mobile workstation you're looking for :). It's an impractical concept which might have brought Acer some experience with building big machines. But for the consumer it's just a "collectible". Which is why they announced the limited run. Whoever buys it probably does so because only 300 are made, not to actually lug it around. Reply Notmyusualid - Thursday, June 15, 2017 - link @ close I do live out of hotels for months at a time. When it was all on expenses, I was platinum on most hotel chains. Per diem changes all that. Just his year I've done UK, Thailand, HK & mainland China , Colombia, and got back from Japan two weeks ago, and will be in South Korea on Tuesday. Last year was crazy too, year before not so much as I was busy with my Cisco certs. But that has been been my life since 1998, and so I'm on my 6th DTR machine. My AW18 is <6kg. Power brick 1.8kg. Add a small bag of dongles, serial cables etc, and everything still feels OK in the Alienware backpack. The Mrs complains though if she has to retrieve it from the car, and so its not acceptable weight to everyone. Imagine how many console windows you could have open with that wide screen... PS: I tried carrying a PC around with me, it was not practicle.

Internal records for Flynn's partner, Bijan Kian, indicate he had not disclosed his work on behalf of a Turkish businessman last year with the Flynn Intel Group or provided any warning that he planned to file as a foreign agent, a current Trump transition official told The Associated Press. Kian, a little-known figure active on the presidential transition team, is emerging as a key player in the political controversy involving Flynn, Trump's fired national security adviser. In this March 15, 2014, photo provided by Alfredo Flores, from left, Vice Admiral Michael Rogers; Paul Monteiro, vice chairman and co-Founder of Nowruz Commission; Bijan R. Kian and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn talk during the Fifth Annual Nowruz Commission Gala at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington. As Michael Flynn spent last fall campaigning as Donald Trump‚Äôs top national security adviser, Bijan Kian, his little-known business partner supervised much of the foreign political work for Turkish interests that has boomeranged back on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. (Alfredo Flores via AP) "He did not indicate that to us in his transition documents. We would have no reason to know," said the transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Kian's role during the post-election period. Almost two months after the transition period, both Kian and Flynn filed in March as foreign agents with the Justice Department, acknowledging their political work for Turkish-run Inovo BV could have principally benefited the government of Turkey. For Kian, who led most of Flynn Intel Group's research and lobbying for a Turkish businessman, the Trump transition role offered influence in the selection of intelligence agency candidates and access to internal discussions of U.S. national security policy. But Kian's participation in the transition — following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey's government — reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration's vetting process. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is co-sponsoring a bill to toughen regulation of Americans performing political work for foreign interests, said Tuesday it was "very troubling that an unregistered foreign agent was playing a key role in the Trump administration's transition." She added that "similar to General Flynn, someone working on behalf of foreign governments should never be put in a position where they're making important decisions within our government." An Iranian-American businessman whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, Kian did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Kian described his transition role on his LinkedIn profile as "deputy lead" assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided "policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare" candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials who met with Kian during that period said that Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general's sounding board. One of the officials said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump's CIA director. The second official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added that Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition's work. Like Kian, Flynn also worked on the transition while he was under Justice Department scrutiny for the Turkish work. But, as the AP previously reported , Flynn did inform the Trump transition about his Turkish work through his attorneys, who notified the transition he might have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn joined the administration, his attorneys followed up with the White House counsel's office, disclosing that Flynn would indeed be registering with the government as a foreign agent. As Flynn's little-known business partner, Kian played a key role last year in supervising much of Flynn Intel Group's foreign work while the former U.S. lieutenant general campaigned for Trump. The research and lobbying they conducted for the Turkish firm has boomeranged on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Flynn's mishandling of his dealings with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing in February by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. But the inquiries spawned by Flynn Intel's Turkish work pose added legal complications for both Flynn and his associates. Federal investigators are concentrating on possible criminal violations and a House oversight committee inquiry is examining Flynn's records to determine whether he lied to federal officials about his foreign contacts and payments. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group's creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn's company and records submitted to the Justice Department. Kian connected Flynn with his Turkish client, helped to negotiate their $600,000 contract and oversaw a documentary and an op-ed aimed at an opponent of Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the client and several others who requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The client, Ekim Alptekin, also confirmed to the AP that Kian worked for one of his Turkish companies at the same time he was working for Flynn Intel. "Content-wise, it was Bijan handling the day-to-day details," Alptekin said during a recent interview in Washington. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. "I'm very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing," he said. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. Kian's interests repeatedly intersected with Flynn's business ventures and political activities after Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, left the government in 2014. Kian, a former director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, shared Flynn's strong public opposition to Iran's theocratic government and a common interest in the development of secure communications systems. Until Trump's election, Flynn served with Kian on the board of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology firm Kian headed until April. Flynn and Kian co-authored a 2015 op-ed about ISIS militants, and attended galas put on by the Nowruz Commission, a non-profit run by Kian and his wife promoting the Iranian Nowruz holiday. Alptekin was named a board director of that group in 2011. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel's linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn's firm together last summer with Alptekin's Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the "main one" representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn "wasn't involved at all" in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo ended up paying Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Flynn Intel disclosed its contract and other details of its Turkish work last March to the Justice Department, which regulates lobbying and other political activities for foreign interests in the U.S. Flynn and Kian were the only individuals who personally registered as foreign agents for Inovo. Kian and Alptekin had an existing business relationship when Flynn Intel began its foreign work. Alptekin confirmed Kian had been vice chairman of his Istanbul-based aviation company, EA Havacilik, since November 2011. Alptekin said he and Kian regularly strategized to build an aviation customer base. Alptekin has denied that any of Inovo's work was done at the direction of Turkey's government, but he is a member of a foreign trade board managed by the country's economic ministry. Alptekin said he first met Kian during Kian's stint on the Export-Import bank board for the Bush and Obama administrations between 2006 and 2011. Kian promoted U.S. business interests abroad for the bank, meeting officials in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations, according to State Department cables released by WikiLeaks. In his supervisory role for Flynn Intel, Kian was not always explicit about his ties to the firm, said several people who worked with him. Kian led a lobbying meeting last October with a representative of the House Homeland Security committee on behalf of GreenZone's secure communications products. But, as the AP previously reported , the session veered into a lobbying pitch for Flynn Intel, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the meeting. Kian and others involved pressed for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen but the request went nowhere, the official said. Kian never identified who he was working for, the official said. Kian also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey's government as America's "strongest ally" against terrorism and pressing for Gulen's extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. "I assumed since Bijan was the one who hired me, that he had written it," said Cox. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn's name. "I was only vaguely aware of General Flynn at the time but I had no idea I was working for him or his company," Cox said. Flynn's firm told the Justice Department that Flynn, Kian and Cox drafted the op-ed based on the firm's research for Inovo. The firm said neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government wrote or directed the op-ed, but Flynn Intel acknowledged it shared a draft with Inovo in advance of publication. Flynn's op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on Election Day, drew scrutiny from the Justice Department's foreign agent unit. Pressure from those officials forced Flynn and Kian to file as foreign agents and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Pace contributed to this report. ___ Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips Advertisement Advertise With Us Report Error Submit a Tip RefundRefund You can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com.

AEye Announces $16 Million Series A Funding from Kleiner Perkins, Airbus Ventures and Intel Capital Company’s Advanced Vision Systems Promote Safe and Reliable Augmented and Autonomous Intelligence for the Aviation, Auto and Heavy Industries Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail AEye Advanced Vision System (Photo: Business Wire) June 13, 2017 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time PLEASANTON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AEye Inc, a robotic vision pioneer, today announced the close of a $16 million series A venture round from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Airbus Ventures, Intel Capital, Tyche Partners and others. AEye’s advanced vision system is the first to “pre-fuse” solid state LiDAR with computer vision, enabling newfound vision intelligence in autonomous vehicles. “We are excited to partner with such reputable firms who share our vision to expedite the delivery of safe, reliable autonomous transportation,” said Luis Dussan, CEO of AEye. “The biggest bottleneck to the rollout of robotic vision solutions has been the industry’s inability to deliver a world-class perception layer. Quick, accurate, intelligent interpretation of the environment that leverages and extends the human experience is the Holy Grail, and that’s exactly what AEye intends to deliver.” ABI Research forecasts global Mobility as a Service (MaaS), which is expected to have a disruptive impact on traditional transportation modes like car ownership, buses, trains, aviation, taxis, and rental cars, will exceed $1 trillion in revenues by 2030. According to BI Intelligence, the automotive sector alone will put 10 million self-driving cars on the road by the year 2020. Intel forecasts a new “Passenger Economy” powered by Mobility as a Service will be worth $7 trillion by 2050 and save, conservatively, 585,000 lives in the preceding decade. The Eyes and Brains of Vehicles AEye’s advanced vision system combines proprietary LiDAR and computer vision with artificial intelligence and customized software to enable a new level of safety for operators and passengers of autonomous or driver-assisted vehicles. The system intelligently scans a scene, focusing on its information content rather than data. By having a visual cortex behind the “eyes” of the vehicle that digests information quickly, AEye greatly improves reliability. At the same time, AEye’s solid state system, which uses a 1550 nanometer retina-safe laser, reduces bandwidth and improves performance to enable fast control loops through improved perception. AEye, based in the San Francisco Bay Area, is attracting some of the biggest and most innovative players in the automotive, heavy and aerospace industries. "AEye is a leading-edge innovator, whose robotic vision system is bringing unique capabilities to sense and avoid systems that will help revolutionize transportation," said Thomas d'Halluin, CEO, Airbus Ventures. "We're thrilled to support the team alongside other forward-looking strategic and financial investors, and we can't wait to be a part of AEye's growth as its technology helps drive the future of mobility." AEye will use its series A funding to commercialize its robotic vision system. The company is currently in early testing with large transportation and heavy industry OEMs, with phased commercial rollouts planned throughout 2017 and 2018. About AEye AEye develops advanced vision hardware, software and algorithms that act as the eyes and visual cortex of autonomous vehicles. Since the demonstration of its first solid state LiDAR scanner in 2013, AEye has pioneered breakthroughs in intelligent sensing and perception technology. The company is based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and backed by investors including Airbus Ventures, Intel Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, R7 Partners, Trucks Venture Capital and Tyche Partners.

The revised line-up includes more powerful desktop computers, upgraded laptops and new monitors built for high frame-rate gameplay. Area-51 Alienware's headline unveiling concerns two new versions of the Area-51, the company's popular gaming desktop PC. It now includes a new selection of processors from both Intel and AMD. Gamers will be able to pick a chip from either brand to reflect their personal buying preferences. Alienware Area-51 Dell On the Intel side, the full range of the company's new enthusiast processors will be available, up to the 18-core Core i9 series. AMD fans will be able to spec the firm's upcoming "Threadripper" chips which have up to 16 cores. Alienware said that regardless of the processor choice, the Area-51 will be capable of playing games at up to 8K resolution. The computer will launch in August. Laptops Alienware Dell Dell also announced new Alienware laptops spanning a range of different form factors. The Alienware 14, 17 and 18 are designed for gamers who don't have the space for a desktop PC, or who want to play while on the move. They have 14, 17 and 18-inch displays respectively with a full HD resolution. All three come with dedicated NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards for smooth gameplay in the latest games. Peripherals Accompanying the new systems is a fully-fledged range of Alienware accessories, all of which are targeted firmly at gamers. Two keyboards are available, the Advanced Gaming and Pro Gaming. Both come with mechanical keys and dedicated macro buttons. The $119.99 Pro Gaming adds additional features to the base $89.99 Advanced Gaming. These include zone-based RGB backlighting and a built-in volume roller control. Alienware Dell For mice, Alienware will be offering the $49.99 Advanced Gaming or $89.99 Elite Gaming. As with the keyboards, the "Advanced" branding denotes a less fully-featured but more affordable option. It has an ergonomic design and support for on-the-fly DPI changes. The Elite mouse expands on this by adding swappable grips and up to 13 programmable buttons. Monitor Completing the revised Alienware line-up is a new 25-inch monitor that's designed around the needs of gamers. While the resolution is comparatively low at 1920x1080 Full HD, the monitor has an exceptionally high 240Hz refresh rate. This is four times higher than the 60Hz of a regular PC monitor, minimising input lag and giving competitive gamers an advantage by improving responsiveness. It'll launch in the U.S. today priced from $499 to $699. "Fierce commitment" Dell said it has a "fierce commitment" to supporting PC gamers with its Alienware product line-up. The expanded 2017 range lets gamers buy every component of their workspace from the company, including the PC itself and all the core peripherals. Alienware said it launched the products based on customer requests. Alienware Dell "I love arriving at E3 every year to watch fans get blown away by our latest PC gaming innovations and this year is no exception," said Frank Azor, vice president and general manager of Alienware, Dell Gaming and XPS. "Our fans’ passion for Alienware and our gaming PCs is our lifeblood, and it’s only through our equal passion and commitment in delivering bleeding-edge innovation, design and performance, that we continue to exceed expectations and deliver on their requests." Dell also used E3 to announce new investments in esports gaming, including partnerships with several leading esports tournaments organisers. The company is sponsoring the upcoming CS:GO Clash for Cash: The Rematch event by ELEAGUE which features a $250,000 grand prize. The new Alienware products will arrive throughout the summer. Pricing on the updated Area-51 and Alienware laptops hasn't yet been announced.

I know, it’s been a real slow week for games news, huh? Try not to get the information overload get you down, though, because this is a pretty interesting business deal. As ESL’s official technology partner, Intel will power all of ESL’s activities in amateur and professional gaming, including online competition platforms ESL Play and ESEA, National Championships in multiple countries and major events such as the Intel Extreme Masters, ESL One and ESL Pro League. With the eSports audience expected to reach 500 million fans worldwide by 2020, and this year’s Intel Extreme Masters registering as the biggest eSports event in ESL’s history with 173,000 attendees and 46 million viewers, this partnership aims to deliver the best possible experience to meet the evolving technical demands of players and fans. The two companies also revealed the Intel Grand Slam that will offer a $1 million team prize. The Intel Grand Slam will reward the first team that wins four of the last 10 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive competitions hosted by ESL and DreamHack. Qualifying events include the Intel Extreme Masters, ESL One, ESL Pro League and DreamHack Masters series. The Intel Grand Slam will kick off at ESL One Cologne on July 7th-9th. Gregory Bryant, senior vice-president and general manager of the Client Computing Group at Intel, said of the partnership: “Intel’s involvement in eSports and the gaming community has spanned more than 15 years, and we’re always looking for ways to take the player and fan experience to the next level. In this next phase of our long-time partnership with ESL, we’re investing in the development of future eSports stars, further expanding our global footprint with the Intel Extreme Masters circuit, and exploring fresh formats like the Intel Grand Slam that we announced today.” And Ralf Reichert, CEO of ESL, said: “Intel has been a key partner for us since 2001, and the partnership was extended globally with the launch of the Intel® Extreme Masters in 2006. We’ve been building the eSports industry together with Intel for the last 15 years, and now look forward to building the future with Intel integrated into almost every ESL product globally.” Intel’s technology will be the backbone for ESL’s eSports events, studios and broadcasting operations, with all tournament PCs running the latest Intel Core i7 processors and all of the eSports League’s production hardware will be running on a combination of Intel Core and Xeon processors. Additionally, ESL’s studios in North America and Europe will be renamed The Intel eSports Arenas.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Source: AMD to launch Threadripper in August Source: AMD to launch Threadripper in August Matthew Wilson 3 days ago CPU, Featured Announcement At Computex this year, both AMD and Intel laid all of their cards out on the table with the announcements of Threadripper and Skylake-X. Last night, Intel announced that its 4 to 10 core CPUs would begin shipping from June 19th onwards, with 12 to 18 core SKUs expected to start shipping in August. So when is AMD’s Threadripper stepping into the HEDT arena to compete? Well, we hear that the launch will take place in August. From what we have heard from sources close to KitGuru, AMD should launch Threadripper around the 10th of August, after moving the date from a late July launch. This is what we have heard through industry contacts and if true, would mean we will be seeing AMD and Intel square up once again, this time in the HEDT market.   AMD’s flagship Threadripper part will feature 16 cores and 32 threads and while Intel’s Core i9-7980XE might beat it with a higher core/thread count, pricing is going to be a huge factor. Intel’s top-end Extreme Edition is going to be $1999.99 and leaving the door open for AMD to swoop in and undercut the price by quite a bit. We’ll be keeping an eye out and look forward to comparing Threadripper and Skylake-X once both hit the market. KitGuru Says: A good chunk of our readership are very much looking forward to Threadripper. I’m quite excited to see how this shakes up the HEDT market going forward, after all Ryzen has proven to be very competitive already.

Name: Subject: Message: Is Intel rattled about Windows emulation on the Snapdragon 835? Features Newsby Robert Triggs3 days ago 15 431 9 With smartphone hardware becoming increasingly powerful while simultaneously boasting power efficiency and integrated network connectivity, news from Computex 2017 that Microsoft and Qualcomm had been collaborating to enable full Win32 app support on the Snapdragon 835 seems almost overdue. With a number of big name manufacturers already queueing up to launch Snapdragon-powered systems, the laptop market could be in for a major shakeup. Intel’s response has been perhaps even more predictable, using the 40th anniversary of its x86 architecture to warn of the potential legal implications should these emulation efforts infringe on its patented instruction set. Although Intel didn’t direct its comments at any particular party, the company seems keen to stress not only the performance benefits of native x86 apps, but also the strength of its instruction set patent portfolio. Clearly, it’s a warning to some perceived threat, and that can only be Microsoft and Qualcomm. See also: Windows and Android divide grows smaller: Snapdragon 835-powered PCs incoming 2 weeks ago For a little background, the vast majority of smartphone processors, including Qualcomm’s Snapdragon range, are based on ARM’s instruction set and architecture. This differs from Intel’s x86 architecture that the company uses for its processors, and the complications begin to arise when it comes to compiling an operating system and software for a specific processor architecture. Older and even many current Windows applications are compiled solely for x86, and so simply won’t run on an ARM-based processor. The workaround is to emulate these instructions in software, thereby allowing ARM hardware to run the full suite of Windows applications. Of course, it’s up to Microsoft to do what it wants with its operating system, and supporting ARM-based hardware now seems like a core part of the company’s plan to increase the Windows 10 install base on always connected devices. However, Intel’s warning is related to the patented portions of its x86 instruction set, many of which are used to speed up execution of a wide range of software tasks, ranging from SIMD math to AES-NI encryption, MMX for audio and graphics, and various security extensions. In total, Intel holds some 1,600 patents relating to instruction set implementations. 'Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel's microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel's x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences ... However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights' - Steven Rodgers, Intel VP Whether or not Microsoft and Qualcomm can find a way around this threatening patent issue remains to be seen. From what we know about the emulation strategy so far, the core operating system is running on pure ARM code, so there are unlikely to be any issues there. Even Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps downloaded from the Windows Store will be compiled as native ARM programs. The emulation issue only rears its head when running current and older x86 applications. Based on what we’re seeing so far, Microsoft’s work is starting to look more like a compatibility layer than out an all-out emulation, with native ARM code stepping in for existing Microsoft DLLs and OS functions. Interestingly, this “emulation” is based on Microsoft’s existing Windows-on-Windows layer, which is already used on 64-bit x64 hardware, including Intel and AMD machines, to run x86 applications. For a closer look at how Microsoft’s x86/ARM emulator works, check out the video below. What’s particularly interesting about Intel’s complaint is that emulation is far from a new idea; the Snapdragon 835 example isn’t the first time this has been tried on non-Intel hardware. The FX!32 software emulator ran Win32 programs on DEC-Alpha based systems back in the 1990s, Microsoft already ships an x86 emulator as part of its Windows malware protection engine, and then there’s QEMU that runs a variety of OSs on a number of support architectures. In its blog post, Intel attempts to up the threat by citing precedent with the successful use of its SIMD patent portfolio to shut down code morphing x86 emulation from Transmeta used in its Crusoe family of microprocessors. While there’s no doubt that Intel is serious, Transmeta’s method looks quite different to Microsoft’s, especially as Windows will actually be running on native ARM code and they’re not building a processor specifically for emulation, so it’s not exactly a copy and paste example for any courts. In response, Qualcomm doesn’t appear too worried about the threat, although Microsoft is remaining quiet on the issue. 'Given our recent announcement with ASUS, HP and Lenovo, we found the blog that one of our competitors published on June 8 very interesting ... We look forward to the launch of the always connected Windows 10 PC powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform later this year.' - Qualcomm spokesperson Of course, Intel has a vested interest in shutting down any serious emulation effort as quickly as possible. The company has been a clear leader in the PC space for a number of years now, retaining between a 70 and 80 percent of the market share and squeezing its only chip rival AMD down to as low as 20 percent over the past decade. The dominant market position has left Intel with an ability to charge a premium for its processors, and the threat of a low cost alternative capable of running Windows applications would undermine the company’s profit margins and would, arguably, put competition back on track. This makes the prospect of any sort of licensing deal highly unlikely. Last year, Intel’s Client Computing Group, its largest group that includes desktop/laptop component sales, pulled in revenue worth $32.91 billion and $8 billion in Q1 2017, which almost doubles the revenue from its second place Data Center Group. Laptops and 2-in-1s with LTE connectivity might reinvigorate the market. Qualcomm's mobile platforms seem like a natural fit for this new market segment and Intel has no competing products after cancelling SoFIA. Compounding the issue is the fact that certain segments of the laptop market have shown a little more resilience to the slow decline of the PC market, with low cost, low power laptops and the Chromebook market actually showing some growth. That’s exactly the type of product that a Snapdragon processor running Windows 10 could fit into, and a market that Intel would not want to lose. In this market segment, the real danger for Intel is the connectivity options being offered by integrated SoCs like Qualcomm’s Snapdragons. Bluetooth, WiFi, and LTE support all come on the chip, offering up a cost effective solution for product developers. Intel was slow to market with its LTE modems and still doesn’t have any competing integrated SoCs for portable products after abandoning LTE-SoFIA Atom development. With 5G technologies not too far away either, enhanced connectivity in the laptop space is likely to be a big selling point going forward, and Qualcomm is well ahead of Intel in this regard. See also: Snapdragon 835 unveiled – Everything you need to know January 3, 2017 It’s not just Qualcomm that could potentially be a threat to Intel’s bottom line though. Presumably Microsoft could open up its technology to a wide range of ARM-based SoC designers, including Samsung, Nvidia, and MediaTek, amongst others. There’s also bound to be concern that Apple may move away from Intel hardware towards its own in-house, ARM-based, A series of processors for its Mac hardware, if Microsoft proves that it’s doable. Again, Apple’s Macbook sales have been more resilient than other declining PC sales, so the company is a hugely valuable customer to Intel. Apple’s in-house designs have proven powerful and profitable for its iPhone and iPad products, and it seems likely that the company wouldn’t turn down the opportunity to bring laptop chip development in-house too, if it was viable. However, there’s no sign that Apple is working on any x86 emulation software of its own just yet. ASUS, HP, and Lenovo have all been confirmed to release Snapdragon-powered PC systems running Windows 10. Wrap Up Intel’s sabre rattling is almost certainly aimed at Microsoft and Qualcomm’s collaboration, and the company rightly has some causes for concern. The prospect of low cost, well connected laptops with full Windows 10 and x86 compatibility will be tempting to a number of consumers. For Microsoft, it’s also a much needed play to halt of the march of the Chromebook, and this looks like the company’s best way into the connected market after missing out on the smartphone boom. Intel consumer grade chip revenue doubles that of its data business, and low cost ARM hardware could seriously upset Intel's largest business segment. However, we’re yet to see how well this emulation works when contending with heavier workloads, and there’s always going to be some performance trade-offs compared with running code natively. Still, Snapdragon powered products won’t be competing against top-tier laptop processors anyway, and native UWP app support might be enough for most day-to-day use cases. Qualcomm expects that we’ll see our first Snapdragon 835 powered laptops running Windows 10 before the end of the year. We can almost certainly expect a more robust and legal sounding tone from Intel once products actually hit the shelves, and perhaps even another long running expensive legal battle to look forward to.

Forums Join   The iPhone 8 Won't Support Gigabit LTE by Karl Bode Tuesday Jun 13 2017 07:40 EDT The looming iPhone 8 won't support gigabit LTE, according to a report from Bloomberg. Why? Apple refuses to use a single supplier for chips, utilizing both Qualcomm and Intel for its devices. And while Qualcomm is expected to have a gigabit-capable LTE chipset available by the iPhone 8 launch, Intel's still cooking up its own gigabit-capable chip. Until Intel catches up, Apple won't be utilizing the ultra-fast speed in its newest devices. Some news outlets went so far as to insist that this means the iPhone 8 is "outdated before it launches": quote: This is a big deal for consumers who buy the new iPhone 8 and realize it's outdated and running on slower networks than other phones that support Gigabit LTE, like the Galaxy S8. But given few will actually be able to see gigabit speeds anytime soon on their local networks, Apple isn't likely to see the lack of the chipset as a real problem for the handset. Customers who keep the device for several years expecting it to work via these faster networks may be disappointed, but given the speedy pace of personal phone upgrades these days, the entire complaint feels a bit overblown, even if it may put a slight damper on Apple's PR hype war with other handset vendors like Samsung. tags: competition · business · wireless · hardware · consumers · LTE · gigabit News Jump Canada Eyes a 5% Broadband Tax to Fund Canadian Media'Cord Nevers' Don't Want Cable TV, Even if It's a Skinny BundleNew ISP Anti-Piracy Plan Could Involve Hijacking Your BrowserTrump Brings Commissioner Rosenworcel Back to the FCCThursday Morning Links Senators Ask FCC to Prevent Rise of 'Ringless Voicemail' SpamVerizon Says It's 'Doubling Down' on Fiber.

Computing Phones Cars Gaming Science Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Mobile Intel Sued for Allegedly Defective, Exploding Phones Intel Sued for Allegedly Defective, Exploding Phones By Joel Hruska on June 13, 2017 at 8:39 am Comment Several years ago, back when Intel was still trying to break into the smartphone market, the company announced a highly unusual partnership. Because Intel couldn’t build a smartphone modem integrated on-die on its own silicon at that time, the company decided to partner with TSMC, which handled its modem manufacturing. This allowed Intel to bring an SoC to market that could compete in the budget and mainstream smartphone markets of the time with the on-chip modem that was critical to competing in that space. The chip, dubbed SoFIA, had a multi-year roadmap and Intel also inked deals with the Chinese manufacturer Rockchip to bring devices out for the mainland Chinese market as well. A slide from 2014, showing where SoFIA fit in Intel’s roadmaps at the time. A new complaint filed against Intel and emailed to ExtremeTech by smartphone and device manufacturer Qbex, a Brazilian company, alleges that defects in the SoFIA design led to a number of smartphone fires and thousands of complaints against the company. QBEX alleges that the SoFIA parts were defective from the beginning, that Intel was aware of the defects, and that the company has taken little to no action to fix the problem. SoFIA devices were mostly a play for markets outside the US, and the CPUs themselves were fairly modest, even compared with other Atom processors. Clock speeds were in the 1GHz – 1.2GHz range, with both dual-core and quad-core parts available on the market. Of the various SoFIA chips, only the Rockchip models are listed as having shipped on Intel’s Ark website: A sample of the Rockchip SKUs listed at Ark.Intel.com According to Qbex, Intel approached it about working together on a joint smartphone in January 2015. As part of that agreement, Qbex’s smartphone — which carried Intel Inside branding — would use parts built as part of the Rockchip agreement. We’ve wondered in the past about which smartphones had fielded the Rockchip design and Qbex just filled in that part of the puzzle. Qbex actually praises Intel’s collaboration and representation of the ongoing work relationship between Qbex, Intel, and the various Chinese semiconductor manufacturers that provided additional components for the device, writing “For all practical purposes, the ODMs [Original Device Manufacturers] functioned as an extension of Intel, which is exactly what Ms. Souza and other executives of Intel had represented.” Qbex sold 235,074 Intel smartphones from October 2015 to December 2016. While that’s small potatoes compared with Samsung or Apple, the company considered these sales figures to be quite good “for a once local electronics company.” Alleged defects The filing then alleges that this success was a “curse in disguise for Qbex” because “Intel’s central microprocessor and/or mobile system had a design defect that caused the devices to overheat and even explode.” Qbex claims that Intel was aware of these defects by October of 2015, before the Qbex phone had gone on sale, but did not communicate this information, despite sharing it with the ODMs that were handling actual device manufacturing. What follows reads a little like the back-and-forth between the EPA and Volkswagen, at least from Qbex’s point of view. First, Intel said that the temperature readings were a little high, but normal for the product. Then it promised a software update to bring temperatures down. All the while, complaints and returns were escalating throughout 2016 — 401 devices were returned in April, 915 in May, and 1,446 in June. Even after Intel announced it would cancel SoFIA, it apparently promised Qbex it would still release a software update to repair the handsets and bring operating temperatures down. But that didn’t happen, and customer returns skyrocketed by mid-2016. In July, Qbex received 9,090 complaints or returned devices, with 5,962 in August. Qbex claims that its own internal measurements identified a defect in the SoFIA microprocessor itself that “caused the smartphones to overheat, catch fire, and sometimes explode.” The exact nature of this flaw is not identified, but since the device was built by ODMs of Intel’s choosing and according to Intel’s specification, the problem could lie almost anywhere within the hardware. Presumably it isn’t a conventional battery problem, or the Qbex case would have stated that, specifically, but this is not certain. Qbex is accusing Intel of selling known-defective merchandise and general breach of contract. Update: We reached out to Intel regarding these allegations. A company spokesperson told ExtremeTech that: “We are reviewing the allegations in the complaint and we will investigate them thoroughly. However, we have no evidence to suggest that the overheating issues QBEX alleges were caused by our product.” Tagged In smartphones intel tablets semiconductors TSMC Medfield sofia fire Qbex ODM Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Newsletter Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

Flynn’s partner, Bijan Kian, joined the former chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency on Trump’s national security transition team after the election. For Kian, who led most of Flynn Intel Group’s research and lobbying for a Turkish businessman, the Trump transition role offered influence in the selection of intelligence agency candidates and access to internal discussions of U.S. national security policy. Flynn’s mishandling of his dealings with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller’s wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. But inquiries spawned by Flynn Intel’s Turkish work pose added legal complications for both Flynn and his associates. Federal investigators are concentrating on possible criminal violations and a House oversight committee inquiry is examining Flynn’s records to determine whether he lied to federal officials about his foreign contacts and payments. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group’s creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn’s company and records submitted to the Justice Department. And Kian’s participation in the Trump transition — following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey’s government — reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration’s vetting process. A current Trump transition official said Monday night that Kian’s records did not show his foreign work for Flynn Intel or that he planned to file with the government as an agent for his work for a foreign interest. “He did not indicate that to us in his transition documents. We would have no reason to know,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss Kian’s role during the post-election period. Both Kian and Flynn filed in March as foreign agents for the Turkish firm. Kian connected Flynn with his Turkish client, helped to negotiate their $600,000 contract and oversaw a documentary and an op-ed aimed at an opponent of Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the client and several others who requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The client, Ekim Alptekin, also confirmed to The Associated Press that Kian worked for one of his Turkish companies at the same time he was working for Flynn Intel. “Content-wise, it was Bijan handling the day-to-day details,” Alptekin told the AP during a recent interview in Washington. An Iranian-American businessman whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, Kian did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. “I’m very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing,” he said. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. Kian’s interests repeatedly intersected with Flynn’s business ventures and political activities after Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, left the government in 2014. Kian, a former director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, shared Flynn’s strong public opposition to Iran’s theocratic government and a common interest in the development of secure communications systems. Until Trump’s election, Flynn served with Kian on the board of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology firm Kian headed until April. Flynn and Kian co-authored a 2015 op-ed about ISIS militants, and attended galas put on by the Nowruz Commission, a nonprofit run by Kian and his wife promoting the Iranian Nowruz holiday. Alptekin was named a board director of that group in 2011. Soon after Flynn Intel ceased operations after Trump’s election, Flynn and Kian joined the president-elect’s transition team. Kian described his role on his LinkedIn profile as “deputy lead” assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided “policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare” candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials said Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general’s sounding board. One official said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump’s CIA director. Another official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added that Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition’s work. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel’s linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn’s firm together last summer with Alptekin’s Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the “main one” representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn “wasn’t involved at all” in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo ended up paying Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Flynn Intel disclosed its contract and other details of its Turkish work last March to the Justice Department, which regulates lobbying and other political activities for foreign interests in the U.S. Flynn and Kian were the only individuals who personally registered as foreign agents for Inovo. Kian and Alptekin had an existing business relationship when Flynn Intel began its foreign work. Alptekin confirmed Kian had been vice chairman of his Istanbul-based aviation company, EA Havacilik, since November 2011. Alptekin said he and Kian regularly strategized to build an aviation customer base. Alptekin has denied that any of Inovo’s work was done at the direction of Turkey’s government, but he is a member of a foreign trade board managed by the country’s economic ministry. Alptekin said he first met Kian during Kian’s stint on the Export-Import bank board for the Bush and Obama administrations between 2006 and 2011. Kian promoted U.S. business interests abroad for the bank, meeting officials in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations, according to State Department cables released by WikiLeaks. In his supervisory role for Flynn Intel, Kian was not always explicit about his ties to the firm, said several people who worked with him. Kian led a lobbying meeting last October with a representative of the House Homeland Security committee on behalf of GreenZone’s secure communications products. But, as the AP previously reported , the session veered into a lobbying pitch for Flynn Intel, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the meeting. Kian and others involved pressed for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen but the request went nowhere, the official said. Kian never identified who he was working for, the official said. Kian also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey’s government as America’s “strongest ally” against terrorism and pressing for Gulen’s extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. “I assumed since Bijan was the one who hired me, that he had written it,” said Cox. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn’s name. “I was only vaguely aware of General Flynn at the time but I had no idea I was working for him or his company,” Cox said. Flynn’s firm told the Justice Department that Flynn, Kian and Cox drafted the op-ed based on the firm’s research for Inovo. The firm said neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government wrote or directed the op-ed, but Flynn Intel acknowledged it shared a draft with Inovo in advance of publication. Flynn’s op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on election day, drew scrutiny from the Justice Department’s foreign agent unit. Pressure from those officials forced Flynn and Kian to file as foreign agents and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation Should Host an "Intel Architecture Day" This chipmaker should, in addition to talking about chip manufacturing tech, go over its plans to build compelling chip designs. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 13, 2017 at 7:30AM Earlier this year, chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) hosted what it called a "Technology and Manufacturing Day." At this event, the company went into quite a lot of detail about its various chip manufacturing technologies, and their applicability across the company's different business units. This was an exceptionally informative presentation, and I both applaud Intel for hosting it, and hope that the company continues to regularly update the investment community on its advances in manufacturing technology. Image source: Intel. In the spirit of this event, I think Intel should do something similar with respect to its chip designs called an "Intel Architecture Day." Tell us about your vision for the future, Intel Chip manufacturing technology is an important part of what makes Intel's products as competitive as they are in the marketplace. And, of course, Intel's robust factory network allows it to be a reliable supplier of hundreds of millions of complex chips to its customers each year. However, Intel doesn't sell chip manufacturing technology to its customers; it uses that technology to craft products that its customers (personal computer vendors, data center operators, and so on) want to buy. A typical Intel processor incorporates a host of different individual technologies, commonly referred to as "intellectual properties." Intel's seventh-generation Core processors for personal computers, for example, include the following technologies (though this list is by no means exhaustive): CPU cores Graphics, media, and display engines Image signal processors Memory controller Sensor hub Wired connectivity (wireless connectivity should be integrated in the future) I think that Intel could drum up excitement for its long-term business prospects if it gives a bold, vibrant vision for where it plans to take its current product portfolio (PC processors, Xeon processors, and so on). And, to be blunt, it wouldn't hurt for Intel to talk about why it expects to extend/maintain/attain leadership across these various technological vectors. Furthermore, as Intel seems to be investing in more specialized technologies to attack certain markets (e.g. buying Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) for autonomous driving, nabbing Altera for its FPGA technology to improve its data center and Internet of Things offerings, and scooping up Nervana to power its machine learning efforts), I think it'd be useful for Intel to go into more depth into these technologies and provide roadmaps indicating what the future for these technologies hold. In addition to talking about its vision for various technologies and market segments, Intel could also give investors a peek at its investment levels and trends in certain areas. What technology is Intel investing in? What areas is it cutting its investments back in? Where does Intel think its investment levels are currently appropriate? There's really a lot that Intel can talk about. The problem certainly wouldn't be trying to figure out how to come up with approximately three hours of material, but instead the challenge would likely be to try to pick the right subset of topics to keep the day's presentations from running too long.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Don't Worry -- Apple Inc.'s 2018 iPhone Will Feature Gigabit LTE This feature that won't come to this year's iPhone models will almost certainly come to next year's iPhones. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 13, 2017 at 7:45AM Recent news suggests that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 won't support gigabit LTE speeds, because of its desire to dual-source cellular modems from wireless giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) as well as chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). In a nutshell, Qualcomm sells modems that support gigabit LTE speeds today, while the best cellular modem Intel will offer this year, known as the XMM 7480, will support download speeds of only 450 megabits per second, a little less than half of the peak of the theoretical download speeds of Qualcomm's offerings. Image source: Apple. Although some have made this out to be a big deal, I doubt it'll have a significant impact on the sales of Apple's next-generation iPhones. But for those of you who really care about this feature, never fear -- Apple's 2018 iPhone models will almost certainly feature gigabit LTE capability. Apple gets a viable second source Apple appears to want to have two sources for its cellular modems. Multi-sourcing critical components is often prudent, especially for ultra-high-volume products such as the iPhone, but in the case of the cellular modem, Apple would be downright foolish to not dual-source, considering the rough legal battle it's fighting with Qualcomm right now. I suspect Apple wants to keep Intel in the game with respect to cellular modems, and to do that, it's buying enormous quantities of Intel modems, even if it means throttling back the iPhone models with superior Qualcomm modems for now. The good news for Apple, though, is that next year, Intel's modems should become substantially more competitive than they are today. Intel's upcoming XMM 7560 modem, the company says, achieves download speeds "exceeding 1 [gigabit per second]" and "up to 225 [megabits per second] in the uplink." Intel still isn't likely to achieve technological parity with Qualcomm's best when the XMM 7560 finally begins to ramp up, but the Intel modems should be closer, and Apple should be able to finally advertise that the iPhone can handle gigabit LTE speeds without needing to rely on a single modem supplier. Faster LTE won't drive upgrade activity Although I'm sure that Apple, the various carriers, and others will push the 2018 iPhone's gigabit LTE capabilities as some sort of game changer, I doubt that this feature will ultimately prove to be a particularly strong selling point. Smartphone customers seem to react more positively to "obvious" features, such as improvements in camera technology, display technology enhancements -- particularly if they drive compelling form-factor changes -- and better battery life. The way I think about it is something like this: I can't imagine that the typical smartphone customer is going to want to fork over hundreds of dollars for a new smartphone because it features faster LTE speeds, but I could easily imagine such a customer springing for a new phone because it has a full-face display, or because it has new camera features such as a high-quality optical zoom or dramatically enhanced low-light capabilities. That's not to say Apple shouldn't improve these less obvious features, such as Wi-Fi and cellular speeds, processor speeds, and so on. However, these are features that I think customers appreciate once they've purchased the device and have used it, rather than features that drive customers to buy the new devices in the first place.

MacBook Pro: Apple’s professional laptop gets a speedy new processor Video MacBook Pro Kaby Lake first look At a Glance 15-in 2.9GHz Core i7 MacBook Pro 512GB storage Touch Bar (mid 2017) Macworld Rating $2,799.00 View on Apple Did you hear cries of regret and maybe a few cuss words in the background during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote? If you did, it was from folks who bought a MacBook Pro in the past few weeks. You see, during WWDC, Apple revealed an upgrade to the MacBook Pro to replace the models that were released just last Fall. Now, on the surface, the new MacBook Pro looks exactly the same, but all of the changes are found under-the-hood via performance bumps. And our test results do show an expected increase in speed, but it's not enough to induce serious buyer's remorse in anyone who recently bought a MacBook Pro of the previous generation—though it may spark a bit of envy. (This review covers Apple’s top-of-the-line model, a 15-inch MacBook Pro with a 2.9GHz processor. This particular model sells for $2,799.) What’s changed The heart of the MacBook Pro is where you’ll find the major change. All MacBook Pro models now feature Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, which replace the Skylake processors found in the previous MacBook Pro. For this review, a Kaby Lake 2.9GHz quad-core Core i7 in the model I reviewed replaces a Skylake 2.7GHz quad-core Core i7. Roman Loyola Stock up on adapters: The MacBook Pro relies on Thunderbolt 3 for connectivity. The 15-inch models have four of them. Our MacBook Pro Thunderbolt 3 adapter guide will help you get the ones you need. Another major change is the graphics technology. The $2,799 model now has the Intel HD Graphics 630 instead of the Intel HD Graphics 530 as integrated graphics. The discrete high-performance graphics chip is now a 4GB Radeon Pro 560, which replaces a 4GB Radeon Pro 460. What’s the same Just about everything else about the MacBook Pro is the same as before. The aluminum unibody case design (available in Space Gray or Silver), the 15.4-inch display with a 2880-by-1800 native resolution and P3 color gamut, the Thunderbolt 3 ports (four ports on my review model), and the Force Touch trackpad are unchanged. Roman Loyola The keyboard doesn’t have enough “life” for my taste, but I love the maxi-sized Force Touch trackpad. Disappointingly, the MacBook Pro still supports a maximum of 16GB of RAM, which is what’s included in the $2,799 model. Apple uses LPDDR3 memory rated at a speed of 2133 MHz, and in order for the MacBook Pro to support 32GB of RAM, Apple would have to use memory that needs more power, thereby affecting battery life. (MacDaddy has a great article explaining the issues with 32GB of RAM on the MacBook Pro.) The $2,799 MacBook Pro comes with a 512GB solid-state drive. Apple says that the performance of the SSD is 50 percent faster than the previous SSD. The speed increase comes from improvements in the SSD’s hardware controller. Let’s touch on the Touch Bar The Touch Bar made its debut on the MacBook Pro last Fall. Since it hasn’t changed, I’m not going to dive into what it is and how it works. (If you aren’t familiar with the Touch Bar, I encourage you to read our review of the 2016 MacBook Pro, specifically, the “Meet the Touch Bar” and “Using the Touch Bar in apps” sections.) Roman Loyola Introduced last year, the Touch Bar is here to stay. My personal experience with the Touch Bar? I don’t use it that much. I like using Touch ID to unlock the laptop, but I’ve gone through work sessions where Touch ID is the only time I use the Touch Bar. When I use a Mac, my focus is on the screen, and I just haven’t gotten used to looking down at the keyboard to use the Touch Bar controls. But I do know people who love the Touch Bar. I hesitate to say that the Touch Bar is wasted on me; if I forced myself to look at it, I’m sure I’d find it more useful. When it comes to the Touch Bar, as the saying goes, your mileage may vary. Speed improvements To gauge the speed of the new 2.9GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro, we ran a set of benchmarks tests. Our result show a significant boost over its predecessor. The 2.9GHz MacBook Pro we tested had a stock configuration: 16GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory, a 512GB SSD, integrated Intel HD Graphics 630, and discrete Radeon Pro 560 with 4GB of GDDR5 memory. Geekbench 64-bit Single-Core and Multi-Core CPU Test IDG Longer bars are better. Click to enlarge. In Geekbench 4.1, the 2.9GHz MacBook Pro posted a score of 4739 in the single-core 64-bit CPU test, which is 16 percent faster than the 4101 score by the 2016 2.7GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro, the model that the new MacBook Pro replaces. In Geekbench’s multi-core 64-bit CPU test, the 2.9GHz MacBook Pro also saw a speed gain. Its score of 15731 is 19 percent faster than the 13193 score by its predecessor. Geekbench 4.1 OpenCL Test IDG Longer bars are better. Click to enlarge. We also ran a pair of graphics benchmarks to test the speed of the discrete graphics card. In the Geekbench 4 OpenCL test, the 4GB Radeon Pro 560 in the new 2.9GHz MacBook Pro posted a score similar to the 2GB Radeon Pro 450 in the 2016 2.6GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro. Cinebench OpenGL Test IDG Scores are frames per second. Longer bars are better. Click to enlarge. The graphics performance difference is more apparent in the Cinebench OpenGL test. The 2.9GHz MacBook Pro scored 87.1 frames per second, a 14 percent boost over the 2.6GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro from last year. In our review of the MacBook Pro last year, we said that the MacBook Pro, even with 16GB of memory, is probably fast enough for most video editors. But even if you’re still not convinced, there’s another factor you should consider: macOS High Sierra. Kaby Lake and macOS High Sierra Kaby Lake features technology that can enhance video performance—specifically, 4K video. Intel integrated into the processor support for encoding and decoding 10-bit 4K HEVC and 4K VP9 video. Not only will this help performance for 4K video, it can help save on battery life. (For more information on this, I highly recommend reading, “10 key things to know about Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs” and “Intel Kaby Lake Review” from our sister publication, PCWorld.) Apple During the WWDC 2017 keynote, Apple announced that macOS High Sierra and its suite of Pro Tools apps will have HEVC support. The proper software drivers are required to take advantage of this technology, and it looks like they will be in the next version of the Mac operating system, macOS High Sierra. One of the key features in High Sierra that is being touted by Apple is support for the 4K HEVC codec. During the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference keynote, Apple said that hardware acceleration for HEVC video will be available in “the newest Macs.” This is definitely something to keep an eye on. We’ll be following the development of macOS High Sierra closely, and we’ll be ready with the video benchmarks once the HEVC support is ready to be put to the test. Bottom line So, you’re in the market for a top-of-the-line laptop. Should you buy the $2,799, 2.9GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro? If you’re a general user who uses the internet constantly, uses Apple apps like Photos, iMovie, iTunes, Pages, and the like, you’ll find that the 2.9GHz MacBook Pro is certainly a luxurious laptop to have. You can probably save a few dollars and get the other 15-inch MacBook Pro configuration for $2,399. But if you insist on the best, you’ll be very happy. If you’re a pro user, you can’t be blamed for being disappointed in the 16GB memory limitation. But the impeding 10-bit 4K HVEC support in macOS High Sierra and the potential for hardware acceleration using Kaby Lake’s built-in HVEC support makes for a very enticing combination. The 2.9GHz 15-inch MacBook Pro becomes a very attractive investment, even if you recently bought a previous-generation MacBook Pro.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 13 June 2017 | MYT 5:48 PM Google execs hunker down for fight with EU as fines loom A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. — TAN KIT HOONG/The Star As European Union officials count the days before their annual vacation, Google’s lawyers and lobbyists are hunkering down in Brussels, preparing for what may be a record EU antitrust fine.  A penalty in the shopping-search probe could come within weeks and many expect it to exceed a US$1.2bil (RM5.11bil) fine on Intel Corp in 2009.  That would be another show of strength by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who slapped Apple Inc with a €13bil (RM62.07bil) tax bill in August. Google is a top priority case for her as European politicians and publishers push for action against the Mountain View, California-based company that’s come to dominate online advertising.  “If there’s going to be a fine, it has to be the biggest ever,” said Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represents companies that have complained to the EU about Google. “The European Commission has strongly signalled that if there is going to be a fine it would need to be at a level that would have deterrent effect.”  Timing on a decision could slip and Google representatives and the commission both remain tight-lipped, declining to talk about it. The company hasn’t yet met with regulators to discuss a potential EU order or how it might implement any changes, according to a person familiar with the probe, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Major rulings  But the EU has a long tradition of issuing major rulings just before officials quit Brussels for their summer break. Last July saw more than US$3bil (RM12.78bil) in fines for truck makers including Daimler AG and Volvo AB. With one eye on the impending decision, some Google officials have been getting ready, moving vacation dates or making sure they are close to the action, other people familiar with the probe said.  Vestager “has a keen eye to maximising the impact of any announcement on a case and July sees a slowdown in the news cycle,” said Christopher Bright, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels, who’s not involved in the Google probe. “Together with the advanced state of preparation of the case, this points to a July announcement for Google.”  Vestager isn’t afraid of big numbers, setting records with the tax bill for Apple – which it’s appealing – and the cartel fine for truck companies. Facebook Inc may have got off lightly with a mere €110mil (RM525.49mil) penalty for not providing correct information in the WhatsApp merger probe.  Top spot  Intel holds the top spot for a monopoly abuse with a fine of €1.06bil (RM5.06bil). That represented more than 3% of Intel’s US$37.6bil (RM160.19bil) in sales in 2008, below the maximum penalty of 10% of yearly sales regulators can impose.  As Alphabet Inc pulled in US$90bil (RM383.44bil) in revenue last year, any fine would be capped at US$9bil (RM38.34bil). But within that limit, the actual size of the fine would be calculated from sales in the market under investigation. Alphabet’s Google division generated US$79bil (RM336.57bil) in ad revenue in 2016. While it doesn’t break out sales for shopping search advertising, ads from search provide most of its revenue.  The EU also factors in how many years the illegal conduct lasted. Regulators say the systematic promotion of Google’s own shopping search started in 2008, allowing Google Product Search and Google Shopping grow more quickly than rival comparison-shopping services.  A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. The Android investigation goes to the heart of what Google does in the mobile-phone space, questioning the strict terms Google places on phone makers and app developers to use the software it provides for free.  Cash pile  While money matters, Alphabet has a cash pile of more than US$92bil (RM391.96bil) as of March 31 and any changes to its business model ordered by the EU may “probably be of more significance,” said Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at Loyola University in Chicago.  ”I doubt this is going to hamstring the company but the commission is going to order what it thinks is necessary to give competition a chance,” he said.  EU’s claims that Google Shopping results harm competition “are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,” general counsel Kent Walker wrote in a blog post last year. The EU’s case “rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online” because price comparison sites aren’t the only way to shop around.  Google can appeal, which could take years. Microsoft only won a 4% cut to its fine. Intel has been waiting eight years for a final ruling.  Vestager’s move against Google is sure to attract further criticism that she’s unfairly singled out US companies. Transatlantic tensions are already on the rise after President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, adding to concerns over global trade.  ”We’re entering a period in the States where foreign competition enforcement against US-based companies is going to be a matter of more public comment and criticism,” said Waller. “I think you’ll hear similar things” to the outcry over the Apple tax bill when the Google probe wraps up, he said.  The US Chamber of Commerce in March called on Trump to “address the misuse of competition law by other nations that impede international trade and competition and harm US companies.”  On the other hand, Vestager is under pressure in Europe from companies and politicians eager to see her punish Google.  Complaints about Google continue to pour in to the EU, most recently from publishers about Android software. And new fronts could open; Vestager tweeted recently that she’d be playing close attention to Google’s new ad-blocking feature.  For Google, there could be more summers like this. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Mattel plays with digital toys to triple China business Instagram introduces archive feature to allow users to hide photos Not yet Amazon Prime time: Australia retail sell-off overblown?

Kian and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn talk during the Fifth Annual Nowruz Commission Gala at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington. by STEPHEN BRAUN & CHAD DAY, The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - A business partner of former national security adviser Michael Flynn took part in sensitive hiring and policy discussions involving U.S. intelligence as a member of President Donald Trump's transition team, but failed to inform Trump's team that he had conducted political work on behalf of a foreign client of Flynn and might have to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Related Coverage Dennis Rodman just gave Kim Jong Un 'The Art of the Deal.' And it may be a genius move Christopher Ruddy, the Trump whisperer: 'I'm honest with him' Special counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice Internal records for Flynn's partner, Bijan Kian, indicate he had not disclosed his work on behalf of a Turkish businessman last year with the Flynn Intel Group or provided any warning that he planned to file as a foreign agent, a current Trump transition official told The Associated Press. Kian, a little-known figure active on the presidential transition team, is emerging as a key player in the political controversy involving Flynn, Trump's fired national security adviser. "He did not indicate that to us in his transition documents. We would have no reason to know," said the transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Kian's role during the post-election period. Almost two months after the transition period, both Kian and Flynn filed in March as foreign agents with the Justice Department, acknowledging their political work for Turkish-run Inovo BV could have principally benefited the government of Turkey. For Kian, who led most of Flynn Intel Group's research and lobbying for a Turkish businessman, the Trump transition role offered influence in the selection of intelligence agency candidates and access to internal discussions of U.S. national security policy. But Kian's participation in the transition - following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey's government - reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration's vetting process. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is co-sponsoring a bill to toughen regulation of Americans performing political work for foreign interests, said Tuesday it was "very troubling that an unregistered foreign agent was playing a key role in the Trump administration's transition." She added that "similar to General Flynn, someone working on behalf of foreign governments should never be put in a position where they're making important decisions within our government." An Iranian-American businessman whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, Kian did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Kian described his transition role on his LinkedIn profile as "deputy lead" assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided "policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare" candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials who met with Kian during that period said that Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general's sounding board. One of the officials said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump's CIA director. The second official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added that Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition's work. Like Kian, Flynn also worked on the transition while he was under Justice Department scrutiny for the Turkish work. But, as the AP previously reported, Flynn did inform the Trump transition about his Turkish work through his attorneys, who notified the transition he might have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn joined the administration, his attorneys followed up with the White House counsel's office, disclosing that Flynn would indeed be registering with the government as a foreign agent. As Flynn's little-known business partner, Kian played a key role last year in supervising much of Flynn Intel Group's foreign work while the former U.S. lieutenant general campaigned for Trump. The research and lobbying they conducted for the Turkish firm has boomeranged on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Flynn's mishandling of his dealings with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing in February by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. But the inquiries spawned by Flynn Intel's Turkish work pose added legal complications for both Flynn and his associates. Federal investigators are concentrating on possible criminal violations and a House oversight committee inquiry is examining Flynn's records to determine whether he lied to federal officials about his foreign contacts and payments. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group's creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn's company and records submitted to the Justice Department. Kian connected Flynn with his Turkish client, helped to negotiate their $600,000 contract and oversaw a documentary and an op-ed aimed at an opponent of Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the client and several others who requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The client, Ekim Alptekin, also confirmed to the AP that Kian worked for one of his Turkish companies at the same time he was working for Flynn Intel. "Content-wise, it was Bijan handling the day-to-day details," Alptekin said during a recent interview in Washington. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. "I'm very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing," he said. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. Kian's interests repeatedly intersected with Flynn's business ventures and political activities after Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, left the government in 2014. Kian, a former director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, shared Flynn's strong public opposition to Iran's theocratic government and a common interest in the development of secure communications systems. Until Trump's election, Flynn served with Kian on the board of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology firm Kian headed until April. Flynn and Kian co-authored a 2015 op-ed about ISIS militants, and attended galas put on by the Nowruz Commission, a nonprofit run by Kian and his wife promoting the Iranian Nowruz holiday. Alptekin was named a board director of that group in 2011. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel's linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn's firm together last summer with Alptekin's Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the "main one" representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn "wasn't involved at all" in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo ended up paying Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Flynn Intel disclosed its contract and other details of its Turkish work last March to the Justice Department, which regulates lobbying and other political activities for foreign interests in the U.S. Flynn and Kian were the only individuals who personally registered as foreign agents for Inovo. Kian and Alptekin had an existing business relationship when Flynn Intel began its foreign work. Alptekin confirmed Kian had been vice chairman of his Istanbul-based aviation company, EA Havacilik, since November 2011. Alptekin said he and Kian regularly strategized to build an aviation customer base. Alptekin has denied that any of Inovo's work was done at the direction of Turkey's government, but he is a member of a foreign trade board managed by the country's economic ministry. Alptekin said he first met Kian during Kian's stint on the Export-Import bank board for the Bush and Obama administrations between 2006 and 2011. Kian promoted U.S. business interests abroad for the bank, meeting officials in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations, according to State Department cables released by WikiLeaks. In his supervisory role for Flynn Intel, Kian was not always explicit about his ties to the firm, said several people who worked with him. Kian led a lobbying meeting last October with a representative of the House Homeland Security committee on behalf of GreenZone's secure communications products. But, as the AP previously reported, the session veered into a lobbying pitch for Flynn Intel, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the meeting. Kian and others involved pressed for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen but the request went nowhere, the official said. Kian never identified who he was working for, the official said. Kian also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey's government as America's "strongest ally" against terrorism and pressing for Gulen's extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. "I assumed since Bijan was the one who hired me, that he had written it," said Cox. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn's name. "I was only vaguely aware of General Flynn at the time but I had no idea I was working for him or his company," Cox said. Flynn's firm told the Justice Department that Flynn, Kian and Cox drafted the op-ed based on the firm's research for Inovo. The firm said neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government wrote or directed the op-ed, but Flynn Intel acknowledged it shared a draft with Inovo in advance of publication. Flynn's op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on Election Day, drew scrutiny from the Justice Department's foreign agent unit. Pressure from those officials forced Flynn and Kian to file as foreign agents and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Pace contributed to this report. ___ Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips Published: June 13, 2017 — 3:01 AM EDT | Updated: June 13, 2017 — 4:00 PM EDT Thanks for your continued support...

For the most part, we had assumed that the news was just that, and following traditional Intel strategy they would not officially give a launch date until the reviews go live sometime later. So imagine our surprise when Intel starts announcing dates at the E3 show this week. As part of Intel’s E3 press release, as well as their presentations at the show, the new Core i9 processors were discussed, along with Intel’s continued commitment towards eSports. Intel gave the dates for the new platform as the following: 4, 6, 8 and 10-core parts available for pre-order from June 19th 4, 6, 8 and 10-core parts shipping to consumers from June 26th 12-core parts expected to ship in August 14, 16 and 18 core parts expected to ship in October This means that the following five processors will be available from June 26th: Intel Basin Falls X299 Processors, June 26th   i5-7640X i7-7740X i7-7800X i7-7820X i9-7900X Cores 4C/4T 4C/8T 6C/12T 8C/16T 10C/20T Base Clock 4.0 GHz 4.3 GHz 3.5 GHz 3.6 GHz 3.3 GHz Turbo Clock 4.2 GHz 4.5 GHz 4.0 GHz 4.3 GHz 4.3 GHz TurboMax Clock N/A N/A N/A 4.5 GHz 4.5 GHz L2 Cache 256 KB per core 1 MB per core L3 Cache 6 MB 8 MB 8.25 MB 11 MB 13.75 MB PCIe Lanes 16 28 44 Memory Channels 2 4 Memory Freq DDR4-2666 DDR4-2400 DDR4-2666 TDP 112 W 140 W Price (1k tray) $242 $339 $389 $599 $999 The two quad-core parts are part of the Kaby Lake-X family, essentially using the mainstream Kaby Lake-S silicon but disabling the integrated graphics and expanding the voltage/frequency window and TDP limit to give extra frequency. As already demonstrated, extreme overclockers have hit over 7.5 GHz on these chips at a special Computex Intel event using Liquid Helium, with positive words coming out about 24/7 overclocking capabilities on air and water. The other three parts are the Skylake-X family, with the 6, 8 and 10-core variants all coming from the same harvested low-core-count die. The big upswing for these processors is the rearranged cache arrangement, with Intel moving from 256KB of L2 cache on the previous generation to 1MB of L2 cache on Skylake-X (and changing the L3 cache from being a fully inclusive cache to being a non-inclusive cache). This significantly enhances software which is L2 cache size sensitive, although it remains to be seen how much of an effect it will have for consumers. For the other parts, 12 core and up, Intel is staggering their launch to the extent that we do not even know many of the details. Intel's own documents list them all as TBD for frequency, power and DRAM support – the only certainties are core counts, pricing, and the fact that they will use the same socket as the above five processors. The August shipping date for the 12-core will be interesting, given that Dell has announced that pre-orders for its ThreadRipper Alienware desktops start on July 27th. The same announcement from Dell states 'and the Area 51 featuring Intel Core X-Series will arrive on August 22nd, and the product page states that this includes the 12-core option, as well as 6-10 cores. Whether the wording 'arrive' means pre-order or release we do not know, although the TR version explicitly states 'pre-order'. Ryan points out that this could just mean the 6-10 core options, as it doesn't explicitly state the 12 core and Intel hasn't made a firm date themselves yet.

Intel recently stated very late 4th quarter earliest and 1H 2018 as the most probable release time frame. Bottom line, they lied just to try and rain on AMD's Threadripper party. It didn't work and consumers know it. Reply Cygni - Tuesday, June 13, 2017 - link Youve posted like 10+ comments breathlessly defending a publicly traded company on this comment section. We get it, you think AMD is extra best special and Intel is evil terrible overpriced. Nobody cares. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, June 13, 2017 - link You obviously care. Also, he completely is right. Intel did invent non-existent products out of thin air and announced stuff it doesn't even have in the works just to avoid looking as a second-class chipmaker. His comment doesn't smell of fanboyism unlike your devoted response in Intel's defense. Reply ddriver - Tuesday, June 13, 2017 - link I got to give it to Intel nonetheless, I mean even if they manage to get out something faster than Threadripper in the HEDT market, it will be so expensive that its actual consumer value will plummet. It looks like the top TR chip will cost about as much as Intel's 10 core, and for the amount of money they are gonna ask for the 18 core model you may as well go EPYC and still get better value AND performance. Have Intel forgotten that competition is not only about performance, but price as well? They'd have to slash a good 1/3 of the price right away before those products are even worth the purchase consideration. Reply Hurr Durr - Wednesday, June 14, 2017 - link Talk about kneejerk. Reply Cygni - Wednesday, June 14, 2017 - link I really don't give a shit about either company, they are companies not people. They would kill us both in our sleep for a .0001% share price rise and never forget that. For a lot of years, AT comments was at least semi-free of this stupid brand loyalty white knight horseshit, but it has gotten as bad as everywhere else lately. Your awful awful posting everywhere certainly hasn't helped. Reply ddriver - Wednesday, June 14, 2017 - link That's all fine and dandy but it doesn't change the fact that you had a rather negative reaction to what is essentially true. When it comes to companies or for that matter - governments too, they are always evil, but always only as evil as they can afford to be. While it is unarguably true that AMD shows a lot more love to consumers, that's only because they need to and cannot afford not to. While Intel - they did great even when their chips were garbage compare to Athlons - I doubt they will have any change in their ways until something rather drastic, like say losing a third of their market.

Yes, that means we will shortly be seeing Area-51 desktops equipped with the AMD Threadripper or Intel Core-X series processors, as well as other potent components for 4K / VR gaming at its best. Whichever model of new Area-51 you choose, the system will be cooled via Alienware's own designed CPU liquid cooling system. From the description it sounds like a typical closed loop PCU cooler with a cold plate on the CPU and radiator on one of the chassis extremities. The cooling system has a life expectancy of 50,000 hours (5.7 years). Pricing has yet to be announced for either system. Alienware Area-51 with AMD Threadripper Edition The system is of course based around an AMD X399 chipset motherboard with unlocked BIOS. Buyers can configure this system with either a 12-core/24-thread or 16-core/32-thread AMD Ryzen Threadripper processor. Graphics options start with a choice between an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 570, and scale up to options including either dual GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, or triple Radeon RX 580 cards. Quad channel memory is fitted as standard, up to 2,933MHz 64GB. For storage you can specify up to a 1TB M.2 PCIe SSD and 2TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s HDD. Networking is handled by dual Killer E2500 Gigabit NICs and a choice of either Dell 1820 802.11ac 2x2 or Killer 1535 802.11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi. Dell will have AMD Threadripper exclusivity among the big OEMs, at least for this introductory period. You can buy this pre-made factory overclocked AMD Threadripper system in the UK from early September onwards. Alienware Area-51 with Intel Core X-Series CPUs Explaining the appeal of its Core-X pre-built gaming systems, Alienware says "Intel Core i9 processors are for gamers running applications that prioritize clock speeds that run at boost speeds up to 4.5GHz." Extra performance can be achieved thanks to Intel Turbo Boost Max 3.0 technology which identifies the fastest two cores in the CPU for the best dual-core speeds. These systems use motherboards based upon the Intel X299 chipset. Systems can be configured with a 6, 8, 10, or 12-core CPU option. Graphics card, memory and storage options are similar to in the AMD system above but of course Intel's system also supports Intel Optane memory. Dell will release the first Alienware Area-51 systems with Intel's Core-X CPUs on 22nd August, in the UK. In other Alienware PC system news Dell has revealed that its Max-Q technology Alienware 15 gaming laptop will be released on 27th June. This 99WHr system will have its price revealed shortly.

Posted by kompukare - Tue 13 Jun 2017 14:04 CAT-THE-FIFTH So the the 18 core SKL is not available then?? Well CB says that the 14, 16, and 18 core variants aren't out until October: https://www.computerbase.de/2017-06/core-i9-7980xe-release-date/ Whereas the 12-core comes in August. Despite what the Intel fanclub on other forums seem to say, it does sound like the 14+ are rushed because of Threadripper. Now, Threadripper announcement until October is too little time for Intel to rush such a product, but it is possible and likely that some product manager at Intel had planned (for example) the 14-core variant as a backup strategy just in case and that was subsequently rushed. Posted by excalibur1814 - Tue 13 Jun 2017 15:35 “Kind of ironic when Dell were one of the main culprits for taking kickbacks from Intel and not selling AMD chips back in the Pentium 4 era…” Things have changed since 17 years previously.

MSI MSI is launching a new gaming desktop soon. The Infinite A is the first model in the company’s all-new Infinite series roster. It comes with Military Class 5 components and PCIe Steel Armour for added durability. MSI unveiled its latest gaming PC at Computex 2017 in Taipei. Those who went to the event should remember its distinctive look. The desktop’s front side sports a circuit board-like panel that lights up customised RGB colours thanks to the Taiwanese tech titan’s Mystic Light software. The machine also has a see-through tempered glass for a side pane, which means that all of its insides are free for all to see. And speaking of the Infinite A’s hardware, the desktop boasts of its maker’s revered gaming graphics card. MSI also set it up vertically to boost cooling efficacy and transport support. Joining MSI’s graphics card inside the first Infinite series PC is the latest Intel Core i7 or i5 chip, depending on the region. Helping keep things thermally under control is MSI’s own Silent Storm Cooling 3 system, which provides quiet and efficient gaming by freshening the most vital heat-producing components via separated chambers. What’s more, the video card is backed by a Twin Frozr VI cooler to further enhance gameplay. “Loaded with an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor combined with a GeForce GTX graphics card, Infinite A is ready to provide a smooth display of VR content on your VR headset, such as the HTC Vive,” according to the Taiwan-based company. “MSI made it super easy to connect a VR headset by implementing VR Link, an HDMI-port on the front side of the system, supported by MSI’s One-click to VR software that automatically optimizes both system performance and prevents any software from impacting the VR experience.” The MSI Infinite A gaming desktop PC is launching soon. Its maker has yet to reveal pricing details, although a number of configurations and variants are expected when it launches. The machine is optimised for easy upgrading and it likewise comes with a built-in carry handle.

You can watch tournaments in VR, but competing in VR? Almost unheard of. Intel wants to change that -- it's teaming up with Oculus and long-time partner ESL to kick off the VR Challenger League, Engadget said. The competitive gaming series will have players donning headsets to take each other on through Insomniac's The Unspoken and Ready at Dawn's Echo Arena. The league will start with online-only competition in July, but the finalists will square off in person at the Intel Extreme Masters World Championship in 2018. Intel and ESL have an additional deal that will see Intel's processors power both tournament PCs and behind-the-scenes systems. It's an important move, VR should not be expected to match the popularity of conventional eSports in the near future. Multiplayer VR games are quite rare as it is, let alone titles that lend themselves to competitive play. And there's also the higher barrier to entry: you need both a VR headset and a computer fast enough to handle it. It'll be a while before the audience is large enough, and the costs low enough, that VR tourneys will really take off. Intel and partners just know that they have to start somewhere, Engadget said.

Die Prozessoren mit bis zu zehn Kernen können ab dem 19. Juni vorbestellt werden, die Auslieferung beginnt eine Woche später. 12 bis 18 Kerne gehen im August beziehungsweise Oktober an den Start. Als Intel Ende Mai seine Prozessoren mit den Codenamen Kaby Lake-X und Skylake-X auf der neuen Sockel-2066-Plattform angekündigt hat, nannte der Chiphersteller noch keine Release-Termine. Das holte Intel gestern auf seiner E3-Pressekonferenz nach, zu der parallel eine Pressemitteilung verschickt wurde. Die Veröffentlichung der neun CPUs wird in drei Teile gestaffelt, wobei es mit den Modellen mit bis zu zehn Rechenkernen (Core i5-7640X bis Core i9-7900X) losgeht. Ab dem kommenden Montag, den 19. Juni, möchte Intel Vorbestellungen entgegennehmen - wie das in Deutschland ablaufen wird, ist nicht bekannt. Die Auslieferung soll in der darauffolgenden Woche, also ab dem 26. Juni, beginnen. Der 12-Kerner Core i9-7920X wird im August folgen. Ein denkbarer Termin wäre die Gamescom, die ihre Pforten vom 22. bis 26. August öffnet. Dazu passend möchte Dell sein Area-51-Komplettsystem mit Skylake-X ab dem 22. August ausliefern. Das ist abermals ein Hinweis darauf, dass die Sockel-2066-Plattform mit Skylake-X ursprünglich nur maximal zehn Kerne erhalten sollte. Alle Skylake-X-CPUs bis zum Core i9-7920X sollen den gleichen 12-Kern-Die nutzen, die Spezifikationen des 12-Kerners stehen aber immer noch nicht fest. Die drei Topmodelle Core i9-7940X, i9-7960X und i9-7980XE nutzen den mittleren Skylake-EP-Die mit bis zu 18 Kernen. Deren Veröffentlichung zögert sich weiter bis zum Oktober hinaus. Auch hier nennt Intel noch keinen genaueren Termin. Vorher sollen noch AMDs Ryzen-Threadripper-CPUs mit bis 16 Kernen auf der SP3r2-Plattform erscheinen, deren Release AMD auf den Sommer 2017 datiert - der kalendarische Herbstanfang ist am 22. September. zur Startseite Modell Codename Kerne/Threads Takt (GHz) L3-Cache (MiB) Preis (USD) Termin Core i9-7980XE Skylake-X 18/36 ? 24,75 1.999 Oktober Core i9-7960X Skylake-X 16/32 ? 22,0 1.699 Oktober Core i9-7940X Skylake-X 14/28 ? 19,25 1.399 Oktober Core i9-7920X Skylake-X 12/24 ? 16,5 1.199 August Core i9-7900X Skylake-X 10/20 3,3-4,5 13,75 999 26.

The CPU manufacturer has made it clear that it intends to take legal action to stop unauthorized emulation practices. Last week, Intel published a blog post detailing the 39th anniversary of the x86 microarchitecture’s launch and the various ways the microarchitecture has evolved over the decades, from the advent of various SIMD (single instruction multiple data) capabilities to advanced encryption and security enhancements. For the most part, it was an unremarkable story for the not-quite-40th-anniversary of what remains one of the most important ISAs on the market today. It wasn’t until near the end of the post that things turned ugly. In the editorial, Intel Fellow Richard A. Uhlig and Intel general counsel Steven Rodgers write: "Intel carefully protects its x86 innovations, and we do not widely license others to use them… In the early days of our microprocessor business, Intel needed to enforce its patent rights against various companies including United Microelectronics Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, Cyrix Corporation, Chips and Technologies, Via Technologies, and, most recently, Transmeta Corporation. Enforcement actions have been unnecessary in recent years because other companies have respected Intel’s intellectual property rights. However, there have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel’s proprietary x86 ISA without Intel’s authorization. Emulation is not a new technology, and Transmeta was notably the last company to claim to have produced a compatible x86 processor using emulation (“code morphing”) techniques. Intel enforced patents relating to SIMD instruction set enhancements against Transmeta’s x86 implementation even though it used emulation… Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel’s x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel’s microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel’s x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences, consistency across applications, and a full breadth of consumer offerings, full manageability and IT integration for the enterprise. However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel’s intellectual property rights." This is clearly a shot across the bow of Qualcomm and Microsoft’s plans to introduce Snapdragon 835 hardware in mainstream mobile markets. Historically, Intel has good reason to feel confident about its chest-thumping. On the one hand, it’s hilarious to see the company talking up its legal actions against AMD. Intel has generally come out the loser in multiple countries and in the United States when it attempted to argue AMD had no right to build its own microprocessors based on the x86 architecture. But look at things from Intel’s perspective: Its tactics in the early 1990s and mid-2000s substantially limited AMD’s addressable market share. It may have paid a whopping $1.4 billion fine to the EU to settle antitrust claims, but that’s peanuts compared with the threat Athlon 64 might have represented to Prescott and Smithfield. And Intel isn’t wrong when it talks about the myriad other companies that used to hold x86 licenses (or tried to emulate the ISA), but withered on the vine after their attempts to compete with Santa Clara failed. The problem is this: System OEMs like Dell, HP, and Asus aren’t in the business of taking chances. When your net margin on hardware is in the 2-4 percent range, you can’t afford bravery. Imagine a hypothetical future in which HP shipped a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 that could run x86 code via emulation, only to be named as a party to a hypothetical lawsuit in which Intel sues Qualcomm and Microsoft for their emulation system. Unless one of its two partners agrees to indemnify it, there’s no way HP would risk a serious lawsuit over the topic. Asus, Dell, Acer — all of these companies are likely to see the situation similarly. The specter of these kinds of lawsuits has always loomed large over the computer industry. I wouldn’t blame them for Transmeta’s problems; Transmeta’s code-morphing approach and Efficeon architecture were initially innovative, but performance wasn’t strong and Intel quickly moved to address its own power weaknesses through the Pentium M and the development of technologies like SpeedStep. On the other hand, Intel’s threats of lawsuits over VIA Technologies’ lack of a P4 bus license were the direct cause of the collapse of VIA’s P4 motherboard market share. VIA’s DDR P4 chipset was a fast and affordable option when the P4 was stuck between either SDR RAM (which badly crippled the CPU) and extremely expensive RDRAM. Intel wouldn’t launch its own DDR chipset for the P4 for more than a year after VIA launched its own. But lawsuit threats and licensing disagreements ensured VIA’s addressable market was minimal. Does Intel have a case? The short answer is, we don’t know. The long answer is, it’ll depend on exactly what kind of patents Intel has on its own SIMD extensions. If it holds patents that specifies how to emulate SSE/SSE2, rather than just the instruction sets themselves, Microsoft and Qualcomm could well be found to violate them. Then again, this also wouldn’t be the first time Intel slammed down its foot in a tough-talk display that ultimately came to naught. When AMD announced it would spin off GlobalFoundries, Intel initially argued that the deal might run afoul of its own agreements with AMD regarding the use of that company’s x86 license. In the end, nothing came of those claims, and GF was spun off while continuing to manufacture x86 chips for AMD. Much of this will turn on what kind of x86 emulation the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 actually performs and how it performs it. Until we know more, we can’t speculate. But Intel has every reason to fight this move. Back when it looked as if ARM and x86 might slug it out head-to-head across the entire market, Intel planned to “win” the fight on performance and efficiency. But with Intel having withdrawn from the smartphone and tablet space, it’s now in the unhappy position of fighting a rearguard action to protect its consumer notebooks and desktops from an encroaching ARM. There have been cracks in the WinTel alliance since smartphones and tablets began gobbling up market share from the PC industry in 2011, but this kind of court case could escalate the feud between Microsoft and Intel.         LATEST STORIES (8) ISIL’s Days in Iraq's Mosul Numbered Syrian Army Expanding Buffer Zone against ISIL's Threats around Palmyra Philippines Army Trying to Save Civilians Trapped by ISIL-Linked Militants in Marawi US' War Crime in Syria: Civilians Killed, Displaced as US-Led Coalition Provides Air Support for Kurds in Raqqa Syrian Army Troops Continue to Push ISIL back from Western Raqqa Naval Forces Hit Saudi-Led Warship off Southwestern Yemen Volunteer Forces Preparing for Anti-ISIL Operations at Syria-Iraq Border Yemen Cholera Epidemic: Death Toll Nears 1,000 Grenfell Tower: Death Toll Rises to 17 as Hope of Finding Survivors Wanes Mourning Event for Imam Ali (AS) Held in Supreme Leader's Presence Over 130 Gunmen Receive Gov't Amnesty, Reconciliation Plan Ends in Homs City France Condemns New Housing Units in Israeli Settlements Syrian Army Deploys near Regions under Control of Kurdish-Led Forces in Raqqa Province Saudi Forces Intensify Attacks on Shia Town Senior MP: US Helicopters Transfer Tens of ISIL Terrorists to Afghanistan ISIL’s Days in Iraq's Mosul Numbered TEHRAN (FNA)- The military operation by Iraqi Army troops to liberate the Northern city of Mosul from ISIL militants continued in the Holy month of Ramadan as Baghdad forces have laid full siege on the terrorists.

Posted by Ozaron - Tue 13 Jun 2017 10:02 I was convinced that these new CPUs would be expensive, featureless and disappointing. But a 6c/12t chip with quad channel memory and 28 lanes for $390? I mean, it's the *only* one that catches my eye but that's fairly decent! Someone could make a case for the 8 core too I suppose, though it's still way above R7 1700(x) in price. Still sort of expect all of these to run hot and use a lot of power. Posted by scaryjim - Tue 13 Jun 2017 10:02 $600 for 8C/16T? Seems extravagant when you can get the same C/T from AMD at just over half the price. The higher clock speeds are going to make up a lot of the thread count and efficiency difference, but I know where my money would be going… Anyway, AMD have their Threadripper pricing targets now. Rumours were for AMD's cheapest 16C/32T chip to be priced at $849. If that's true, Intel's pricing is going to look kind of silly again. Posted by Iota - Tue 13 Jun 2017 10:31 scaryjim The higher clock speeds are going to make up a lot of the thread count and efficiency difference Well you say that, but then take the power into account on the Intel i7-7800X 6/12 140W compared to the R7 1700X 8/16 using 95W or the R7 1700 8/16 using 65W and I'm not sure the efficiency is anywhere close to where it needs to be. Anyway, at those price points from Intel I'm definitely far more inclined to build an AMD system when I upgrade. The difference in price for what you're getting simply isn't justifiable from where I'm looking at it. Posted by Dashers - Tue 13 Jun 2017 14:44 Currently I'm more interested in PCIe lanes. Got a 5930K at the moment so won't be changing any time soon. A 2014 rig won't be due an upgrade until 2019-2020. If I was buying for myself now, it'd be a threadripper.

Internal records for Flynn's partner, Bijan Kian, indicate he had not disclosed his work on behalf of a Turkish businessman last year with the Flynn Intel Group or provided any warning that he planned to file as a foreign agent, a current Trump transition official told The Associated Press. Kian, a little-known figure active on the presidential transition team, is emerging as a key player in the political controversy involving Flynn, Trump's fired national security adviser. "He did not indicate that to us in his transition documents. We would have no reason to know," said the transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Kian's role during the post-election period. Almost two months after the transition period, both Kian and Flynn filed in March as foreign agents with the Justice Department, acknowledging their political work for Turkish-run Inovo BV could have principally benefited the government of Turkey. In this March 15, 2014, photo provided by Alfredo Flores, from left, Vice Admiral Michael Rogers; Paul Monteiro, vice chairman and co-Founder of Nowruz Commission; Bijan R. Kian and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn talk during the Fifth Annual Nowruz Commission Gala at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington. As Michael Flynn spent last fall campaigning as Donald Trump's top national security adviser, Bijan Kian, his little-known business partner supervised much of the foreign political work for Turkish interests that has boomeranged back on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. (Alfredo Flores via AP) For Kian, who led most of Flynn Intel Group's research and lobbying for a Turkish businessman, the Trump transition role offered influence in the selection of intelligence agency candidates and access to internal discussions of U.S. national security policy. But Kian's participation in the transition - following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey's government - reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration's vetting process. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is co-sponsoring a bill to toughen regulation of Americans performing political work for foreign interests, said Tuesday it was "very troubling that an unregistered foreign agent was playing a key role in the Trump administration's transition." She added that "similar to General Flynn, someone working on behalf of foreign governments should never be put in a position where they're making important decisions within our government." An Iranian-American businessman whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, Kian did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Kian described his transition role on his LinkedIn profile as "deputy lead" assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided "policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare" candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials who met with Kian during that period said that Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general's sounding board. One of the officials said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump's CIA director. The second official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added that Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition's work. Like Kian, Flynn also worked on the transition while he was under Justice Department scrutiny for the Turkish work. But, as the AP previously reported , Flynn did inform the Trump transition about his Turkish work through his attorneys, who notified the transition he might have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn joined the administration, his attorneys followed up with the White House counsel's office, disclosing that Flynn would indeed be registering with the government as a foreign agent. As Flynn's little-known business partner, Kian played a key role last year in supervising much of Flynn Intel Group's foreign work while the former U.S. lieutenant general campaigned for Trump. The research and lobbying they conducted for the Turkish firm has boomeranged on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Flynn's mishandling of his dealings with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing in February by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. But the inquiries spawned by Flynn Intel's Turkish work pose added legal complications for both Flynn and his associates. Federal investigators are concentrating on possible criminal violations and a House oversight committee inquiry is examining Flynn's records to determine whether he lied to federal officials about his foreign contacts and payments. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group's creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn's company and records submitted to the Justice Department. Kian connected Flynn with his Turkish client, helped to negotiate their $600,000 contract and oversaw a documentary and an op-ed aimed at an opponent of Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the client and several others who requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The client, Ekim Alptekin, also confirmed to the AP that Kian worked for one of his Turkish companies at the same time he was working for Flynn Intel. "Content-wise, it was Bijan handling the day-to-day details," Alptekin said during a recent interview in Washington. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. "I'm very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing," he said. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. Kian's interests repeatedly intersected with Flynn's business ventures and political activities after Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, left the government in 2014. Kian, a former director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, shared Flynn's strong public opposition to Iran's theocratic government and a common interest in the development of secure communications systems. Until Trump's election, Flynn served with Kian on the board of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology firm Kian headed until April. Flynn and Kian co-authored a 2015 op-ed about ISIS militants, and attended galas put on by the Nowruz Commission, a nonprofit run by Kian and his wife promoting the Iranian Nowruz holiday. Alptekin was named a board director of that group in 2011. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel's linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn's firm together last summer with Alptekin's Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the "main one" representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn "wasn't involved at all" in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo ended up paying Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Flynn Intel disclosed its contract and other details of its Turkish work last March to the Justice Department, which regulates lobbying and other political activities for foreign interests in the U.S. Flynn and Kian were the only individuals who personally registered as foreign agents for Inovo. Kian and Alptekin had an existing business relationship when Flynn Intel began its foreign work. Alptekin confirmed Kian had been vice chairman of his Istanbul-based aviation company, EA Havacilik, since November 2011. Alptekin said he and Kian regularly strategized to build an aviation customer base. Alptekin has denied that any of Inovo's work was done at the direction of Turkey's government, but he is a member of a foreign trade board managed by the country's economic ministry. Alptekin said he first met Kian during Kian's stint on the Export-Import bank board for the Bush and Obama administrations between 2006 and 2011. Kian promoted U.S. business interests abroad for the bank, meeting officials in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations, according to State Department cables released by WikiLeaks. In his supervisory role for Flynn Intel, Kian was not always explicit about his ties to the firm, said several people who worked with him. Kian led a lobbying meeting last October with a representative of the House Homeland Security committee on behalf of GreenZone's secure communications products. But, as the AP previously reported , the session veered into a lobbying pitch for Flynn Intel, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the meeting. Kian and others involved pressed for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen but the request went nowhere, the official said. Kian never identified who he was working for, the official said. Kian also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey's government as America's "strongest ally" against terrorism and pressing for Gulen's extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. "I assumed since Bijan was the one who hired me, that he had written it," said Cox. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn's name. "I was only vaguely aware of General Flynn at the time but I had no idea I was working for him or his company," Cox said. Flynn's firm told the Justice Department that Flynn, Kian and Cox drafted the op-ed based on the firm's research for Inovo. The firm said neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government wrote or directed the op-ed, but Flynn Intel acknowledged it shared a draft with Inovo in advance of publication. Flynn's op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on Election Day, drew scrutiny from the Justice Department's foreign agent unit. Pressure from those officials forced Flynn and Kian to file as foreign agents and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Pace contributed to this report. ___ Submit a confidential tip to The Associated Press: https://www.ap.org/tips Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

In this next phase of our long-time partnership with ESL, we're investing in the development of future esports stars, further expanding our global footprint with the Intel Extreme Masters circuit, and exploring fresh formats like the Intel Grand Slam that we announced today".   The massive competition itself is the new Intel Grand Slam for CS:GO, with an additional $1 million for any team that manages to stop the Intel Grand Slam winner. The game is split into a few factors: with an additional $1 million being offered to the team that wins 4 of the last ten $200,000 events between DreamHack and ESL. The first Intel Grand Slam event takes place during ESL One Cologne 2017, which takes place between 7-9 of July.   If a team has won 3 trophies and is then defeated in the fourth Grand Final round which would win them the Intel Grand Slam title, the opposing team will be rewarded with $100,000 in prize money, as long as they aren't the Intel Grand Slam champion.

Qbex Computadores SA filed suit June 12 in San Jose District Court claiming up to $100 million in damages. In its complaint, Qbex claims it received 35,000 customer complaints and 4,000 lawsuits in Brazil due to design errors found in the SoFia SoC by an independent review it plans to release later. Qbex “is now known as the brand of exploding and defective smartphones,” it said. Intel initially declined to comment on the complaint, a copy of which a Qbex attorney sent to EE Times. Intel co-developed the SoFia SoCs with China’s RockChip but discontinued it in April 2016 as part of a reorg of its struggling mobile business group. Later, an Intel spokeswoman said, “We are reviewing the allegations in the complaint and we will investigate them thoroughly. However, we have no evidence to suggest that the overheating issues Qbex alleges were caused by our product.” Qbex got its start as an electronics assembler in 2003. It rose to annual sales of $85 million, selling as many as 600,000 desktop PCs in 2012. It moved into tablets and in 2015 sold Brazil’s second most popular system next to the Samsung Galaxy, the complaint said. In June 2015, Qbex struck a deal with Intel to assemble and sell smartphones using on the SoFia SoC and other components provided by a group of four contract manufacturers in China. It had also considered a smartphone deal with Qualcomm. At one point Qbex shifted more than 90 percent of its assembly operations to SoFia smartphones and hired 200 people to support the business. It sold a total of 235,074 units between October 2015 and December 2016 before ending the business amid rapidly rising customer complaints. Qbex charged Intel and its contract manufacturers failed to inform it of design problems with SoFia. It also charged Intel tried to sell it as many as 1.25 million SoFia chips in May 2016, after it discontinued the business. Ultimately Qbex hired as many as 216 people just to deal with complains and suits regarding the handsets and agreed to exchange 18,000 units. — Rick Merritt, Silicon Valley Bureau Chief, EE Times Related posts: Intel to Exit Mobile SoC Business How Intel Missed the Smartphone Call Intel, Rockchip Co-Design Tablet SoC Email This Print Comment More Related Links Exascale Project Awards $258M Nokia Touts NPU for Internet's Next Chapter Google Ramps Mobile SoC Team B'com Overhauls Network Switches PCI Express Preps Shift to 32G Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] Be the first to post a comment regarding this story.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You BIRMINGHAM: US-based chipmaker Intel is tying up with Bengaluru based smart-wearables startup Speculur to commercialise its recently launched bat-sensor technology, which made its debut in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy in England. The chip, which weighs about 25 grams and can be mounted on top of any cricket bat, generates data for every shot that the batsman plays. Speculur was founded by US-based technology executive Anu Agrawal and sports marketing entrepreneur Atul Srivastava in 2015, with a focus on bringing data analytics to sports. Called Speculur BatSense with Intel Inside, the product will be sold for Rs 10,000 or $150 per unit bundled with a mobile application. Players can see the analysis or a report card after a practice session or a match in the app, and also share it with others. This technology currently measures parameters like back-lift, bat speed, and impact angle. Followthrough can also be tracked for every cricket stroke. The product will be available from August 2017 in Australia, India, the US and the UK. While the technology is niche, Speculur sees a significant market for the product, which besides professional cricketers and training academies, is expected to find takers in corporate cricket leagues. "There is a 8.5-million cricket playing population in the age group of 835 years. And bats account for about 50% of sports equipment market," said Srivastava, who has set a target of selling 1 million units. Srivastava also runs sports marketing company Gaames Unlimited, which focuses on talent management and merchandising. Agra wal has spent two decades working in tech companies like Mphasis and HP, where he was last heading sales for the banking and insurance vertical in North America. Speculur has been working with Intel in bringing out the bat-sensor tech, which took about 18 months, consulting with coaches and players. Some of the other areas where the startup is developing products is fan engagement and injury prevention besides analytics. Besides tying up with Speculur for Batsense, Intel has also launched drones with infrared cameras for advanced pitch analysis and virtual reality (VR) zones in stadiums for batsmen to experience what it is to face a virtual bowler. Intel does not have any immediate plans to commercialise these two technologies, but they represent its push into sports like NBA, La Liga and Winter X Games. The use of these technologies in sports by Intel is targetted at increasing digitisation, immersion and personalisation. "We are growing beyond the personal computers to get into the data business," said Anuj Dua, director of marketing for Intel's New Technology Group.

Read on to find out why this is a great update to the iMac by Karen Haslam | 13 Jun 17 Price RRP: From £1,049, From US$1,099 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   Apple From £1,049 View Price comparision from , and manufacturers iMac 21.5-inch (2017) preview The 21-inch iMac was last updated in October 2015 and, to be frank, that update was a little disappointing because, despite the fact that this was the first generation of 21-inch iMac to offer a 4K Retina display, the processor in that model was a Broadwell CPU, rather than the Skylake CPU offered by the 27-inch iMac of the same generation. The good news is that this time round both the 21-inch iMac and the 27-inch iMac have received a processor boost to the newer Intel Kaby Lake range. So no more lagging behind for the 21-inch model. The other big change this time round is that where in 2015 there was only one 21-inch iMac with a 4K Retina display. This time round there are two models offering 4K displays. These two 4K iMacs also offer discreet graphics processors, rather than the integrated Intel graphics that had been offered on older generations. As a result, these 4K iMacs, with their quad-core Kaby Lake processors, Radeon Pro graphics cards, and the option to configure RAM to 32GB, are looking more powerful than ever. We’ll take a more in-depth look at all the aspects of the new models below, starting with display. If you want to find out more about the 27-inch iMac, our review of that model is here: 27-inch 2017 iMac review. Thinking of buying a new Mac? Here's our complete buying guide, which covers every model Apple makes. Which Mac: Mac Buying guide 2017. We also have a guide showing you the best place to buy a Mac. Display When it updated the iMac in 2015, Apple added a 4K Retina display to the 21-inch range. This time round there are two 4K Retina iMacs: a 3GHz quad-core model and a 3.4GHz model. At launch in 2015 the 3.1GHz 4K 2015 model with a Retina display cost £1,199. This year’s entry-level 4K Retina, with its 3GHz processor, costs slightly more at £1,249. However, we should note that the prices of the previous generation iMac increased in October 2016, so that model was eventually priced at £1,449. So in some ways Apple could sell this as a price drop (and will probably try to). As for the 4K display Apple’s made some improvements there. All the new iMacs with Retina displays (including the 27-inch models reviewed here) feature new Retina displays with 500nits and 10-bit dithering, which probably sounds like gobbledegook to anyone who doesn’t speak ‘monitor’ but basically means that they are 43 per cent brighter and capable of reproducing even more colours - one billion colours, according to the company. Apple says that iMac users will be able to enjoy an “even more vivid and true-to-life viewing experience” from these new screens. The resolution is the same as before, at 4,096x2,304 pixels for the 21-inch Retina iMacs. This is a P3 display, as per the 2015 models. A P3 display is capable of producing colours outside the sRGB colour gamut. The non-Retina 2.3GHz model offers a 1920x1080 sRGB display. It is possible that if you didn’t see the Retina display model you would be more than satisfied with the standard display on the entry-level iMac. But at just £200 extra, and with the other benefits the Retina model brings (faster processor, better graphics) we think it’s worth considering the pricier 3GHz Retina model. It’s interesting to note that the £1,249 Retina display 3GHz iMac has the same price attached to it as the 12-inch MacBook, which offers a 1.2GHz processor, and the 2.3GHz 13-inch MacBook Pro. You won’t get a Retina display for less than £1,249 and the iMac certainly looks like it offers the best value for money. Processor All the new 21-inch and 27-inch iMacs feature new Intel Kaby Lake processors. The 21in iMac models will get Kaby Lake processors running at up to 3.6GHz (which is a build-to-order option). The processors are as follows: 21.5in iMac     •    2.3GHz i5 dual-core     •    3.0GHz i5 quad-core     •    3.4GHz i5 quad-core     •    3.6GHz i7 quad-core (BTO) 27in iMac     •    3.4GHz i5 quad-core     •    3.5GHz i5 quad-core     •    3.8GHz i5 quad-core     •    4.2GHz i7 quad-core (BTO) As you can see, it is not the case that the 27-inch iMac offers a huge jump in comparison to 21-inch models, which is a significant difference to the MacBook Pro where there is quite a leap between the siblings. Read our MacBook Pro 2017 review here. You can choose a 3.4GHz iMac in either 4K or 5K resolution, for example. One will cost you £1,449 and the other costs £1,749 (that bigger screen costing an extra £300). Compared to the last generation models, the new Kaby Lake processors will make a big difference. In 2015 the 21-inch iMac was hampered by older Broadwell processors while that year’s 27-inch models had the Skylake processor. Since the 21-inch model are jumping two processor generations so you can expect to see some real gains compared to the older models. In addition, the entry-level model is an improvement on the 2015 entry-level iMac. Back then the cheaper model offered a measly 1.6GHz processor. Now the entry-level is a more attractive 2.3GHz. However, there is a caveat. When that 1.6GHz processor first arrived the entry-level iMac price was just £899. So the price is now £150 more. However, as we mentioned above, Apple did rase the price of the iMac back in October 2016, so the entry-level 1.6GHz model was £1,049 more recently. Meaning that Apple has effectively removed the old entry-level specced machine from the line up and replaced it with an update to what was the 2.8GHz non Retina 4K model, which cost £1,049 at launch, and later cost £1,249. What that all boils down to is the fact that you can get a 2.3GHz iMac for the same price as you used to get a 1.6GHz iMac. And this new 2.3GHz model sits somewhere between the older 1.6GHz and 2.8GHz models. It definitely has more going for it than the old 1.6GHz model which we would have dissuaded anyone from buying. However, as we said above, for just £200 pounds more you can get a Retina display, but also a 3GHz processor and a discrete graphics card. If you would benefit from these improvements its well worth paying the extra cash. One last, thing about the iMac processor. The processor is accessible and upgradable, according to iFixit. Yes, Apple has made it possible for users to upgrade their iMac, something that has been impossible in recent years. Doing so will void your warranty, or course, but since updates tend to happen years down the line we doubt this matters to you. We have run some Geekbench tests on the 2017 3.4GHz 21.5-inch iMac - that's the top of the range model. Geekbench 4 64-bit Single-Core tests 3.4GHz 21.5-in iMac (mid 2017) 4877 3.0GHz Mac Pro 8-core (late 2013) 3794 3.3GHz 21.5-in iMac (late 2015) 4505 3.1GHz 21.5-in iMac (late 2015) 4174 2.8GHz 21.5-in iMac (non-Retina, late 2015) 4010 1.6GHz 21.5-in iMac (non-Retina, late 2015) 3189 Geekbench 4 64-bit Multi-Core tests 3.4GHz 21.5-in iMac (mid 2017) 14115 3.0GHz Mac Pro 8-core (late 2013) 21649 3.3GHz 21.5-in iMac (late 2015) 14831 3.1GHz 21.5-in iMac (late 2015) 12192 2.8GHz 21.5-in iMac (non-Retina, late 2015) 11683 1.6GHz 21.5-in iMan (non-Retina, late 2015) 5722 Unfortunately while we have Geekbench results from the 2015 models they aren't truly comparable because they were run in Geekbench 3 and we haven't yet been able to re-run those tests.  RAM If that wasn’t reason enough to buy the new iMac, then here’s another. It is also possible to upgrade the RAM yourself. This discovery was also made by iFixIt, who were shocked to find that rather than being soldered onto the motherboard, this time the RAM is located in a RAM hatch hidden behind the logic board. So the RAM can be upgraded. The fact that these components can be upgraded is a refreshing change, although accessing them will not be easy. Nevertheless it is great to see Apple making changes that will please typically creative users who want upgradable Macs. It may point to the forthcoming iMac Pro and Mac Pro being user upgradable. (Read more about Apple's plans for the iMac Pro here and all the latest news about the new Mac Pro here.) The memory is better too - it’s been upgraded to DDR4 and therefore offers higher clock speeds and lower voltage operations and is faster than the older DDR3 memory. Graphics It’s not just the Retina display you get if you pay £200 more than the entry price. You also get a dedicated graphics card, the Radeon Pro 555 with 2GB video memory, rather than the Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640. Intel’s graphics (which are integrated on to the CPU) use the computer’s RAM, while dedicated (or discreet graphics cards have their own memory. An integrated card will be quite sufficient if you are just using your Mac for things like browsing the web, office work, even watching and editing videos. But if you do graphic intensive work - perhaps you are a designer, or maybe you like to play games on your Mac - you will benefit from the Radeon Pro graphics cards offered on all the other machines. Back in 2015 all the 21-inch iMacs, even the top of the range, 4K iMac, featured Intel Iris Pro Graphics 6200. Now all but the entry level iMac are getting discrete Radeon Pro graphics cards. The 4K iMac will ship with discrete Radeon Pro 555 and 560 4GB VRAM, which is 3x faster than the previous generation, according to Apple. The 21.5-inch model delivers up to three times faster performance than previously, and the 27-inch model is up to 50 percent faster, according to Apple. Even though the entry-level 21-inch iMac gets an Intel’s Iris Plus integrated graphics, that is still 80 percent faster than previous generation. Apple’s decision to use discrete graphics on the 21-inch Retina Macs in 2017 suggests to us that Apple is reacting to increased interest from graphics professionals and gamers. One thing is for sure, judging from the WWDC keynote presentation in June, at which Apple said the new iMacs offer a “big jump in graphics performance.” Apple wants to get into the Virtual Reality revolution, and to do so, Macs need to have the right graphics cards. We are currently testing the new iMac’s graphics prowess to make a judgement on just how much better the Radeon Pro graphics card is compared to the Intel integrated card. We envisage that there will be a significant difference. For that reason, the Radeon Pro graphics card is another reason to pay the £200 extra to get the £1,249 3GHz Retina iMac. Storage As we have explained already, if you are deciding which 21-inch iMac to buy you might be wise to choose the 3GHz Retina version over the 2.3GHz non Retina model. It’s just £200 more.  However there is one other thing to factor in. For years we have advised that if you are buying the iMac then you should upgrade to a Fusion drive rather than settle with the hard drive offered as standard on some models. This year is no different - although the company is now offering the Fusion Drive as standard on more iMacs than ever. Where the Fusion Drive used to be offered as standard only on the two more expensive 27-inch models, now the only models that don't have a Fusion Drive are the non-Retina 21-inch and the entry-level Retina 4K model. The Fusion Drive combines a small amount of flash with a hard drive. Certain things are kept on the SSD part of the drive so they can be accessed really quickly, but you also get a high capacity hard drive. An iMac with a Fusion Drive will run a lot faster than one that does not have a Fusion Drive. At just £90 as a build-to-order option, this is an affordable solution if you want the speed benefits of flash but can’t afford a large capacity SSD. We just wish it was standard across the range, but at least Apple has widened the range that do offer this solution. So our advice if you are buying a 3GHz Retina iMac is to add on another £90 and get a Fusion Drive. The standard storage offered in the 21-inch iMacs is as follows: 21.5in iMac     •    2.3GHz 1TB hard drive     •    3.0GHz 1TB hard drive     •    3.4GHz 1TB Fusion Drive The Fusion Drive addition aside, it’s also good news that the SSD storage is now up to 50 percent faster, with write speeds of 3Gbps, according to Apple. Ports and peripherals As expected the new 21-inch iMac gained two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which doubles up as a USB Type-C port, which Apple describes as the “most powerful and versatile port ever.” In addition to the Thunderbolt 3 ports you will also find the older USB port, so no need to worry about your older USB peripherals. This latter point is definitely one in favour of the iMac in comparison with the MacBook Pro or MacBook, both of which have done away with the old USB standard in favour of USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. One other change that makes us think Apple has been listening is the fact that you can now purchase a wireless keyboard with a number pad. This is something people have been requesting for years. Price The new iMac pricing remains the same (or rather, pricing hasn’t changed since it changed in October). Here's how the pricing of the 21-inch breaks down: 21.5-inch     •    2.3GHz i5, 1TB hard drive, 8GB RAM, Iris Plus 640, £1,049/$1,099     •    3.0GHz i5, Retina 4K, 1TB hard drive, 8GB RAM, Radeon Pro 555, £1,24/$1,299     •    3.4GHz i5, Retina 4K, 1TB Fusion Drive, 8GB RAM, Radeon Pro 560, £1,449/$1499 BTO options:     •    3.6GHz i5 processor + £180     •    16GB RAM + £180     •    32GB RAM + £540 (3.4GHz model only)     •    256GB SSD + £90     •    512GB SSD + £270     •    1TB SSD + £630 OUR VERDICT We think Apple has been listening to what people want and the new 21-inch iMac will answer a lot of people’s prayers. Sure we’d like the price of the entry-level model to be less, but even if it was we’d still be recommending that Apple’s customers should upgrade. Unlike the MacBook Pro where the 13-inch model is less pro than its larger 15-inch sibling, there is a lot more in common between the 21-inch and 27-inch iMacs. It doesn’t feel like you need to buy a 27-inch model to get a decent Mac because the 21-inch is still pretty amazing. The only thing it’s left us wishing is that the 21-inch iMac was a bit bigger. We’d love to see the return of the 24-inch iMac from the Intel switch days (although obviously with more modern specs!) Tags: Mac , iMac Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 13 June 2017 | MYT 11:00 AM Apple’s new iPhones said to miss out on higher-speed data links Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. — EPA Verizon Corp, AT&T Inc and the rest of the US wireless industry have a big boast for this year’s crop of smartphones: thanks to network upgrades, devices will be able to download as much as a gigabit of data in a single second – speeds 100 times faster than before.  But that won’t be the case for Apple Inc’s newest iPhones, devices to go on sale later this year, leaving the company’s most important product potentially lagging behind the data performance of rival smartphones.  The reason stems from the delicate and sometimes complicated way Apple manages the supply of the components embedded in its flagship device – in this case, the modems, which handle the connection between a phone and the cellular network.  One of Apple’s suppliers, Qualcomm Inc, sells a modem capable of the 1 gigabit download speeds. Another supplier, Intel Corp, is working on a modem with the same capability, but it won’t be ready for the iPhone’s introduction, according to people familiar with Apple’s decision.  Apple could in theory just use Qualcomm’s chips, but it has an aversion to being dependent on a single supplier, and its relationship with San Diego-based Qualcomm is particularly thorny. Cupertino, California-based Apple is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with the chipmaker, accusing the supplier of maintaining an illegal monopoly, and it’s seeking to loosen Qualcomm’s grip on the market for high-end smartphone modems. That’s why Apple will stick with Qualcomm modems for some of its new iPhones while relying on Intel for others.  Until Intel is able to offer its chips with matching features, Apple won’t enable some of capabilities of the phones running with Qualcomm modems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn’t public. Apple, Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment.  Apple’s decision clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share. The top US wireless carriers – Verizon AT&T, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp – have declared 2017 the year of 1 gigabit speeds.  Apple used two modem suppliers – and the same technique to mask performance disparities – for last year’s iPhone 7. But the rise of gigabit wireless networks could make the strategy more risky: iPhone users will have a unified experience, no matter what modem is inside the new device, but it could look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers.  The carriers will be able to boast about 1 gigabit speeds if customers use other phones. Samsung Electronic Co’s Galaxy S8, the main rival to the next iPhones, has Qualcomm’s X16 LTE modem and will keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks. Sprint sells the gigabit-ready HTC U11 and will have a Motorola Gigabit LTE phone later this year.  Apple’s decision to introduce new technology when it wants, rather than chase whatever the market dictates, isn’t new. The original iPhone launched in 2007 without support for 3G networks, and it was still wildly successful. It wasn’t until 2012 that the iPhone supported LTE technology that’s the basis of 4G networks – a year after Samsung Electronics Co added that capability to its smartphones.  Still, Apple is dealing with a market that’s crying out for innovation to revive growth. Last year, the company’s revenue from iPhones, which generates more than 60% of Apple’s US$216bil (RM921.25bil) annual sales, fell for the first time. Smartphone total market growth was just 2.5%, breaking a run of double-digit annual surges, according to industry analyst IDC.  Whether Apple’s decision will overshadow the company’s slick new design and features in the phone coming later this year, as well as its customer loyalty, remains to be seen. Achieving 1 gigabit data speeds requires almost lab-like optimal signal conditions that seldom occur in the real world.  Nonetheless, the first carrier to claim such network capabilities will get bragging rights and an edge at selling the promise of instantaneous movie downloads and high-quality live video. It’s one area where service providers can’t afford to be seen as laggards.  Luring customers  The carriers are already in a fierce price battle for subscribers. As the pool of new customers has declined, most of the user gains are coming at the expense of rivals. Sprint and T-Mobile have been taking customers from AT&T and Verizon by offering cheaper unlimited data at a time when video hungry users seek lower-cost plans to support their habits. The ability to advertise a service that’s 100-times faster may help carriers shift consumer focus to network performance and away from cut-throat pricing.  T-Mobile promised to have the first 1 gigabit data service available in the US this year and has already started making network upgrades, chief technology officer Neville Ray said in February. AT&T has started 1 gigabit mobile service in Austin, Texas, and plans to expand to as many as 20 cities this year. Verizon will begin 5G trials in 11 markets this summer and plans to start mobile testing of 1 gigabit speeds in those cities.  Sprint has been one of the most aggressive proponents of 1 gigabit mobile speeds, promising in December that it would offer the fastest service in the industry. Sprint said it will have at least three 1 gigabit capable phones available this year – with the exception of iPhones. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Mattel plays with digital toys to triple China business Instagram introduces archive feature to allow users to hide photos Not yet Amazon Prime time: Australia retail sell-off overblown?

While most of the hardware I tested pre-Ryzen launch was almost 100% Intel based, it's now actually more on the AMD side.   AMD is the comeback kid, and they are slowly releasing their entire lineup, with rumors flying around that their Ryzen 3 series processors destined to target Intel's Core i3 processors will come out later this year.     I have reviewed the 1800X, 1700X, 1700, 1600X, and 1500X, and today I will look at another one of their 6 core/12 thread CPUs the Ryzen 5 1600 and the 4 core/8 thread Ryzen 5 1400.     Specifications     Compared to the 1600X, the 1600 has a base frequency 400MHz lower at 3.2GHz, and 100MHz lower on the boost at 3.6GHz. It doesn't feature XFR like it's bigger brother, but also has a TDP 30W lower at 65W. With 6 cores and 12 threads, the 1600 has the same amount of cache and is almost identical to the 1600X except for the clocks and XFR.   The Ryzen 5 1400 has a 65W TDP, but I found it uses a lot less power than other 65W TDP Ryzen processors. Its 4 cores and 8 threads run at 3.2GHz base and 3.4Ghz Max Turbo, which is 400MHz and 300MHz lower than the 1500X's base and turbo speeds. It also doesn't offer XFR. While the AMD Ryzen 5 1600 has 16MB L3 cache, the Ryzen 5 1400 has 4MB.     Pricing   The Ryzen 5 1600 and 1500 cost $219.99 and $169.99, respectively.   For comparison, the Ryzen 5 1500X costs $189.99, and the 1600X costs $249.99, the Ryzen 7 1700 costs $314.99, so the cost savings are significant.

Intel's upcoming Core i9-7900X has reached 5GHz with the AIO liquid cooler, and even 4.5GHz on air, all on 1.15V - and with all CPU cores enabled.     The new Core i9-7900X will arrive with 10C/20T of CPU power, 13.75MB L3 cache, and 3.3/4.3GHz for base/boost, respectively. But Intel's new Turbo Boost 3.0 technology will overclock the 10C/20T chip to 4.5GHz, which is a huge upgrade over the current high core count CPUs like the Core i7-6950X. Intel's upcoming Core i9-7900X will have a TDP of 140W, and its X299 chipset will feature 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes.     Intel will be pricing the new 10C/20T Core i9-7900X at $999, and considering the Core i7-6950X debuted at $1500 and is still $1500 on Amazon right now - all with the same 10C/20T, but at much lower clocks (3.0/3.5GHz for base/boost), it's a steal. AMD will be competing big time with their upcoming Ryzen ThreadRipper CPUs offering up to 16C/32T, but their spiffy new X399 chipset rocks 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes, beating Intel out by a fair chunk.   NEWS SOURCES:Wccftech.com, Youtu.be Recommended for You Samsung's mid-range Exynos chips leak Intel's next-gen Coffee Lake CPUs delayed into 2018...

The giant chipmaker made the announcement as it reported lower-than-expected sales for the first quarter. This as industry analysts say an extended slide in global PC sales is showing no signs of leveling off. Intel, which has long been the world’s leading maker of PC chips, is now trying to expand into other types of computing. “It’s time to make this transition,” CEO Brian Krzanich told analysts. While calling the job cuts “difficult,” he said they would help the company sharpen its focus in new areas. The latest cuts follow an earlier reduction of about 5,000 jobs announced by Intel in 2014, and analysts say they may not be the last. “These companies are so big that it takes time” — and sometimes multiple rounds of restructuring — to change direction, said Patrick Moorhead, a longtime industry expert at Moor Insights & Strategy. Krzanich has been pushing Intel to change its focus from PCs to other computing segments that are growing and providing more profit. These include making microprocessors for “cloud computing” data centers, along with chips for Internet-connected gadgets, wearable devices and drones. “We are evolving from a PC company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices,” he said in a statement. Intel said the job cuts will include “voluntary and involuntary departures” over the coming year, some of them occurring as Intel consolidates some of its PC chip operations into fewer locations. A spokeswoman declined to say exactly which jobs or locations would be affected. Intel has large campuses in Portland, Oregon; Chandler, Arizona; Rio Rancho, New Mexico; and Santa Clara and Folsom, California. It also has facilities in countries including Israel and China. Most of the affected workers will be notified in the next 60 days. The cuts are likely to involve divisions making and selling chips for traditional desktop and laptop computers, Moorhead said. He noted Intel has signaled its plans to continue investing in chips for gaming consoles and new “two-in-one” devices that resemble tablets with detachable keyboards. Those devices are still seeing strong sales growth. Krzanich has been trying to change Intel’s focus since he became CEO in 2013, and he’s replaced several top executives in recent months. Intel said Tuesday that longtime Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith will transition to a new position in coming months. But aside from the data center business, which now contributes nearly a third of Intel’s revenue, the markets for Intel’s other new products are still “very embryonic,” according to Mark Hung, an industry analyst at the Gartner research firm. “It’s going to take two to three years before they provide meaningful growth for the company,” Hung said. Krzanich cited Intel’s first-quarter financial performance as evidence the transition is working. Intel reported revenue of $13.70 billion for the first three months of 2016, up 7 percent from the same period a year earlier. That was slightly lower than the $13.73 billion that analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting. Global demand for PCs fell 9.6 percent in the first quarter, according to figures released earlier this month by Gartner. The industry has been in decline for the last four years, Hung noted, but some analysts had expected PC sales to level off this year. Instead, he noted quarterly PC shipments fell below 65 million for the first time since 2007.

BUSINESS Google execs prepare for fight with EU as fines loom 13 Jun, 2017 10:21am 5 minutes to read × A visitor passes a sculpture of a "G" inside Google's European headquarters in Dublin. Photo / Chris Ratcliffe Bloomberg Share via email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Show more Bookmark this article Share on Facebook facebook Share on Twitter twitter Share via email email Share on LinkedIn linkedin Share on Google Plus google-plus Share on Whatsapp whatsapp Share on Pinterest pinterest Share on Reddit reddit × As European Union officials count the days before their annual vacation, Google's lawyers and lobbyists are hunkering down in Brussels, preparing for what may be a record EU antitrust fine. A penalty in the shopping-search probe could come within weeks and many expect it to exceed a $1.2 billion fine on Intel in 2009. That would be another show of strength by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager who slapped Apple with a 13 billion-euro (US$14.5b) tax bill in August. Google is a top priority case for her as European politicians and publishers push for action against the Mountain View, California-based company that's come to dominate online advertising. "If there's going to be a fine, it has to be the biggest ever," said Stephen Kinsella, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who represents companies that have complained to the EU about Google. "The European Commission has strongly signalled that if there is going to be a fine it would need to be at a level that would have deterrent effect." Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Timing on a decision could slip and Google representatives and the commission both remain tight-lipped, declining to talk about it. The company hasn't yet met with regulators to discuss a potential EU order or how it might implement any changes, according to a person familiar with the probe, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the EU has a long tradition of issuing major rulings just before officials quit Brussels for their summer break. Last July saw more than $3 billion in fines for truck makers including Daimler AG and Volvo AB. With one eye on the impending decision, some Google officials have been getting ready, moving vacation dates or making sure they are close to the action, other people familiar with the probe said. Vestager "has a keen eye to maximising the impact of any announcement on a case and July sees a slowdown in the news cycle," said Christopher Bright, a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling in Brussels, who's not involved in the Google probe. "Together with the advanced state of preparation of the case, this points to a July announcement for Google." Vestager isn't afraid of big numbers, setting records with the tax bill for Apple -- which it's appealing -- and the cartel fine for truck companies. Facebook may have got off lightly with a mere 110 million-euro penalty for not providing correct information in the WhatsApp merger probe.

As Alphabet pulled in $90 billion in revenue last year, any fine would be capped at $9 billion. But within that limit, the actual size of the fine would be calculated from sales in the market under investigation. Alphabet's Google division generated $79 billion in ad revenue in 2016. While it doesn't break out sales for shopping search advertising, ads from search provide most of its revenue. The EU also factors in how many years the illegal conduct lasted. Regulators say the systematic promotion of Google's own shopping search started in 2008, allowing Google Product Search and Google Shopping grow more quickly than rival comparison-shopping services. A large penalty and an order for Google to change its ways might just be the start. The EU is also examining its AdSense advertising service and its Android mobile phone software. The Android investigation goes to the heart of what Google does in the mobile-phone space, questioning the strict terms Google places on phone makers and app developers to use the software it provides for free. While money matters, Alphabet has a cash pile of more than $92 billion as of March 31 and any changes to its business model ordered by the EU may "probably be of more significance," said Spencer Waller, a competition law professor at Loyola University in Chicago. "I doubt this is going to hamstring the company, but the commission is going to order what it thinks is necessary to give competition a chance," he said. EU's claims that Google Shopping results harm competition "are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics," general counsel Kent Walker wrote in a blog post last year. The EU's case "rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online" because price comparison sites aren't the only way to shop around. Google can appeal, which could take years. Microsoft only won a 4 per cent cut to its fine. Intel has been waiting eight years for a final ruling. Vestager's move against Google is sure to attract further criticism that she's unfairly singled out US companies. Transatlantic tensions are already on the rise after President Donald Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate accord, adding to concerns over global trade. "We're entering a period in the States where foreign competition enforcement against US-based companies is going to be a matter of more public comment and criticism," said Waller. "I think you'll hear similar things" to the outcry over the Apple tax bill when the Google probe wraps up, he said. The US Chamber of Commerce in March called on Trump to "address the misuse of competition law by other nations that impede international trade and competition and harm US companies." On the other hand, Vestager is under pressure in Europe from companies and politicians eager to see her punish Google. Complaints about Google continue to pour in to the EU, most recently from publishers about Android software. And new fronts could open; Vestager tweeted recently that she'd be playing close attention to Google's new ad-blocking feature. For Google, there could be more summers like this.

As ubiquitous as x86 is, it's easy to forget it's still a patent minefield guarded by Intel. And surprise, surprise, with the chipmaker under pressure from AMD and ARM, it felt the need to make that very, very clear. Dangling at the end of a celebratory PR blog post about 40 years of x86, Intel writes: However, there have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel's proprietary x86 ISA without Intel's authorization. Emulation is not a new technology, and Transmeta was notably the last company to claim to have produced a compatible x86 processor using emulation ("code morphing") techniques. Intel enforced patents relating to SIMD instruction set enhancements against Transmeta's x86 implementation even though it used emulation. In any event, Transmeta was not commercially successful, and it exited the microprocessor business 10 years ago. Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel's x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel's microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel's x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences, consistency across applications, and a full breadth of consumer offerings, full manageability and IT integration for the enterprise. However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights. Strong intellectual property protections make it possible for Intel to continue to invest the enormous resources required to advance Intel's dynamic x86 ISA, and Intel will maintain its vigilance to protect its innovations and investments. I'm assuming Microsoft has all this stuff licensed nice and proper, but it's interesting that Intel felt the need to emphasize this as strongly as they do here. Which companies is Intel referring to here? Maybe Apple?

Each has been revamped with faster Intel Kaby Lake processors to allow for a speed boost, but look mostly the same as last year. The biggest change in terms of features is the rectangle-shaped fingerprint scanner located at the top-right corner of the trackpad. It can be used to unlock the Mi Notebook Air and authorize payments online. The trio additionally comes with 4G LTE modem support for added connectivity options. The top-of-the-line Mi Notebook Air doesn’t have a price tag yet. It boasts of a seventh generation Intel Core i7 SoC clocked at 3.5GHz and 256GB of SSD storage. The new CPU has apparently resulted in a 10% improvement in performance. Also See: Xiaomi may bring Mi Max 2 to India in July The second 13.3-inch Xiaomi laptop offers a seventh generation 3.1GHz Intel Core i5 chip and 128GB of room at CNY 4999 (roughly Rs 51400). The third features the same Intel Core i5 chipset, but upgrades the storage to 256GB. It’ll set buyers back by CNY 5499 (approx Rs 52100). All 3 Mi Notebook Air variants ship with 8GB of RAM inside and a new NVIDIA GeForce MX150 graphics card with 2GB of GDDR5 memory to help it along. Custom AKG speakers and Dolby Audio Premium make sure sound is of the highest quality. Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air specifications: – Display: 13.3-inch, 1080 x 1920 pixels – OS: Windows 10 – CPU: 7th gen Intel Core i7 – GPU: NVIDIA GeForce MX150 – Battery: 40Wh – Storage: 128GB/256GB SSD – RAM: 8GB – Connectivity: 4G, Wi-Fiac, Bluetooth, HDMI, 2 x USB 3.0, USB Type-C We’ll keep you updated if and when the Mi Notebook Air makes its way out of China.

Image Credit: The PC Gaming Show Destiny 2 is coming to the PC, and now Intel is helping to convince fans that the game will run well when it launches. Intel software boss Doug Fisher took the stage at the annual PC Gaming Show prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade event in Los Angeles to speak about how his company is amping up its gaming presence. That is manifesting as a major esports initiative and the sponsoring of The PC Gaming Show itself, but the chip company also revealed that it has partnered with Activision to help with the sequel to the online cooperative shooter Destiny. “I couldn’t be more excited to say we worked with Bungie and Activision to bring Destiny 2 to the PC,” said Fisher. “That experience is absolutely amazing.” Intel revealed that part of working with Bungie was about getting Destiny 2 to take full advantage of multi-core CPUs like the upcoming i9 chip. That should help players on Windows get as many frames per second as possible, which could potentially enable 144 frames per second when coupled with a powerful enough video card. Finally, Fisher also talked about how Intel is working to optimize its CPUs for both the lower end of the market with a focus on esports as well as the super high end where gamers demand the best to render demanding virtual reality games. This is all part of Intel’s recent efforts to endear itself to the PC gaming community. While it is competing with AMD and that company’s newly introduced Ryzen chips, Intel is hoping to make a direct pitch to one of the communities that is most likely to spend money to build their own systems.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Component / CPU / Intel is well prepared for 10nm, 2nd gen Ice Lake CPUs already taped in Intel is well prepared for 10nm, 2nd gen Ice Lake CPUs already taped in Matthew Wilson 4 days ago CPU, Featured Tech News Intel has announced a few times already that it is planning on releasing its first generation 10nm processors before the end of 2017 but it seems that the company has also been making solid progress on 10nm Gen 2. Today, Intel announced that its ninth generation Cannon Lake CPUs were still on track but added that 10nm Ice Lake chips have already been taped in. In a couple of Twitter posts made recently, Intel said: “Another milestone for 10nm: Cannon Lake on track and we’ve now taped in Ice Lake, our 2nd-generation 10nm product”. The company then continued to hammer home its position as a ‘leader in 10nm technology’ by saying: “Ice Lake, our 2nd generation 10nm processor, is taped in. Intel continues to lead in 10nm technology”. Before 10nm Cannon Lake lands, Intel will be launching Coffee Lake, which will be the company’s last revision of 14nm technology. We should be hearing more official details about Coffee Lake in a few months time. KitGuru Says: We have been on 14nm CPU tech for some time now so it will be nice to see what the 10nm die shrink will bring to the table late this year/early next year. We will be seeing Intel’s low-power CPUs launch first though, so 10nm may take a while to land for custom PC builders.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Intel Corporation's Core X-Series Rolls Out in 3 Phases Intel's Core X-series of processors should roll out over the course of four months. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 12, 2017 at 1:00PM Just ahead of the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) provided some additional details around the launch timing of its recently announced Core X-series of processors. As you might recall, late last month Intel formally announced its Core X-series of processors aimed at high-end desktop personal computers. At the time of the announcement, the company said that chips with between four and 10 cores will be the first of the Core X processors that'll be available. Image source: Intel. The parts with between 12 and 18 cores, Intel said at the time, would be "coming soon." Let's go over when we should expect the different members of the Core X processor family to be available, and what the roll out schedule could mean for the company's high-end desktop processor business. Up to 10 cores in June Intel says that the Core X processors with four, six, eight, and 10 cores "will be available for pre-order beginning on June 19 and will start shipping to consumers the following week." These parts range in price from $242 for the four core/four thread Core i5 7640X, to $999 for the 10 core/20 thread Core i9-7900X. I expect that the overwhelming majority of Intel's Core X-series processor sales will be of these parts. The rest of the lineup Intel is also planning to launch Core X processors with 12, 14, 16, and 18 cores. These chips, which begin at $1199 for the 12-core model and scale all the way to $1999 for the 18-core model, are likely to sell in substantially lower volumes than the lower core count parts, simply due to price. Not a lot of consumers -- or frankly, even prosumers -- spend that kind of money on computer processors. However, while relatively few desktop computer buyers will pick these chips, there are enough potential customers to make it worthwhile for Intel to release them. Moreover, these processors should be quite lucrative for Intel -- I'd be stunned if they didn't command gross margin substantially above Intel's corporate average of around 62%. Intel says that the 12-core model will be available in August, while the 14-, 16-, and 18-core models will be available in October. All told, it'll take the company about four months to get the entire lineup out. What this means for Intel The good news is that the parts that will likely sell in meaningful quantities should be out soon. The higher-core count parts will come later, so obviously the impact to Intel's business from these processors will be later, as well. However, as I said, I don't expect those parts to be particularly high-volume runners, and considering the sheer size (in both units and dollars) of Intel's personal computer processor business, I just can't see the impact of the roll out of these niche (but, again, profitable) chips being visible in the company's financial reporting. What the staggered rollout of these chips should do for Intel, though, is allow the company to stay in the gaming/enthusiast news cycles longer, serving to continually stimulate awareness of Intel's efforts in the gaming/enthusiast personal-computer market. And, to a small extent, Intel could benefit from individuals buying one of the lower core count processors initially, and then upgrading to a higher core count part later. Again, I don't expect such activity to have a meaningful impact on Intel's business, but the more revenue and profits that Intel can rake in, the better. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

In a technology demo Apeiron has compared the performance of its ADS1000 storage with NVMe flash drives and Intel Optane 3D XPoint drives. Global sales and marketing exec veep Jeff Barber tells us: “We have 3rd party testing of NAND vs. Optane, with a 70/30 read/write mix, where Optane with Apeiron produces only 13 microseconds of latency vs. 500 for NAND. Large block writes are 10x NAND performance, with 25x less latency.” Intel’s P4800X is a 375GB drive built from 3D XPoint memory which is faster than NAND and lasts longer than flash as well. The storage is an external array accessed across a hardened layer 2 Ethernet providing RDMA access to data using NVMe over Ethernet. Accessing servers are fitted with Apeiron’s own host bus adapters (HBAs) to achieve this, and the company’s pitch is that those servers get direct-attached SSD access speed when accessing a shared external array fitted with SSDs. The flash drives were 24 x Toshiba 7.68TB SSDs and the ADS1000 was accessed across 32 x 40 GbitE ports hooked up to five Dell and NEC x86 servers. Each server had two 2-port Apeiron HBAs installed. Then Apeiron looked at the same servers fitted first with internal Optane drives and, secondly, accessing the ADS1000 fitted with Optane drives. The company looked at IOPS, throughput and average latency and sent us a set of slides showing the results. Barber said: "Essentially we had a partner (WWT) complete a full study of NAND NVMe drives through the Apeiron network. This testing consisted of four drives per server, using a combination of Dell and NEC to prove Apeiron is compatible with any x86, PCIe Gen-3 [system]. “Apeiron then worked with Intel to secure multiple Optane drives and run the same VDBench scripts, using Optane “out of the Box” (no optimisation applied-straight Apeiron driver, HBA and enclosure). … we ran 70/30 read/write with some very large block sizes (up to 256K).” Here is a chart showing IOPS, throughput and latency for a NAND-based ADS1000 and an Optane-based one: ADS1000 array performance with NAND and Optane SSDs. Click chart for a larger version. Apeiron also ran FIO benchmarks, with Barber saying: “The FIO slides are critical because they prove that the Apeiron network is not adding any discernible latency. In fact, it is typically faster than an internally installed Optane drive. This demonstrates 'Optane on a string' instead of captive in the box. It will change how we look at HPC, Analytics, SAP HANA, etc…” There is a 4K block random read chart: Apeiron Optane DAS vs Optane array FIO benchmark - 4K random read. ... and a 1298K block sequential write chart: Apeiron Optane DAS vs Optane array FIO benchmark - 128K sequential write. +Comment This is the first external array Optane benchmark we have seen and it's clear that RDMA over Ethernet provides access as fast as if the Optane drives were local to the accessing servers. Apeiron's system design supports both NAND and Optane SSDs and, presumably, even faster other media if that comes along. The company's interest is to show that, like an NVMe over fabrics-accessed array, its network access penalty is low to non-existent, and that its array's performance scales linearly. Job basically done. Ours is to compare the NAND and Optane SSD data access performance. Without knowing the price of an Optane-fitted ADS1000 we don't know how much the Optane performance boost costs. But it's clear that Optane accelerates ADS1000 data access performance and we could well expect Apeiron to publish an Optane performance white paper as well as bring out an Optane ADS1000 product. Such a rocket ship array product would likely blow away virtually every external block array in existence performance-wise. The company probably has a data management services roadmap to add enterprise appeal to this – potentially – hottest of hot storage box products. ® Tips and corrections 9 Comments MORE Nvme Optane Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Fabric maths: Pure + Cisco = end-to-end NVMe Analysis FlashStack in pole position 8 Comments Cisco goes 32 gigging with Fibre Channel and NVMe Netzilla adds NVMe over Fibre Channel support on top of 32Gbit/s FC 6 Comments Dell kills off standalone DSSD D5, scatters remains into other gear +Comment Blueprints and staff shifted to different projects after EMC spent '$1bn' on tech 12 Comments Flash funds: Micron to rain cash on Excelero – sources SolidScale software supplier gets closer relationship with up-the-stack moving MIcron Always late to the party, IBM reveals itself to be NVMe fanboy +Comment Big Blue wants to lead NVMe transition in the industry.

Earlier this year, ESL partnered with Facebook and it’s been long-time partners with livestreaming platform Twitch. It’s set viewership records before; according to news site IGN, ESL’s ESL One CS:GO tournament in 2015 was the most-watched CS:GO tournament ever at the time with 27 million viewers. ESL said that Intel will now power all its streaming and live operations, and the two are teaming up for the new Intel Grand Slam series of 10 competitive Counter-Strike: Global Offensive matches (it’s the most popular shooter in esports). They’re offering a $1 million bonus prize to whoever wins 4-out-of-the-10 matches. Finally, they’re also partnering to tackle VR esports with their VR Challenger League, which will compete in Ready At Dawn Studios’ multiplayer Echo Arena VR game. Intel said that 46 million people watched its Intel Extreme Masters esports event last year, and competitive gaming and streaming are both focuses for its hardware moving forward.

Entering its third year as a major presentation at E3, one major question about the PC Gaming Show that we have is: Will it rein in its length? In both 2015 and 2016, the conference ran in excess of two hours, making it the longest major press conference in both years. That is not to say that the presentations were filled with duds. Last year, Cliff Bleszinski took the stage to talk Lawbreakers, New World Interactive announced its follow-up to Insurgency, a World War II shooter called Day of Infamy, and we saw a slew of virtual reality announcements for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, including the excellent Superhot. But much of the time in each of the first two years was given to games we already knew of and, in some cases, trailers and gameplay that we had already seen for those games. There is reason to believe that Intel’s show will turn things around this year, though. How to watch The Intel PC Gaming Show kicks off Monday at 10 a.m. (PT). It will be streamed on Twitch, but you can watch it right here with us in the window above. What to expect While this conference is a little harder to predict than other major conferences, we know a few things that will be featured on stage. For starters, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds developer Bluehole Studio will have some news and announcements about its ridiculously popular survival game. Firaxis Games and 2K will be in attendance to announce a major new addition for XCOM 2, a game that we awarded a perfect score. Klei Entertainment will announce its follow-up to Oxygen Not Included, which entered Early Access earlier this year. Creative Assembly will discuss Total War: Warhammer 2. Also, look for Harebrained to talk about the status of its Kickstarter-backed BattleTech. Microsoft reps will also take the stage, presumably to discuss the Play Anywhere program. Naturally, there will be more trailers, announcements, and looks at upcoming VR titles as well.

Should the prediction come true, this will be a major blow to Intel, which has been the leading chip maker in terms of sales for 26 years since 1991. According to researchers with NH Investment & Securities, cited in a report by The Korea Herald, Samsung could overtake Intel as soon as this summer due to the rise in number of data centers and expanded demand of solid state drives. Intel captured an estimated thirteen percent of global chip sales in the first quarter of 2016 versus Samsung’s 9.1 percent share. But during the March quarter of 2017, Intel took up 14.7 percent while Samsung held a comparable figure of 13.4 percent. “Starting the March-June period, Samsung’s global market share of chips will surpass the 15-percent mark to outpace its rival, helped by its improved competitiveness in the memory segment,” the report added. Apple no longer uses Samsung’s chip fabrication plants to build its in-house designed processors for iOS devices, but iPhones and iPads still use Samsung-built flash memory modules and the iPhone 7’s LTE modem is being dual-sourced from Intel and Samsung.

Page 1 of 3. 17 Comments Last week I posted some fresh macOS vs. Linux Intel OpenGL benchmarks while for those curious about the CPU performance, here are some additional benchmarks from that Mac Mini system. Like the OpenGL graphics tests, these CPU-focused Mac benchmarks were done from the Mac Mini with Core i5 4278U Haswell CPU, 8GB RAM, 1TB Apple HDD, and Intel integrated graphics. MacOS 10.12.5 was tested with its Xcode 8.3.3 Clang-based compiler stack and other stock packages. Ubuntu 17.04 x86_64 was tested with its default package-set including the Linux 4.10 kernel and GCC 6.3.0. Intel's performance-oriented Clear Linux was also tested with its stock packages including Linux 4.11, Mesa 17.2-dev, and GCC 7.1.1. Both Linux distributions were using EXT4 while macOS 10.12 still defaults to HFS+. A variety of macOS vs. Linux benchmarks were run in a fully-automated manner using the open-source Phoronix Test Suite benchmarking software.

We take a look. WWDC this year brought a host of new announcements, and while HomePods and new iOS 11 updates are all well and good, we're a tad excited about the iMac developments. Not only did Apple upgrade the existing lineup with new graphical capabilities and Intel's latest Kaby Lake processors, the company also gave us a sneak peek at the upcoming iMac Pro. It's not launching until later this year, but it looks like a real beast. The specs are off the charts, and several staff in the Trusted office simply cannot contain themselves. But with the slew of new upgrades for the existing iMacs, is it worth actually waiting for the Pro version? How much more powerful is this mysterious beast? We've got all the answers for you right here. Related: WWDC 2017 New iMac (2017) vs iMac Pro – Design Screen sizes on the new range of iMacs start at 21.5 inches and resolutions at 1080p. If you want to compare the best available iMac to the iMac Pro, that would be the 27-inch 5K iMac. The iMac Pro is also a 27-inch machine, but it comes in a snazzy Space Grey finish, as opposed to the Silver finish on the standard iMacs line. All iMac models bear the glass and metal design the series has become known for, and there's very little difference in terms of design between the standard iMacs and the Pro. The latter is slightly heavier at 9.7kg, as opposed to the 27-inch iMac's 9.44kg, and the 21-inch model's 5.66kg. Related: iMac 27-inch (2015) There's a hefty metal “lip” on all models of the iMac, including the upcoming Pro, which makes for an instantly recognisable look, and it seems Apple is sticking with that same design for the super-powered variant. When it comes to ports, the Pro has its more humble counterparts beat. The regular iMac range pack a Gigabit Ethernet socket, four USB 3.0s and two Thunderbolt 3 (USB C) ports on the rear, alongside a SDXC card slot and a headphone jack. On the Pro, you'll get all that alongside a further two Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a 10GB Ethernet port – that's 10 times faster than your standard Gigabit Ethernet. Other iMac features that appear on both models include a pair of decent down-firing speakers in the back, and an HD FaceTime 1.2-megapixel camera above the screen for your Skype sessions. Related: 5K iMac 27-inch review New iMac (2017) vs iMac Pro – Display There's a few different display options when it comes to the 2017 iMac range. On the base-level iMac, you'll find a 21.5-inch Full HD screen, while the Retina version packs a 21.5-inch 4K screen and the ability to support up to 4,096 x 2,304 pixels on an external display. And when it comes to the top-end 5K model, you get an impressive 5120x2880 resolution, and the ability to output to two 4096x2160 external displays, or one 5120x2880 dual-cable screen. There's no doubt that 5K iMac is a seriously impressive display. It's calibrated to satisfy the DCI P3 colour standard, used in film production and will generally suit anyone looking for a top-end screen on which to craft the latest filmic masterpiece. So, what does the iMac Pro bring to the table? Well, exactly the same screen as the 5K iMac. There's no added extras here – that mainly comes with the internal hardware. But either way, this is a fantastic screen, so it's no bad thing that Apple has ported its 5K display over to the iMac Pro. What's more, the LCD displays used on all iMacs, except the 21.5-inch model without the Retina display, come with 10-bit colour, with Apple upgrading the entire range with new displays for 2017. There's now 1 billion colours and 500 nits of brightness, making the screens 43% brighter than the previous Mac models. Related: Best desktop PC Surface Studio vs iMac (2017) – Hardware versus Pricing Here's where things really start to diverge. As we mentioned, the iMac Pro is a beast in the hardware department, and it clearly has the edge on even the top-spec standard iMac. First, it's important to note there numerous different iMac configurations when it comes to the standard range. If you go for the top-spec 27-inch iMac you get a quad-core Intel i7 Kaby Lake (4.2GHz), 64GB RAM, 2TB SSD and AMD Radeon Pro 580 graphics with 8GB video memory for £4949. Now, those are some respectable specs that almost rival the Pro's standard setup. For now, however, the Pro's full pricing is yet to be revealed. We know it starts at $4999, which works out to around £3936, but Apple is yet to confirm UK pricing. That said, the standard configuration comes with Intel’s top-end Xeon CPUs with a minimum of eight CPU cores (configurable to 10 or 18 cores), 32GB RAM (configurable to 64 or 128GB), and a 1TB SSD (configurable to 2 or 4TB). That processor will make multi-threaded tasks such as rendering and audio production a breeze, and while the top-spec standard iMac is still somewhat comparable, the graphical capabilities of the Pro put it way over the top. The GPU tech is so cutting-edge, we don’t even know what the exact specification will be. Apple is using AMD’s latest Vega graphics architecture, which is yet to be released, and comes ith 11 teraflops (trillion floating point operations per section) of GPU power. That makes it the most powerful graphics chip ever seen in an all-in-one PC, with 16GB of high-bandwidth memory, and up to 128GB of ultra-reliable error correcting code (ECC) memory. While Apple made a big deal out of the new range of standard iMacs being able to run VR and coming with a big boost to graphics power, the iMac Pro is in another league. Put simply, this thing will run anything you throw at it. All that extra power is accommodated for with a new thermal design which Apple says increases cooling capacity by 80% over the standard iMacs. Good thing too, with all that extra hardware packed inside. Apple’s spec configs are more malleable, but here’s how the whole series pans out: 21in 1080p iMac Starts at £1049/$1099 — 8GB/1TB HDD/Core i5 dual/Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 21in 4k iMac Starts at £1449/$1499 — 8GB/1TB Fusion Drive/Core i5/Radeon Pro 560 with 4GB video memory 27in 5K iMac Starts at £1749/$1799 — 8GB/1TB Fusion Drive/Core i5/Radeon Pro 570 with 4GB video memory Buy Now: 5K iMac 27-inch at Amazon.com from $1,899.99 And here's how the 27-inch iMac stacks up against the iMac Pro: 27-inch iMac iMac Pro Screen 27-inch 5K 27-inch 5K Display Resolution 5120x2880 5120x2880 Camera 1080p FaceTime HD camera 1080p FaceTime HD camera Chipset 3.8GHz quad-core Intel Core i5/4.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 8-core Intel Xeon (10 and 18 core also available) RAM 8/16/32/64GB 32/64/128GB Storage 2/3TB Fusion drive or 512GB/1TB/2TB SSD 1/2/4TB SSD Ports Gigabit Ethernet, four USB 3.0, two Thunderbolt 3 (USB C),SDXC card slot, headphone jack Gigabit Ethernet, four USB 3.0, four Thunderbolt 3 (USB C),SDXC card slot, headphone jack Dimensions 51.6 x 65 x 20.3cm 51.6 x 65 x 20.3cm Weight 9.44kg 9.7kg Software macOS Sierra (upgradeable to High Sierra when it launches) macOS High Sierra New iMac (2017) vs iMac Pro – Included accessories All iMacs models come with Apple's new Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad and Magic Mouse. The only difference between models here is the Pro's accessories come in that flashy new Space Grey finish However, you may also want to get hold of the excellent Magic Trackpad 2, which costs an additional £50/$50. New iMac (2017) vs iMac Pro – Software The iMacs come with macOS Sierra for now, but Apple announced the next iteration, macOS High Sierra, will be launching at the end of June. That means you'll be able to upgrade to the new version when it launches, and the Pro will arrive with High Sierra pre-installed. Sierra introduced a load of new features to macOS, including Siri, but High Sierra promises even more improvements. You'll get better spotlight search and full-screen split-window support in Mail, along with an email library 35% smaller in terms of file size. High Sierra also supports the most common 4K video standard, HEVC (H.265), and brings Metal 2 graphics to the party (that means developers can make use of a new graphics API) along with VR support. It looks to be a decent upgrade to the OS, but we'll have more once we've been able to review it. New iMac (2017) vs iMac Pro – Price and release The new range of 2017 iMacs, complete with Kaby Lake processors, improved screens, and better graphics hardware, is available right now. Once again, there are numerous configurations which affect pricing, but here's a quick guide to the cost: 21in 1080p iMac Starts at £1049/$1099 21in 4k iMac Starts at £1449/$1499 27in 5K iMac Starts at £1749/$1799 The Pro will launch in December and starts at $4999. Again, we're not sure what top-spec models will run you, and UK pricing is yet to be confirmed at this point. New iMac (2017) vs iMac Pro – Summary Design: There's very litlle that separates the Pro from the 27-inch iMac. The only real difference is a Space Grey finish on the former. Oh, and it's a bit heavier. Otherwise, it looks almost identical. Hardware: The top-spec 17-inch iMac is a powerful machine, but the Pro comes with Intel's Xeon chips and AMD’s latest Vega graphics architecture. Put simply, that makes it a monster. Software: Both the standard iMac range and the iMac Pro will run the latest macOS High Sierra. No differences here. Price: Pricing for the iMac Pro will start at $4999 when it launches in December. Beyond that we don't have UK pricing or details on what the top-spec will cost you. The standard iMacs range from £1049 to around £5000 depending on the configuration you go for. There's no doubt the iMac Pro is the better machine. It looks set to be the most capable all-in-one we've ever seen. But for the average user, it's entirely unnecessary. In which case, you're likely to be better off with one of the standard models. However, if you're a pro user looking for the best available, Apple's iMac Pro looks to be the ultimate all-in-one. We'll have more once we've reviewed it.

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Merrill Lynch Stays Bullish on Semiconductors Despite the Sell-Off By Lee Jackson June 12, 2017 8:25 am EDT Print Email Tweet If any area of technology has been white-hot over the past year and more, it has been the semiconductors. Merrill Lynch remains very positive on the top stocks going forward in 2017, despite the recent sell-off that ripped some of the big momentum stocks. In fact, at the recent Merrill Lynch Global Tech Conference, where the firm hosted 16 of the top companies in the industry, the overall tone was extremely positive, as was sentiment, but without prior bubble exuberance. A new research report from Vivek Arya, the firm’s outstanding semiconductor analyst, reviews the information gleaned at the conference and noted three very positive takeaways and trends: Strong demand across autos, industrial, gaming, mobile and data centers. Disciplined/low supply driving extended lead-times in certain cases. Sentiment is positive, but not exuberant as investors are more willing to believe macro trends, but under-appreciate the secular/structural positives in the semiconductor sector. Three companies were highlighted as among the most catalyst rich and having the most estimate upside. All are rated Buy at Merrill Lynch. Broadcom This stock has been on fire over the past year and not only remains a top pick across Wall Street but is also on the Merrill Lynch US 1 list. Broadcom Ltd. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has an extensive semiconductor product portfolio that addresses applications within the wired infrastructure, wireless communications, enterprise storage and industrial end markets. Applications for Broadcom’s products in its end markets include data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecommunications equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems and displays. Top Wall Street analysts like the leadership in the mobile, data center and broadband markets, and especially in the radio frequency (RF) arena. Many on Wall Street see a cyclical rebound in industrial and communications demand. Merrill Lynch sees this company as having the most potential catalysts going forward, and the firm cited the Toshiba resolution, the accretion from the acquisition of Brocade, a boost in the dividend and the 40% growth in iPhone content. Broadcom investors receive a 1.6% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $260. The Wall Street consensus target is $272.65. Shares closed last Friday at $254.53. Intel This leader in semiconductors is working hard to scale away from dependence on personal computers, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a big part of the shift. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) designs, manufactures and sells integrated digital technology platforms worldwide. The company’s platforms are used in various computing applications comprising notebooks, two-in-one systems, desktops, servers, tablets, smartphones, wireless and wired connectivity products, wearables, retail devices and manufacturing devices, as well as for retail, transportation, industrial, buildings, home use and other market segments. Earlier this year, Intel announced the purchase of Mobileye for $15.3 billion. The Israel sensor company gives the chip giant a leg up in the autonomous car competition, and it also adds many other capabilities. While some say the valuation paid is high, the dividends down the road could be worth the price. The analysts note that while the stock is a more controversial pick, benefits from the Purley server launch, which is expected in July, and the fact that Intel should be able to reaccelerate data center growth are positives investors need to focus on. Intel investors receive a 3% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $42 price objective, while the consensus target price is $39.90. The stock closed on Friday at $36.26. NVIDIA This top chip stock has reported very strong earnings, and it was the top performing stock in the S&P 500 last year. NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) is one of the leaders when it comes to supplying graphics processing technology for the 3D graphics market, including desktop graphics processors and gaming consoles. NVIDIA is also moving into visual computing chips for cars, mobile devices and supercomputers. The company has been able to use its ability to leverage past investments, with a more controlled spending structure ahead on unified, which enables strong cash flow that is allowing a focus on capital return, which is currently estimated to be $1 billion next year. Top Wall Street analysts feel the stock is maturing to a platform company from a pure chip company, and Jefferies sees the stock continuing to benefit from four secular trends: virtual reality, PC gaming, chips in the automobile industry and graphic processing units (GPUs) in the cloud. They also feel the stock has the most potential upside. The company posted gigantic first-quarter results that well exceeded Wall Street estimates, with much of the gains directly from the firm’s huge data center and AI business. NVIDIA reported net income that more than doubled. Investors receive a 0.55% dividend. The $185 Merrill Lynch price target compares with the consensus price target of $125.59. Shares closed Friday at $164.89.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print SESSIONS TO TESTIFY TUESDAY – Dems fighting over top Judiciary spot – CONSERVATIVES THREATEN OBAMACARE REVOLT – Polis running for governor 06/12/2017 08:04 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) THE SENATE IS IN SESSION(S) — Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday as part of its ongoing probe into connections between Russia and the Trump campaign. The big question is whether Sessions’ hearing will be open or closed. Several senators are concerned Sessions is trying to avoid testifying in public, CNN reports, and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent a letter to Intel leaders Sunday calling for an open hearing. But GOP leaders are desperately trying to notch some legislative wins and another big public hearing after James Comey testified last week could again scuttle Republicans’ entire messaging agenda this week. Story Continued Below What to expect tomorrow: “If this is an open session — it is still unclear at this point, but Senate aides believe it will be public — Sessions will likely face a barrage of questions over his role in Comey’s dismissal, his independence from President Donald Trump, and allegations of additional unreported meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak,” Kyle reports. Sessions’ Intel appearance comes in lieu of his planned testimony before the House and Senate Appropriations committees on DOJ's budget. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will testify on the funding request instead. Much more: http://politi.co/2rm8DXk I’M NOT GOING THERE — Republicans making the Sunday show rounds notably did not join efforts to discredit Comey’s testimony, something President Donald Trump and his allies have been working at, even before the ousted FBI director testified Thursday. Instead, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she’d “be fine” with issuing a subpoena for tapes the president suggested he made of his conversations with Comey if the White House continues to refuse to say if the recordings exist. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Trump may “go down” because he can’t stop talking inappropriately about an investigation that would clear him. And Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) called Trump’s interactions with Comey “very inappropriate.” Kyle with the roundup: http://politi.co/2rmyLRZ ROUND ONE, FIGHT — House Democrats are already battling over who will be their next leader on the powerful Judiciary Committee, even though current ranking member John Conyers (D-Mich.), dean of the House, hasn’t said he plans on stepping aside. In a letter late last week, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) fired off a warning to New York Rep. Jerry Nadler, the committee’s No.2 Democrat, that she too would be interested in the job if and when Conyers steps down. To some Democrats, Nadler already serves as the unofficial ranking member given Conyers, at 88, is not as robust as he used to be. But Lofgren, an ally of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), is also widely respected in the caucus and could make a competitive run for the seat. Worth watching: “Whoever is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee is a critical issue. Many Democrats believe they have a good chance of taking back the House in November 2018, and the Judiciary panel would be a key battleground for taking on President Donald Trump if Democrats are in the majority in the next Congress,” Margaret Harding McGill and Bres report this morning.

Help empower the states and bring the fans what they want! ** DON’T FRET, TUESDAY IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. Welcome to Monday, June 12. Thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. Your host is happy to be back navigating another hectic week after a fun weekend visiting with a friend who's moving overseas. FRIDAY’S MOST READ: Rep. Mark Meadow’s photo of pal Rep. Trey Gowdy’s interesting fashion choices (re: a bucket hat and pink shorts, to start) got all the clicks. TO RUSSIA, WITH LOVE — Senators are hoping to vote this week on a bipartisan proposal to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election. Democrats want to see a plan that would give Congress the power to block any attempt by Trump to ease current sanctions against the Kremlin. But it’s unclear if a majority of Republicans are willing to go that far, publicly rebuking the president. Whatever deal emerges, some senators were clear over the weekend that Trump should sign it or face a possible veto override. "If the president doesn't sign the bill to punish Russia, he would be betraying democracy,” GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said. Elana with more: http://politi.co/2rmaBXG CONSERVATIVES THREATEN HEALTH CARE REVOLT — Conservative senators and allied outside groups are threatening to jump ship on the Senate’s efforts to repeal Obamacare as the GOP plan continues to tilt toward the party’s more moderate members. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said Sunday he has “grave concerns about what we’re doing so far.” Losing Lee and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who aides increasingly think will oppose the plan, “would be a major blow that would allow Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell no further defections in his 52-senator majority,” Burgess reports. Much more: http://politi.co/2rmHpQl POLIS JOINS CROWDED GOV RACE — Democratic Rep. Jared Polis will run for governor of Colorado, he announced Sunday, joining a crowded race that already includes one of his House Democratic colleagues. “With both Polis and [Rep. Ed] Perlmutter in the race, the only House Democrat from Colorado not running for governor in 2018 is U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver,” Mark Matthews reports for the Denver Post. Read more: http://dpo.st/2rm62ga WHAT’S NEXT FOR DEMOCRATS? The party is facing an ever-widening gulf between the party’s progressives, who are calling on leaders to go all-in on a liberal platform heading into 2018 (health care for all, impeach Trump, etc.), and the more moderate wing, which insists the road back to the majority runs through conservative-leaning districts. “The growing tension between the party’s ascendant militant wing and Democrats competing in conservative-leaning terrain, was on vivid, split-screen display over the weekend,” Alex Burns and Jonathan Martin report for the New York Times. “In Chicago, Senator Bernie Sanders led a revival-style meeting of his progressive devotees, while in Atlanta, Democrats made a final push to seize a traditionally Republican congressional district. It may be essential for Democrats to reconcile the party’s two clashing impulses if they are to retake the House of Representatives in 2018.” More: http://nyti.ms/2rmeJH6 YOU CAN CALL ME ON MY FLIP PHONE — When the president calls, you answer— even if you’re mid-workout as Sen. Lindsey Graham was last week when Trump gave him a ring to vent about the ongoing Russia investigation. The buddy-to-buddy chat is a far cry from the pair’s relationship two years ago, when Graham called Trump a “jackass” on the campaign trail and Trump then announced the senator’s cell phone number to the world on national TV. Emma Dumain reports for the Post and Courier: http://bit.ly/2rmfW1q A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIEND — Trump raised more than $800,000 for Rep. Tom MacArthur Sunday night, the New Jersey Republican credited with successfully reviving House efforts to repeal Obamacare. “The fundraiser, at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, was the first personal fundraiser Trump has held for a House incumbent. About 100 people were in attendance, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie,” Katie Jennings reports. Notably, press weren’t allowed into the fundraiser, not even for Trump’s opening remarks. More: http://politi.co/2rmyL4j IS ROMNEY IN OR OUT? Mitt Romney has refused to rule out a Senate bid next year, most recently at his annual donor gathering over the weekend. “On Friday night, in a private appearance with former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrat raised eyebrows when he told Romney he should consider running for Senate,” Alex Isenstadt reports. “Romney, who has refused to quash persistent speculation he might seek Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch’s seat should he forgo seeking reelection, did not push back at the suggestion, said two people who witnessed the exchange between the two former rivals.” More on Romney’s return to the spotlight: http://politi.co/2rmCPSp POLITICO's INAUGURAL "WOMEN RULE” INVESTIGATION — Not only did women not break the glass ceiling in 2016 —they stalled at just 20 percent in Congress, and less than one-quarter of elected offices nation-wide. Why does a persistent gap in women’s interest in running for office continue—even as political activism among women has heated up since the election? Over the course of several months, POLITICO conducted over 50 interviews with candidates, elected officials, researchers, wavering candidates and political operatives and found that the swell of female political activism does not translate to future candidacies. To change things, recruiters must start earlier in a woman’s life for her to consider running, school boards are the best starting place, and the sales pitch to get women to run for office must change.

Our coalition, comprised of members from across the political spectrum, advocates for repealing this 25-year-ban and shutting down the $150 billion illegal sports betting market. It’s time to empower law enforcement with the tools they need to put an end to illegal gambling and give the fans what they want. Sports betting is only becoming more popular; fifty million Americans bet on the Super Bowl this year. A majority of Americans support lifting the ban and legalizing it will generate tax revenue and create jobs. A legal sports betting market would create an estimated $30 billion in economic output. The need for change is clear, help overturn this failed ban. ** « View Archives This story tagged under: Congress Most Read Huddle - POLITICO Archive Thursday, 6/15/17 Wednesday, 6/14/17 Tuesday, 6/13/17 Monday, 6/12/17 Friday, 6/9/17 View the Full Huddle Archives » Politico Magazine Brooklyn’s Latest Craze: Making Your Own Electric Grid By Debra Bruno How Congress Failed to Plan for Doomsday By Garrett M.

The company also announced timing for the new Intel Core X-series processor family which is claimed to be Intel's most powerful, scalable and accessible high-end desktop processor family. At the top of the stack is the new Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor, the first consumer desktop processor with 18 cores and 36 threads of power to handle heavy gaming, VR and content creation. "Intel's heritage in gaming has been built around technical innovation that brings to life amazing experiences and it's also an area where we want to keeping pushing the limits of what's possible with our technology," Gregory Bryant, Senior Vice President at Intel Corp, said in a statement. At the expo, Intel and e-sports company ESL announced they are expanding their 15-year partnership to further advance the worldwide growth and development of e-sports. In addition, Intel announced several partnerships and investments to accelerate pro-competitive VR gaming (VR e-sports) and to help accelerate the global growth of e-sports, including partnerships with Oculus and Ready At Dawn Studios. "From giving the world its first look at our upcoming Intel Core i9 Extreme Edition processor to accelerating e-sports and the future of VR e-sports, we're excited to be part of one of the strongest PC gaming showcases at E3 in recent years," said Bryant. --IANS tony/na/mr SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Digital India 'Digital India' or the doomsday device!

The ninth generation Intel Core processors, codenamed Cannon Lake are "on track" said the chipmaker. It added that its second generation of 10nm CPUs, code named Ice Lake have been taped out - that's a significant milestone. In follow up Tweets Intel claimed that it "continues to lead in 10nm technology," and that it is "a full generation ahead of others" with its 10nm technology. Mobile chipmakers, for example, might not agree with either assertion though. Ahead of any of the above 10nm CPUs, Intel is readying its Coffee Lake 14nm CPUs which will add the first 6C/12T configurations to its mainstream consumer desktop lineup. Later on, Cannon Lake will essentially be a die shrink of Coffee Lake. 40 years of x86 processors Intel is marking the 40th anniversary of the launch of the 8086 CPU, which powered the first IBM Personal Computer. Over that time there have been many refinements to the CPU architecture with Intel making special mention of the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions. Particularly successful additions to the ISA were MMX multimedia enhancement technology in 1996, and SSE and SSSE2/3/4 instructions to accelerate media, imaging and 3D workloads. Of course multiple iterations of AVX were added from 2011 onwards to boost data crunching apps too. Intel to sue or obstruct Qualcomm? Towards the end of the above 40th anniversary post, Intel hints that it doesn't take lightly to people infringing upon its x86 architecture. It protects its investments with "a deep and dynamic patent portfolio with over 1,600 patents worldwide relating to instruction set implementations". The Intel blog post authors specifically mention that recently there "have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel’s proprietary x86 ISA without Intel’s authorization." It reckons that the emulation (surely the Qualcomm / Microsoft partnership leveraging the Snapdragon 835 and Windows 10) will eventually hit a sticky wicket like Transmeta, UMC, Cyrix, and others before them. So it will be interesting to see if the previously touted 'cellular PCs' will ever reach retail.

Too bad those were created by AMD. :P Posted by DanceswithUnix - Mon 12 Jun 2017 13:07 Shouldn't they be celebrating 39 years of the 8086, I thought it was available in 1978? Edit: … and it was a piece of crud, released just a year before the lovely 68000, as a stopgap for the even worse i432. I would have thought they would be quiet about that, I don't like to remember those dreadful early x86 machines. Posted by zaph0d - Mon 12 Jun 2017 13:52 I think the fact that they've had a monopoly of the x86 licence for 40 years is probably long enough. If they go to court there's every chance that qualcomm will counter-litigate especially seeing as the x86 patent itself expired 20 years ago. That's why intel keep patenting “New Instructions” they just want to maintain their monopoly of the x86 technology licence.

Windows on ARM-based chips, which run pretty much every mobile device, has been an aspiration across the tech industry for years. For a long time the ‘Wintel’ symbiotic relationship between Microsoft and Intel meant the latter was disinclined to facilitate such a move, but times have changed. At the recent Computex show a few PC vendors announced plans to launch Windows 10 laptops running Qualcomm Snapdragon (ARM-based) processors. While Microsoft seemed to downplay the announcement, such a thing is only possible via a special version of Windows 10 for ARM that incorporates an x86 (Intel’s instruction set) emulator. This is a software layer that allows applications designed to run on x86 use the ARM instruction set instead. A recent blog post in which Intel congratulated itself on 40 years of x86 innovation the company quickly moved to the kind of passive-aggressive language usually reserved for patent litigation. In a section sub-headed ‘Protecting x86 ISA Innovation’, Intel blogged: “Intel invests enormous resources to advance its dynamic x86 ISA, and therefore Intel must protect these investments with a strong patent portfolio and other intellectual property rights.” “However, there have been reports that some companies may try to emulate Intel’s proprietary x86 ISA without Intel’s authorization,” the blog later reflected. It then detailed the saga of a company called Transmeta that tried a similar trick around the time of the dotcom bubble (it was one of the defining IPOs of that era), only to be swatted into bankruptcy by Intel’s lawyers. The message is neither ambiguous not subtle – don’t mess with x86. “Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel’s x86 ISA will meet a different fate,” concludes the blog, portentously. “…we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel’s intellectual property rights.” The final sentiments are the usual intellectual property stuff about how it’s only by fanatical imposition of its IP right that is can scrape together the cash to innovate and how people should invent their own stuff. Microsoft, which still makes a lot of money from the Wintel paradigm, is still keeping a low profile on this topic, although it must be assumed that it doesn’t think Windows 10 for ARM has broken any laws. Qualcomm, however, has commented but, as ever, hasn’t really said anything. “Given our recent announcement with ASUS, HP and Lenovo, we found the blog that one of our competitors published on June 8 very interesting,” said the Qualcomm statement. “We look forward to the launch of the always connected Windows 10 PC powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC Platform later this year.” There was a sentence or two more on how great these PCs will be but no further attempt to address the emulation issue at all.

Just 3 Months In, AMD’s Ryzen Is Already Shaking Up PC Gaming We haven’t seen a real battle over performance and value in the CPU market in ages, but Ryzen is changing that. Over the last decade, PC gamers deciding what should be in their systems have had to answer only one question: Which Intel processor should I go with? Frankly, it has been that long since AMD mounted a serious challenge to Intel for the heart of gaming PCs. The decade-long march of Intel's performance dominance has given it an 80 percent market share among gamers. Now, with AMD's new Ryzen processors, everything is changing. Ryzen is not the fastest gaming processor you can buy. It's not even the fastest gaming CPU for the price. But it's close, and it's markedly faster than anything Intel has to offer at a similar price for everything outside of gaming, like video editing, or encrypting and compressing your files. This makes Ryzen a great buy, and while it may take years for AMD to claw back all that market share, the unexpectedly great Ryzen processors are already changing the enthusiast PC landscape. The years when PC enthusiasts could safely ignore AMD CPUs are over. It's all about cores and threads With the exception of extremely expensive high-end workstation-class parts, performance-minded consumers have been stuck primarily using quad-core CPUs for ten years. Intel keeps making the cores faster, but improving the performance of a single core is really tough and expensive. Adding more cores is, by comparison, cheap. All the Ryzen 7 series CPUs feature 8 cores with 16 threads, and cost between $300 and $500. (A thread is a sequence of related instructions, and many modern PC CPUs can manage two threads on each core, to more fully utilize that core's capabilities). And you can get a 6-core, 12-thread Ryzen 5 for less than $250. Intel's 6-core processors cost at least double, with more expensive motherboards. This is a significant shift. The most demanding PC tasks—video editing, encryption, CAD, 3D rendering—perform better as you throw more cores at them. Yet games haven't really followed the trend. Most of the tools, middleware, and game engines are optimized for 4 cores and 8 threads at most, and are tuned to Intel's architecture in particular. And why not, if gamers are overwhelmingly buying quad-core Intel chips? Ryzen has already proven fast enough and popular enough in its early days to start to change that. For games to run great on Ryzen, they are going to need to run well on lots of cores and threads, and be optimized for AMD's new architecture. That sort of optimization is now taking place, and will eventually filter out through the game development ecosystem. And that's even good for Intel fans, because Intel can more easily make bigger jumps in performance by adding cores than by making each core faster. Games that make good use of lots of cores will be good for everyone. Gamers don't just play games Yes, if you want to do nothing but run a game as fast as possible, you're still better off with a Core i5 or i7 processor. At comparable price points, Intel's latest CPUs deliver somewhat higher frame rates than the new Ryzen chips do. Fewer but faster cores are just better for games right now (though that should change over time). At low resolutions, the Intel advantage is significant, and it trails off as you run games at higher resolutions and detail settings (because the graphics card becomes the performance bottleneck). But PC gamers don't just play games anymore. They play games while simultaneously surfing the web for hints and cheats. They stream gameplay to Twitch or Mixer with sophisticated broadcasting software that superimposes their webcam shot over the game, while keeping one eye on a chat window. They edit videos for their YouTube gaming channels. The whole "gamers as content creators" phenomenon is so big now that streaming is built right into Windows 10, Playstation, and Xbox consoles. Image: AMD With Ryzen, AMD asks gamers to be satisfied with "really good" gaming performance that isn't quite as fast as the similarly-priced Intel chip, while delivering way better performance when doing all that other stuff. It's a tradeoff that increasingly looks like a really good deal. Oh, and Ryzen's doing all this with lower power consumption and cooler temperatures, too. Real competition benefits everyone At the start of the year, Intel released its best gaming CPU yet, the first in its 7th generation desktop processor family: the Core i7 7700K. It's a great chip for gaming, because it has high clock speeds, but it's not really all that different from what came before. Reviews featured headlines that asked, "Is the desktop CPU dead?" Weeks later, on the verge of Ryzen's release, Intel dramatically slashed prices on a whole bunch of CPUs. Coincidence? Of course not. Image: Microcenter/Tweaktown Now, AMD is readying it's Ryzen Threadripper CPUs (yes, that's really the name) for launch later this summer. These are really high-end processors aimed at performance enthusiasts, with up to 16 cores and 32 threads. It goes along with a new platform that gives you quad-channel memory and 64 PCI Express lanes (the current Ryzen platform offers only dual-channel memory and 40 PCI Express lanes). That means double the memory bandwidth and all the I/O bandwidth necessary to fully make use of multiple graphics cards, solid state drives, and other expansion cards. It's a freaking monster. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but it's expected to be under $1,000 (about double the 8-core Ryzen 7 parts). Intel's biggest consumer CPU right now is the Core i7-6950X, which only has 10 cores and costs a whopping $1800. How long do you think that sort of pricing is going to last? In fact, Intel has announced a bunch of new processors under the "Core i9" banner, going all the way up to 18 cores and 36 threads! Only, that particular model won't be released for a while, and it plugs into a new type of CPU socket that means buying all new motherboards, and the thermals are really high, and… well it's painfully obvious to everyone who watches enthusiast PC hardware that these new processors are a direct response to AMD's Ryzen Threadripper. No matter who comes out on top, it's safe to say that Intel would still be pushing high-priced quad core CPUs at gamers and enthusiasts if it weren't for AMD. It has barely been three months since Ryzen hit the shelves and we're already seeing price drops and new products from Intel in response. The Ryzen story has barely begun, and it's already having an impact. From an increased focus on multi-threaded games and multitasking, to lower prices, and the introduction of powerful new high-end hardware. And that's why you should get to know AMD's Ryzen. Even if you're an avid Intel fan, you should hope that AMD keeps delivering real performance and value like this for years. If the boring desktop CPU market got this exciting in just a few months, just imagine what a couple years of serious competition could do.

And if you’re desperate for one, here’s some great news: Some Core i9 preorders begin the week of June 19, with the remainder launching through October. Just weeks after AMD disclosed its massive 16-core, 32-thread Threadripper chip, Intel dropped its bomb: The Core i9 family will have up to 18 cores and 36 threads, making them possibly the most powerful consumer PC chips ever made. Read on for the speeds, feeds, and prices of the new Core i9 chips, and all the details we have on the underlying technologies. Also, stay tuned for more information: We haven’t had a chance to test the new Core i9 chips yet, and the availability and pricing of the associated X299 motherboards remain unknown. We’ll update this post with new information and testing as we get it. Intel Intel’s Core family now has a new member: Core i9. The latest news At the PC Gaming show at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) on June 12, Intel senior vice president Gregory Bryant announced that Intel would begin taking preorders for the Core i7 X-series chips and the 10-core Core i9 7900X the week of June 20. Intel will launch the 12-core Core i9-7920X, the 14-core Core i9-7940X, the 16-core Core i9-7960X, and the 18-core Core i9-7980XE from August through October, with exact dates and pricing to be disclosed later. (Intel confirmed separately that the 12-core i9-7920X will launch in August, and the 18-core Core i9-7980XE in October.) Pricing and release date Unfortunately, all that performance comes at a hefty price. Note that Intel hasn’t released the clock speeds of all of the Core i9 family yet. They’re all unlocked, though—ready and waiting to be overclocked. Here’s a summary of what speeds and prices of the Core i9 chips we do know, including clock speeds where available. Core i9 Extreme Edition: Core i9-7980XE: 18 cores/36 threads, $1,999  Core i9: Core i9-7960X: 16 cores/32 threads, $1,699 Core i9-7940X: 14 cores/28 threads, $1,399 Core i9-7920X: 12 cores/24 threads, $1,199 Core i9-7900X (3.3GHz): 10 cores/20 threads, $999  Core i7:  Core i7 7820X (3.6GHZ), 8 cores/16 threads, $599 Core i7-7800X (3.5GHz), 6 cores/12 threads, $389 Core i7-7740X (4.3GHz), 4 cores/8 threads, $339   Core i5: Core i5-7640X (4.0 GHz), 4 cores, 4 threads, $242 Intel Intel still hasn’t provided all of the details for all of its new chips, but here’s the latest, official word. At this point, we don’t know exactly when the new Core i9 family will ship—or whether all of the chips will ship at once, or be staggered over time. We do know that you’ll be able to preorder the Core i7 X-series chips and the 10-core Core i9 7900X the week of June 20. We also know that the 12-core i9-7920X will launch in August, and the 18-core Core i9-7980XE in October. Frequently asked questions What is Core i9? On May 30 at Computex, Intel formally announced the Core i9 high-end chips for PC enthusiasts. You may also see these chips referred to as the Skylake-X family, the X-series of chips, or by their code name, “Basin Falls.”  When can I get Core i9? Intel hasn’t said yet when Core i9 will ship. We do know that you’ll be able to preorder the Core i7 X-series chips and the 10-core Core i9 7900X the week of June 20. Intel confirmed separately that the 12-core i9-7920X will launch in August, and the 18-core Core i9-7980XE in October. Who should buy Core i9?  As you might guess from the prices, these chips aren’t for everyone. You don’t remotely need 18 cores and 36 threads unless you’re doing resource-intensive multitasking, such as video or gaming.  How much will Core i9 cost?  The least-expensive Core i9 chip will be the Core i5-7640X, at $242. The Core i7 chips will range from $339 to $599. The Core i9 chips will be priced from $999 to $1699. The most expensive will be the Extreme Edition (Core i9-7980XE) for $1,999.   Where does Core i9 fit into the Intel Core family?  Core i9 is Intel’s fifth PC processor family, starting with the Core m and moving up through the traditional Core i3, i5, and i7 chips to Core i9. As the numerical sequencing suggests, Core i9 represents Intel’s most prestigious chip family, offering the best performance at the highest price.  It’s important to know that Core i9 is an architecture as well as a brand. Intel has taken some of these new chips and named them Core i7 and even Core i5. Though they share some common features with the Core i9 (more on that later), two of the new chips, the Core i7-7740X and the Core i5-7640X, are based on Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake architecture (rather than 6th-generation Skylake). These two chips, with only four cores apiece, are the most modestly priced members of the Core i9 family. How does Core i9 relate to Broadwell-E? Core i9 succeeds Broadwell-E as Intel’s supreme, enthusiast desktop chip family.  At the top of the heap sits Core i9 Extreme Edition, part of the Core i9 family, but a supercharged subset of its own. Right now, it’s just a single chip: the Core i9 Extreme Edition i9-7980XE.  Will I need a new motherboard for Core i9? Yes. All Core i9 CPUs will use a new Socket R4, a 2,066-pin LGA socket that will require a brand-new motherboard. Intel’s Core i9 family is not backward-compatible with existing Skylake or Kaby Lake motherboards. PCWorld’s review (forthcoming) Intel hasn’t formally released the Core i9 family yet, but we plan to test it as soon as it’s available. Intel has said that the new chips will be 15 percent faster than last-generation Broadwell-E chips in single-threaded apps and 10 percent faster in multithreaded tasks. We’ll test that claim and let you know. Basic specs: Clock speed, core count, prices, socket, ship date The processor specs that matter most concern performance. The raw clock speed determines how fast any one thread can be acted upon, while the core and thread counts control how many threads or tasks can be calculated in parallel. The Core i9 series excels in these metrics. Unfortunately, you’ll pay a hefty premium for that talent.  The new chips will consume 112W or 140W (depending on the chip), requiring a liquid-cooling solution. Intel has said there will be a 165W chip, too, but the company hasn’t specifically identified it. We’re guessing it will be the Core i9-7980XE. More importantly, they’ll all use a new Socket R4, a 2,066-pin LGA socket that will require a brand-new motherboard. Intel’s Core i9 family is not backward-compatible with existing Skylake or Kaby Lake motherboards. Video coverage The Full Nerd team discusses what the Core i9 could mean for you, especially with Threadripper also coming down the pike: You can get a taste of Core i9’s innovations in this video. Stay tuned for our review video after we have a chance to test the chip. Here’s Intel’s PC chip chief, Gregory Bryant, announcing the Core i9 preorders: New features: Why you’ll want to buy a Core i9 In addition to just the raw performance, the Core i9 family includes something new. In its earlier Broadwell-E chips, Intel included something called Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, which identified one “best core” among all of the available cores on a chip. If and when the chip needed to be boosted, that best core would be the one selected to be dynamically overclocked. The new feature within most of the Core i9 chips is what Intel calls an updated Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0,  where the chip identifies not just one, but two cores as the best cores. While the Core i9 can turn this feature on when needed, it will be used to best advantage when playing games with multiple threads, or performing simultaneous tasks like game streaming and music playback. This feature is not available in the lower-end Core i9 chips, though—only from the Core i7 7820X (8 cores, 16 threads), on up through the 7900X, 7920X, 7940X, 7960X, and 7980XE. Intel Here’s what differentiates Intel’s new X299 chipset from its older rivals. Not everything new about Core i9 is found within the chip itself. The related X299 chipset provides up to 24 PCI Express 3.0 lanes vs. the 8 PCIe lanes of Broadwell-E’s X99 chipset—important if you want to power your Core i9 system with multiple graphics cards. Additional PCIe lanes for high-speed PCIe NVMe drives can also be plumbed directly into the PCIe coming from the CPU itself. On CPUs with 10 cores and up, a full 44 lanes of PCIe 3.0 lanes are available for use. All this enables a range of options: Do you want to run four x8 graphics cards in a single Intel-powered PC? If so, you’ll want a Core i9 system. The X299 chipset supports up to eight SATA 3.0 ports and 10 USB 3.0 ports. Finally, owning a Core i9 with an X299 motherboard means you’ll have access to Optane, Intel’s caching drive technology that can accelerate frequently used data. Overclocking options Intel’s Core i9 is tailor-made for overclocking, as the entire family comes unlocked. Intel doesn’t recommend that you cool a Core i9 chip with air alone, though, so a straight fan-based solution is out. Instead, Intel recommends its own TS13X liquid-cooling solution, which will be sold separately. You can also buy your own third-party cooling solutions, as long as it’s rated for the TS13X. The TS13X uses a solution of propylene glycol to pump the heat to a 73.84-CFM fan that generates between 21 and 35 dBA, rotating between 800rpm and 2,200rpm. The TS13X will cost from $85 to $100. Intel Intel recommends liquid cooling for its Core i9 parts. Intel will maintain support for per-core overclocking and per-core voltage adjustments, using its own Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU). New controllable features for overclocking include AVX 512 ratio offsets, trim voltage control of the memory control, and PEG/DMI overclocking.  Intel will also offer what it calls its “performance tuning protection plan,” a sort of insurance policy for overclockers. It’s a one-strike policy: The company will let you fry your chip once, just once, and send you a replacement.  Intel X299 chipset: What’s included Right now, there’s but a single chipset to accompany the Core i9: the X299. As mentioned above, the new chipset uses Socket R4, a 2,066-pin LGA socket that will require a brand-new motherboard. Intel’s Core i9 family is not backward-compatible with existing Skylake or Kaby Lake motherboards. With the exception of the two Kaby Lake-based quad-core chips, the X299 chipset also provides the following features: Intel’s improved Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, on the Core i7-7820X and above Up to 44 lanes of PCI Express (enabling two x16 or four x8 graphics cards) Quad-channel DDR4 2666 memory 140W support Some of Intel’s cheaper chips can only take advantage of a subset of these, though. The Core i7-7800X (6 cores, 12 threads) and Core i7-7820X (8 cores, 16 threads) rest on an intermediary rung where only 28 PCIe lanes total are available. For the two quad-core Kaby Lake based chips (the Core i5-7640X and Core i7-7740X) , the X299 provides a slightly different feature set: No Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 16 PCI Express lanes (for one x16 or two x8 cards) Two-channel DDR4 2666 112W support All of the various X299 chipset implementations support up to eight SATA 3.0 ports and 10 USB 3.0 ports.  There are two other under-the-hood improvements. By moving to Intel’s latest DMI 3.0 interface between the Core i9 and the X299, bandwidth is essentially doubled, allowing for the extra ports and PCIe lanes. Intel also moved to a different cache scheme that puts a smaller amount of cache closer to each individual core. You probably won’t see any overt signs of either in your day-to-day compute tasks, but those upgrades may show up in the benchmarks. Core i9/X299 motherboards Remember that for now, every Core i9 motherboard you’ll buy is based on the Socket R4, a 2,066-pin LGA socket that’s incompatible with some of the older Core i5 and Core i7 microprocessors. (The Core i5-7640X, Core i7-7740X, Core i7-7800X, and Core i7-7820X all use the new 2,066-pin socket, too.) All of the new motherboards are based on Intel’s X299 chipset, the only chipset for the Intel Core i9 right now. Asus The ASUS TUF motherboard, using Intel’s X299 chipset. We have some details on the Core i9 motherboards that have been announced, from Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, ASRock, and EVGA. We don’t know any prices or ship dates, but don’t expect them to come cheap.  Some of the brands and families include: Asus Prime Asus TUF Asus ROG ASRock EVGA Gigabyte Aorus MSI The competition: AMD’s Threadripper For much of the last decade, Intel dominated high-end PC computing, and rival AMD struggled to keep up. That’s changing. AMD debuted its Ryzen processor to global acclaim, though the company’s performance claims came under some scrutiny. More recently, the company came out with its own version of the Core i9: Threadripper.  IDG/Gordon Mah Ung Intel’s Core i9 may be ready for liftoff, but AMD’s Threadripper is waiting to take it down. (An unrelated AMD mobile chip is on the right.) Right now, Threadripper lags slightly behind Core i9 in core count: 16 cores, 32 threads, compared to the Core i9-7980XL’s 18 cores and 36 threads. AMD’s traditional lever, though, is price. While Intel is asking enthusiasts to pay through the nose for Core i9 chips, AMD hasn’t yet disclosed all of its Threadripper prices. That’s an enormous consideration when buying a chip like the Core i9: What’s its value proposition, and is it better than the competition? We’ll keep you updated as more Core i9 news comes out, and we’ll let you know when we post our review.  Updated on June 12 at 10:04 AM with additional Core i9 preorder details and launch dates.

Intel is reacting in a scared fashion as I said months and months ago now, throwing out its 18C/36T processor at Computex 2017 without any details, a gimped X299 chipset compared to the ThreadRipper ready X399 chipset from AMD which has 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes compared to just 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes on X299.   The new Cannon Lake CPUs will be a die shrink of the Coffee Lake chips, so don't expect huge things from it, apart from lowered TDP and possibly higher clocks. Ice Lake will be the bigger one, something like the upgrade from Broadwell to Skylake, and is expected in 2H 2018.

So far, there have been talks about what to expect from the phone’s A11 ARM chip in comparison to the A10X Fusion. Right now, the new iPad Pro is the first to showcase just how powerful the new chip really is. A couple of benchmarks on the A10X Fusion gave consumers an idea of what to expect when the iPhone 8 arrives. Power-packed A11 ARM SoC Early last week, Apple fans witness power in the making with the new GeekBench benchmark results for the A10X Fusion ARM chip from Apple. The new chip, which is used on the new iPad Pro, offers massive improvements compared to the previous iteration. On the single processing benchmark, the chip managed to outstrip even Intel’s Core m7 processor by a certain degree. However, it is with the multicore processing where the A10X Fusion chip really shines. The device under test managed to achieve an impressive score worthy of accolades. The score of 9091 is about 60 percent better than the current iPhone 7 smartphones in the market. GeekBench scores for iPad Pro’s A10X Fusion chip (via primatelabs.com) If Apple finally decides to cram a total of eight cores inside the A11 chip, consumers could be looking at really impressive performance from the iPhone 8. New iOS renders with iPhone 8 iDrop News has been known in releasing unofficial renders of upcoming mobile phones. Its latest render now shows the iPhone 8 with official screen captures from iOS 11. On the said renders, one can see the mockup iPhone 8 with some iOS 11 apps. Also present is the in-display-mounted Touch ID sensor since one of the images shows the phone’s rear without any fingerprint scanning hardware. As suggested by many rumors in the past, the new renders still continue with the vertical dual camera assembly at the back. Also from the renders, it seems like the new iPhone will be covered in glass. It is still rather too soon to say whether the new renders will really represent Apple’s tenth anniversary phone. So far, much of it was done as guesswork and through various leaked schematics. New iPhone 8 renders with iOS 11 via idropnews.com) Component mass production started According to Digitimes, Samsung has already started mass producing OLED panels for Apple’s upcoming iPhone models. The company is expected to ship around 30 million 4.7- and 5.5-inch panels for the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Meanwhile, supply chain rumors claim that Apple has ordered 80 million 5.8-inch OLED panels to be used on the iPhone 8. The report from Digitimes also claimed that the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus will both have glass panels for front and back and an aluminum frame. On the other hand, instead of aluminum, the iPhone 8 will have a steel frame. No Gigabit LTE Finally, Bloomberg reported a few days ago that this year’s iPhones may not have Gigabit LTE when released. According to the report, this is pretty much due to the current spat between Qualcomm and Apple about patent royalties. Print to this, there were reports that Apple is beginning to favor Intel as the majority provider for future iOS devices. For this year alone, Apple is said to increase order volumes to 50 percent in favor of Intel, as reported by Digitimes. Starting next year, Intel may expect to see around 70 percent of overall wireless modem orders from Apple for future iPhones and iPads. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is slowly losing out on possible revenue from Apple due to the current lawsuit that both companies have on each other.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Apple Inc.'s iPhone 8 Won't Support Gigabit LTE One Fool doubts that this omission will noticeably affect iPhone sales in this coming product cycle. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 11, 2017 at 6:30PM A June 9 report from Bloomberg says Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone models won't support 1-gigabit-per-second download speeds. The report notes that Apple will again look to both Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to supply the cellular modems for the next-generation iPhone models, as it does for the current iPhone 7-series smartphones. As Bloomberg points out, Qualcomm currently sells a cellular modem capable of 1-gigabit-per-second download speeds -- the Snapdragon X16 -- but Intel doesn't. Intel's upcoming XMM 7480, which Apple will probably use this year, supports only 450 megabits per second. As a result, Bloomberg says, Apple will hold back the capabilities of the Qualcomm-powered devices to match those of the Intel-powered devices.  Image source: Apple. In other words, it's the same thing we saw happen with the iPhone 7-series: The Qualcomm modem used in those phones supported higher download and upload speeds than what the Intel modems could achieve, so the Qualcomm modems were held back. Is this a problem for Apple? I don't think so, and here's why. Carriers not happy, but it probably won't hurt Apple Bloomberg says Apple's decision to dual-source modems "clashes with the marketing plans of a cellular industry desperate to show off faster network speeds to grab market share." The report also says the new iPhone models could "look even less speedy compared to newer gigabit-ready smartphones from other manufacturers." While it's true that other smartphone manufacturers will be able to boast of gigabit wireless capabilities in their phones and could even use it as a marketing weapon against Apple, I'm not convinced that this will have a significant negative impact on iPhone sales in the coming product cycle. I wouldn't be surprised if Qualcomm stoked the flames behind the scenes as well. The iPhone 6-series smartphones -- Apple's most successful iPhones to date -- lagged the competition in terms of cellular capabilities. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus had modems that were capable of only 150-megabit-per-second download speeds, and those phones did very well in the marketplace against phones with modems that boasted 300-megabit speeds. Of course, higher peak download capabilities are marketable features, but compared to things such as the camera, industrial design, operating-system capabilities, and battery life, paper specifications about download speeds that typical customers on most networks are probably never going to see just aren't that important. This "problem" becomes a tailwind in 2018 When Apple hosts its keynote this year and publishes its marketing materials for the upcoming iPhone, the company should have plenty of features to market while keeping relatively quiet on cellular speeds and feeds. Then, next year, when Intel has its gigabit LTE modem ready and Apple can source gigabit LTE chips from both Qualcomm and Intel, Apple can make a big deal about this new feature and use it -- in conjunction with other feature enhancements -- to try to stimulate demand for its 2018 iPhones.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) for the second time in a week on Tuesday as she pressed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to discuss a policy he cited to avoid answering other questions. “Is that policy in writing somewhere?” Harris asked Sessions during an open session of the committee. “I think so,” Sessions replied. “So did you not consult it before you came before this committee knowing we would ask you questions about that?” she pressed. “Well, we talked about it. The policy is based—” Sessions began. “Did you ask that it would be shown to you?” Harris asked. “The policy is based on the principle that the President—” Sessions began again, before Harris interjected. “Sir, I’m not asking about the principle. I am asking, when you knew you would be asked these questions and you would rely on that policy, did you not ask your staff to show you the policy that would be the basis for you refusing to answer the majority of questions that have been asked to you?” she asked. “Well, I am unable to answer the questions,” Sessions said. “Chairman, the witness should be allowed to answer the question,” Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) interrupted Harris, also for the second time in a week. “Senators will allow the chair to control the hearing,” Burr said. “Senator, let him answer.” After Harris pressed Sessions again for a yes or no answer while Sessions spoke over her again, he said, “The answer is yes, I consulted.” “It was a simple question,” Harris tweeted afterward. It was a simple question. Can Sessions point to the policy, in writing, that allows him to not answer a whole host of our questions today. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) June 13, 2017 Burr cut off Harris’ questions last week as she tried to question Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Harris, the only woman of color on the committee and the former attorney general of California, pressed Rosenstein at the time to give a firm yes or no answer as to whether special counsel Robert Mueller had “full independence” to pursue the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. McCain complained that Harris was not letting Rosenstein answer, and Burr subsequently chastised her and cut her off.

The result could be a product that analyzes infrastructure systems, social networks and cybersecurity defenses with incredible efficiency. © AP Photo/ Kirsty Wigglesworth Catch and Release: Darpa’s Reusable Gremlin Drones to Lower Costs The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) wants contractors to build a non-von-Neumann processor to handle and interpret vast amounts of graphical information for the Hierarchical Identify Verify Exploit (HIVE) program. The goal is to “enable relationships between events to be discovered as they unfold in the field rather than relying on forensic analysis in data centers,” according to an unclassified brief on DARPA’s website. But what exactly can this type of technology do for the Pentagon? It would allow US military statisticians to “make associations previously thought impractical due to the amount of processing required,” the HIVE brief noted. DARPA outlined a few ways the computer processors could be used for DoD purposes. Applications for the technology include cybersecurity, where there are many nodes or vertices in a given network — hence the graphical emphasis for HIVE processors. Social media analysis is another application that could uncover hidden or indirect patterns between members of a terror cell. Lastly, infrastructure monitoring is yet another system of nodes where the failure of one could mean shut down for others, such as the electric grid.  The program seeks to change a fundamental paradigm in computing: Namely, that hardware systems like CPUs (central processing units) and GPUs (graphics processing units) rely on a model that dates back to 1945 called the von Neumann model, named after Hungarian-American genius John von Neumann. When he wasn’t busy developing the architecture ubiquitously used in our computer age, von Neumann contributed to the Manhattan Project, game theory in economics, quantum mechanics and various branches of mathematics. The von-Neumann model requires machines to retrieve data from a server farm in order to analyze it. If the Pentagon’s vision becomes a reality, huge chunks of data will automatically produce “multiple layers of indirect relationships” in real-time, without the need for separate storage. The graphs the Pentagon wants to be able to understand with unprecedented speed and depth are not necessarily simple supply and demand graphs with price on one axis and quantity on the other, or a family tree. Such graphs are easy to draw and visualize.   Instead, Intel said the analytical capability they hope to provide the Pentagon is far more involved. “Many graphs are vast and constantly changing,” Intel said in a Tuesday release. The datasets can be thought of “as the evolving search list of every user on the plane for Amazon sales or Apple iTunes,” for instance. Considering that there are hundreds of millions of users, if not billions, on each of these services, and each user may have 10, or 100, or 10,000 observable data characteristics (sales or songs, type of good, genre of music, etc.) one can get an idea of just how big these data sets can get.  © Photo: Pixabay Pentagon’s DARPA Hopes Bitcoin Technology Can Help Protect Nukes These types of conclusions could be useful for Intel from a commercial standpoint, and indeed the company hopes to roll out products based on the research with DARPA. But for the Pentagon, deciphering huge sets of data could reveal now-unknown or unknowable patterns between seemingly random observations that ultimately could prevent a terror attack, infrastructure failure or massive cyber attack — like when China nabbed 50 terabytes of data from the Pentagon on sensitive projects as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.   ...

He has been covering Microsoft since 2009 back when this site was called WMExperts (and later Windows Phone Central). His interests include Windows, Surface, HoloLens, Xbox, and future computing visions. Follow him on Twitter: @daniel_rubino. The Surface Laptop is a pricey solution to a problem that may not even exist. But it's still a marvelous PC you'll lust over. Microsoft has been setting the bar for PCs and unique form factors for many years with its Surface hardware. That makes the Surface Laptop's existence stranger. Regardless, the company has created a luxurious PC Ultrabook that directly targets Apple's MacBook. Is there really a need for a MacBook killer? Microsoft thinks so, but it may be bringing too little, too late. Its PC partners also seem to be taking on Apple just fine. I spent the last two weeks with the Surface Laptop, and while I'm a big fan, it may be a tough sell. About this Surface Laptop review Microsoft supplied a loaner Surface Laptop for review purposes. The unit tested features a Core i5-7200U processor, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It costs $1,299. Starting price of the Surface Laptop is $999 for the Core i5 with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The Surface Laptop maxes out at a Core i7-7660U with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,199. See at Microsoft Microsoft Surface Laptop technical specifications Microsoft offers a few variants of the Surface Laptop, but only two processor types, seventh generation dual-core Intel Core i5 and i7 chips, along with Intel HD 620 and Intel Iris Plus 640 for graphics.

Surface Laptop design Following in the tradition of other Surface devices, the Surface Laptop is the cream of the crop when it comes to aesthetics and quality. The Laptop's chassis is unibody aluminum that is smooth and creak-free with no screws or visible seams. Everything from the grating on the rear vent to the edge of the back of the display is symmetrical and impeccable-looking. The aluminum is excellent for preventing smudges as well. I never once felt I had to wipe down the Surface Laptop nor were there visible fingerprints on the chassis from normal handling. This fingerprint experience carries over the touch screen as well. Our review unit was burgundy, but there are three other colors including platinum, cobalt blue, and champagne. Unfortunately, the latter two colors are only offered in the Core i5 models, and platinum is only available for Core i7 variants. The burgundy and cobalt blue are muted and non-flamboyant (Microsoft describes the colors as "timeless.") Burgundy shimmers a bit depending on the light – sometimes it looks darker, other times brighter. Rubber feet keep some distance between the bottom metal chassis and any flat surface. The Microsoft logo along with some minor device information is on the underside and is almost invisible. There are no Intel stickers or anything else marring the Surface Laptop. Opening the lid is effortless and can be done one-handed – a trademark of quality laptop engineering. Microsoft did not even add a notch to open the display, which is unusual but not problematic because there is enough ridge in the front to grab and open it from any position. The inside keyboard deck and display area are almost boring ... but in a good way. There is nothing that immediately draws your eye away from the screen – no chrome, vents, grills, speakers or LEDs – just the keyboard and screen. It's a pure Windows experience. Alcantara luxury (and concerns) That keyboard deck features Alcantara – a synthetic fabric that is supposed to be on the same level as leather or suede but not as damaging to the environment. It's made from polyester and polyurethane. The fabric is warm and inviting versus the common cold metal found in premium laptops. The color scheme matches the exterior with bits of darker color to add some style. Everything you need to know about Alcantara Alcantara has some detractors, and some say the fabric can stain over the years. Microsoft has used it before with its Signature Type Cover for Surface Pro and Surface Ergonomic Keyboard, and most reviews on Amazon are positive, with few complaints about the fabric. The blend with the Surface Laptop is supposed to be slightly different, with an extra layer of a specialized polyurethane coating. There is a very distinct and almost pungent smell with the Surface Laptop. While this scent is like any "new computer" smell, it has lingered more than the usual 24 hours. I own and use the Signature Type Cover and Surface Ergonomic Keyboard and have never noticed this odor, so clearly, something is different. Microsoft says that like any luxury item occasional user care needs to be taken with the Alcantara, which includes giving it a light wipe down with microfiber, water, and some soap. In my two weeks with the Surface Laptop, I didn't notice any wear, tear, or staining with the Alcantara fabric. The only downside is the smell, which is more apparent than I would prefer. For now, only time will tell how well Alcantara holds up over the life of the Surface Laptop. Surface Laptop display The Surface Laptop features a 2256 x 1504 (201ppi) PixelSense multi-touch display. That is a lower resolution than the 12.5-inch Surface Pro at 2736 x 1824 (267 ppi) and the 13.5-inch Surface Book 3200 x 1800 (267 ppi), but it would be difficult to eyeball any differences. Because the Surface Laptop is not a tablet or a 2-in-1 PC, Microsoft made the display bezels quite thin and smaller than on Surface Pro or Surface Book. The Laptop's screen is bright and auto-adjusts based on ambient lighting. That adjustment feature works well. Brightness could be higher, but for most usage scenarios it should be OK. Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display from scratches, and each screen is calibrated for 100 percent sRGB. In my color calibration test, I saw 99 percent sRGB and 80 percent AdobeRGB. Calibration scores confirm a highly accurate color palate for Surface Laptop's display. The glass is edge-to-edge and unlike any other laptop because there is no ridge – it's perfectly flat. The "oleophobic" screen protection is excellent with no noticeable smudges even after touch or pen use. Microsoft claims the Laptop's screen has "the thinnest and lowest parallax LCD touch module on any laptop." That's good because making a display touch and pen-enabled often results in thicker and heavier displays that can add "visual distance" between the glass and LCD. Regarding quality, blacks are not quite as deep as on an AMOLED or IGZO display. Instead, there is a slight shift to dark gray due to the backlight standard with IPS LCD. Microsoft appears to have gotten the light-bleed issue in some of its other PCs under control, too, and we didn't see any backlight hotspots. While the display is glossy, the effect is somewhat muted and does not cause eye strain. Overall, the Surface Laptop screen is a marked improvement in the Surface lineup. It is easily one of the best displays on a 13-inch form factor, even if it is not the highest-resolution. Surface Pen is better than anticipated Surface Laptop does not come with a Surface Pen, and it's not considered an inking device. Nonetheless, the touch display supports the feature. While it does not have advanced features such as the tilt support found in the new Surface Pro, it does quite well. The Surface Laptop's display does not articulate fully backward, nor can it lay flat. That makes using a digital pen a bit awkward, often requiring you to hold the screen with the other hand for support. However, for signing documents, making a quick on-screen note, or drawing on a screen capture, it's not bad and better than I expected. Inking on Surface Laptop is a "nice to have" feature. You probably won't use it a lot, but that moment you need to sign a PDF document or sketch a diagram, you'll be glad it's there. Excellent typing experience on a smooth keyboard Microsoft basically took Surface Pro 4's keyboard and dropped it into the Surface Laptop. There are some changes, however, including deeper key travel at 1.5mm versus the 1.3mm found in the Surface Pro. The keys themselves are plastic and smooth just like Surface Pro. The material is a bit surprising because the Surface Book uses metal (magnesium) keys. The keys feel a little cheaper and lighter than anticipated. That's not bad, just different. My guess is Microsoft wanted the keys to match the warm feel of the Alcantara, and metal keys would have added weight and a cool-to-the-touch experience that did not match. There is a three-stage backlight with a keyboard shortcut for easy access. Lighting comes on automatically and works great. In another welcome change, Microsoft finally added dedicated function keys (F1 and F2) for display brightness controls. Previously, people with Surface devices had to use a cumbersome hidden key combo for those commands. To the left of the Delete key is the power button – another change from previous Surfaces. The button works well and is instant. A light touch results in the display lighting up immediately. There are also dedicated media playback keys (play and pause), print screen, home, end, and page up and down. The overall typing experience is excellent. Precision trackpad lives up to its name The Surface Laptop comes with a large 105 mm x 70 mm Precision trackpad with a glass layer. The trackpad on the Surface Laptop is almost perfect. Clicking is satisfactory with an audible click, although you can tap for a quieter experience. The glass layer is smooth, though a bit tackier at times than I'm used to. I had no issues with unregistered entries, and the cursor accuracy was high. Input and output (or lack thereof) There are a few controversial areas of the Surface Laptop, and port selection is one of them. A single USB Type-A 3.0 port is found on the left-hand side. Next to it is a mini DisplayPort and 3.5mm headphone jack. That's it. The lack of a forward-looking USB Type-C in place of a mini DisplayPort is disappointing. Nonetheless, it is not a deal breaker, at least not for me. I have a few laptops with USB Type-C, and the ports are used exclusively for charging. While external GPU (eGPU) support would be nice, Thunderbolt 3 is still a bit messy with some burdensome requirements, so I get why Microsoft is forgoing the standard. And later this year, Microsoft plans to release an adapter that fits into the Surface Connect port. It will reconfigure that power and data port into USB Type-C for those who want it. Why Microsoft's new Surface Pro doesn't have a USB Type-C port Conceptually, I think people accepted a single USB port on Surface Pro because it was a tablet. I'm not sure that leniency will carry over to Surface Laptop. The absent SD card reader is also a letdown, but Microsoft evidently prioritized battery over external media support. Surface Laptop speakers gratify When looking at the Surface Laptop, you quickly notice what is not there, and that includes visible speakers. The Surface Pro and Surface Book put the speakers in the display facing outward, but Laptop is too thin for that. Instead, Microsoft is doing something new – and risky. The Surface Laptop's speakers are below the keyboard deck, hidden from sight. Using special "Omnisonic" speakers that are tuned to work well with the Alcantara fabric and space between the keys, Microsoft may have outdone itself. Compared to the new Surface Pro and Surface Book, the Surface Laptop sounds better. The reason is acoustics. With the speakers in the lower deck, there is more area for the sound to resonate. You can feel the sound when turned up, much like how a quality stereo speaker has a timbre. Audio from Surface Laptop is loud, clear, and distinctly rich. There is Dolby Audio Premium support, too, along with some smart enhancements like loudness, room tuning, and bass boost to help customize the audio. Wicked fast Windows Hello and a 720p camera All modern Surface devices leverage Microsoft's Windows Hello feature via face recognition. The function is accomplished via a combination of infrared (IR) light and a lens, along with the front-facing camera. Microsoft tuned Windows Hello on the Surface Laptop for speed, and it is impressive. As you begin to open the lid at a 10-degree angle the display and camera are enabled. As you continue to open the lid the camera actively searches for the user, and due to the improved optics, by the time you fully open the display the Surface Laptop has already recognized you. The result is a very fast Windows Hello unlock process. Image sample from the 720p front-facing camera is decent. Speaking of that front camera, it is only 720p, a downgrade from the new Surface Pro's 1080p one. That tradeoff is likely due to how thin the bezels are on Laptop compared to Pro, not to mention the thickness. While images are a noticeably lower resolution, they are brilliant and look good. In fact, they're still better than most laptops I have tried. Due to the Surface Laptop not being a tablet, there is no rear camera. Surface Laptop performance leaves something to be desired Microsoft ships two versions of the Surface Laptop: one with a Core i5-7200U and the other with a Core i7-7660U. Both are dual-core and have the latest seventh-generation processors from Intel. Our review unit is the Core i5 model, which is likely to be the most popular. In synthetic benchmarks, the Surface Laptop with Core i5 does quite well. Geekbench 4.0 focuses mostly on a CPU-intensive task and it compares favorably to speedier Core i7 devices: Geekbench 4.0 benchmarks (higher is better) Device CPU Single core Multi core Surface Laptop i5-7200U 3,725 7,523 HP EliteBook x360 G2 i7-7600U 4,496 8,435 Samsung Notebook 9 15 Ext i7-7500U 4,316 8,320 Lenovo X1 Carbon i5-7300U 4,139 8,311 Dell XPS 13 (9360) i7-6560U 4,120 7,829 HP Spectre 13 i7-7500U 4,100 7,469 Surface Book 965M i7-6600U 3,977 7,486 While the i5-7200U handles Windows 10 just fine, it is a very middle of the road processor that peaks at 3.10GHz and has a base clock of 2.7GHz (Microsoft used the configurable thermal design power or cTDP to boost the base from 2.50GHz to 2.70GHz). PCMark (Home Conventional 3.0) Device Score Comparison Surface Laptop Core i5 2,494 Better than 40 percent of all results Samsung Notebook 9 15 Ext 2,998 Better than 57 percent of all results Lenovo X1 Carbon Core i5 2,965 Better than 57 percent of all results HP EliteBook x360 G2 2,916 Better than 52 percent of all results Dell Latitude 7280 2,829 Better than 52 percent of all results HP Spectre x360 15 2,472 Better than 41 percent of all results The PCMark score for the Laptop matches that of the 4K HP Spectre x360 15, despite the latter having a Core i7 CPU. PCMark Home Conventional looks at the system under load, and things like display resolution come into play, so laptops with higher resolution screens like Surface Laptop and the HP Spectre x360 get dinged because they push the graphics component much harder. Geekbench 4.0 OpenCL (higher is better) Device Compute score Surface Laptop 19,256 HP Spectre x360 15 28,868 Samsung Notebook 9 15 Ext 23,207 HP EliteBook x360 G2 21,512 Lenovo X1 Carbon 20,932 Dell XPS 13 (9360) 19,410 Surface Book HD520 18,197 Dell Latitude 7280 17,827 The Surface Laptop does not have a discrete GPU, but it uses the Intel HD 620 to offload graphics from the CPU. With a core clock of 1GHz, the HD 620 edges out the Intel HD520 found in Surface Book, but it is not considered a powerhouse. Where things get disappointing is with the 256GB of SSD storage for read and write speeds. Microsoft made a big deal about integrating a PCIe NVMe SSD directly into the PCB board, whereas many other laptops use an add-in module. The result is a more power-efficient drive that takes up significantly less space leaving more room for the battery. While still an SSD the 256GB is far from the fastest out there. Unfortunately, for the Core i5 edition, the SSD is made by Toshiba (THNSN0256GTYA) and its peak read and write speeds are just 900 MB/s and 200 MB/s – and that is theoretically under ideal conditions. Here are the synthetic benchmarks using CrystalDiskMark. CrystalDiskMark (higher is better) Device Read Write Surface Laptop 423 MB/s 237 MB/s Lenovo X1 Carbon 1,518 MB/s 1,188 MB/s Samsung Notebook 9 Ext 1,365 MB/s 1,213 MB/s HP EliteBook x360 G2 1,129 MB/s 916 MB/s Dell XPS 13 (9360) 1,287 MB/s 794 MB/s HP Spectre x360 15 1,128 MB/s 862 MB/s Surface Book 1,018 MB/s 967 MB/s Dell Latitude 7280 428 MB/s 412 MB/s I've seen some Core i7 editions of the Surface Laptop use a Samsung KUS040202M for the 512GB configuration. That drive can push 1,200 MB/s for read and 960 MB/s for writes, which are very respectable speeds, suggesting that the high-end Surface Laptop will perform significantly faster all around – especially with Intel Iris Plus 640 Graphics – compared to the Core i5 Surface Laptop. The 128GB edition of the Core i5 Surface Laptop may also perform even worse than the 256GB for storage access rates. Bottom line: The more money you pay, the more power you get. To put this in perspective, using the Core i5 Surface Laptop feels just fine. Whether it is booting the OS, running Windows Store apps, or even some light gaming, you would never suspect that the SSD was by any means slow. However, for large file transfers (1GB or more), the slower SSD speeds are slower than similarly configured laptops in this category. All-day battery life The battery life is exceptional with the Surface Laptop. Microsoft touts 14.5 hours using a closed-loop video playback with no connectivity – standard practice in all battery estimates. Real-world usee falls more in line with a solid nine hours, but you can push it to ten if you are not doing intensive work, or by keeping the display dimmer. In my experience with the Surface Laptop, I never had to take the AC wall charger with me for the day, which is great. Standby time is also outstanding. Closing the lid means the Laptop is not consuming battery life despite being on standby for rapid resumes. After a few hours, the laptop sleeps and behaves like any Windows machine, but returning a week later will result in nearly the same battery life as when you left it. Whisper fans and a cool experience The Core i5 processor stays very cool, never exceeding 102 degrees F (39 degrees C) under intensive graphics processing for 20 minutes. The fan is whisper quiet and rarely turns on especially under regular usage. You would almost suspect the device was fanless, until you start playing games or do a large OS update or install. Due to the design, the air intake grill is shared with the exhaust vent in the back of the device. That means your legs never block or interfere with air flow. It also gives the appearance that the device has no fan due to the grill being hidden behind the display hinge when opened. The Surface Laptop never gets beyond warm and is exceptionally quiet. Windows 10 S: Another conundrum Windows 10 S is a variant of the Windows 10 Pro OS that comes with the Surface Laptop. It is Windows 10 Pro with the one exception that it can only install apps from the Windows Store versus .exe apps downloaded off the internet. At any time a user can do a one-time "unlock" to Windows 10 S to Pro through the Store for free through 2017. (It'll cost $49 after that if Microsoft does not extend the offer). Unlocking to Windows 10 Pro is literally a single button click. The whole process took less than three minutes, including the Laptop rebooting to adjust OS configurations. It was fast and easy and did not alter any customizations or files on my Laptop. However, once you upgrade to Pro you cannot downgrade to S. Instead, you need to use a Surface Recovery image file from Microsoft (free). A user will not be charged for another Pro upgrade because the license is linked to the Laptop and Store. Regarding performance and battery life between Windows 10 S and Windows 10 Pro, technically there is no difference. Putting two machines side by side – one with S and one with Pro – and running the same Windows Store apps and web use will result in the same performance and battery life. There is nothing "extra" about Pro, and Windows 10 S is not "lite" Windows. The upgrade to Windows 10 Pro took under 3 minutes including device reboot. If, however, you begin to install non-Windows Store apps on Windows 10 Pro, you may not see the same performance and battery life – especially after months or years. That's the difference. Windows 10 S is an ideal form of the Windows experience and keeping that configuration means the Surface Laptop will behave the same on day one as day one thousand. Conclusion: Surface Laptop is beautiful and delightful — but not unique I've thought hard about the Surface Laptop and who should buy it. Three distinct buyers come to mind, and I'll address each in turn for a review recommendation: Surface fans looking for validation to buy. "Regular" people who want 13-inch laptops. MacOS users looking to switch to Windows. The first group is made up of people who saw Surface Laptop and just wanted it. They think it's stunning, they are committed to the Surface brand, are comfortable with the price – and missing ports – and want to know is there anything severely wrong with it before they commit. Those people should grab their credit cards and get one. I thoroughly enjoy using the Surface Laptop. It is delightful to use and carry around. I had zero issue or complaints, and this is easily my favorite Surface so far from Microsoft. For the second group, regular shoppers who simply want a good 13-inch Ultrabook, you should probably skip the Surface Laptop. There is nothing fundamentally flawed with the device, but companies like HP (Spectre x360), Dell (XPS 13) and even Huawei (MateBook X) all make exceptional laptops that are thin, luxurious, more powerful, offer additional ports, and are significantly cheaper. It seems ludicrous to suggest the Surface Laptop is a better value or purchase than those – it simply is not. The third group is MacBook and MacBook Pro users. For years, the PC crowd has been dogged by comparisons to Apple's premium laptop line. Microsoft finally went and made just as an audacious and deluxe laptop as Apple. Perfectly engineered? Done. Lacking in features? Check. Overpriced? Very likely. Still amazing to use and something you want? Yup. The Surface Laptop is Microsoft's MacBook. People buy $10,000 watches that can only tell time, while my $150 Fitbit gives me my heart rate and acts as a pedometer. But there is a reason why people buy $10,000 watches: quality. The Surface Laptop is a status device for Windows users. Microsoft might as well make a gold edition, with real gold, just to sell it to Kanye West. It's about prestige. I suspect, however, like the MacBook brand, the Microsoft Surface Laptop will attract a certain "tech glitterati" to the Windows 10 world, an elite group of digital fashionistas who will sing the gospel of Redmond's vision of Fluent Design. Ironically, the people who want this device the most are the tech media that cover Microsoft and who will review it – not your average consumer. Microsoft wants to see its brand at press events, and mindshare matters. Finally, the conceptual problem is that the Surface Laptop has no "killer feature." That's a change from prior Surface devices that created a new category, or solved a unique problem. Surface Laptop idoesn't change the game. It's just a really, really nice Windows laptop. And that's perfectly fine. See Surface Laptop at Microsoft Pros: Outstanding build quality and design. Balanced for performance and all-day battery. Very good display and typing experience. Quiet and cool. Pure Windows 10. Microsoft prestige device. Cons: Very expensive. Limited I/O port selection. SSD is slower than expected.

I hope the Surface Pro i5 isn't similarly spec'd because a faster SSD is one of the reasons I ordered it to replace my SP3 i5.

And the same solid stand by mode without battery discharging when in sleep mode? 0 2 days ago Reply Gabriel Hernandez5 Great review, except for the slow SSD speeds I think this is a good laptop. Hopefully the SSD speed is caused by a driver issue that can be fixed and not because of low quality hardware controllers as this is a laptop that competes with Ultrabooks from HP, Dell and Apple. 0 2 days ago Reply netmann Don't make your hopes high! No driver issue...The 256 GB SSD sequential write speed is pathetic!... I would not buy it for slow performance and the fact that the SSD is not upgradable! 0 2 days ago Reply DoctorSaline This laptop is so cool! Visually stunning device. I get why they reduced the display resolution. More pixels discharge more battery to light all those pixels up. Maybe one of the reasons for increase in battery percentage compared to previous gens. But what I'm disappointed is with slower SSDs. Simply disgusting for a device with this steep price tag. Totally unacceptable. As for ports, I get now why Microsoft didn't go with type C. Until it becomes a norm and a standard as a charging connector, display interface, eGPU, Thunderbolt 3, data transfers and connected devices... USB type A seems like a better option. What I don't agree with though is the lack of SD card slot and HDMI. Bummer for camera and media enthusiasts out there. Since from what I know,most TVs use HDMI interface and mini display port to HDMI adapter is not even available in my part of the world. Having read MJF's review, Microsoft still needs to perfect the lappability formula. Slippery base, wobbly and heavy screen are still a legit concerns for the anxious among us who would also like to use their laptops on less than ideal conditions for longer durations. Next up is the software department in Windows 10 S. I think Microsoft has finally given RT a worthy successor. It goes without saying that it's what should have been from the start but better late than never. Having better performance, battery life and especially security over the length of device's lifetime is all very attractive to me. The fact that store apps run in a container and doesn't mess up the registry is a huge bonus. Also, project centennial as a starter does exactly that to otherwise largely untouched traditionally win32 programs. We know that full office suite as a centennial convert is coming to store. Some programs have already made the jump. Others most used ones like Adobe's suites, professional softwares, productivity suites need to make the jump and soon. Since the benefits of such system far outweigh the hassle it takes to make that jump. Oh, and such a version of windows gives users a proper lesson in giving sincere try to Edge so hurray for that. As for apps deficits, web apps on Microsoft Edge run just fine. Maybe as good as native experience. Plus more convenience for developers to update them through a server side update without having to take compatibility and optimizations in the process. Progressive web apps can possibly be the saviour of Microsoft's app gap problem. Ultimately, I hope, Microsoft's newly born cool factor can get them their lost ground back in computing space particularly in browser and app ecosystem. Fingers crossed for what's to come next. In cShell, successor to Surface Book and possibly a Surface Phone. Exciting times ahead. 1 2 days ago Reply someoneinwa The Surface Laptop was produced for a different reason than other Surface products. Not to show the OEMs something they didn't know as with the Pro and the Book and the Studio, but to show off Windows 10 S and to satisfy the Surface fans who had been asking for a traditional laptop. I suspect Microsoft will be signing up third party sellers for this device like they do with the Pro to sell to education and other niche markets. Yeah, the MSRP is high for you and me, but it won't be for bulk buyers. 0 2 days ago Reply Jason Krewson 83 Hard to say best like that when all Microsoft Surface devices have a different use case.

In probably 98% of the tasks relevant to the users of light and portable machines like this, you'd care about access times (affects snappiness) and power consumption (affects system battery life). OTOH, seq. reads and writes do not correlate to user experience in any way, except for a small fraction of special users.  It's like gigahertz wars of the early 2000s - more is better, everybody knows that.    3 2 days ago Reply Shrave Agreed. Microsoft didn't market this computer to power users who will edit, constantly move files around, etc. It's meant for recreational users, students, and entertainment. For them, the SSD will make no difference.

Microsoft Office applications? Online research? For those, you shouldn't notice any difference. If you're moving big video files or photos around constantly. If you're rendering videos (then it's mostly processor anyway), other big file work, then you will notice a difference. 1 2 days ago Reply realparadyne Agreed.  More useful would be the IOPS rate or random 4k read / write rate as that is more like normal usage.  Provided it can write faster than your download speed or transfer from a USB stick / external hard disk then most people will be happy most of the time.  Interesting that they are using two different SSDs, probably in order to get enough supply so you might get either kind in any spec device.  They don't give a spec for the SSD itself so you can't say it isn't as good as specified! 1 2 days ago Reply Daniel Rubino Still relevant to point out for comparison. There are costs and quality associated with different SSD brands and performance. 0 2 days ago Reply RayWP7 Yeap! Professional anecdote (simplified):  my bosses opted to buy all SSD SAN shelf from EMC recently. The idea was to help provide better performance for our application (we do SaaS).  Well, I told them the application we write is ******.  Nothing can scale ******.  What happens?  We install the new shelf.  We migrate databases (via AG movement) and guess what?  Application is still ****** (from a SQL code perspective).  SSD and raw transfer rates aren't too useful when the workload isn't as equally optimized.  File transfers?  Unless you're transferring data from primary site to an HA/DR site and need to ensure recovery time/ objectives, its silly to focus on that metric alone when so many things in between affect transfer rates.

Idaho Sen. James Risch made the comment while questioning Attorney General Jeff Sessions during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. “We’ve been through thousands of pages of information, interviewed witnesses and everything else. We’re really no different than where we were when this whole thing started,” Risch said to Sessions. “And there’s been no reports that I know of of any factual information that regard it. Are you aware of any such information of collusion?” he asked. Sessions took Risch’s questions to be a reference to the dossier of Trump opposition research compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

Our games guru STUART CULLEN will be getting up close and personal with the new titles coming your way and finding out what will be big in the gaming world in the next 12 months. Reuters 1 The PS VR impressed our gaming guru Stuart Cullen THE action is hotting up in Los Angeles – like the weather. It sounds a bit geeky but LA sweltered in 30C heat, blue skies and no clouds, yet all I saw was the inside of an air-conditioned hotels and auditoriums. And I was as happy as a dog with two tails. Although, between you and me, I did get to lap up the sunshine when all the fun had finished last night and as I was moving between venues. But back to the serious gaming stuff. There were two conferences as well as a play event. We started at the PC Gamer conference. MOST READ IN GAMING POKEMOGGY There's a new Pokemon Go-style game on the way - and it stars GARFIELD the cartoon cat GAME ON E3 2017 saw bigger crowds than ever before as gamers inhaled the sights and sounds of epic LA convention MORE TO EXPLORE Strange Brigade: A new blockbuster from the makers of Sniper Elite and Zombie Army CHOC-A-BLOCK Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 shows off its mammoth list of characters in explosive announcement trailer CHILDHOOD DREAM Forza Horizon 3 Hot Wheels delivers the racing experience you always dreamed of as a kid FAMILY FEUD Tekken 7 review: The longstanding series proves it still packs a punch with this champion effort This is aimed solely at the PC market and highlighted new titles as well as a raft of ground-breaking tech which will be out soon. It was held at the stylish Ace Hotel and was all pretty cool. It was sponsored by Intel. Their headline hardware news was a range of super-duper chips and boards, but they also revealed a new eSports grand slam competition. The first team to wins four qualifying CS-GO global tournament events in a 12-month period will pocket a cool $1million. That caused a murmur in the crowd, but it was followed by news of a new VR eSports league which will feature games like Echo Arena. That is a new VR multi-player game – an offshoot of the story-driven Lone Echo. Echo Arena will see teams facing off against each other in a 3v3-type disc-throwing game where you must score as many points as you can. The new league and support from Intel shows how seriously they are all taking VR eSport. It is so important that Echo Arena will be FREE at launch for a limited time as they aim to build a user base. The event also highlighted a number of new games, but the main news was that Xcom 2 is getting a new expansion called War Of The Chosen. It will add new units, enemies and a host of other goodies and it will be twice as large as any other Xcom expansion so far. Forza 7 and Sea Of Thieves should both do well on PC. They have a number of features that will only be on the PC version. Turn 10 have also said that Forza will also support almost every steering wheel package on the market. US game designer Cliffy B – Cliff Bleszinski – was on stage showing off Lawbreakers. It looks like a fast-paced multi-player game and was backed up by a video of pro gamers all waxing lyrical about it. I’ll be seeing how right they are later this week. After all the PC goodness we headed to the EA Play event in downtown Hollywood where fans could get hands-on time with the hottest EA titles coming up. Need For Speed Payback was the major title and we got a quick taste of what the game will be like by playing through a section where you had to steal a Koenigsegg off the back of a truck. You also drove a beefed-up Mustang. Overall, the game looks promising but there are still question marks over how well the Fast And The Furious-style story will work. We also tried out Star War Battlefront 2. It has taken the first game and turned everything up to 11. We played a droids against clones, where the droids had to protect a troop carrier then capture and hold a final point. It plays just like the first game which isn’t an issue, but it gives you more choices like what sort of character you want to be – from assault to heavy. They all have their own good points and bad. You can also call in support by spending the point you earned. This lets you play as heroes like Darth Maul or Boba Fett or you could become a heavy battle droid or vehicle. The changes add a wealth of options in terms of combat and gameplay. This WILL be a hit later this year. Then we were off to the Sony conference in the Shrine Auditorium. It is a huge theatre that was the perfect backdrop for a Sony master-show. Beforehand, you could get time with new titles like Far Cry 5 and Detroit Become Human. I took Grand Turismo Sport for a spin with the PS VR. Wow, it is very good. The depth of field and the ability to read the road as you do climbs was incredible. It is the best VR racing game I’ve played so far. Sorry, Drive Club. There will be plenty of new stuff for PS4 and PS VR. A few standouts were the zombie-fuelled Days Gone. It followed on from last year’s trailer with another brutal gameplay teaser. It hints at setting trap and using swarms of zombies to attack enemy camps. It looks pretty special. Titles like Spiderman, God Of War and Uncharted The Lost legacy got new trailers. The Spidey gameplay was fast and frantic and showed off some stunning web-slinger fighting. New titles include Shadow Of The Colossus. You play as a young boy climbing up a giant monsters to kill them in a super-stylish way. Horizon Zero Dawn looks to be getting an expansion. Frozen Wilds adds a new storyline as well as areas and enemies. It’s all set in a winter wonderland of snow. The big PS VR push is on. There will be a host of new titles although some are pretty strange. Monster Of The Deep is a stand-alone game set in the world of Final Fantasy where you FISH. It was a hell of a show to finish the day. Sony are ready for a monster 12 months. And hungry gamers even got mini-hamburgers. That was the deal clincher! Sorry, Microsoft, Sony won the fight for best con in 2017. Now the attention turns to the official opening of E3. This is heaven for gamers – I can’t wait. We pay for your stories and videos!

You'd be forgiven for not recognizing the name Alpha. The company first made a splash back in March when it launched the 14-inch Litebook laptop running Elementary OS on a quad-core Intel Celeron and 4GB of RAM for $249. Now Alpha is back with two more products, one of which is a Coe i7 laptop. Liliputing brought to our attention a new post on the Alpha Store blog. In it the company explains how it has revamped its website, refreshed its forums, and learned a lot over the past three months from selling the Litebook. Now it's back with the Centurion laptop and Litebox desktop PC, both of which also run Linux by using Elementary OS. Lets' start with the Centurion laptop, which Alpha states is a performance machine. It's a 15.6-inch laptop using a 1080p display. Inside you'll find an Intel dual-core Core i7 (3517U) running at 1.9Ghz and jumping to 3GHz for Turbo Boost. The processor is complemented by 8GB of RAM and a choice between a 1TB hard drive, 480GB SSD, or 120GB SSD/1TB hard drive hybrid setup. There's no dedicated GPU, instead the Centurion relies on the Core i7's integrated HD Graphics 4000 processor. While the Centurion isn't going to win any speed awards, you can't argue with the price. It costs $429 with a 1TB hard drive, rising to $529 with the hybrid drive, or $549 with the 480GB SSD. If you'd prefer a Linux desktop PC instead of a laptop, Alpha would like you to consider the Litebox. It's a tiny machine offering either a quad-core 2GHz Celeron (J1900), 4GB of RAM and a 500GB hard drive, or a dual-core 1.6GHz Core i5 (5200U), 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. The prices are $249 and $449 respectively. The Litebook received generally favorable feedback with it mostly being compared to Chromebooks, only with more functionality available because it runs a flavor of Linux. We'll have to wait and see if the Centurion and Litebox are received just as well, but at these prices it would be hard to complain unless there's some serious shortcomings.

Dell will be launching an Alienware Area-51 desktop computer in July that packs inside the coming Ryzen Threadripper processor family. The machine will be called the Alienware Area-51 Threadripper Edition. The machine will use the AMD X399 chipset and will come with either the 12-core or 16-core Ryzen Threadripper chips inside able to handle either 24 or 32 threads depending on which of the chips you choose. Both Threadripper flavors will be unlocked and overclocked right out of the box. To keep Threadripper from overheating, the Alienware machines will use the most powerful liquid cooling system that Alienware has ever featured. Alongside those Threadripper gaming beasts, Dell will later launch Area-51 systems that are powered by the Core-X Series processors from Intel. The bottom of the line Intel rig will come with the 6-core Core i7-7800X and at the top of the line will sit a machine with the 10-core Core i9-7900X. The Intel machines will use the X299 chipset and will support Intel Optane memory in 16GB or 32GB flavors. Aside from chipsets and processors, some components will be the same between the AMD or Intel machines. Namely, you will be able to choose from a plethora of storage options including SATA or M.2 PCIe solutions. The Area-51 machines will support up to three graphics cards in SLI or CrossFire modes. The most powerful card offered in these rigs is the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. The AMD Threadripper Edition will ship July 21 with the Intel version shipping late this summer reports HotHardware. Pricing isn’t announced, but the cost will be high.

(Alfredo Flores via AP) WASHINGTON — Several people familiar with the company headed by President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn say a former Trump transition aide played a key role in Flynn Intel Group's work for a Turkish client. Flynn is under investigation by federal authorities in connection with that work. Bijan Kian, Flynn's former business partner, connected Flynn Intel with its Turkish client and managed much of its foreign work, according to the client and others familiar with Flynn's company. They spoke anonymously because of the expanding investigation. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

And they are placing as top 16C/32T TR on AMD's side. And 10C/20T on intel's. Is that due to intel's high price? Or due to low availability? In either way from Alienware's business perspective, they do not intend to offer more than 10-core intel solution at this moment in time.     Fox2232 View Public Profile Find all posts by Fox2232   (#6) shamus21 Member Guru   Videocard: 0 Processor: 0 Mainboard: Memory: Soundcard: PSU: 0 06-13-2017, 10:39 | posts: 59 I still would go intel when it comes to building a new gaming rig or at least until the second Gen AMD cpu`s come out but that said it would not be at any price which intel still seems to think it can get away with.     shamus21 View Public Profile Find all posts by shamus21   (#7) DStealth Master Guru     Videocard: MSI GX 1080Ti@2088/12000 Processor: i7 5820k@4666_1.29V Mainboard: X99 Memory: @3.1Ghz CL14-14-14-35 1T Soundcard: PSU: SS X-1250W 06-13-2017, 11:03 | posts: 244 | Location: 127.0.0.1 Quote: Originally Posted by BLEH!

Sure, the low end Kaby Lake X CPUs are fairly pointless, but doubtless, the higher end stuff won't be the disaster that many think (or hope) it will be.

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Problem-o-matic: iPhone 8 problems keep coming iPhone 8 rumors: New evidence points to wireless charging and waterproof specs... 8 ways the iPhone 8 can beat the Galaxy S8 Video iOS 11: The top features announced What are you likely to get when you ask Apple questions about presumed problems with devices they haven’t announced yet? Let’s find out. Writing for CNBC, Todd Haselton warns us that “The iPhone 8 may be outdated before it even launches.” (Tip o’ the antlers to Nick Sayer, The LeeBase and Crandall Crute.) The Apple iPhone 8 may already lag behind Android rivals when it launches later this year. No. You know why? Because phones aren’t judged on one and only one feature. That’s not how this works. Haselton isn’t new to the pre-dooming-Apple-products-before-they-ship rodeo which is the kind of rodeo that uses teacup poodles. He also pre-doomed the Apple Watch. Pre-dooming, of course, cannot fail, it can only be failed so pundits have to pretend that the Apple Watch flopped even though it has sold way better than the hit Amazon Echo. No, none of this makes any sense. It’s not you. This iPhone 8 pre-doom isn’t really “news” so much as it is “olds”. This came up a month and a half ago and it’s no less much ado about very little now than it was then. Bloomberg echoed a report from CNET earlier this spring which explains that Apple typically sources its chips from Intel and Qualcomm. While Qualcomm already offers Gigabit LTE support in its newest modems, Intel won't roll out support until next year. So the iPhone 8 most likely won’t have Gigabit LTE. As the Macalope previously noted, the original iPhone only had EDGE and still managed to please at least a few people. Also, the top Android phones are already a few seconds behind the iPhone and they still seem to sell pretty well anyway. Why? Because speed isn’t the only virtue of a smartphone. This is a big deal for consumers who buy the new iPhone 8 and realize it's outdated and running on slower networks than other phones that support Gigabit LTE, like the Galaxy S8. Sure. People will drop the iPhone 8 in meaningful numbers and switch to the Galaxy S8 because they care about modem speed and only modem speed. That sounds like people the Macalope knows and not at all like a fabricated single-feature D&D character sheet Haselton just had to roll 10,000 times to create. It might not matter much in 2017 as carriers are still working to activate next-generation networks, but it'll matter over the lifetime of the phone for folks who keep their iPhone for two years or more. You know what else matters to folks who keep their phones for two years or more? Software updates. Good luck getting your Android phone updated after the carrier/manufacturer combination gets bored with your model and wanders off into the woods because they heard there was a dead body by the train tracks and they want to poke at it with a stick. Apple’s adoption rate for iOS 10 is 86 percent and Android 7’s is 7 percent so let us not be lectured to about devices that are outdated. Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment. “Hi, I was wondering, just how badly will the iPhone 8 suck? Hello? Hello? … I think they hung up.” That’s what you get.

The partnership will also see both companies jointly investing in Centres of Excellences (CoEs) across India and the US to provide industry specific solutions for optimising cost and improving productivity. "The collaboration allows us to offer advanced ready-to-use solutions and reference architectures across the network, cloud and client. The CoEs will also provide on-the-ground solution testing, verification and development support for customers in the US and India," said Intel Sales and Marketing VP Shannon Poulin. While TCS will gain from Intel's hardware know-how, the partnership will ensure that the latter company's chips sell better in systems that are used by large enterprises. They will also design cloud-ready network design to help businesses build agile and cost effective infrastructure through software-defined networking, software-defined infrastructure and NFV. Intel had announced last month that it will collaborate with industries and academia across India to push AI and complementary technologies such as IoT and Big Data to the masses. The announcement comes a week after Intel's long-time partner Microsoft announced that it will work with Qualcomm to build Snapdragon powered PCs. TCS already has one centre for excellence for IoT research in its Hyderabad campus which was done in partnership with Intel.

Kian and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn talk during the Fifth Annual Nowruz Commission Gala at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington. As Michael Flynn spent last fall campaigning as Donald Trump’s top national security adviser, Bijan Kian, his little-known business partner supervised much of the foreign political work for Turkish interests that has boomeranged back on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Alfredo Flores via AP) National Business June 13, 2017 5:34 PM Trump transition aide did not disclose role in Turkish work By STEPHEN BRAUN and CHAD DAY Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON A business partner of former national security adviser Michael Flynn took part in sensitive hiring and policy discussions involving U.S. intelligence as a member of President Donald Trump's transition team, but failed to inform Trump's team that he had conducted political work on behalf of a foreign client of Flynn and might have to register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. Internal records for Flynn's partner, Bijan Kian, indicate he had not disclosed his work on behalf of a Turkish businessman last year with the Flynn Intel Group or provided any warning that he planned to file as a foreign agent, a current Trump transition official told The Associated Press. Kian, a little-known figure active on the presidential transition team, is emerging as a key player in the political controversy involving Flynn, Trump's fired national security adviser. "He did not indicate that to us in his transition documents. We would have no reason to know," said the transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Kian's role during the post-election period. Almost two months after the transition period, both Kian and Flynn filed in March as foreign agents with the Justice Department, acknowledging their political work for Turkish-run Inovo BV could have principally benefited the government of Turkey. For Kian, who led most of Flynn Intel Group's research and lobbying for a Turkish businessman, the Trump transition role offered influence in the selection of intelligence agency candidates and access to internal discussions of U.S. national security policy. But Kian's participation in the transition — following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey's government — reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration's vetting process. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is co-sponsoring a bill to toughen regulation of Americans performing political work for foreign interests, said Tuesday it was "very troubling that an unregistered foreign agent was playing a key role in the Trump administration's transition." She added that "similar to General Flynn, someone working on behalf of foreign governments should never be put in a position where they're making important decisions within our government." An Iranian-American businessman whose full name is Bijan Rafiekian, Kian did not respond to repeated attempts over two months by the AP to contact him by phone, email and visits to properties listed for him in public records. Kian described his transition role on his LinkedIn profile as "deputy lead" assigned to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kian said he provided "policy input, strategic guidance and operational counsel to prepare" candidates for the director of national intelligence, the CIA and other top officials. Two former transition officials who met with Kian during that period said that Kian was clearly close with Flynn and served as the retired general's sounding board. One of the officials said Kian helped scrutinize then-Rep. Mike Pompeo before he was named Trump's CIA director. The second official said Kian was involved in transition discussions for the National Security Council and the director of national intelligence. That official added that Kian did not expect to get an administration post. Both transition officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the transition's work. Like Kian, Flynn also worked on the transition while he was under Justice Department scrutiny for the Turkish work. But, as the AP previously reported , Flynn did inform the Trump transition about his Turkish work through his attorneys, who notified the transition he might have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn joined the administration, his attorneys followed up with the White House counsel's office, disclosing that Flynn would indeed be registering with the government as a foreign agent. As Flynn's little-known business partner, Kian played a key role last year in supervising much of Flynn Intel Group's foreign work while the former U.S. lieutenant general campaigned for Trump. The research and lobbying they conducted for the Turkish firm has boomeranged on Flynn, now the target of a federal criminal investigation and congressional inquiries. Flynn's mishandling of his dealings with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. led to his firing in February by Trump from his post as national security adviser and is now a prime focus of special counsel Robert Mueller's wide-ranging investigation into Russian contacts with the Trump campaign. But the inquiries spawned by Flynn Intel's Turkish work pose added legal complications for both Flynn and his associates. Federal investigators are concentrating on possible criminal violations and a House oversight committee inquiry is examining Flynn's records to determine whether he lied to federal officials about his foreign contacts and payments. It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group's creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn's company and records submitted to the Justice Department. Kian connected Flynn with his Turkish client, helped to negotiate their $600,000 contract and oversaw a documentary and an op-ed aimed at an opponent of Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the client and several others who requested anonymity because of the ongoing criminal investigation. The client, Ekim Alptekin, also confirmed to the AP that Kian worked for one of his Turkish companies at the same time he was working for Flynn Intel. "Content-wise, it was Bijan handling the day-to-day details," Alptekin said during a recent interview in Washington. Alptekin told the AP he has not been contacted by federal authorities but has consulted with his U.S.-based legal team. "I'm very confident I engaged in a legal contract and was fully transparent from the beginning about what it entailed and what I was doing," he said. Flynn's attorney, Robert Kelner, did not respond to detailed questions from the AP. Kian's interests repeatedly intersected with Flynn's business ventures and political activities after Flynn, a former U.S. Army lieutenant general, left the government in 2014. Kian, a former director of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, shared Flynn's strong public opposition to Iran's theocratic government and a common interest in the development of secure communications systems. Until Trump's election, Flynn served with Kian on the board of GreenZone Systems Inc., a technology firm Kian headed until April. Flynn and Kian co-authored a 2015 op-ed about ISIS militants, and attended galas put on by the Nowruz Commission, a nonprofit run by Kian and his wife promoting the Iranian Nowruz holiday. Alptekin was named a board director of that group in 2011. For the three months leading up to the election, Kian was Flynn Intel's linchpin, lobbying and managing contractors in the Turkish work. Alptekin said Kian was the intermediary who brought Flynn's firm together last summer with Alptekin's Dutch-based company, Inovo BV. Kian was also the "main one" representing Flynn Intel in contract talks with him last fall, Alptekin said, adding Flynn "wasn't involved at all" in the talks, though he signed the contract. Inovo ended up paying Flynn Intel $530,000 for research and lobbying aimed at persuading authorities to file criminal charges against Fethullah Gulen, a political foe of Erdogan. Flynn Intel disclosed its contract and other details of its Turkish work last March to the Justice Department, which regulates lobbying and other political activities for foreign interests in the U.S. Flynn and Kian were the only individuals who personally registered as foreign agents for Inovo. Kian and Alptekin had an existing business relationship when Flynn Intel began its foreign work. Alptekin confirmed Kian had been vice chairman of his Istanbul-based aviation company, EA Havacilik, since November 2011. Alptekin said he and Kian regularly strategized to build an aviation customer base. Alptekin has denied that any of Inovo's work was done at the direction of Turkey's government, but he is a member of a foreign trade board managed by the country's economic ministry. Alptekin said he first met Kian during Kian's stint on the Export-Import bank board for the Bush and Obama administrations between 2006 and 2011. Kian promoted U.S. business interests abroad for the bank, meeting officials in Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other nations, according to State Department cables released by WikiLeaks. In his supervisory role for Flynn Intel, Kian was not always explicit about his ties to the firm, said several people who worked with him. Kian led a lobbying meeting last October with a representative of the House Homeland Security committee on behalf of GreenZone's secure communications products. But, as the AP previously reported , the session veered into a lobbying pitch for Flynn Intel, according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the meeting. Kian and others involved pressed for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen but the request went nowhere, the official said. Kian never identified who he was working for, the official said. Kian also recruited a freelance editor, Hank Cox, to fine-tune an opinion article in early November. The op-ed, praising Turkey's government as America's "strongest ally" against terrorism and pressing for Gulen's extradition, listed no author, Cox said. After he edited the article, Cox said, he sent it back, listing Kian as the writer. "I assumed since Bijan was the one who hired me, that he had written it," said Cox. Days later, Cox was baffled when he learned the op-ed had appeared under Flynn's name. "I was only vaguely aware of General Flynn at the time but I had no idea I was working for him or his company," Cox said. Flynn's firm told the Justice Department that Flynn, Kian and Cox drafted the op-ed based on the firm's research for Inovo. The firm said neither Inovo BV nor the Turkish government wrote or directed the op-ed, but Flynn Intel acknowledged it shared a draft with Inovo in advance of publication. Flynn's op-ed, published in The Hill newspaper on Election Day, drew scrutiny from the Justice Department's foreign agent unit. Pressure from those officials forced Flynn and Kian to file as foreign agents and led in part to the federal investigation now targeting Flynn. ___ Associated Press writer Julie Pace contributed to this report.

Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) included more new launches than any other single Apple event in recent history. http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/apples-latest-launches-will-keep-it-in-the-limelight-for-months-ahead-35817249.html http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/news/article35817248.ece/dd0f6/AUTOCROP/h342/2017-06-13_bus_31993649_I2.JPG Email At times, it was almost impossible to keep up. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) included more new launches than any other single Apple event in recent history. From revamped iMacs and MacBooks to a new smart speaker and umpteen big software upgrades, the reverberations from what was launched will be felt for the rest of the year. But how do the new machines and services measure up? And what do they tell us about the kind of company Apple will be in future? Here are the four most important takeaways from Apple's new offerings: 1. Apple reaffirms its faith with core Mac computers There have been insinuations floating around that Apple is fading away from its Mac and MacBook line of devices to concentrate on the category it makes most money from - iPhones. At this year's WWDC, Apple smashed this notion to bits. It unveiled a new top-end desktop computer, calling it the iMac Pro. With a 27in display, it's a beast with up to 128GB of Ram and up to 18 Intel Xeon cores, a configuration that few other computers can match. It's a little like getting a Porsche and adding a load of horsepower just for the hell of it. It's so powerful it can run two giant 5K monitors at the same time (it has a 5K display itself). As such, it's likely to appeal to media professionals and developers. Indeed, when I looked at it, Apple showed off some virtual-reality development systems that it said will suit the power of the new computer. Although set in the familiar iMac frame, the machine comes with its own distinct look. Apple has coloured the iMac Pro in a space grey matte finish. To keep it exclusive, the firm says that only iMac Pro keyboards and mice will come in this colour. It has up to four terabytes of solid state storage and 10Gb Ethernet connections for those who really need to network their devices. There's very little this sort of firepower will struggle with - forget about crashes or stalling antics. This will zip through multiple heavy workflows like lightning. It won't overheat, either, with a new, more efficient cooling system. But it won't be cheap, even for the basic configuration. Apple says it's still relatively affordable when rival systems are priced against the iMac Pro's specifications. Nevertheless, if this seems steep, Apple has updated its other iMac ranges too. All now have the new generation of Intel Kaby Lake processors and bumps in graphics, storage and software. So does this mean the iMac Pro shoves aside the Mac Pro in Apple's future computing plans? No - Apple says it is now working on a "completely redesigned, next-generation" Mac Pro that is being built for professional users. Crucially, this will be modular, something that pro users crave. (The iMac is largely a case of what you get is all you'll have: Apple doesn't let you tinker about too much with adding Ram or memory.) 2. With the new HomePod speaker, Apple is expanding into smart homes in a big way The holy grail of controlling smart-home devices has been dominated as much by voice-recognition equipped home speaker systems as by phones. Apple has finally entered the competition against Google Home and Amazon's Alexa with its new home speaker, the HomePod. Apple is positioning the 7in device as a very smart speaker that beats rivals on sound quality. But the company is also making clear that the gadget could become the voice-connected centre of emerging smart home technology for millions of people. This is largely down to the HomePod's compatibility with HomeKit, Apple's software platform that makes everyday domestic appliances work with iOS devices. In this way, the HomePod can control smart home devices by 'asking' Siri to turn on the lights, close the curtains or turn on the alarm. It can do this too when you're away from the house by using the Home app on an iPhone or iPad. It can also be used via Siri for messages, news, sport or weather. The HomePod is quite small, at only 7in tall. However, Apple claims that some high-end technology under its hood gives it an edge for audio quality. "Spatial awareness" sensors allow the HomePod to estimate how best to modify audio levels to maximise effect in any given room. One of the things Apple wants is to make the HomePod addressable from anywhere in the room, even if there's music playing fairly loudly. In this vein it has a six-microphone array to figure out whether people are nearby. As a smart speaker, it's designed for Siri to handle advanced searches within the music library. So you can ask it questions such as "Hey Siri, who's the bass player in this?". Wireless speakers are a booming tech category at present and are seen as a gateway into turning our homes into 'smart' homes. Everyday products such as light bulbs, heating systems and security alarms are increasingly being made to connect to the internet. Domestic appliances such as kettles, washing machines and fridges are also becoming wifi-connected. 3. Apple wants to become a serious player in augmented reality While Facebook, Samsung and others jump further into a virtual reality ecosystem, Apple is going squarely for an augmented reality (AR) alternative. The difference is that AR can be used on devices we already have, like iPhones, iPads and other everyday gadgets, so you don't need to don a headset to use it. At WWDC, the company launched an AR kit for iOS to let developers focus on making games and other applications. Because of its scale, Apple claims (with some accuracy) that this makes Apple the world's biggest AR platform. That doesn't mean the firm is shunning VR, though. A significant part of its pitch on its new iMacs and MacBooks is as tools for VR developers and programmers. John Knoll, chief creative officer for Industrial Light & Magic (which looks after graphics for Star Wars) was on hand to show off some gaming projects. 4. Apple knows our iPhones and iPads are filling up There are very few people who don't know the pain of handsets that won't save any more photos because they're full to the brim. To this end, Apple has increased the default (and upper) storage levels on almost all of its updated devices announced this week. This includes the iPad Pro, which now starts at 64GB and goes up to 512GB of storage. But Apple has also done more. It has re-engineered its photo and video compression rates so that both now only take up half as much space on the iPhone or iPad as they used to. It has done this, it says, without affecting the resolution or quality of the photos and videos.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars TECH Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable MORE Entertainment Science Health Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Cars Tech   Android Apple Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable More   Entertainment Science Health Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Dell, Alienware bring their E3 game on with new gear JC Torres - Jun 12, 2017 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit It definitely rocks being a gamer these past few weeks, from the gaming-centric Computex to the annual flood of E3. Of course, it’s also a perfect opportunity for hardware and accessory makers to show off their latest wares to the hungry masses. Not one to let the opportunity pass, Dell and its Alienware brand has just announced two new gaming desktops, a notebook sporting NVIDIA’s new Max-Q tech, and a couple of accessories to take your gaming to the next level. While Dell usually reserves its gaming products for its Alienware brand, it did take an unusual turn at Computex last month when it unveiled the first ever gaming desktop under the Inspiron name. It is now making that Inspiron Gaming Desktop available in the US, with a starting price of $599.99. That gets you an AMD Ryzen processor paired a choice of a Radeon RX580 or GeForce GTX 1060, packed inside a traditional tower design with Polar Blue LED lighting. Of course, Alienware has its own Area-51 gaming desktop and that is getting upgraded with new overpowered multi-core processors. And by multi-core, we mean “16 cores”! The new Area-51 is AMD’s exclusive OEM partner for bringing its new AMD Ryzen Threadripper in pre-built systems. For those from the other camp, configurations with Intel’s new Core i9 from its X-Series will also be available. The Alienware Area-51 with AMD Ryzen Threadripper comes to market on 27th July while the Intel Core X-Series models will arrive later on 22nd August. Some gamers prefer their gaming rigs to be a little more portable. For them, the new Alienware 15 might just fit the bill. The 15.6-inch laptop is equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 utilizing the company’s new Max-Q technology, promising higher performance in a smaller package. More details about this laptop will be revealed closer to its 27th June launch date. Rounding up the flood of gaming announcements are the peripherals that are sometimes just as essential as the computers themselves. The new Alienware 25-inch monitors, which come in a choice of NVIDIA G-SYNC or AMD FreeSync, boast of 240 Hz refresh rates. The Alienware Advanced Gaming Keyboard boasts of mechanical keys with brown switches that gamers just love, while the Pro Gaming Keyboard flaunts its 13 zone-based RGB AlienFX backlighting. For PC games, the mouse is just as critical as the keyboard, which is why Alienware’s Advanced Gaming Moses promises both comfort and precision with an on-the-fly DPI switch. The Elite Gaming Mouse, on the other hand, has more buttons than you might think you need, carrying 13 programmable buttons in total. All Alienware gaming peripherals are available 13th June.

Notably, the VR Challenger League purports to be the first VR-focused eSports league ever established, though it seems likely to be limited to Oculus Rift headsets for the foreseeable future. Insomniac's wizard-dueler The Unspoken (pictured) and Ready at Dawn's team-based arena baller Echo Arena (both of which are published by Oculus) will be the two VR games played in the League, and the stakeholders are promising a prize pool of over $200,000 will be up for grabs.

Don't waste our time.— Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) June 12, 2017 “I can only imagine this is part of the effort to tear down Robert Mueller,” Schiff told MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on Monday night. “You can’t exclude the possibility [of Mueller’s dismissal],” he continued. “But I think it’s just a way of raising doubts about this man who's well respected on both sides of the aisle.” ADVERTISEMENT He pledged on “Hardball” that if Trump removed Mueller, Congress would move to reappoint him to continue the investigation. A friend of Trump told PBS on Monday evening that Trump is considering firing Mueller, who is leading the FBI investigation into Russian election meddling and potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. “I think he’s considering perhaps terminating the special counsel,” Chris Ruddy told PBS’s Judy Woodruff on “PBS NewsHour.” “I think he’s weighing that option.” Ruddy, the CEO of conservative news organization NewsMax, was spotted leaving the White House earlier on Monday.

The company has now remedied that with release dates for the Core i9-7980XE 18 core, i9-7960X 16 core, i9-7940X 14 core, and i9-7920X 12 core CPUs. The 12 core model will be available first in August, with the 14, 16, and 18 core models hitting the market in October. These models join the i9-7900X and lower models that will be available sometime this month. The prices will range between $1199 for the 7920X to $1999 for the 7980XE, which puts these CPUs out of reach for most consumers. It will be interesting to see how much more performance users are able to achieve for the premium price tag. Source: The Motley Fool Email Link Print News Register as a member to subscribe comments.

Download Quick Facts What's New Alternatives 6 Download Download options: Windows 64-bit Windows 32-bit Last updated: June 12, 2017 OS: Windows Developer: Core Temp System Information License: Freeware File size: 394 KB User rating: Not rated yet from 0 votes Rate this 5 (Best) 4 3 2 1 (Worst) Found a bad link? Help us by reporting it What makes Core Temp unique is the way it works. It is capable of displaying a temperature of each individual core of every processor in your system. You can see temperature fluctuations in real time with varying workloads. Core Temp is also motherboard agnostic. Core Temp makes it easy for you to monitor the temperature of any modern x86 based processor. The program supports processors from all three major manufacturers; Intel, AMD and VIA. Intel processors starting with the "Core" series all the way up to the newest Core i7, including all the derivatives. AMD processors starting with the first Athlon64 and Opteron processor series, all Phenom and AMD's new APU are supported. VIA processors starting with the C7 generation of CPUs, including all the derivatives based on the C7 architecture. All of the Nano based processors are supported as well. The temperature readings are very accurate as the data is collected directly from a Digital Thermal Sensor (or DTS) which is located in each individual processing core*, near the hottest part. This sensor is digital, which means it doesn't rely on an external circuit located on the motherboard to report temperature, its value is stored in a special register in the processor so that software can access and read it. This eliminates any inaccuracies that can be introduced by external motherboard circuits and sensors. What's New: New: AMD Ryzen support. New: Power consumption notification area (system tray) icon. New: Intel/VIA, right click the Frequency to select which core's frequency to display. Fix: Power draw figures are only available on CPU #0 in multi processor systems. Fix: BSOD on some Intel systems. Fix: Core Temp locks up after waking up system from suspend/hibernation due to overheating protection. Fix: AMD Athlon FX-60 Dual Core recognition. Known issues: Some systems running Windows 10 Anniversary may still have driver load failure.

Hedge Fund Titan George Hall Ramps Up Holdings in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Intel Corporation (INTC) support@smarteranalyst.com (Ben Mahaney) SmarterAnalyst June 12, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Hedge fund manager George Estes Hall has demonstrated a bullish outlook towards three key tech stocks in Q1 2017 according to 13F forms filed by Clinton Group with the SEC. He ramped up the $1.72 billion fund’s holdings of volatile semiconductor stock Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), as well as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). George Estes Hall holds three of the fund’s major positions; he is President, CEO and Chief Investment Officer at Clinton Group. As a result, Hall has the final say on the firm’s investment and trading decisions, risk management and quantitative analysis. Hall’s expertise comes from his time as CEO of ROIC Acquisition Holdings and CIO of ROI Acquisition Corp. Previous to this Hall owned Axiom Bank and working in mortgage securities at CitiCorp. Hall, who graduated from the Wharton School of Business, takes a long-term approach towards hedge funds: “It’s easy to forget about the bear markets we’ve had, and how terrible they’ve been. In terms of the typical retail investor, I think with hedge funds the market needs more time to shake out some of the people who are not going to be successful.” In terms of the fund, Clinton Group has a specific investing philosophy that involves both a fundamental and quantitative approach. Intriguingly, the fund has developed its own data-intensive quantitative equity strategy based on ten years of actual “time-tested” trading. The method uses statistical arbitrage and adaptive systems to find patterns that it believes can identify return-drivers for specific stocks and sectors. On the fundamental side the fund says it has a “unique macro vantage point” from which to source attractive opportunities. In particular, the fund tries to use “deep research” and opportunistic trading to optimize the portfolio without incurring too much risk. Now let’s see how this strategy and these ambitions played out in three of the fund’s key Q1 moves: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. In Q1, Hall upped the fund’s holding in AMD by 15%, which is about 22,800 shares. The fund’s holding now stands at close to 180,000 shares with a value of $2,616,556. AMD has just received a boost from giant Apple in its fight against fellow chipmaker Nvidia. Apple is using AMD’s Radeon cards AMD’s for its latest iMac computers including the 4K and 5K Retina iMac. The biggest news however is that the new iMac Pro out in December will feature AMD’s Radeon Pro Vega graphics card. This is a real coup for AMD because Apple is touting the $4,999 Pro as its most powerful computer yet, and this is also its much-hyped offering for creative professionals. On the news- announced at Apple’s recent WWDC 2017 conference- shares in AMD surged by over 7%. Shares are also up due to rumored product sellouts and increased demand from a booming cryptocurrency market. The stock has a hold analyst consensus rating. TipRanks reveals that in the last three months, the stock has received 6 buy, 9 hold and 3 sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $11.70 now stands at close to 5% below the current share price of $12.28. View photos Read More NVIDIA Corporation Hall also displayed a bullish outlook towards AMD rival Nvidia, increasing the fund’s holding in the stock by a whopping 1597% (about 45,447 shares) to a $5,260,556 position, which makes up about 0.3% of the total portfolio. An opposing view has just been revealed by famous blogger Andrew Left of Citron Research. He surprised the market by publishing a bearish call on the stock on June 9. He believes shares will fall back to $130- approximately $20 below their current price. Shares in Nvidia more than tripled last year, which has led to an undercurrent of concern that the stock is overvalued. On the news shares fell by 8%. Left- who is personally short Nvidia- wrote that although Nvidia is a “wonderful” company it has now become a “casino stock” with tough competition ignored and the market over optimistic that gains can continue especially as gaming growth decelerates (down 24%- gaming makes up 55% of NVDA’s revenue). His move is at odds with most of the major banks which have been busy upping their price targets on the stock- for example Merrill Lynch’s Vivek Arya just raised his price target from $155 to an incredible $185 (the Street’s highest price target).  Left recommends leaving Nvidia for a stock like Alphabet which has similar exposure to tech stocks but without the risk due to its much higher core value. Citron Research has a strong track record according to TipRanks which places the financial blogger at #569 out of 6,005 bloggers tracked by the financial accountability engine. Indeed, Citron- which correctly predicted the demise of healthcare calamity Valeant- has a 63% success rate and 11.6% average return per recommendation. Interestingly, the vast majority of the tech-focused blogger’s ratings are a sell- 90% to just 2% buy ratings. Nvidia has a moderate buy analyst consensus rating on TipRanks based on the 13 buy, 8 hold and 2 sell ratings the stock has received over the last three months. At the same time, the average analyst price target of nearly $137 stands at a considerable -5.58% from the current share price. View photos Intel Corporation Hall completed the trio by initiating a new holding in Intel with the purchase of 65,000 shares worth $2,368,068. Intel has just released its new Skylake Core X-series processor family at the Computex conference in Taipei. The new processor is intended for high-end gamers and is based on 2nd-generation 14nm Skylake architecture. Five-star Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Ramsay reiterated his hold rating on the stock 12 days ago with a $38 price target (6.4% upside) due to stagnating gross margins. Ramsay says the processor is impressive but predicts Intel’s “PC revenue will remain in a modest secular decline” of around 3%. He says declines would be faster but Intel has a strong portfolio lineup. Smaller rival AMD could also provide competition. Ramsay says AMD's new 14nm Ryzen processor lineup offers “both competitive performance metrics and aggressive pricing and could take incremental share from Intel starting in Q3/17”. He is now looking for Intel to deliver returns not from just PCs and servers. Ramsay is the #39 analyst out of 4,560 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Like Nvidia, Intel has a moderate buy analyst consensus rating on TipRanks. In the last three months, the stock has received 11 buy, 7 hold and 2 sell ratings. The average analyst price target of $40.50 paints a more positive picture than for the other two stocks with potential upside of 13% from the current share price of $36.

The company is staggering the release dates over several months, and it's saving the best—the monster 18-core Extreme Edition—for last.  On Monday at the E3 show in Los Angeles, Intel said you'll be able to buy the lower-end 4-core, 8-core, and 10-core Core i9s as soon as next week. The mid-range 12-core Core i9-7920X will be next, shipping in August. The fastest of the Core i9 family will go on sale in October. Specifically, the 14-core Core i9-7940X, the 16-Core Core i9-7960X, and the 18-core Core i9-7980XE Extreme Edition will be available about the time you're planning your Halloween costume.  Intel Intel hasn't disclosed the final clock speed on its CPUs that have 12-cores and up yet. The delay until fall for the highest-end Core i9 chips means AMD and its 16-core Ryzen Threadripper will likely have a head start. AMD has been coy with details, but we do know the number of cores, the number of PCIe lanes, and the vague due date of "this summer." Unless the 10-core Core i9 can pull a rabbit out of the hat, there's a very good chance AMD's 16-core Threadripper will be the first to dominate CPUs in multi-threaded tasks.  To comment on this article and other PCWorld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Over the next few slides we’ll unveil the return of a real-time strategy giant, a neon-lit 2D platformer, an anthropomorphic isometric hack ‘n’ slasher and a multiplayer shooter with eyes on triple-A stardom. Oh, and a game that’s basically Harvest Moon meets Pokemon.  Who says PC games are all the same, eh? Prev Page 1 of 11 Next Prev Page 1 of 11 Next Ooblets Some games just want to be nice, wrapped in bubble wrap and cotton candy and surrounded by kittens.  One of those games is the very cute and oh-so-sickly sweet Ooblets - which looks and plays a bit like a cross between The Sims, Pokemon and Harvest Moon.  Sound weird? Just wait until you see it in motion - it’s certainly  one of the odder things you’ll see at E3 this year. Ooblets tasks you with managing your own farm, growing and training your titular Ooblets and heading out to explore the world around you.  You even get to run a shop then head off to travel strange new lands, battle wild Ooblets and other Ooblet trainers, and unlock the mysteries of Oob. Sounds a lot like Pokemon, doesn’t it? But hey, if you’re going to take inspiration, it might as well be from the best. Ooblets due out on Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2018. Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Prev Page 2 of 11 Next Total Warhammer 2 The second part of a planned trilogy of real-time strategy games from Creative Assembly, Total Warhammer 2 will feature four new races at launch.  You can play as the savage Lizardmen, the regal High Elves, the shadowy Dark Elves and a mysterious fourth race yet to be revealed. These four races will feature in the story mode, but CA has confirmed that all the races you owned in the first game will be unlocked for multiplayer in this grand Warhammer sequel. We’re told the game's campaign will be a lot more narrative-driven  than the sandbox campaign of the first game, with each race battling to save or destroy the Great Vortex over Ulthuan.  Gameplay will tighter and faster, with a greater emphasis on bringing out the diversity in each race. CA are the masters of real-time strategy, so we can’t wait to take Total Warhammer 2 when it arrives 28 September 2017. Prev Page 3 of 11 Next Prev Page 3 of 11 Next Tunic Formerly known as Secret Legend, Tunic might just be the cutest isometric hack ‘n’ slasher we’ve ever seen.  As an anthropomorphic fox dressed as a knight, Tunic tasks you we slashing your way past puzzles, locating new weapons and taking on a variety of enemies with a combat model that rewards well-timed dodges and parries. Think the old Redwall books or the excellent virtual tabletop game Armello and Tunic’s frankly gorgeous polygonal art style will pull you in immediately.  Coming off the excellent and bright Rime, the sheer amount of colour bursting off screen is a joy. There’s a Metroidvania-feel at work here as well, with certain paths blocked unless you locate a certain weapon or tool. Tunic is definitely one to watch. No word on a release date as yet. Prev Page 4 of 11 Next Prev Page 4 of 11 Next BattleTech Based on the classic tabletop game of the same name, BattleTech  is an upcoming turn-based strategy game which successfully funded its development through Kickstarter (including a full single-player campaign, an expansion for that very story and a new PvP multiplayer mode).  The team behind it also includes devs who've worked on MechCommander and MechAssault, so you know this team loves its mechs. The big focus for BattleTech is tactically targeting certain  components on your opponent and stripping away their armour so certain weapons or limbs can be disarmed and removed.  Not only does this slow down your foe, but it enables you to salvage these parts to repair and upgrade your own BattleTech mech post-battle. Each mech contains 11 armour points and layers of inner components, so planning your strikes is key to BattleTech glory. It’s due later this year. Prev Page 5 of 11 Next Prev Page 5 of 11 Next The Last Night The neon-drenched, pixel-art 2D platformer The Last Night has already proved one of the biggest sleeper hits of E3 2017.  Drawing inspiration from the Oddworld games of old, the game is part platformer and part point-and-click adventure, with a big focus on real-time puzzles (such as breaking into a certain room or  reaching an area unnoticed). The game is set across multiple nights, with NPCs that actively remember your actions from previous encounters - so if you cut a dialogue halfway through, that character will remember it and act ruder to you the next time you cross paths.  There’s combat there, too, although we’re most excited to see this Blade Runner-esque story unfold when it arrives next year on Xbox One and Windows 10. Prev Page 6 of 11 Next Prev Page 6 of 11 Next Echo Arena/Lone Echo Coming from Ready At Dawn, the studio that brought us the PSP God of War games and the poorly received (but utterly beautiful to look at) The Order 1886 on PS4, Echo Arena is one of the first proper second-generation VR titles and serves as a sister title to RAD’s other project, a poignant Adr1ft-style narrative in space. What makes Echo Arena that little bit more intriguing is its fast-based VR action (think of it as zero-G ultimate frisbee) and the fact it’s free (for a limited time) on Oculus Rift.  Yes, actual free for your super-powered VR headset. The mode also serves as a poster boy for Intel’s new eSports league in partnership  with ESL. No word yet on when either project will arrive on Oculus Rift. Prev Page 7 of 11 Next Prev Page 7 of 11 Next Grift Lands Klei, the makers of the brutal yet endlessly addictive Don’t Starve and Don’t Starve Together, has just unveiled its long-teased new IP, a sci-fi RPG called Grift Lands.  With a unique art style that’s part The Banner Saga, part comic series Saga, Grift Lands looks to contain a galaxy-crossing story with side-on team-based and turn-based combat. It’s certainly a step away from the studio’s work on the Don’t Starve series, but even with only a few details teased and a short trailer, Grift Lands has already generated a huge wave of hype. It’s due out next year (we hope) and you can check out its teaser trailer right now. Prev Page 8 of 11 Next Prev Page 8 of 11 Next Y-Lands Despite being known for the military shooter series Arma,  developer Bohemia has been working on something very different in the form of Y-Lands (pronounced ‘aye-lands’).  Think of it as Bohemia’s attempt to marry the crafting creativity of Minecraft with the deeper systems the studio has become known for with the Arma games. Y-Lands attempts to offer a lot of content, with crafting, exploration, randomly-generated areas and both singleplayer and multiplayer content. The game is due to hit Steam Early Access later this year, but in the meantime you can sign up to play Y-Lands alpha, which is currently up and running.  Any title attempting to play Minecraft at its own game often comes up short (just look at Lego Worlds), but Arma is a very talented studio and the cartoony art style of Y-Lands could help it over the hill. We’re just concerned it’s not offering too much as to put off casual players. Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Prev Page 9 of 11 Next Age of Empires: Definitive Edition 2017 marks the 20th anniversary of Age of Empires, the classic RTS that helped make PC gaming what it is today, and what better way to reminisce on the good old days than a fully remastered version for the modern era?  That’s right, Age of Empires: Definitive Edition sees the original game remastered in 4K, with manual zoom control, a fully re-recorded soundtrack and enhanced gameplay across the board. We’d heard rumours that Microsoft had something big planned  for the Age of Empires brand in time for the anniversary, and it looks like it has more news planned for GamesCom in August.  We’re pretty confident to hedge our bets that we might just be seeing Age of Empires 4 before the year is out. Age of Empires Definitive  Edition will launch later this year, and you can sign up to the Beta via ageofempires.com. Prev Page 10 of 11 Next Prev Page 10 of 11 Next LawBreakers LawBreakers, the long-gestating arena shooter from Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski, finally has a release date as it gears up for release on Windows 10 and PS4.  According to the potty-mouthed creator and head of Boss Key Productions, the game will arrive in full on 8 August with a price tag of $30 (expect it to be slightly less in UK Sterling). There won’t be any cross-platform play between users shooting it up on PS4 and Windows 10 (boo), but Bleszinski did confirm the game is getting a closed Beta on 28 June and an open Beta on 29 June.  LawBreakers, with its gravity-defying action, could be a hit if Boss Key manages to iron out the kinks we’ve seen so far.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The latest scandal to rock the Intel World concerns the actions of the newest member of the hall of shame — Reality Winner. Her overly muscled visage, along with excerpts from her reckless social media accounts, were trending last week for about 17 minutes. Already she has fallen down the media memory hole, to no doubt resurface (a bit) once her trial actually begins. Notwithstanding its obscurity, I find this incident very troubling — as should any professional in the intelligence community. And the reason for this bad feeling I have isn't going away. I am afraid she's the proverbial canary in the coal mine. This is the type of discussion that will only occur, and rarely at that — in hushed tones within the intelligence community (IC) — for anyone who would address what I believe is a true "reality" problem in the IC would soon find themselves out of a job. Thus, it's not a very politcally correct endeavor. The problem, showcased most recently by the deluded Ms. Winner, is that the U.S. intelligence community, along with the U.S. military and every other institution, is now reaping the bitter harvest of a liberal, progressive educational system. I am sure we all can agree that the IC and the military should be a mirror to U.S. society —and I believe we are getting just that. I fear, however, that down the line, we are not going to like what we see in that mirror. Mind you, what I am talking about is a general, long term trend — there remain, and will always be, professional patriots motivated to serve our country in all its forms — but over time I believe these people will become progressively harder to find and or recruit — and the quality of our security institutions will fade. Think of it as the equivalent of a slowly declining standard. For example, 30 years ago, the FBI, CIA, and other agencies, could immediately rule out any applicant who indicated any drug use. This standard was subsequently relaxed into accepting applicants who admitted isolated, experimental drug use. In our present overly-medicated society, even that standard has been difficult for agencies to uphold — especially those seeking to expand, such as the United States Secret Service. Other standards have been relaxed,  including the acceptance of "alternative lifestyles," a process which accelerated in the early 2000s. More ominously, as described by retired Senior CIA Analyst Fred Fleitz.  Former CIA Director John O. Brennan announced his "Diversity and Inclusion Strategy (2016–2019)" to make the CIA more diverse and politically correct. Brennan has mandated "diversity and inclusion performance objectives for all CIA managers and supervisors and ultimately [for] the entire workforce," so that CIA personnel must weigh diversity and gender figures in making key assignments and senior-level promotions." We are treading in dangerous territory once we make the mission of any government agency social engineering rather than its proper function. Ask the Marine Corps. As ill-advised as some (but not all) of these reforms have been, what is even more troubling is that our society is now receiving the fruits of a watered-down liberal education system, namely the millions of millennials currently entering the work force. The generations-long process of declining SAT numbers and reduced critical thinking skills are making themselves felt.  It's clear that I am not the only one seeing this. It is also being increasingly noticed by business leaders nationwide. Whereas some may disagree with the liberal progressive label I have placed on it — these people are wrong, thank you — few can argue with its effects. With our universities now hotbeds of intolerance and groupthink, where are our intelligence services headed? To ask the question is to answer it. New millenial members of the intelligence community (or military, or what have you) have been taught more liberal doctrine than their predecessors. They are more often easily manipulated by the mainstream media, forces of political correctness or whomever (critical thinking again!), and have sometimes radically different values regarding patriotism, transparency, etc.  Even someone such as former CIA Director Michael Hayden, has discussed this "challenge" peripherally.  So we have a markedly different millennial workforce entering the fray, along with external factors enabling a "leaker culture." When you expose these individuals to a stridently politically correct environment, like that found within goverment, combine it with the present "resist" movement — What are you going to get? When former Director Comey, without shame, admits to personally leaking info, or former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lies to Congress, what goes through the mind of someone like, for example, Reality Winner? Someone brainwashed by the liberal narrative, intellectually incurious, deprived of critical thinking skills — then placed in a position of trust in a toxic political environment — becomes a recipe for disaster. I am not absolving Ms. Winner, just lamenting the bitter harvest we reap due to the forces of political correctness. For those who would challenge my words, I know of what I speak. In addition to graduate teaching at New York University (NYU) where a conservative professor is about as common as an albino Sasquatch, I have substitute-taught in my local, rural Pennsylvania high school. I have seen this sort of liberalism firsthand. I don't know how many times students have approached me after class to thank me for bringing a more conservative perspective to their history or literature classes. Many young people recognize they are slowly force fed an unending liberal agenda - but there is no alternative. If it’s this bad in rural Pennsylvannia, how is it in New York, or God forbid, California? The future will bring many more Reality Winners. Millennials will soon dominate the U.S. workforce. No counterintelligence system in the world can compensate for the fact conservatives long ago abdicated the education field of battle to the forces of liberal progressivism.

Intel, Oculus, and ESL have partnered up to bring us, the people, a bunch of VR and eSports-related goodies. Easily the most interesting aspect is that Echo Arena, a competitive VR title, will be free for a limited time when it launches on the Oculus Rift. The title is essentially that space sports game from Ender's Game. You know, "the enemy's gate is down," that one. In addition to free stuff, the partnership is bringing a "Grand Slam" of eSports, where teams can compete in multiple tournaments throughout the year to earn a cash bonus of $1M. Probably not as great as Denny's Grand Slam, but whatever. There's also a "VR Challenger League" featuring Echo Arena and The Unspoken, the finals of which will be held in Poland next year. As for me, I'm just excited to see people try and be competitive in VR, a growing and sometimes unresponsive technology. You are logged out.

The top salary offered this year was an annual package of $180,000 (about ₹1.15 crore), he said without divulging the company’s name. There was an increase in average and median salary by about 5 per cent, he said. Citicorp (23 students), Samsung R&D (20), Cognizant Technology Solutions (19) and Eaton (19) were the other top recruiters, he told BusinessLine. The number of start-ups that came for campus placement dropped to 53 from 139 in the previous year, he said. “After several start-ups failed to keep their promises following the offers, students and placement office were a lot more cautious in inviting start-ups this year. This may be one of the reasons for the decline in the number of start-ups coming for campus placement. Those students who could not get into start-ups were given an opportunity this year during placement,” he said. However, the lower number of start-ups was compensated by more hardcore technology companies such as Intel and public sector undertakings (PSUs) participating in large numbers. Some of the top IT service companies, which are bulk recruiters, did not participate for the last couple of years, he said. This year, eight PSUs, including ISRO, Coal India, HPCL and ONGC, selected a total of 39 students as against three PSUs and 19 students last year, he said. Some of the companies were from sectors like analytic, consulting, education, finance and information technology, he said. Santhanam said, while a majority of graduating students are placed through campus placement, some job opportunities come up through their respective department faculty via out-of-placement offers. Exit data The exit data collected before 2016 convocation showed that the entire graduating class had either been placed, opted for higher studies or started their careers as entrepreneurs. The current year’s exit data will be available in August, he said.

It’s not that TI is indifferent to autonomy. It’s just that TI, one of the leading automotive chip suppliers, sees a different way to get there. Its plan is to use its current ADAS-focused platform to eventually enable Level 4, Level 5 autonomous car. In a recent interview with EE Times, Brooke Williams, business manager in the automotive ADAS business unit at Texas Instruments, said TI has been actively participating in carmakers’ RFQs on models four to five years out. Some of the RFQs are for Level 4 and Level 5 autonomous cars. Others address ADAS features to achieve 5-star ratings. “We support all of their requests,” said Williams. Above all, TI’s priority is responding to “needs for system-level safety across the board” — all cars, all models, according to Williams. TI’s strengths lie in 30 years of ASIL D-level safety experience and a litany of TI technologies that include power management, analog devices, networking solutions such as LVDS and Ethernet, and sensors including radars, he said. The only automotive electronics devices TI doesn’t offer are CMOS image sensors and memory. This “system-level safety” argument might seem to be just TI talking points. But the company’s financial results demonstrate how well a modest strategy — focused more on Level 2 autonomous cars — has worked so far. TI reported in April better-than-expected first quarter revenue growth driven primarily by strong sales to the automotive and industrial markets. Phil Magney, founder and principal advisor for Vision Systems Intelligence (VSI), noted, “TI does not subscribe to massive architectural overhauls.” He pointed out, “For TI, it is all about incremental ADAS features which become the enablers to automation. TI is not concerned with L4 and L5 at the moment. In time their architectures will support advanced levels of automation but for now they are targeting automotive safety and convenience features because that is where the money is.” ‘No wholesale change in platform’ OK. So, today’s TI is all about ADAS. But really, what are the plans, if any, for TI to shift its current ADAS platform to Level 4/Level 5 autonomy? During the interview, TI’s Williams noted, “We don’t believe a wholesale change in the platform is needed” to add autonomy to cars. That view, however, has triggered a host of questions from automotive industry analysts.

Convenience always wins, if the average Joe can TXT or apply makeup while driving, there is no debate. Studies on the matter are highly flawed as you ask the average person to imagine an extraordinary situation and answer quickly with minimal info. On legislation, the Trump administration might get rid of any regulations, so that's a plus (LOL) but , at the end of the day, the economic and social benefits are too large to ignore. Crashes can lead to complication and any delays they might cause are hard to predict. Including something that reminded me of conversations here on regulators. http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/24866-new-way-to-test-self-driving-cars-could-cut-99-9-percent-of-validation-costs On Intel's study i still think that they are off by 15-20 years and i highly doubt that cars will exist by 2050. Would be truly sad if they do as they are so inefficient.- 2000kg of metal to transport 100kg of water. This is a longer conversation but by that time robots will be smarter than humans and we still can't do better than cars? What i don't get, at all, is what arguments do people have when they claim ownership will survive. or even dominate. You bring up legal and acceptance as issues but those relate to autonomy not the business model. if we accept that L4/L5 is here and legal between 2020-2025, what stops the shift in business model. I can't come up with any scenario that keeps ownership alive, aside from the one I mention in the previous comment. If the 2020-2025 timing seems too aggressive, in 10-15 years our glasses need to be smarter than these cars- they need to understand what the user is looking at and a context aware UI is a must. This is automation not AI, it's the easy part (LOL). From a certain point progress is exponential and i think folks have figured out what is needed for autonomy and now they can focus on efficiency. Data collection is getting there too as the number of cars able to collect such data increases rapidly.

Big if, however, still hangs in the balance of legislations (how long will it take?) and people's acceptance of robo-cars, in my humble opinion. I also found it interesting, when Intel and Strategy Analytics put together Passenger economy report recently, they chose the year 2050 as a base year for Passenger Economy predictions. While I am not knocking autonomous cars, I think there is a lot more than we care to admit that we don't know about which way and how fast this market is moving.   Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author maybe alex_m1   6/12/2017 4:11:19 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate They seem to have a shrewd approach, but than reading this quote: >> For the next couple of decades, cars will largely be sold to individual buyers  Gives the impression that they are unrealistic, in the name of protecting the business(how much of TI's biz depends on private cars? ) . Heck, realistically, even without L4/L5 , we'll probably see on-demand shared transportation(like ford chariot's shuttles), replacing a lot of private cars, pretty soon. And electric vehicles, with the much higher lifetime would be an issue too.      Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank CEO ... realjjj   6/12/2017 3:31:41 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate Magney said, "I think L2/L3 is going to be a hot market for a long time." Despite high hopes for the emergence of Mobility as a service applications, he cautioned, "For the next couple of decades, cars will largely be sold to individual buyers like they have been."   The only way ownership works is if the hardware becomes much cheaper than current cars. The issue is that the said hardware has to be electric and autonomous since that's the only way to achieve much lower op costs. Could one make an electric autonomous Corolla and sell it at 8k$? Even if one could do that, a service can provide more comfort (slightly nicer car for the same price due to higher efficiencies), more convenience (no need for a parking spot, maintenance and so on) plus a faster cadence for new and improved hardware (every 2 years not 5-10 years). Guess a collapse in electricity prices could help ownership to some extent but it would have to be a very large one. L2/L3 would become low end very quickly as it lacks in comfort and convenience vs L4/L5 but low end is addressing the more cost sensitive customers so those that will migrate to CaaS very fast if possible- basically just low end rural remains as a market for L2/L3 in the long run. You could also look at it another way, leasing could be considered a service and that's already some 25% of the market in the US and over 30% when it comes to just retail. Public transport and taxis are services too so all added up, services are already holding a substantial share. Going from here to over 50% of the market is a blink of an eye once the necessary legislation arrives. Smartphone sales in 2008 were some 140 million units and some folks still expected the PC market to reach 500 million units by 2015. Look where those markets are today, with smartphones outselling PCs 6 to 1. Disruption is never slow once the cat is out of the bag and we should never forget that.

It was the first meeting of Trump’s full cabinet, and POTUS kicked things off blaming Senate Dems “which I call The Obstructionists.” Related Stephen Colbert Casts Hugh Jackman To Play Him In Donald Trump Probe Movie Trump’s getting-back-to-work photo op kicked off a week in which he’s under siege due to the Russia investigation. One the cabinet members present, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, will publicly testify before the Senate Intel Committee about his various meetings with Russians while serving as a member of Trump’s transition team. Sessions had recused himself from Russia probe matters, after failing to disclose two meetings with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. on his security-clearance paperwork and during Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings. Last week, former FBI Director James Comey reportedly told the intel committee during a closed hearing about a possible third Sessions meeting with the ambassador. In a 23-minute ring-kissing ceremony, each member of Trump’s cabinet gave the various reasons in which they are thankful to be members of Trump’s team and the good deeds the administration had done to date on their watch. Sessions said it was great to be there to attest to the support Trump has from law enforcement “all over America. “They have been very frustrated…They are so thrilled we have a new idea that we are going to support them and work together to properly, lawfully fight the rising crime we have seen.” Sessions voted to “serve you in that regard” and commended Trump for “sending the exact right message and response that has been fabulous around the country.” Sessions is expected to be asked tomorrow if there is a recording system in the White House – Trump having tweeted after sacking Comey that he’d better hope there are no tapes of his conversations with Trump before Comey thinks about talking publicly about his sacking. Last week Comey, who had taken notes immediately after his conversations with Trump, testified that POTUS’s tweeted threat about tapes caused him to give some of his memos to a friend, who leaked the information contained to The New York Times. Sessions is on thin ice with Trump. POTUS took to Twitter to trash DOJ and the revisions on his “travel ban” after the latest London attack, and reportedly is angry Sessions recused himself from Russia probes.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars GAMES Best of E3 2017 so far: from A Way Out to Wolfenstein 2 Dean Takahashi@deantak June 12, 2017 10:01 AM Above: Star Wars Battlefront II Image Credit: EA It’s only been a couple of days, but we’ve been through three intense briefing events so far even before the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the big game tradeshow in Los Angeles, kicks off Tuesday. Today, we’ll hit the Intel press event, the PC Gaming Show, the Microsoft hands-on Xbox showcase, the Ubisoft press briefing, and the Sony press event. So we’ve still got a lot of games to see. But we’ve been to the Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Bethesda events already. (Click on these links if you want to see everything each company showed). Here’s the best announcements at E3 so far. Square Enix issues new trailer for Kingdom Hearts III GamesBeat’s Mike Minotti was asleep at the time. But Square Enix finally showed its progress on Kingdom Hearts III, the latest mashup of Disney and Final Fantasy characters. It’s been in the works for four years, and the new game will feature plenty of action. Electronic Arts Hands-on with Star Wars: Battlefront II EA showed off the gameplay of the game’s multiplayer, and we got to play a couple of sessions. It proved to be surprisingly accessible and fun, as you can earn enough points in a match to become a hero, or villain, like Darth Maul.  Star Wars: Battlefront II launches on November 17 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. A Way Out, the new EA Originals game from Hazelight Josef Fares is one of the creators of Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Now funded by EA, his Hazelight studio showed a first look at A Way Out, a creative co-op game where you control one of two characters who must escape from a prison and evade capture. The game moves seamlessly from fullscreen cinematics to split screen gameplay as you escape the prison, rob a gas station, or escape from a hospital. Fares says there is nothing like it, or you can break his legs. BioWare’s Anthem reveal EA’s BioWare is investing heavily in a secret game, and now we know it’s a new science fiction third-person shooter. Microsoft Xbox One X debuts on November 7 for $499 We all knew the Xbox One X was coming, but Microsoft finally confirmed its price and launch date. It’s going to be the most powerful game console ever launched, with 6 teraflops of processing power. Ubisoft confirms Assassin’s Creed Origins Now you can go stealth in the Nile River and ambush alligators or Egyptian soldiers alike. We’ve got some more coverage of this game today Original Xbox titles will get the backward-compatible treatment Now you can play your original Xbox games on the Xbox One S and Xbox One X. Sea of Thieves Hilariously, you’ll be able to board other ships by shooting yourself out of a cannon and flying over to land on the enemy’s deck. Sea of Thieves is going to give us a lot of laughs as we venture out onto the high seas as pirates. Other notable reveals included Forza Motorsport 7, Metro Exodus, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Life is Strange: Before the Storm, Shadow of War, and Crackdown 3. Bethesda Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus This action-packed sequel will make first-person shooter fans happy. The trailer was as well done as any, showing what an alternative universe would be like if the Nazis won World War II and took over the United States. It’s a creepy idea full of creepy enemies and monsters from Nazi experiments. It is coming out on October 27 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The Evil Within 2 Talk about creepy. The Evil Within was high on both creativity and grotesque horror, and the sequel shows that it will carry on with that. It captures your morbid curiosity about the nightmarish imagery at the same time it repulses you. For horror fans, it may be just what the creepy doctor ordered. It is coming out for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Doom VFR and Fallout 4 VR Bethesda’s lawyers may be at war with Facebook’s Oculus VR division, but that doesn’t mean the company doesn’t support virtual reality. Both Doom and Fallout are getting the VR treatment, and they will immerse players in some very realistic-looking worlds. While Microsoft didn’t show off its VR headset, Bethesda’s support for VR shows the new platform is moving forward.

Microsoft has moved a little slower—four years between the Xbox One and Xbox One X this autumn—but that’s still pretty quick in the world of consoles, especially if you factor in the slim refreshes that appeared last year. As a reminder, there were seven years between the PS3 and PS4, and eight years between the Xbox 360 and One. While the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X have substantially different innards from their predecessors, they can still run all of the same games, but usually at a lower resolution and with a few graphics toggles switched off. With previous console iterations this wasn’t usually possible—a new console meant entirely new CPU, RAM, storage—unless the console maker went through the pain of including backwards compatibility. Now, though, the PlayStation and Xbox have finally ascended to x86—the one true architecture—and they’re reaping the benefits of a standardised, genericised, well-supported environment with lots of competitive players. There are still some hardware differences between these consoles and your desktop PC, but they’re relatively minor. If Microsoft or Sony want to boost their consoles’ performance, they simply buy a faster or larger x86-64 CPU from AMD or Intel. Ditto the graphics chip: just go and ask Nvidia or AMD for something with more cores, then slot it in. This is a gross simplification, but it is essentially what Microsoft and Sony did with the Xbox One X and PS4 Pro. For a relatively small investment (new industrial design, new logic board, some other small tweaks) they now have new, significantly differentiated products that can be sold at higher price points. And they will do it again a few years from now. Everything will shuffle down the product stack: the Xbox One S will be a little cheaper; the Xbox One X will drop down to the £250/$300 price point currently occupied by the Xbox One S; and then there’ll be a new more powerful console at the top end, the xXbox One Xx. I could be wrong; maybe Microsoft or Sony will go down another path eventually. But it seems unlikely, now that they’ve found themselves in the mid-range x86 sweet spot. It would be like Intel or AMD switching from x86-64 to a brand new architecture called Bitanium, because Bitanium is technically better than x86—but that would never happen because the x86 ecosystem is just so damn mature. A more likely scenario would be the console makers, perhaps in partnership with the chip makers, developing specialist extensions like SSE2 or AVX. Xbox++ Such a massive change to the console industry will have massive repercussions—though it’s hard to predict what they might be. There are too many variables. How will consumers react to a new console being released every three years? (The PS4 Pro seems to be doing okay so far.) How will Sony, Microsoft, and games developers handle the widening performance gap between new and old consoles? Will there always a shiny technological curio (4K, HDR) to push consumers towards a more expensive device? And what about PC gaming? PC gaming has enjoyed a period of growth over the last few years, mostly off the back of big free-to-play games like Dota 2 and League of Legends, plus the general expansion of the industry and the number of top-notch games. But what will happen as games consoles become more powerful? In an interview last year, the head of Sony Interactive Entertainment Andrew House said the PS4 Pro was primarily designed to win over PC gamers, rather than to drive the knife further into Microsoft. “I saw some data that really influenced me,” House said. “It suggested that there’s a dip mid-console lifecycle where the players who want the very best graphical experience will start to migrate to PC, because that’s obviously where it’s to be had. We wanted to keep those people within our eco-system by giving them the very best and very highest [performance quality].” Microsoft has quite different intentions than Sony—it also wins if people buy Windows PCs for gaming—but the net result is much the same: a couple of years from now, Sony will probably release a console capable of true 4K @ 60 FPS across a range of games for £450/$500. Further Reading Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti review: The fastest graphics card. Again.For many PC gamers it’s about much more than just graphics quality, and they won’t be moved by a cheap 4K games console. But next year, when I look at building a 4K-capable gaming rig or a friend asks me for some 4K buying advice, and I add up the cost of the components and arrive at a figure north of £1,000… well, that decision is going to be a lot trickier than I ever thought it would be.

Moravian Academy student Neil Deshmukh, 14, of Macungie, placed second in his category at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.(Courtesy photo) By Sara K. Satullo ssatullo@lehighvalleylive.com, For lehighvalleylive.com Visiting his grandparents in India, Neil Deshmukh saw firsthand how easily an undetected crop disease could wipe out his grandparent's harvest. Folks in first-world countries take it for granted that they can turn to Google to diagnose their crops and their own maladies. But for people living in other parts of the world a reliable Internet connection is not guaranteed, he said. This led the 14-year-old Moravian Academy student to spend months developing SCIN, a cellphone app, that can be used offline once it is downloaded, to detect 46 plant diseases and 23 skin diseases, including melanoma. The app just earned him a second place win in the systems software category at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in Los Angeles. More than 1,700 students from more than 70 countries around the world compete. Deshmukh and Parkland High School student Farid Shahid are the only two Lehigh Valley students to place at the Delaware Valley Science Fair and then go on to Intel. They placed first and second, respectively, at the regional fair. Shahid developed an improved windmill blade design that generates 111 percent more power than the conventional industry blades. He is in the process of patenting the technology and then hopes to get some windmill blade makers to test it out.  "The blade design was pure trial and error. I just had a suspicion that a prong-shaped tip would improve the performance," Shahid, 15, said. "I did go through over 100 blades before I found out (I was right.)" Bethlehem honors MIA soldier whose helicopter went down in Vietnam War Both students spent hours and hours teaching themselves about their chosen topics and testing their theories.  Shahid made all of the test blades by hand through various methods and then measured the voltage they generated when put onto a blade hub. It took him a year to find the winning design. Shahid was inspired to improve renewable energy options after reading news coverage and realizing how dependent the world is on fossil fuels. "I thought it would just help the world," he said. Parkland High School student Farid Shahid, 15, is show at the Intel fair.Contributed photo  To develop the cell phone app, Deshmukh, who just finished ninth grade, had to build a convolutional neural network. He describes it as a technological brain, which he trained to recognize disease by showing it 500,000 images of plant and skin diseases. "Let's say I give it a melanoma and it discovers key aspects of melanoma," Deshmukh said. "It can use that to diagnose melanoma in the field." Recognizing that people in developing areas won't have the latest iPhones with great cameras, Deshmukh tried to manipulate the testing images to account for this. "It is accurate and it is pretty easy to use," Deshmukh, 14, said. "You open the app and it scans the diseased area two times every second. Right now, it is achieving an 87 percent accuracy rate." Deshmukh is now working to create his own company with the help of Penn State Lehigh Valley's LaunchBox, a business accelerator program. He hopes to have a nonprofit arm working in developing regions that will be powered by the for-profit users of the app. He hopes to also partner with Last Mile Health, a charity organization providing technology in impoverished areas.  "They don't want to have the inconvenience of going to the doctor (to get something that may be nothing checked out," Deshmukh said. Both teens say going to the Intel fair was a once-in-the-lifetime experience. Both were astounded by the talent of their competitors, who came from all over the world. And they found the judges to be kind and helpful, offering advice to improve their projects. "You could see the entire auditorium filled with 1,700 kids and the kids in there were doing some insane stuff," Deshmukh said. "They were the best of the best in their country." Shahid said the judges emphasize the importance of applying for a patent immediately and walked him through the steps. Shahid hopes to go to college and then start his own engineering research company. This summer he plans to keep honing his ideas and testing them on drones and other applicable uses. Deshmukh said the judges responded well to his project. One was from India, so she knew the problems he was trying to solve intimately. A professor Deshmukh met an Intel suggested he set up a cloud server holding all of the images taken by users. These images will help make his neural network get smarter and smarter. He also hopes that geolocation data can help track outbreaks of disease and target medication and resources to those areas. Deshmukh hopes to attend MIT and study computer engineering. He is attending camp there this summer where he hopes to get input on his app. After camp wraps up, Deshmukh is headed to India to visit family, where he plans to put the app to the test in the field with his grandparents.

Next up is Day[9] and the PC gaming show - and if you need to stay up to date, we're liveblogging the whole thing. 5:15 PM: Round 4, then. The PC gaming show will actually be one of the longer conferences. It's kicking off with a 45 minute briefing from Intel first - probably to do with their upcoming CPU/laptop announcements - that starts at the painful time of 02:15 AM AEST. The actual gaming component of the show starts at 03:00 AM AEST (01:00 AM AWST), so you might want to just tune in for that. Either way, I'll keep you updated with all of the announcements. For those who want to tune in below, you'll find the Twitch stream in our post below. The conference will be broadcast on Mixer and YouTube as well, and when I get links and/or embed codes for those I'll drop them in. Watch The PC Gaming Show Livestream Here If you want to follow the PC Gaming Show live, both for the games and the tech shown off beforehand, then we've got everything you need here. Read more As for the show itself, what would you like to see? Every year I've found there has been one or two indie games that have stuck out. Some news on Star Citizen's Squadron 42 campaign would be nice. Creative Assembly will probably show up with the Total Warhammer sequel, while Chucklefish (publishers of Stardew Valley) have promised to show off their Advance Wars-style game, Wargroove. Tripwire Interactive, the Red Orchestra developers, supposedly have an announcement of sorts. There's a new game from the Invisible Inc. and Don't Starve creators, and we're overdue for some new BattleTech campaign footage. (Backers have been playing the alpha for a little while, mind you; we'll probably see how that's coming along as well.) Set your alarms people. If you want to catch Intel's part of the presser, you'll want to be ready by 2:15 AM AEST. If you just want to see the games, be back right before 03:00 AM AEST. And as for the rest of the conferences: All The Australian Times For Every E3 Conference It's almost E3 time, and you know what that means. getting up real early and getting real wired on coffee. But it's hard to do that without knowing when the conferences are on. Fortunately, we've got you sorted. Read more If you couldn't catch EA, Bethesda or Microsoft, never fear: we've got everything as it happened. Bethesda's E3 2017 Conference: The Liveblog Sunday saw EA show off their wares, and earlier this morning it was Microsoft. Now it's Bethesda's turn. So if you're keen on some more news about the Fallout franchise, a possible Wolfenstein sequel, or Quake Champions, chances are we'll find out today. Read more Microsoft's Xbox E3 2017: The Liveblog It's finally time. If you've wanted to know how powerful and how much Project Scorpio can be, or you just want to see some cool games, Microsoft's conference is a good place to be. Let's get our liveblogging boots on. Read more Rewatch EA's Pre-E3 Conference It's not officially part of E3, but with all the major Star Wars titles, a new Need for Speed and the ongoing Battlefield and FIFA franchises, EA's pre-E3 conference is worth watching nonetheless. Read more Here's Every Trailer From E3 2017 Welcome to E3 2017. a week filled with leaks, hardware, software, silly stuff, not so silly stuff, and most importantly. games. Read more I'll see you all bright and early tomorrow morning. 2:00 AM: Aaaaaaand we're back. Did you get some sleep? I felt like I was mostly rolling around in bed, staring at the wall. Always the worst when that happens, so hopefully the E3 Buzz kicks in to power me through the day. I've got my starter kit with me: a large cup of coffee and a second cup of ginger, honey and lemon juice. This liveblog comes live from my home, as Sydney transport doesn't understand why people might want to travel into the city at this ungodly hour. Actually, that's probably not a bad thing. But it does at least restrict me to the creature comforts of home. Sit back, relax, and get ready. Intel's contribution to the E3 show (besides the sponsorship) is due to kick off on the quarter hour. 2:10 AM: So what exactly does Intel have to talk about that could take up 45 minutes, anyway? First thing that comes to mind is Coffee Lake, the codename for Intel's series of 10nm chips. There's been plenty of unsubstantiated rumours that, thanks to AMD's Ryzen, Coffee Lake's release has been bumped up. I don't buy into that, personally, because Intel would have made more of an announcement around Computex if that was the case. But it wouldn't be a surprise if we got more of an update, or at least a roadmap. Intel's Project Alloy might show up as well, and it'd be good if it did. The promise of wireless VR would rectify an awful lot of the stumbling blocks around VR, although Intel has to answer a major question: how good can VR be with a just a CPU (plus the in-built GPU) ? Almost ready now. 2:20 AM: So, Intel kick things off with a gaming laptop playing Overwatch talking about their new X (Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X) series CPUs. Mixed reality is ... on second thoughts, I'm not sure I'm really into mixed reality. The pitch here is basically having enough CPU cores to handle the production of everything real time, which is fairly daunting when you think about it. 2:25 AM: So ESL's Craig Levine comes on stage to say that Intel will be partnering even more with ESL. It's not really that surprising though - ESL began running the Intel Extreme Masters events back when they were exhibitions showcasing Counter-Strike 1.6. I still remember watching one of the first matches between Four Kings and Schroet Kommando. There's more sponsorship for CS:GO as well, with 10 special events. Key takeaway: the first team to win 4 events will get a bonus prize of $US1 million, which is cool. 2:28 AM: But how does VR fit in with esports? Time for Ready at Dawn to take the stage, the devs behind The Order: 1886. They've got a new VR game as well, called Lone Echo. There's a multiplayer arena called Echo Arena, which will be released for free to all Oculus owners. Lone Echo itself will be on sale for $US39.99 on the Oculus store. 2:33 AM: Oh look, Linkin Park are doing a VR experience. Actually, Reanimation in VR sounds alright. (That's not what it is, though.) But Linkin Park's new "VR destination" will launch next month. You'll need an Intel-based PC, according to the announcer. 2:40 AM: So that's pretty much it - short and sweet, and with not much enthusiasm from the crowd. Here's what Lone Echo's multiplayer component, Echo Arena, looks like: Lone Wolf also has a multiplayer component called Echo Arena, which looks a bit like team dodgeball #E32017 pic.twitter.com/1DyBSJhZcT — Kotaku Australia (@KotakuAU) June 12, 2017 2:45 AM: So, about 15 minutes to go now. Creative Assembly, Battlegrounds dropped in the first line. The pre-show so far is trivia with the Twitch chat about various bits of PC gaming lore, which is a neat way to pass the time. In unrelated news, my neighbour downstairs has started playing music (!). Yes, it is just before 3 in the morning. What even. 2:48 AM: Sound from the stage mics breaks in to inform sponsors that they sit in their designated seats. Cute. More trivia, in the meantime. 2:52 AM: This pre-show quiz is actually pretty good. The music doesn't make you want to go postal, unlike my neighbour's, and the announcer has a good voice for this sort of stuff. Very natural. It's right about now that I'm wishing I could control the brightness on my monitor. 2:56 AM: What do you know: the original X-COM was cancelled during development, but kept being made. Nice piece of history there. Don't forget that Ubisoft's pre-show is scheduled to start soon as well. If you want to watch that at the same time, on a second monitor perhaps, you can do so below: Watch Ubisoft's E3 2017 Livestream Here Ubisoft's conferences have been entertaining over the last few years, and this year should be no different. There's Far Cry 5, the return of Assassin's Creed, and always the potential for the accidental real life meme. Let's watch. Read more Under two minutes now. 3:00 AM: The showcase kicks off with a soft montage about the personalisation of PCs and the value of modders. Day[9] then appears: BattleTech's campaign coming up, new Shadow of War footage, more Total Warhamamer 2, stuff from Intel and Xbox, Tripwire's new game, and probably lots of indies. 3:03 AM: First up: an expansion for XCOM 2 from Firaxis. It's out August 29, and called War of the Chosen. 3:09 AM: Jake Solomon is talking about some of the new abilities for the Chosen warriors. There's an assassin, a sniper - more or less the things you'd expect. Chosen warriors stay with you over the course of the campaign, and you can upgrade their abilities and capacities. Your XCOM 2 Chosen warriors will stay with you throughout the campaign, if you can keep them alive #E32017 pic.twitter.com/BDEk1C28oY — Kotaku Australia (@KotakuAU) June 12, 2017 The Lost are the protagonists - heavily mutated humans, mutated beyond the point of humanity really. War of the Chosen will launch simultaneously on PC and consoles. Day[9] follows up by telling everyone to follow Jake Solomon on Twitter, which makes him a tad uncomfortable. Next game is being introduced by Sonja Reid. It's from Double Fine, and it's called Ooblets. Out on PC and XBO next year. Next game: a chat with the makers of BattleTech, specifically about its campaign. 3:18 AM: The campaign is open-ended, and you can keep playing it after the story finishes. The developers talk a little bit about the main characters, which you can see in these screenshots below: It's time for BattleTech #E32017 pic.twitter.com/VyR7WLD1b8 — Kotaku Australia (@KotakuAU) June 12, 2017 There's a focus on melee combat as well for BattleTech #E32017 pic.twitter.com/hEqJEOuBIm — Kotaku Australia (@KotakuAU) June 12, 2017 3:21 AM: Next up is Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord. The font still annoys me, but the action looks ripe for LAN parties. That's followed by cutscenes and in-game footage from a quest battle for Total WARHAMMER 2, showing the Lizardmen and High Elves. 3:27 AM: Total WARHAMMER 2 launches September 28 this year. 3:28 AM: It's CCG time, specifically Shadowverse. It's introduced by a bloke wearing a Team Solomid shirt, a bloke who could use a shave. After a quick trailer, Intel comes up to talk a bit more about VR and esports. The overlay literally describes him as "Intel's Software Guy". 3:34 AM: After talking a bit about Intel's efforts in the scene, a Twitch streamer and broadcaster comes on to ... talk about Destiny 2 on PC. 3:36 AM: The streamer basically talks about how PC gamers shouldn't worry - Destiny 2 will be fine on PC. And if Intel could hook him up with an i9 CPU, that'd be great. Bit awkward, but also have to appreciate the hustle. 3:39 AM: Intel's Software Guy is recapping the announcements from just prior to the show. He's now covering the Grand Slam tournaments I mentioned earlier. He tries to get the crowd revved up by talking about the bonus $US1 million prize, but the applause is pretty muted. I think they're a bit Intel'd out. Lone Echo and Echo Arena get mentioned; no pause for applause though. There's also a VR Challenger League kicking off, with finals being held next year. 3:44 AM: Secret Legend has been renamed to Tunic apparently. It's way cute. 3:49 AM: Battlegrounds is getting the ability to vault over fences (yay!), new weather effects, new weapons, and eventually, mods. All good stuff. Greene then talks about how the studio is focusing - this month - on server performance and stability. Not something you hear on an E3 stage a lot. The PC Gaming Show is real weird sometimes. Also, more evidence of how cute Tunic is: It's called Tunic, and it stars a *really* cute fox #E32017 pic.twitter.com/E3sc8eg9gO — Kotaku Australia (@KotakuAU) June 12, 2017 Store page just appeared on Steam, too. 3:52 AM: Bill Munk from Tripwire - who just released Rising Storm 2 appears to talk about their studio's new game. It's a scary VR shooter, apparently. More to be announced later this year. Killing Floor 2 is also getting new seasonal content in the form of Summer Side Show, which lets people muck around a horror-themed carnival. Over 50 new cosmetic items, lots of mini-games, new weapons, and so on. Summer Side Show launches tomorrow, and it's free for a whole week. Crowd gets more enthused by the prospect of free stuff. Who'd have thought? 3:58 AM: Forza Motorsport 7 is coming direct to PC, and Turn 10's Bill Giese rocks up to the stage. Time to roll those camels from the Forza trailer, then. 4:00 AM: Rare now appears to talk Sea of Thieves; game gets the loudest cheer for a while. New features: firing people out of cannons, riddle maps, and more. There's support for ultrawide resolutions and an unlocked framerate. An overlay also says that Sea of Thieves is coming early 2018. 4:03 AM: The Last Night's creative director Tim Soret - who has been having a fun time on Twitter over the last 24 hours - and he says "I have some concerns I want to address" about things he posted publicly. Soret quickly makes a public apology for things he posted years ago, and Day[9] immediately moves back onto the game. Soret is a little flustered after that, but adds that The Last Night is about defining yourself when you have nothing to strive for. 4:07 AM: Regaining his composure a little, Soret keeps talking about The Last Night's inspiration and mechanics. If you walk away from NPCs during a conversation, they'll remember it. It's looking and sounding good, for what it's worth. But now it's time for a ... pirate game from Bohemia Interactive? It's called Islands. Almost looks like it'll compete with Sea of Thieves in a way. It's a sandbox game at its core. 4:13 AM: It's Klei's time to reveal their next project. It's a sci-fi RPG called Griftlands and it looks sick. 4:16 AM: Lone Echo gameplay appears, but it's mostly just retreading the stuff that was already announced. New Echo Arena trailer then rolls. 4:20 AM: Oh look, Cliffy B is back with Lawbreakers. We're promised a "full hard date" now. Cliffy then says the "first alpha was alright" and says publishers "do a lot of bullshit betas". Oh Cliffy. Lawbreakers is coming out on August 8 on PC and PS4 for $US29.99. "None of that $US60 multiplayer only bullshit," he adds. A video then plays featuring influencers and streamers praising the high skill ceiling and movement of the game. Seems like Lawbreakers is trying a similar thing to Quake Champions, targeting the same crowd without having the Quake franchise to lean on. But it's Wargroove time now. Yes, it's basically Advance Wars in 2017. 12 campaigns, apparently (what?). 4:29 AM: Time check - the show has run for over two hours now, if you include the Intel pre-show. Damn. Nothing like a livestream of the system taskbar: Three minutes to design a map and mission from scratch and to get it playable. Not half bad. 4:32 AM: Shadow of War time. Michael de Plater from Monolith also sounds Australian, which is neat. It's just a chat over the recently released trailer. Here's a nice GIF of that for your entertainment: GIF: Kotaku 4:38 AM: Right. Time for something new. We're hearing about a new RTS, a homage to Command & Conquer games. It's from Microsoft Studios and looks like a remaster of Age of Empires 1. Age of Empires: Definitive Edition will use matchmaking through Xbox Live, as well as a web portal for tracking stats, friends, and so on. The game will debut later this year; beta signups are live now. 4:44 AM: That's a pretty good thing to end a show on. Day9 is wrapping up now, and reminds everyone that E3 doesn't officially start until tomorrow. Jesus. In any case, that's it for the PC gaming show this year. What'd you think? No super huge announcements this year, and the crowd was flat throughout. VR didn't really excite people as much as new graphics cards. But there were some crackers, and AoE 1 is a huge deal. For more E3 coverage, stay tuned - Ubisoft will be kicking off proper at 0600 AEST/0400 AWST/0800 NZST. Thanks for following along! Watch Ubisoft's E3 2017 Livestream Here Ubisoft's conferences have been entertaining over the last few years, and this year should be no different.

That was... pretty awful. Almost nothing of interest there at all. Lots of things relying on existing IP (or just expansions for existing games) and what new IP was shown doesn't seem particularly interesting, or it doesn't really show the power of the PC platform.

The short demo has been widely well-received, with most of what was shown marking a big departure from what Bioware is usually known for. For some fans, however, it's too big of a departure from the Bioware formula, judging from the responses on the studio's social media pages.

Related Stephen Colbert Casts Hugh Jackman To Play Him In Donald Trump Probe Movie The testimony got everybody’s attention, Oliver noted, when he kicked things off saying he had no doubt Trump fired him because of the FBI’s Russia investigation. While dramatic, that statement actually was not new or controversial, Oliver insisted, reminding Trump himself suggested as much in his interview about a month ago with NBC News’s Lester Holt. “It’s more a known fact that people choose to ignore, like ‘a pet snake is a character flaw’,” he said. Comey said Trump’s claim he fired Comey because the FBI was in disarray and its workforce had lost confidence in him was a lie “plain and simple.” Oliver took issue, insisting Trump’s lies never are plain and simple. But the remark was just one of many times during his testimony in which Comey questioned the president’s credibility.  At one point Comey explained to the senators why he took such careful notes immediately after a dinner with Trump, saying he honestly was concerned Trump might lie about the nature of their meeting and so thought it was really important to document. “He is is describing his meeting with the president like a person who thought he was about to be murdered,” Oliver observed. Asked if it is unusual for an FBI director to have a one-on-one dinner with the POTUS, Comey responded, “Yes, so much so I assumed there would be others [attending]. He couldn’t possibly be having dinner with me alone.” Oliver guessed it was not the first time a person had been tricked into having dinner with Trump alone. But the most tantalizing moments of the testimony came when Comey said he was not able to answer questions. When he explained why he thought Attorney General Jeff Sessions was going to recuse himself from any matters regarding a Russia probe. “Our judgement, as I recall, was that he very close to, and inevitably going to, recuse himself” for a variety of reasons, Comey said, adding that the bureau also was aware of facts he could not discuss in an open setting “that would make his involvement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.” “Now that sounds like a big deal,” Oliver said. Trump notably was silent that day but sent a tweet early the next morning saying, of Comey’s testimony, ‘despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication.” “Trump is essentially claiming that he’s been vindicated by testimony he’s claiming is false,” Oliver pointed out. “At this point he’s become a walking logical paradox.” Trump reiterated his claim at a Rose Garden press conference, prompting one journalist to ask him if he would be willing to speak on the subject under oath with Robert Mueller, who has been appointed special counsel and took over the investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible Russia ties. “100 percent,” Trump said. “I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you,” he said at that presser. “Holy shit! Trump just volunteered to testify under oath,” Oliver marveled. “Why did Trump expose himself like that? I don’t know,” Oliver confessed. “Jane Goodall could not explain” even if she studied him for years, the late-night host joked, imagining that, after studying him for years, she would conclude that Trump is “a cocktail of insecurity, horniness and malice.” But trying to figure out which was in control of Trump would be beyond her, and she would add, “I miss the integrity and emotional intelligence of the apes.” Most infuriating reaction to Comey’s testimony comes from House Speaker Paul Ryan, Oliver announced, whose explanation that “The President is new to this”  just “proves that you can live a normal healthy life without a spine.”   Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 4 4 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

ET Share this article JERUSALEM, June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE: MBLY) – Mobileye N.V. ("Mobileye" or the "Company"), the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and autonomous driving technologies, today announced the results of its 2017 annual general meeting of its shareholders (the "AGM").  During the AGM, held today, the Company obtained shareholder approval for all items proposed for approval at the AGM, including all items relating to the previously disclosed all cash tender offer (the "Offer") by Cyclops Holdings, LLC ("Cyclops"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company, including approval of certain post-Offer closing restructurings as previously announced in the agenda for the AGM, certain amendments to the articles of association of the Company to become effective after the closing of the Offer and the election of new directors associated with Intel effective as of the Offer closing. In addition, a number of other matters were approved at the AGM relating to the adoption of the Company's Dutch statutory annual accounts, the re-election of certain incumbent directors of the Company (who will resign after the Offer closing) and the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers N.V. to serve as the Company's independent public accountants for the current year.  All of the above items are described in greater detail in the AGM agenda disclosed previously by the Company and available on the Company's website (http://ir.mobileye.com/investor-relations/AGM/default.aspx).  All items proposed were adopted at the AGM with percentages ranging from 96% to 99% of the votes cast in favor of the proposals. On March 12, 2017, Cyclops commenced the Offer to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of the Company at a purchase price of $63.54 per share, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest to the holders thereof, payable in cash.  The Offer is being made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated March 12, 2017, by and among Cyclops, Intel and the Company (the "Purchase Agreement").  The Offer is scheduled to expire on June 21, 2017, unless extended pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.  Complete terms and conditions of the Offer are described in the Offer statement on Schedule TO, which includes the Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal, that was filed by Intel with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2017, as amended (the "Schedule TO"). Obtaining the Company shareholders' approval of certain of the items submitted to a vote at the AGM satisfies a condition to the closing of the Offer. Completion of the Offer remains subject to certain other conditions, including that at least 95% of the Company's outstanding shares (as such threshold may be lowered pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (including any extensions) and the receipt of regulatory approvals in certain jurisdictions as described in the Schedule TO. The Offer will continue to be extended until all conditions are satisfied or waived, or until the Offer is terminated, in either case pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and as described in the Schedule TO.

("Mobileye" or the "Company"), the global leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and autonomous driving technologies, today announced the results of its 2017 annual general meeting of its shareholders (the "AGM").  During the AGM, held today, the Company obtained shareholder approval for all items proposed for approval at the AGM, including all items relating to the previously disclosed all cash tender offer (the "Offer") by Cyclops Holdings, LLC ("Cyclops"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel Corporation ("Intel"), to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company, including approval of certain post-Offer closing restructurings as previously announced in the agenda for the AGM, certain amendments to the articles of association of the Company to become effective after the closing of the Offer and the election of new directors associated with Intel effective as of the Offer closing. In addition, a number of other matters were approved at the AGM relating to the adoption of the Company's Dutch statutory annual accounts, the re-election of certain incumbent directors of the Company (who will resign after the Offer closing) and the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers N.V. to serve as the Company's independent public accountants for the current year.  All of the above items are described in greater detail in the AGM agenda disclosed previously by the Company and available on the Company's website (http://ir.mobileye.com/investor-relations/AGM/default.aspx).  All items proposed were adopted at the AGM with percentages ranging from 96% to 99% of the votes cast in favor of the proposals. On March 12, 2017, Cyclops commenced the Offer to acquire all outstanding ordinary shares of the Company at a purchase price of $63.54 per share, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest to the holders thereof, payable in cash.  The Offer is being made pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated March 12, 2017, by and among Cyclops, Intel and the Company (the "Purchase Agreement").  The Offer is scheduled to expire on June 21, 2017, unless extended pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement.  Complete terms and conditions of the Offer are described in the Offer statement on Schedule TO, which includes the Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal, that was filed by Intel with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2017, as amended (the "Schedule TO"). Obtaining the Company shareholders' approval of certain of the items submitted to a vote at the AGM satisfies a condition to the closing of the Offer. Completion of the Offer remains subject to certain other conditions, including that at least 95% of the Company's outstanding shares (as such threshold may be lowered pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) be validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (including any extensions) and the receipt of regulatory approvals in certain jurisdictions as described in the Schedule TO. The Offer will continue to be extended until all conditions are satisfied or waived, or until the Offer is terminated, in either case pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and as described in the Schedule TO.

Five days earlier, former FBI director James Comey testified before the same committee after which, during the closed hearing with the committee that followed, senators heard of an alleged undisclosed third meeting between Sessions and Russia’s ambassador to the U.S. at the Mayflower hotel in Washington. According to press reports, the information was gathered in an interception of Russia-to-Russia communication. “Let me state this clearly, colleagues: I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign, or election, in the United States. Further I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign,” Sessions told his former Senate colleagues. “Any suggestion that I participated in, or was aware of, collusion with the Russians is an appalling and detestable lie.” During his public testimony, Comey took some heat for not blowing the whistle when Trump buttonholed him and said he hoped Comey could let go the probe of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Comey said he had gone to the AG, but had gotten stiffed, declining to discuss Sessions further. Sessions recused himself from Russia probes, after failing to disclose two other meetings with Russians that occurred when he was part of Trump’s election effort. During his testimony, Sessions insisted, under oath, “I recused myself, not because of any wrongdoing… but because of department regulation.” Sessions began the session warning the Senate Intel Committee he will not dish much on President Donald Trump. “I cannot and will not violate my duty to protect the confidential communications I had with the president,” he told the committee at Tuesday’s public hearing. He had expected to invoke executive privilege in re conversations with Trump. Sessions said he’s not doing that, because only POTUS has that ability. But he declined to answer so many questions that Dem Senator Ron Wyden accused him of stonewalling. “I am not stonewalling,” he responded stoutly. “I’m following the historic policies of the Department of Justice. You don’t walk into any hearing or committee meeting and reveal confidential communications with the President of the United States who is entitled to receive confidential communications, and your best judgment about a host of issues.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 6 6 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You KOLKATA | NEW DELHI: A broadband body has written to the government that India could attract serious legal challenges and retaliatory action from key Asean countries if it decides to slap customs duty on imported handsets, the first signs of an organised opposition to a possible plan which is crucial to local handset manufacturing. The Broadband India Forum’s (BIF) letter to IT and telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan drew a sharp response from the Indian Cellular Association — which represents mobile handset companies — with its president, Pankaj Mohindroo saying the government is elected not for Asean but to serve the people, and industry, in India.” In its letter sent on June 13, BIF said any imposition of customs duty on imported mobile phones, post-switch over to the goods & services tax (GST) regime for compensating local manufacturing, will violate India’s stance on Free Trade Agreement (FTA) treaties with multiple Asean countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia. BIF counts Qualcomm, Huawei, Ericsson, Facebook, Google Microsoft, Hughes and Intel among its key members. “India cannot impose customs duty on imported smartphones from any of these countries without incurring serious legal challenges and retaliatory action as it has signed the FTA,” said BIF president TV Ramachandran in his letter to Sundarajan, a copy of which was seen by ET. According to the BIF president, “Since India is a signatory to FTA, of which these Asean countries are also a part, it would have to adhere to the provisions of the Asean Free Trade Agreement (Asean FTA), wherein any goods imported from these countries would enjoy customs duty exemption.” Its letter to Sundararajan comes at a time when the Centre is known to be considering the duty to ensure locally-made handsets are cheaper than imported ones, which will help expand Make in India. This is since local handset manufacturers will no longer enjoy the benefits of countervailing duty (CVD), which will disappear once the GST regime is implemented from July 1. But ICA’s Mohindroo rejected BIF’s views. “The government of India and the inter-ministerial committee will keep in mind all international commitments while arriving at a decision. The highest priority of government is to promote manufacturing and employment in the country,” he told ET. An inter-ministerial committee, comprising representatives from the finance, commerce, and telecom and IT ministries, has been set up to examine the issue of imposing basic customs duty on mobile phones. Another top executive of a leading BIF member company said, “Even if India only levies customs duty on mobile phones imported from non-FTA countries like China, Japan, South Korea or Taiwan, global handset makers in those countries would promptly relocate their manufacturing units to the FTA markets like Vietnam or Thailand, and route their low-priced smartphones into India from there, which would ultimately defeat the purpose of local manufacturing in India.” Comments(0)Add Comments Imposing duty on imported mobiles violation of FTA: Broadband India Forum To post this comment you must Log In/Connect with:Indiatimes Network or Fill in your details: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed Share this Comment:Post to Twitter Also Read No inherent objection to free trade agreement with India: US India, Georgia begin free trade agreement talks India, Russia plan Free Trade Agreement in Eurasian region Why India shouldn't sign on to more free trade agreements, except on really favourable terms Trump vows to 'start renegotiating' North American Free Trade Agreement READ MORE ONQualcommPankaj MohindrooIndian Cellular AssociationHughesHuaweiGSTGoogle Microsoft Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App.DOWNLOAD NOW FROM AROUND THE WEB Choose a home from across 12 cities in India GODREJ PROPERTIES Hit big savings on insurance with State Farm® State Farm Insurance Basketball's Finest: 32 WNBA Players On And Off The Court http://www.smartchoiceshealthyliving.comMORE FROM ECONOMIC TIMES Donald Trump backs H-1B reforms bill: US lawmaker US imposes 266% duty on imports of steel from China Australia imposes dumping duties on Chinese steel From Around the WebMore from The Economic Times 20 Famous Women Who Never Married Womens Forum Grab a Local Pint From These Virginia Beach Breweries Visit Virginia Beach The F-22 Is No Match For this Plane The Brofessional The 25 Richest NBA Players & the Women Behind Them Burst Daily India imposes anti-dumping duty on Chinese refrigerant India banned import of milk, some mobile phones from China EU says committed to 'broad, ambitious' FTA with India Government halves import duty on some steel grades Have something to say?

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Allstate, Marketplace Lending Association and others fly in By Theodoric Meyer 06/13/2017 02:00 PM EDT With David Beavers, Aubree Eliza Weaver and Daniel Lippman A FLURRY OF FLY-INS: All sorts of interest groups are flying in this week to nab some time with lawmakers before the July 4 recess. About 40 Allstate employees will hit the Hill on Wednesday to press lawmakers on tax reform, the National Flood Insurance Program reauthorization and “the utilization of commercial drones for the future of claims handling after catastrophes,” according to Allstate. They’ll meet with Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Reps. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.), John Rutherford (R-Fla.) and Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.), among other lawmakers, as well as staffers from House Speaker Paul Ryan’s personal office. Story Continued Below — The Marketplace Lending Association, a trade group that represents digital financial and lending startups, is in town this week for its first-ever fly-in, meeting with lawmakers and regulators. “The goal is to bring Washington up to speed on the growth of the sector, as well as the emerging partnerships between the fintech member firms and banks,” according to the group. Its member companies include Lending Club, Prosper, Funding Circle, Avant, Marlette Funding and Affirm. — The American Supply Association, which represents manufacturers and distributors of heating, cooling and plumbing equipment, is flying in on Wednesday to meet with lawmakers on the Marketplace Fairness Act, workforce development and water infrastructure issues. They’ll be meeting with Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) and Reps. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.), Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.), Gene Green (D-Texas) and Jason Smith (R-Mo.). And the American Forest & Paper Association is in town Wednesday and Thursday lobbying on tax reform, among other issues. MORE ADS FROM AMERICANS FOR PROSPERITY: Americans for Prosperity is launching a new round of digital ads urging 10 vulnerable Democratic senators on tax reform, including Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. “The group says it's using the ads to push the senators to share AFP's tax reform principles, which include advocating simple broad based rate reductions that induce growth,” POLITICO’s Burgess Everett reports. “But since Republicans are aiming at passing tax reform by the party-line reconciliation mechanism, the ads will also serve to highlight that Democrats are on the outside looking in at the process and that a Republican senator will have more sway under a GOP Senate.” Full story.

MEET THE NEW PRO-CUBA LOBBY: “Five months into the Trump administration, Cuba has a new set of American defenders: a coalition of high-tech firms, farming interests, travel companies and young Cuban-Americans thrown into action by the looming announcement of a new Cuba policy,” The Associated Press’ Michael Weissenstein and Matthew Lee report. “On the opposite side, hardline members of Miami’s Cuban exile community who suddenly have a direct line into the White House through Cuban-American Republican members of Congress and the administration. President Donald Trump planned to announce the new policy on Friday in Miami but had not yet decided all the details, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.” Full story. MORE ON FLYNN’S LOBBYING PARTNER: The Associated Press’ Stephen Braun and Chad Day have unearthed some new details on Bijan Kian, who worked with Michael Flynn lobbying for a Turkish businessman during the campaign. “It is not clear whether Kian has been drawn into the expanding criminal probe, but he was deeply involved in Flynn Intel Group’s creation, financing and operations, according to the Turkish businessman, people familiar with Flynn’s company and records submitted to the Justice Department. And Kian’s participation in the Trump transition — following his management of work that Flynn Intel acknowledged may have benefited Turkey’s government — reinforces concerns about the adequacy of the administration’s vetting process.” Full story. KASOWITZ BOASTS HE GOT BHARARA FIRED: “Marc Kasowitz, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer in the Russia investigation, has boasted to friends and colleagues that he played a central role in the firing of Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, according to four people familiar with the conversations,” ProPublica’s Jesse Eisinger and Justin Elliott report. “Kasowitz told Trump, ‘This guy is going to get you,’ according to a person familiar with Kasowitz’s account. Those who know Kasowitz say he is sometimes prone to exaggerating when regaling them with his exploits. But if true, his assertion adds to the mystery surrounding the motive and timing of Bharara’s firing.” Full story. IVANKA’S COMPANY AXES JAPAN DEAL: “Ivanka Trump’s fashion brand called off a deal with a major Japanese apparel company after learning that it was backed by the Japanese government, Ms. Trump’s company said in a letter made public on Monday,” The New York Times’ Rachel Abrams reports. “The New York Times reported in December that Ms. Trump’s company was finalizing the agreement when Ms. Trump sat in on her father’s meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and that the company’s largest shareholder was a government-owned bank. The brand ‘decided not to pursue further negotiations’ the next month, the company said.” Full story. JOBS REPORT — Clint Lohse is joining the Bramer Group as director of government relations.

Advanced Micro Devices Stock Gets a High-Profile E3 Push (AMD) Microsoft Surface Review: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Gives Apple Inc. (AAPL) a Run for Its Money View All Posts Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) never seems able to catch Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the PC space. But when it comes to gaming consoles, it’s a different story. AMD dominates, with its AMD Jaguar CPU and an AMD GPU powering nearly every console in the current generation. Source: Microsoft That streak continued when Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its new Xbox One X during the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Billed as the world’s most powerful video game console, the Xbox One X has an AMD Jaguar CPU inside, with an integrated AMD GPU providing 6 teraflops of graphics performance. It’s AMD Inside The current generation of video game consoles includes seven different models from three manufacturers: Microsoft, Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) and Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR) (OTCMKTS:NTDOY). Of those seven consoles, just one — the Nintendo Switch — uses an Nvidia CPU and GPU. The Xbox One, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Playstation 4, PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro each have an AMD Jaguar CPU with an integrated AMD GPU providing the graphics horsepower. That’s a pretty impressive domination of the industry. When it comes to game consoles, AMD enjoys a larger market share than rival Nvidia does with computer graphics cards, and a degree of popularity in line with Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) when it comes to computer CPUs. Why Sony and Microsoft Chose AMD Jaguar There are a few questions when it comes to AMD’s apparent vice grip on the video game console market. First, when there is so much apparent overlap with the PC gaming industry — to the point where Xbox One and PS4 games can be streamed to a PC, and Microsoft is pushing “Xbox Play Anywhere” games that can be played on its console or a PC — how is AMD front and center? Shouldn’t these consoles be running Intel CPUs with Nvidia graphics chips? According to Forbes’ Patrick Moorhead, there’s a good reason for that. He says both console makers wanted to stick with X86 architecture to make game and app development easier. They wanted 64-bit processing. And they wanted both the CPU and the GPU together on a single piece of silicon — a SOC (system on chip) design that saves space and generates less heat. These very specific design requirements eliminated the two power players in PC gaming. AMD can’t come close to Intel’s PC CPU market share, but the AMD Jaguar CPU does what Intel couldn’t do — put a 64-bit X86 processor with high-powered graphics on a single, custom chip. And while Nvidia is number one for PC graphics cards, it lacks the X86 license and know-how to design the SOC that Microsoft and Sony wanted.

We like this definition. Technology Industry Veteran Rob Lilleness to Lead the Company Irvine, Calif. (PRWEB) June 13, 2017 Richmond Capital Partners, a private investment firm based in Seattle, today announced the acquisition of Smartlabs Inc., parent company of Insteon®, an Internet of Things (IoT) technology company, and Smarthome®, an eCommerce superstore for home automation. As part of the acquisition, Rob Lilleness will assume the role of chairman and CEO. Lilleness has built multiple successful high-tech businesses in digital media, mobile, software and consumer products. Most recently he served as president and Chief Executive Officer for Medio Systems, an ACCEL-backed company, which was acquired by HERE Technologies (a company currently owned by BMW, Daimler, Audi, Intel, and Tencent). Prior to Medio, Lilleness was president and chief operational officer of Universal Electronics. During his tenure at Universal, earnings more than tripled and the market capitalization grew from approximately $100 million to $500 million. “I’ve been following Smartlabs almost from when they started. Their Insteon line remains arguably the strongest in the IoT space for controlling and communicating with electrical components in one’s home—whether via Amazon Alexa, smartphones, pads, or traditional wall plates and remotes,” said Rob Enderle, principal analyst, Enderle Group. “Additionally, Rob Lilleness, with his background helping to build Microsoft’s networking business, is one of the few people that has both the resources and experience to take Smartlabs where I’ve always believed they could go.” One of the Largest Opportunities in IoT According to a report published by Business Intelligence, by 2020 the U.S. residential market will have 193 million devices in connected homes with almost 50 percent of those devices in SmartLabs’ core electrical, lighting and sensor market. The global smart electrical control market is expected to grow to $10.8 billion over the next five years. “There are two incredibly interesting IoT spaces in technology today—the car and the home,” said Lilleness. “Over the next five to 10 years, it is inevitable that a large portion of electrical nodes in the home will be ‘smart’ and addressable via the internet. With Insteon’s patented dual-mesh technology that communicates both wirelessly and via the home’s own electrical wiring, SmartLabs has the most reliable and scalable technology for electrical control and communication, which is critical to meet consumers’ expectations.” Smartlabs headquarters will remain in Irvine, Calif., and the company plans to open a software development office in Seattle. About Insteon Insteon creates the world’s leading technology for electrical, lighting, and sensor communication and control. Its patented dual mesh technology delivers unmatched reliability that is used in more than 200 Insteon-powered products and enables consumers to control their homes from virtually any device or interface. About Smarthome Smarthome is one of the world’s largest home automation retailers and an easy-to-use source for thousands of affordable lighting, security, and home entertainment products that the average “do-it-yourselfer” can safely install. Its team of product specialists strives to deliver the newest cutting-edge products at the best possible prices. Smarthome distributes products with award-winning INSTEON® technology. About Smartlabs Founded in 1992, Smartlabs, Inc., the parent company of Insteon and Smarthome, is the world's leading authority on electronic home improvement and automation.

That is, if you want ABC Smart Lights, you had to control them using a phone or device from ABC. And those smart lights couldn’t work with, say, a smart alarm system from XYZ that automatically turns ABC’s lights on when you arrive home. It’s an issue that leads to anti-consumer, money-hungry stupidity. Thankfully, the industry isn’t being stupid. Open standards are all the rage these days, with companies opting to be part of bigger coalitions, pacts, alliances (or whichever word you prefer to describe these things) in order to push to a common solution. The same is true for the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), backed by big name players Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, LG, and Samsung. Those last 2 companies are pretty important, because they happen to be 2 of the biggest appliance and electronics players in the game. Their ultimate goal is to create products that work well together, so your LG washing machine can deliver status updates to your Samsung fridge, or any other kinky combination you can think of. In fact, the Korea Herald is reporting that they’re both working on products based on OCF standards for launch later this year. This comes at a time where the smart home market is still one that breeds uncertainty. The OCF is a great prospect, but what about some other auxiliary players? Where will Apple, Google, Amazon, and the like go? Which standards will they push? Will everything ever be truly interoperable? We don’t know the answer to those questions just yet. But the OCF is in a prime position to shape the landscape going forward, because if everyone is buying Samsung and LG smart TVs, fridges, and washing machines, you better believe that other device makers will want to offer products that fit in with the “in” crowd. local_offer    LG   OCF   Open Connectivity Foundation   Samsung   Smart home   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (1) stars Further Reading The LG G7 could launch in January 2018 LG G6 warranty extended to 24 months Samsung Galaxy Note 8 may not have Android O Samsung left millions of customers exposed to hacking The LG X Charge passes through the FCC stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertTop 5 Apps of the Week closeTop 5 Android Apps of the Week (June 9, 2017) Every week, hundreds of Android apps and games are submitted to the Play Store.

We like this definition. CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom, and Moscow, Russia, 13th June 2017: UltraSoC has boosted its presence in Russia by engaging Nautech as its technical sales representative. Nautech’s expert and experienced technical and commercial team will help customers deploy UltraSoC’s embedded monitoring and analytics technology in system-on-chip (SoC) products, enabling powerful security, safety and performance enhancement features, while simultaneously cutting development time and hence reducing costs. UltraSoC is the leading provider of semiconductor IP for embedded analytics and monitoring, with announced licensees including HiSilicon (Huawei), Imagination Technologies, Movidius (now Intel), and Microsemi. Industry analyst SemiCo estimates that SoC design teams can double the profitability of their SoC projects and reduce their development costs by a quarter by using UltraSoC’s technology. UltraSoC is an active member of the RISC-V Foundation, established to promote an emerging open-source microprocessor architecture that has been dubbed “the Linux of semiconductors”. “We are delighted to welcome Nautech to the UltraSoC team,” said Rupert Baines, UltraSoC CEO. “Their existing offering of IP, design tools and services, alongside partnerships for chip manufacturing and packaging, is a fantastic match for our embedded analytics portfolio. We’re also very excited to be stepping up our presence in Russia at the moment, a key region in which the RISC-V architecture seems to be gaining substantial traction.” Andrei Greben, CEO, Nautech, commented: “UltraSoC’s embedded analytics is a unique and powerful proposition for the entire SoC development community. Not only can we use their IP to implement advanced features such as hardware-based security, safety and optimization, we believe we can dramatically reduce both cycle time and cost for our customers, dramatically changing the value equation for the entire industry.” UltraSoC’s suite of silicon IP allows designers to create an on-chip infrastructure that non-intrusively monitors the chip’s behavior – both hardware and software. In development, engineers can use it to gain a much more intimate understanding of the often complex interactions between diverse on-chip processor blocks, custom logic, and system software. Later in the product lifecycle, the ability to intelligently monitor the chip’s behavior under real-world conditions can be invaluable in helping engineers optimize the software running on it – for example to improve the performance of a server or disk drive – and to enable root-cause analysis of even the most intractable bugs. The same capabilities can also be used to spot unexpected behavior caused by software bugs or by malicious interference, enhancing security and functional safety. Nautech in Russia adds to UltraSoC’s global reach, with sales presence in place in China, Taiwan, Korea, Israel, Europe and the USA. About UltraSoC UltraSoC is an independent provider of SoC infrastructure that enables rapid development of embedded systems based on advanced SoC devices. The company is headquartered in Cambridge, United Kingdom.

Not only can we use their IP to implement advanced features such as hardware-based security, safety and optimization, we believe we can dramatically reduce both cycle time and cost for our customers, dramatically changing the value equation for the entire industry.” UltraSoC’s suite of silicon IP allows designers to create an on-chip infrastructure that non-intrusively monitors the chip’s behavior - both hardware and software. In development, engineers can use it to gain a much more intimate understanding of the often complex interactions between diverse on-chip processor blocks, custom logic, and system software. Later in the product lifecycle, the ability to intelligently monitor the chip’s behavior under real-world conditions can be invaluable in helping engineers optimize the software running on it - for example to improve the performance of a server or disk drive - and to enable root-cause analysis of even the most intractable bugs. The same capabilities can also be used to spot unexpected behavior caused by software bugs or by malicious interference, enhancing security and functional safety. Nautech in Russia adds to UltraSoC’s global reach, with sales presence in place in China, Taiwan, Korea, Israel, Europe and the USA.

Easy, that'll be $55k. Fix an election? Oh, I can do that for just $400k Cybercrooks rake it in with Fake-News-as-a-Service 13 Jun 2017 at 14:58, John Leyden Fake news has come to be associated with political intrigue but the same propaganda techniques are also abused by cybercriminals, according to a study by Trend Micro. The techniques and methods used to spread fake news and manipulate public opinion have a wide range of objectives and even a price list. Cybercriminals produce, market and monetise fake news in underground markets. The scope of a campaign and intended target affect pricing. For example, campaigns aimed to spark street protests are priced at $200,000 while discrediting a journalist would cost $55,000 and creating a fake celebrity (with 300,000 followers) costs a more modest $2,600. A year-long campaign to influence election outcomes is available for just $400,000, the study says. Whether such listings are in themselves an attempt at disinformation is certainly debatable. US intel agencies, Western politicians and security firms are nigh-on unanimous that attempts to influence the US presidential election last year were the work of the Kremlin. For example, UK defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon recently said the Kremlin is "weaponising misinformation" as part of a sustained campaign that goes beyond alleged meddling in the presidential election. Against that there have been freelance attempts to influence elections in parts of Latin America that allegedly featured hacking and other malfeasance so the idea that such services are up offered for sale on the dark net is far from implausible. Trend Micro's 77-page report [PDF] breaks down the key steps used to influence public opinion: from reconnaissance of the target audience and weaponisation – preparation of the fake story – to delivery and exploitation via social media, on to follow-up attempts to sustain a false narrative through additional propaganda. At the end of the cycle the public is often deliberately distracted with a new topic, beginning the cycle again. "With fake news becoming increasingly popular, people are questioning how much it has subliminally swayed their decisions or thoughts on campaigns such as elections," said Bharat Mistry, principal security strategist at Trend Micro. "This report takes a closer look at how the cybercrime ecosystem produces, markets and monetises fake news in underground markets. With the advent of Fake News as a Service ... it's never been easier to manipulate social media and other online platforms to affect and amplify [the] influence [of] public opinion." The report reveals the numerous online underground sites offering fake news-style services – which in many ways is an extension of tried-and-tested black hat SEO, click fraud and bot traffic efforts. These sites offer anonymity for any person or organisation seeking to influence public opinion, potentially including nation states. Fake news services typically involve the creation of fake social media profiles and groups; developing the fake content itself; driving likes and retweets for dissemination; and building legitimate-looking news sites. All these steps are designed to set up and sustain false narratives. For an additional fee, multiple news sites can be purchased which cross reference each other to add more authenticity to the fake news campaign, the report reveals. Chinese, Russian, Middle Eastern and English underground marketplaces offer fake news services of one type or another. Regional differences exist. For example, in China, fake advertorials can be purchased for as little as ¥100 (£11), while in Russia 35,000 rubles (£483) will buy your video two minutes on the YouTube homepage. The report also details example of the dissemination of fake news, including the cynical abuse of the recent Manchester bombing attack. Mexican journalists were falsely listed in galleries as bombing victims in what’s thought to be an attack by a drug cartel. These fake victim pics were subsequently promoted through social media. Trend Micro concludes that people can insulate themselves from fake news by cross-checking stories with major media outlets, researching the author and reading beyond the headline. "The hope is that by becoming aware of the techniques used in opinion manipulation, the public will become more resistant to these methods," Mistry concluded. ® Tips and corrections 31 Comments MORE Black Hat Fake News Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Obama's intel chief says Russia totally tried to swing it for Trump Former director of National Intelligence James Clapper has no doubt who hacked the Dems and spread fake news 60 Comments Phishing scum going legit to beat browser warnings Now that Chrome and Firefox call out HTTP, phisherpholk are getting certified 27 Comments Seven in ten UK unis admit being duped by phishing attacks Not so smart now, eh? 16 Comments Assange confirmed alive, tells Fox: Prez Obama 'acting like a lawyer' Failed US Veep candidate Palin's wailin: I was wrong about you, pale one! 76 Comments Facebook bans Russia's RT ahead of Trump's Inauguration Day (then changes its mind) Breaking news, literally 20 Comments Phishing: Another thing we can blame on Brexit Attacks up 33 per cent across the five most-targeted industries 15 Comments Whitepapers Evaluation Guide for Mobile App Security Testing What do you need to look for when identifying, evaluating, and implementing mobile app security testing solutions?

It looks like Google is getting awful serious about designing its own smartphone processors. The company recently hired an engineer named Manu Gulati from Apple, according to Variety. Gulati has at least 15 Apple patents related to chip design under his belt and will be key in Google's plan to build its own processors, Variety said. Apple currently builds its own smartphone processors but Google does not. Apple's newest A10X chips, for example, are built-in house instead of by companies like Intel or Qualcomm. Qualcomm currently supplies its Snapdragon processor for Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. Gulati's LinkedIn profile says he's now Google's "lead SOC architect." SoC stands for "system on a chip." Gulati worked at Apple for almost 8 years as a micro-architect and has also been employed by Broadcom and AMD. If Google begins building processors in house, like Apple, it would potentially cut down on Google's reliance on Qualcomm. That may not be a big hit for Qualcomm, at least not yet, since the company still provides millions of its Snapdragon processors to smartphone makers such as Samsung, LG, HTC and others. Still, this is a significant trend in the smartphone market. Other firms, such as Huawei and Samsung, have also started to build chips in-house, allowing them to rely less on potential supply restraints from outside parties. A spokesperson for Apple was not immediately available for comment. Google confirmed Manu is now working for Google but declined to provide additional details. Read the full Variety report.

Name: Subject: Message: Samsung and LG products may soon be able to communicate with one another Newsby Brian Reigh3 days ago 8 311 8 Imagine being able to see the inside of your LG fridge on your Samsung TV. That might become a reality as early as this year according to sources. See also: What is the problem with IoT security? – Gary explains November 19, 2016 While IoT-based devices are growing exponentially each year, the communication between them still needs a lot of improvement. Often times, smart appliances from different manufacturers are incompatible with one another, limiting users to their smartphones for remote control. However, according to The Korea Herald, that might change soon. Citing anonymous sources, the publication claims that two of the largest South Korean electronics companies – Samsung and LG – are looking to develop products that are certified by the Open Connectivity Foundation. The Open Connectivity Foundation oversees and develops specification standards in connected devices by different brands, allowing them to communicate one another freely. Although it was founded relatively recently, it boasts over 300 members, which include Samsung, LG, Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and more. Samsung’s premium air conditioners and refrigerators as well as its latest flagship, the Galaxy S8, have reportedly been certified by the OCF already. According to the aforementioned sources, Samsung’s premium air conditioners and refrigerators as well as its latest flagship, the Galaxy S8, have all been certified by the OCF already. They also mention that the company is looking to diversify that portfolio by expanding the certification into products like washing machines and cooking tools as early as this year. It is believed that Samsung’s South Korean rival company LG has similar plans. If the report is indeed true, this could mean that users would be able to control LG products using Samsung devices and vice versa – for instance, you might be able to see the inside of your LG fridge on your Samsung TV, or your LG dryer could recommend pre-set modes for your clothes by communicating with your Samsung washing machine. As two of the largest home appliance manufacturers in the world make a move to launch interoperable products, industry experts believe that more companies will follow suit.

"We've seen how CognitiveScale's unique, industry-tailored AI software can create value more quickly by transforming customer engagement and augmenting employee decision making, allowing enterprises to perform at levels they never thought possible." As artificial intelligence evolves, becoming a bigger part of businesses' and consumers' daily decision-making, the fear that machines will displace much of today's workforce has become more pronounced. CognitiveScale believes the real power and value of AI is not just automation of routine processes but in extending and enhancing human decision making and creative potential. According to a December 2016 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), augmented intelligence has the potential to create new jobs in fields that require creativity, social interactions and intelligence and general knowledge. In addition, a study from Accenture projects that AI will increase labor productivity by up to 40 percent and double annual economic growth rates by 2035 by changing the nature of work and creating a new relationship between man and machine. "This round of funding demonstrates continued confidence in our strategy to help businesses augment and extend human creativity and capabilities," said CEO of CognitiveScale Akshay Sabhikhi. "We have delivered real and measurable outcomes with some of the largest banks, healthcare and retail organizations, and are delighted to see the great client and investor demand for our enterprise AI products." CognitiveScale will use the recent funding to further advance the state of its two flagship products, ENGAGE and AMPLIFY, which are built on its open and extensible Cortex OS. ENGAGE focuses on transforming customer experience at the edge of the business through any digital touch point. It interprets user goals, preferences, and context and delivers individualized insights by reasoning across billions of curated industry data points while learning continuously. While ENGAGE works at the edge, AMPLIFY works at the core of an organization, helping augment knowledge workers with contextual insights and deploy self-learning autonomous processes modeled after human cognitive architecture. Both products learn from new data and customer interactions, and deliver future insights and advice that account for dynamic changes in goals, preferences, and the business environment. In a separate press release today, CogntiveScale announced that in addition to USAA's recent investment, the financial services leader is also implementing CognitiveScale's augmented intelligence solution so that USAA advisors can provide their more than 12 million members predictive, data-driven banking and insurance services.

Close Apple finally confirms its car plans Viknesh Vijayenthiran Jun 13, 2017 Follow Viknesh Add to circle Apple logoEnlarge Photo After years of secrecy, Apple has finally divulged some details on its much-hyped car project. In an interview with Bloomberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed the company is developing a self-driving system for cars, putting it in a race with rival tech giants such as Alphabet (Google’s parent) and Intel as well as ride-sharing giants Uber and Lyft and many of the major automakers. “We’re focusing on autonomous systems,” Cook said. “It’s a core technology that we view as very important.” He went on to describe the self-driving system as an artificial intelligence (AI) project that has the potential for “major disruption.” For example, just in the case of the auto industry, self-driving cars could lead to more people in cities choosing to skip owning a car, with automakers earning more of their revenue from offering rides instead of actually selling cars. Tim CookEnlarge Photo Cook wasn’t willing to reveal what Apple plans to do with its self-driving system from a product perspective, which means the company could still manufacture its own self-driving car eventually. The more likely scenario, at least initially, is that Apple either plans to license the technology or use it for a self-driving taxi service. Recall, Apple in 2016 invested $1 billion in Chinese ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing. Though Apple had never previously acknowledged it was working on a car-related project, comments from numerous insiders as well as the tech giant’s poaching of senior auto industry staff suggested otherwise. News of Apple developing its own car under the code name Project Titan emerged in 2013. Two years later it was thought Apple would have a car on sale as early as 2019, but in 2016 it was reported that the company had abandoned plans to develop its own car and would focus on self-driving tech instead. Cook's latest comments go some way towards corroborating the report.
