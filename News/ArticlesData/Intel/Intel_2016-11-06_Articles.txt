Intel’s drone are delivering increasingly impressive light shows, but that may be only the beginning. The tech company unveiled its new “shooting star” drone Friday as it released a video of 500 of the drones flying in formation in Germany this fall. The autonomous drones, which are essentially an LED light with propellers attached, darted around the sky, spelling out “500” and “Intel.” The drone shows could rival fireworks displays. But Intel sees a lot more potential than wowing crowds on the 4th of July. Anil Nanduri, Intel’s vice president of its New Technology Group, noted to CNNMoney that companies spend heavily to promote new products. “Think of a display in the sky,” Nanduri said. “What would you do with it?” By spelling out “Intel” with its 500 drones, the company has shown that advertising a corporate logo is doable. And as more drones are added to its light shows, it will be capable of even more complicated designs. Intel reached the 500 drone barrier less than a year after flying 100 drones simultaneously. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has previously talked of flying 1,000 drones at once. Since Intel’s drones fly autonomously, only a handful of people are needed to operate a huge light show. When Intel demonstrated the 500 drones in Germany, three or four people were monitoring the drones. Nanduri sees the lights as a favorable alternative to fireworks due to pollution and noise concerns. The flying drones also allow for synchronizing with music. Intel’s drones weigh just over half a pound, and their batteries last for 20 minutes. Intel isn’t the only one wanting to use drones for lights shows or creative advertising. Last week, Disney received a waiver from the federal government to fly drones at its theme parks. Disney wants to use “Flixels,” autonomous drones with LED lights, to accompany entertainment, including fireworks shows. And Uber has used drones in Mexico City to hover in front of cars stopped in traffic and advertise its services. Nanduri said he’s eager to bring the technology to the United States, but said more testing was needed first. Intel has already received an FAA waiver to fly its autonomous drone flights at night in the United States. Nanduri, who has two young children, said the drone project finally convinced his kids their dad has a cool job. “When they saw the light show,” Nanduri recalled, “They said, ‘Wow your team did that?'” Filed in: News Topics: drone, Drones Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Southern Bank News 3’s Proud Community Partner!

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 7, 2016 at 4:42PM Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), the biggest mobile chipmaker in the world, will soon also become the world's largest automotive chipmaker after it closes its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI). NXP only became the world's top automotive chipmaker last year, after it bought its rival Freescale for nearly $12 billion. Image source: Getty Images. This game-changing acquisition will send waves across the chipmaking industry, and investors should be aware of how the move could affect smaller automotive chipmakers, such as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY). NVIDIA One of NVIDIA's smartest moves in recent years was pivoting its Tegra mobile systems on a chip (SOCs) away from smartphones and tablets, where they were marginalized by Qualcomm's Snapdragon SoCs, toward connected cars. High-end automakers installed Tegra chips into their infotainment and navigation systems, and NVIDIA's automotive chips became one of its key growth drivers. Last quarter, NVIDIA's automotive revenue rose 68% annually to $119 million and accounted for 8% of its top line. NVIDIA is trying to expand that business further with Drive PX, a turnkey platform for autonomous vehicles. Major automakers such as BMW, Daimler, and Ford are already testing out Drive PX, and the platform could make it much easier for automakers to produce driverless vehicles. Image source: NVIDIA. But here's the problem -- when NXP acquired Freescale last year, it inherited BlueBox, another turnkey autonomous driving platform which competes against Drive PX. NXP already supplies the chips that control driver assistance systems to eight of the 10 leading automakers in the world, which provides it with a natural foothold in driverless vehicles. Earlier this year, Qualcomm introduced its Snapdragon Automotive processors, which modify its mobile SoCs for vehicles to counter NVIDIA's Tegra. Once Qualcomm closes the deal and bundles NXP's automotive chips, Bluebox, and Snapdragon Automotive together, NVIDIA's automotive business could struggle to keep up. Intel Intel recently partnered with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) maker Mobileye and BMW to develop a fully autonomous vehicle platform by 2021. That move expands on Intel's other moves to expand into driverless cars, including the acquisitions of Internet-of-Things functional safety company Yogitech and computer vision companies Itseez and Movidius. Intel's chips already power infotainment and navigation systems in select Hyundai, BMW, Kia, and Infiniti vehicles, but its presence is small compared with NXP and NVIDIA. Intel already fell behind a major technological curve when it lost the mobile market to ARM chipmakers such as Qualcomm and MediaTek. Since connected cars are often considered the next big computing platform, Intel must establish a foothold in this market to diversify away from its slower-growth PC and data center businesses. Qualcomm's purchase of NXP could make that very tough, since the combined company could bundle together a much wider variety of automotive chips than Intel. That competition could throttle the growth of Intel's fledgling IoT business, which grew its sales by 19% annually last quarter. Mobileye Mobileye established a first-mover's advantage in the ADAS market by linking older cameras and radars to braking systems. These solutions, which 90% of the world's major automakers use, are more cost-efficient ways to improve vehicle safety without the installation of pricey LIDAR systems or onboard computers. To address the needs of autonomous vehicles, Mobileye -- along with its longtime partner STMicroelectronics -- developed the EyeQ line of computer vision chips. Mobileye has posted double-digit sales growth in every quarter since its IPO in 2014. However, there are rising concerns that Mobileye will struggle to fend off bigger rivals such as NVIDIA and Qualcomm/NXP. Tesla Motors recently discontinued its partnership with Mobileye over concerns about its EyeQ-powered Autopilot system, leaving the door wide open for competitors to swoop in. Its aforementioned partnership with Intel should provide Mobileye with some financial support, but it's unclear if it can remain relevant against NVIDIA and NXP's newer computer vision plays. Should you fear the 800-pound gorilla? Qualcomm has now become the 800-pound gorilla of automotive chips, but investors shouldn't assume that the chipmaker can simply boot NVIDIA, Intel, and Mobileye out of the market. NVIDIA and Mobileye both have deep roots in the industry, and Intel can make additional acquisitions to strengthen its foothold. Nonetheless, investors should keep a close eye on Qualcomm's alarming advance into the growing market for connected cars. Leo Sun owns shares of Ford and Qualcomm.

Intel began its foray into drones in 2015, and new software allows the craft to create designs, and even choose drones based on battery life and GPS reception. In an official press release, Anil Nanduri, Intel’s vice president of new technology and UAV general manager said, “With this drone, we will be able to demonstrate that drone light shows can redefine entertainment and create amazing new experiences in the night sky.” He added that the computer chip manufacturer set a new Guinness world record for having the most drones airborne simultaneously.  © Flickr/ US Air Force Plot Thickens: Tunisia 'Has Reasons to Hide US Drone Base' Intel had to acquire a Part 107 waiver from the Federal Aviation Agency (FAA) to design the Shooting Star, allowing the craft to fly beyond the usual limits for that kind of vehicle. The Shooting Star has a six-inch rotor diameter and weighs just 280 grams. It also has a light emitting diode (LED) allowing it to beam about 4 million unique color configurations. The company reports,"The fleet is easily programmed, assembled and operated to create beautifully choreographed images in the nighttime sky," According to Digital Trends. The foam craft can operate in a light rain and features propeller cages, seemingly a precautionary measure in case the vehicle should find itself making an emergency landing in the middle of a crowd. ​ ...

(NASDAQ:AMD) [Trend Analysis] moved down reacts as active mover, shares a decrease -2.09% to traded at $6.56 and the percentage gap among open changing to regular change was -0.15%. AMD’s upcoming enthusiast processor lineup based on the Zen architecture would allegedly be featuring special variants aimed at overclockers. The rumor comes from Bitsnchips who are saying that these processors will be part of the Summit Ridge family. The rumor points out that there would be at least one such variant in the Summit Ridge family. The part will feature 8 cores based on the Zen architecture. These special, enthusiast-grade chips would ensure high OC margins but also ship with higher frequencies compared to standard 95W variants. The TDP would remain at 95W for the higher clocked variants given that these are cherry picked. It seems like these variants would be same to Intel’s “Unlocked” series processors. Intel K-Series chips are also aimed at a same market however, these are the only chips in Intel Core lineup that can be overclocked. AMD on the other hand, offers unlocked multiplier across all chips. But the special variants would generally be optimized for overclocking and enthusiast use. The firm’s current ratio calculated as 1.90 for the most recent quarter. The firm past twelve months price to sales ratio was 1.49. As far as the returns are concern, the return on equity was recorded as 232.40% and return on investment was -27.10% while its return on asset stayed at -16.90%.

Thanks, TC Team Disrupt LondonCo-founder Of DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, To Speak At Disrupt London Save £250 On Tickets Now Tech companies don’t want to talk about the lack of disability diversity reporting Posted Nov 7, 2016 by Steve O'Hear (@sohear) 0 SHARES Next Story PetSmart takes on Amazon with launch of same-day delivery and subscriptions Advertisement “Would you mind having an off-the-record conversation about your questions? Is that Ok?” said the PR rep at a leading publicly listed technology company. “Err… sure,” I replied, more than a little puzzled. The questions  —  which I put to Intel, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, Google, and Salesforce  — were pretty straightforward. I simply wanted to know why none of the major technology companies in the U.S. (with the exception of LinkedIn) include disability in their public diversity reporting, and if they had plans to do so. “Great,” continued the PR. “Let me tell you what I’ve found out…”. What came next, of course, I can’t quote or attribute to anybody at the company. Outside of a parallel public relations universe, this conversation never actually took place. I approached the next name on my list and a pattern began to emerge. “[Still] to be decided on what I’ll be able to share on the record, but I can definitely give you some information on background,” came a now-familiar reply. Others wanted to know who else I had asked, perhaps for fear of saying too much or making an unnecessary first move. “When is your deadline?” was also a stock response, before, in a number of instances, the trail went dead. It seems that many leading U.S. technology companies don’t want to talk about disability and employee diversity — at least not publicly. Why does this matter? According to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2015 only 17.5 percent of persons with a disability (PWDs) were employed and this compares to 65 percent for those without a disability. The Bureau also says that although the official unemployment rate for PWDs (counted as persons who do not have a job, are available for work, and are actively looking for a job) fell to 10.7 percent in 2015, it was still twice that of those without a disability, which stood at 5.1 percent. In 2015 only 17.5 percent of persons with a disability were employed and this compares to 65.0 percent for those without a disability. Now, as someone with quite a severe disability, I would be the first to acknowledge that there are myriad reasons why a PWD could find it difficult to secure employment or to work at all, and that employers aren’t always to blame. Agism could also be a factor, since disability disproportionately affects older people. And so could educational attainment; by some measurements, PWDs are less likely to be degree educated than those without. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is very clear: across all age groups and all levels of education, PWDs were much less likely to be employed than were their counterparts with no disability. That said, there are also many practical things employers can do to help PWDs overcome challenges at work, and in turn benefit from a workforce truly made up of all the talents. Why pick on the tech industry? At its best, technology acts as an enabler for PWDs, helping to level the playing field, and therefore can be a genuine force for social mobility. However, since disability isn’t included in most technology companies’ public diversity reporting, what we don’t know is how well the technology industry itself is doing with regards to the number of PWDs it employs and how this compares company to company. Without the data to back it up we can’t say for sure if a company is becoming more diverse, regardless of what efforts they say they are taking or how much PR they generate. The reason why an increasing number of technology companies publish diversity reports regards gender, race and ethnicity— and why it’s important that they do so — is it sends a signal to other prospective employees that a workplace is inclusive and that diversity matters. Crucially, it also enables publications like this one to hold those companies to account. Without the data to back it up we can’t say for sure if a company is becoming more diverse, regardless of what efforts they say they are taking or how much PR they generate. Here are the specific questions I put to Intel, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Slack, Google and Salesforce: Do you include PWDs or equivalent in your public diversity reporting? If no, why not? And, if no, do you have any plans to do so? If you do in actual fact collect this data (but choose not to publish it) are you able to share what percentage of your workforce identifies as a PWD? What is the company doing to encourage and support more PWDs getting into the tech industry? Slack The first to reply and most open was Slack. “Early thought is that Slack will include that information in our diversity reporting, as we are legally able to capture it, and employees are willing to share it,” said a spokesperson. The point here is that, if I understand correctly, you can’t legally force employees to declare if they have a disability to prevent against discrimination. Any reporting has to be non-mandatory and self-identified. The company was also willing to talk about efforts being made within the organisation and Slack’s inclusive culture. However, since it doesn’t currently track “disability status” it couldn’t provide data on how many PWDs the company employs. While we don’t track disability status today, we have channels in Slack where employees can opt in to discuss and self-identify… We keep an open dialogue with our PWD employees to get their input on how and where we invest in accessibility within the office (interpreters for meetings, considering new accessibility technologies, for example), and we’ve also hired some terrific people who are helping us create a product that is accessible for everyone. Apple Apple doesn’t currently include PWD employment data in its public diversity reporting. At first the company pointed me to its accessibility efforts with regards to its own products , something it also highlighted in a video shown at the recent new MacBook Pro launch. I understand that Apple believes making its products accessible is the best way to signal that the company welcomes employees with disabilities. However, I’m unconvinced you can spin the lack of PWD diversity reporting (and therefore accountability) into a discussion about product design. After I told Apple that all of the other major technology companies approached were going on record (which turned out not to be true), the company offered the following statement: Since our earliest days, Apple has encouraged people with disabilities to pursue careers in tech and help inform features on all of our products. We’ll continue to do that because we believe everyone should be able to use technology to do what they love. We foster a diverse culture that’s inclusive of people with disabilities because we understand that inclusion inspires innovation. Twitter Twitter does not include PWDs in its reporting but declined to go on record. However, I understand the company follows the EEO-1 report guidelines (required by the U.S. government), which doesn’t include PWDs. It also has processes for applicants, future employees and current employees to request accommodations related to their disabilities, and Twitter engages to reasonably accommodate these requests. Like Apple, the company pointed me to its accessibility efforts from a product perspective, and I understand that Twitter sees inclusion as a leading principle of the company. Intel Intel were surprisingly forthcoming. A spokesperson for the company told me it does not currently include data on employees with disabilities in its annual and mid-year diversity and inclusion reports, but “as the reports evolve” this could change. They were also keen to highlight the diversity work Intel is currently doing, some of which directly relates to working with PWDs: Right now, our $300 million Diversity & Inclusion in Technology Initiative and 2020 goal is focused around increasing representation of women and underrepresented minorities in our U.S. workforce. However, we have a broad view of diversity and inclusion which extends to employees with disabilities as well as veterans, who may not be accounted for in our diversity and inclusion reports but are not discounted internally. Through a combination of employee resource groups such as the Intel Diverse Abilities Network and accommodations, we are focused on creating a work environment where they can thrive and succeed. The Intel Diverse Abilities Network provides a network of support and sponsors education efforts for employees who have disabilities or have loved ones impacted by disability. Since the statement was provided, Intel announced it has expanded its diversity fund to include support for PWDs. That’s progress. Facebook, Salesforce, and Google All three companies responded on the 18th of October to my original request, with Facebook and Salesforce asking when my deadline was. Despite following up again 7 days later, I’ve still yet to hear back from either company. Meanwhile, the correct spokesperson for Google still could not be reached at the time of publication. Conclusion One of the off-the-record arguments put forward to not include PWDs in diversity reporting is that the resulting data would be inaccurate. Since not all employees with a disability would feel comfortable declaring that they have one, and not every disability is visible, the process would be prone to under-reporting. However, it is hard to see how technology companies can have it both ways: talking up an inclusive and supportive workplace culture whilst at the same time claiming that PWDs would be too afraid to identify as such. Either way, if the technology industry is serious about employee diversity with regards to PWDs, then it needs to find a way to be accountable. You can’t solve the PWD diversity reporting problem until you admit that you have one. The first step is to begin talking about it.

Eine durchgesickerte Roadmap nennt nun erstmals den Nachfolger: Intel SSD 610p. Im gleichen M.2-Formfaktor soll dieser die Maximalkapazität auf 2 TByte anheben. Außerdem enthüllt die Roadmap eine 600p als BGA-Chip und das 2,5"-Modell 545s. Anzeige Benchlife hat einen Ausschnitt der besagten Roadmap veröffentlicht. Bei Enthüllungen dieser Art hat sich die Website bisher als verlässlich erwiesen. Die Zeitleiste ist auf der Abbildung nicht zu sehen, doch heißt es im Bericht, dass die Einführung der 610p im vierten Quartal 2017 erfolgen soll. Allerdings trägt die 610p in der Roadmap noch den Status „in Planung“, sodass der „Launch“ auch später erfolgen könnte. Wie aktuell die Grafik ist, geht aus dem Bericht nicht hervor. Die bereits erhältliche 600p soll wiederum im dritten Quartal 2018 eingestellt (EOL) werden. Intels neue PCIe-SSD ist wie der Vorgänger mit 3D-TLC-NAND von IMFT (Intel/Micron) bestückt und unterstützt das NVMe-Protokoll. Auf den 80 mm langen Modulen werden bis zu 2 TByte Speicherplatz geboten, die 600p ist mit maximal 1 TByte erhältlich. Ob der gleiche SM2260-Controller Verwendung findet, geht aus den Informationen nicht hervor. Inoffizielle Roadmap enthüllt Intel SSD 610p (Bild: Benchlife) 600p als Single-Package-SSD Noch vor der 610p soll im dritten Quartal eine BGA-Variante der 600p erscheinen. Der Formfaktor wird mit M.2 1620 näher spezifiziert. Damit ist das Chip-Gehäuse 16 × 20 mm klein, genau wie es zum Beispiel bei der Toshiba BG-Serie der Fall ist. Die Single-Package-SSD wird direkt auf der Hauptplatine verlötet und soll mit 128, 256 und 512 GByte Speicherplatz erscheinen. 545s kombiniert 3D-NAND mit SATA Ebenfalls „in Planung“ für das dritte Quartal 2017 ist die Intel SSD 545s, die als Schwestermodell der 540s im Mainstream-Bereich mit SATA-Schnittstelle ausgestattet ist. Gegenüber der 540s findet ein Wechsel von 2D-TLC-NAND auf 3D-TLC-NAND statt. Im 2,5-Zoll-Format steigt die Speicherkapazität auf bis zu 2 TByte an. Als M.2-Modul wird wie bei der 540s maximal 1 TByte geboten. 21 Kommentare Teilen auf Facebook: 1Teilen auf Twitter: 1Teilen auf Google+: 0  WhatsApp Themen: 3D-NAND Flash-Speicher Intel M.2 Massenspeicher SSD TLC Michael Günsch E-Mail … zeichnet auf ComputerBase für das Ressort Massenspeicher rund um SSDs und HDDs verantwortlich.

(AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) 2 Bullish Trades for Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Earnings View All Posts With the U.S. presidential election dogging Wall Street’s heels, many stocks, especially tech stocks, are looking to bounce back after nine straight sessions of selling. Semiconductor giant Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) has had it particularly rough, with INTC stock plunging more than 12% since mid-October. But will the election results bring relief or misery for INTC stock? Click to Enlarge First, let’s look at the technical picture. There has been little to cheer about with INTC’s stock price recently. In fact, the shares are trading at their lowest point since July, breaching key support at $34 on Friday. However, the shares are bouncing back this morning, and are on course to reclaim this technical level — an important development for Intel stock bulls that could be a precursor to a rally back toward $36. That said, even if INTC falls post-election, support is rising into the area in the form of Intel’s 200-day moving average. This trendline is currently perched in the $32.50 region. July marks INTC stock’s last close below this moving average. Checking in on Intel stock’s sentiment backdrop, we find that the brokerage community is warming up to INTC. According to Thomson/First Call, 26 of the 41 analysts following Intel rate the shares a “buy” or better in November, up from 23 “buy” ratings last month. Furthermore, the 12-month consensus price target of $40.19 represents a 19.6% premium to Friday’s close. 7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire Growth The situation is already improving rapidly on the options front. For instance, INTC stock’s November put/call open interest ratio has fallen to a reading of 0.43 after rising heading into last month’s earnings report. Calls also more than double puts among options set to expire at the end of this week, with the weekly Nov. 11 put/call open interest ratio arriving at 0.47. Overall, weekly Nov. 11 series implieds are pricing in a potential move of about 3.75% by the end of the week, placing the upper bound at $34.86 and the lower bound at $32.34. The upper bound is just shy of resistance in the $35-$36 region, though follow-through buying should help push INTC stock nearer to $36 by the time monthly November options expire. On the downside, support in the $32.50 region, and Intel’s 200-day moving average, should stall any post-election jitters.

Called Shooting Star, the drone can be programmed to fly as part of a swarm which is able to be controlled by just one pilot from a single computer. Intel says that using its Shooting Star drone will allow lightshows that might once have taken weeks to be created in "a matter of days" thanks to its companion software and animation interface. Rather than animators manually calculating where and when each drone has to be in order to create a particular image, Intel has created algorithms which are able to automate the animation creation process.  Strength in numbers These algorithms take an image, calculate the number of drones needed, determine where they should be placed and formulate the fastest path they can take to create the image. With built-in LED lights that are able to create over 4 billion color combinations, it's safe to say animators will have the freedom to get creative, just as long as they don't want to create a show longer than the drone's twenty minute battery life.  To keep things orgainsed, the software is able to check the status of each drone in a fleet and prioritise the use of those with the greatest battery life and GPS reception.  Of course, safety has to be considered with drones that are designed to be used in close proximity to the public - we all saw what happened to Enrique Iglesias. To prevent damage to the drone or people in the event of an accident, Intel has constructed the Shooting Star with a soft, light frame made of flexible plastics and foam, and has encased its propellers in cages. Intel hasn't revealed a price point for the Shooting Star, or whether it will be made available to the public, so you'll have to sit on those plans for a magnificent Holiday light show for now.  Considering Intel had to get FAA approval to fly its drones in a 500 strong swarm in order to break a Guinness World Record recently, it's unlikely that we'll see Shooting Star light shows outside of professional events any time soon. This is a big achievement for Intel in the area of drone fleet control, showing that large numbers of drones can perform complex tasks in unison under the control of only one person. Such technology could be useful to a variety of industries, not just entertainment, and could even prove useful in transporting large items or assisting in search and rescue missions.  You can see Intel's Guinness World Record setting Shooting Star light show in action below: Fancy a drone?

Intel has ramped up its drone program and in October it unveiled the Falcon 8+ drone aimed at commercial applications. Today Intel has officially announced its next drone called the Intel Shooting Star Drone and it is made specifically for light shows. Intel used a fleet of Shooting Star drones in Germany to set a world record for having the most UAVs in the air at the same time. In that record setting event there were 500 Shooting Star drones in the sky at on time, massively outdoing the 200 drones used in the Palm Springs light show. Having 500 drones in the air allowed Intel to grab the Guinness World Record for UAVs in the air at once. The Shooting Star drone is the first drone made just for light shows and has a light-weight construction with “virtually limitless color combinations” according to Intel. Intel has also worked with the FAA to get a Part 107 Waiver to fly as a fleet with one pilot at night in the US. Intel says that it will be using the Shooting Star drones publicly soon. The Shooting Star drone is a quadcopter with encased rotors. It measures 384 x 384 x 93mm and has a 6-inch rotor diameter. Maximum takeoff weight is 280g and flight time is up to 20 minutes. Maximum range is 1.5km. The drones can fly in wind speeds up to 10m/s and the maximum speed in GPS mode is 10 m/s with maximum light show airspeed of 3 m/s. The integrated LEDs can create over 4 billion color combinations using red, green, blue, and white LEDs. The special software interface allows the creation of a lightshow in days instead of weeks. Intel plans to expand the system to work with more drones in the future.

The company better known for computer chips than flying machines showed off its new “Shooting Star” drone – or 500 of them to be precise – in a video (above) posted recently on YouTube. Setting a new Guinness World Record for having the most drones airborne at any one time, Intel sent its fleet of machines skyward for a special performance at a venue near Munich, Germany. The Shooting Star drone used in the display is a small, lightweight (just 280 grams) quadcopter featuring propellor cages, presumably in case a software glitch sends the machines plummeting en masse into a watching crowd. You only have to cast your mind back to Enrique Iglesias’s drone-related mis-step to imagine the kind of carnage that could ensue. Related: Watch this dazzling “drone ballet” in front of Japan’s Mount Fuji Displays using Intel’s specially created flight control system can be operated by just one person using software on a single computer that’s controlling the performance. “The fleet is easily programmed, assembled and operated to create beautifully choreographed images in the nighttime sky for an amazing new entertainment experience,” Intel said. The company explains that its proprietary algorithms allow it to “automate the animation creation process by using an image and quickly calculating the number of drones needed, determining where drones should be placed and formulating the fastest path to create the image in the sky.” Last year Intel managed to get 100 drones into the sky at the same time, with the company’s Natalie Cheung commenting that the more complex 500-drone performance would’ve been impossible to achieve then. “It’s been an amazing experience just to see the technology develop so quickly,” Cheung said. The entertainment-focused drone system has even been green-lighted by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing for the possibility of public displays in the U.S., something the company says it hopes to do soon. Related: Watching “umbrella drones” take to the sky is weirdly beautiful After missing out on the mobile revolution, Intel is working hard to ensure it performs better in the fast-expanding drone market. The chipmaker has said it’s keen to position itself “at the forefront of this opportunity to increasingly integrate the computing, communications, sensor, and cloud technology required to make drones smarter and more connected.” Its new Shooting Star copter showcases some of these technologies, with the company particularly interested in developing systems that can help drones fly with total awareness of their environment.
Experiments in program optimisation A bug story: data alignment on x86 Tags: C optimisation alignment 06 Nov 2016 I once had to calculate a sum of a vector of integers. This sounds unusual. Who ever wants to do this in real life? Normally, we only see code like this as primary school assignments or compiler benchmarks. However, this time it happened in real life. Well, the actual task was to verify the IP header checksum, which is a ones’ complement sum of two-byte words. Simply speaking, it means adding together all the words and all the carry bits produced in the process. This procedure has several nice features: it can be done very efficiently using the ADC processor instruction (unfortunately, this feature is not accessible from C) it can be done on any size words (you can add eight-byte values if you wish, as long as you reduce the result to two bytes and add all the overflow bits together) it is insensitive to the endianness of the processor (very surprising, but true). There was one important requirement: the input data was not aligned (the IP frames as received by hardware or read from a file). I didn’t have to bother about portability, as the only platform the code had to run was Intel x64 (Linux and GCC 4.8.3). Intel has no restrictions on the alignment of integer operands (an unaligned access used to be slow, but isn’t any more), and, since the endianness was not important, the little-endian case was also all right. So I quickly wrote: _Bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    sum += q[0];
    sum += q[1];
    sum += q[2];
    sum += q[3];
    sum += q[4];

    for (size_t i = 5; i < size / 4; i++) {
        sum += q[i];
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} The source code and assembly output can be found in the repository. The most common size of an IP header is 20 bytes (5 double words, which I’ll call simply words) – that’s why the code looks like this. In addition, the size can never be less than that – this is checked before calling this function. Since IP header can never be longer than 15 words, the number of loop iterations is between 0 and 10. This indeed isn’t portable – accessing arbitrary memory using pointers to 32-bit values is known to fail on some processors, such as most, if not all, RISC ones. However, as I said before, I never expected this to be an issue on x86. And, of course (otherwise there wouldn’t have been a story to tell), the reality proved me wrong, as this code crashed with a SIGSEGV. A simplification The crash only happened when the loop was actually executed, which means that the headers were longer than 20 bytes. In real life this might be very rare case, but I was lucky as my test data contained such headers. Let’s simplify our code to only contain this loop. We’ll write it in plain C and split it in two files to avoid inlining. Here is sum.c: #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdint.h> 
uint64_t sum (const uint32_t * p, size_t nwords)
{
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) res += p [i];
    return res;
} and here is main.c: #include <stdint.h> #include <stdio.h> 
extern uint64_t sum (const uint32_t * p, size_t nwords);

char x [100];

int main (void)
{
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < sizeof (x); i++) x [i] = (char) i;

    for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
        printf ("Trying %d sum\n", (int) i);
        printf ("Done: %d\n", (int) sum ((const uint32_t*) (x + i), 16));
    }
    return 0;
} This code SIGSEGV’s inside sum when i equals 1. The investigation The code of the sum function is surprisingly long, so I’ll only show the main loop: .L13:
        movdqa   (%r8), %xmm2
        addq     $1, %rdx
        addq     $16, %r8
        cmpq     %rdx, %r9
        pmovzxdq %xmm2, %xmm1
        psrldq   $8, %xmm2
        paddq    %xmm0, %xmm1
        pmovzxdq %xmm2, %xmm0
        paddq    %xmm1, %xmm0
        ja       .L13 The compiler was clever. Too clever, if you ask me. It used SSE (it was allowed to do so, because I used it elsewhere and had -msse4.2 in my command line). This code reads four values at a time (movdqa), then converts them to 64-bit format in two registers (two pmovzxdq instructions and a psrldq) and adds to the current sum (%xmm0). After the loop it adds the accumulated values together. This looks like a valid optimisation for the case when the word count is big, which is not our case. The compiler has no way to establish the typical number of loop iterations, that’s why it optimises for the highest benefits, correctly concluding that when the word count is small, so is the loss from the excessive optimisation. We’ll test later if there is such a loss and how big it is. What can possibly crash in this code? We quickly establish that it is that movdqa instruction. Just like most of SSE instructions that access memory, it requires 16-byte alignment of the source argument address. But we can’t expect such alignment from the uint32_t pointer, so how could this instruction be used at all? The compiler actually takes care of the alignment. Before running the loop, it calculates how many words must be processed before the loop starts:         testq   %rsi, %rsi   ; %rsi is n
        je      .L14
        movq    %rdi, %rax   ; %rdi is p
        movq    %rsi, %rdx
        andl    $15, %eax
        shrq    $2, %rax
        negq    %rax
        andl    $3, %eax Or, in more conventional notation,     if (nwords == 0) return 0;
    unsigned start_nwords = (- (((unsigned)p & 0x0F) >> 2)) & 3; This produces 0 if p ends with 0, 1, 2, or 3 in hex, 3 if it ends with 4 to 7, 2 for 8 to B and 1 for C to F. After these first words have been processed, we can run the loop (provided that the number of remaining words is at least 4, and taking care of the leftovers). In short, this code aligns the pointer to 16, but only provided that it is already aligned by 4. Suddenly, our x86 behaves just like RISC: it crashes when a pointer to uint32_t is not aligned by 4. Simple fixes do not work No simple manipulation with this function resolves the problem. We can, for instance, declare the p parameter as char* as a naïve attempt to “explain to the compiler the arbitrary nature of the pointer”: uint64_t sum0 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) res += q [i];
    return res;
} Or, we can replace indexing with the pointer arithmetic: uint64_t sum01 (const uint32_t * p, size_t n)
{
  uint64_t res = 0;
  size_t i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) res += *p++;
  return res;
} or do both: uint64_t sum02 (const char * p, size_t n)
{
  uint64_t res = 0;
  size_t i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++, p += sizeof (uint32_t))
    res += *(const uint32_t *) p;
  return res;
} Neither of these modifications help. The compiler is clever enough to get rid of all the syntax sugar and reduce the code to basics. All these versions crash with SIGSEGV. What the standard says This seems like a rather nasty trick of the compiler. The transformation it performed on the program contradicts to the usual expectations of a programmer who is used to x86. Is the compiler actually allowed to do this? To answer this, we’ll have to look at the standard. I’m not going to dive deep into various standards of C and C++. Let’s look at one of them, that of C99, or, more specifically, at the latest publicly available version of the C99 standard (2007). It introduces the concept of alignment: 3.2 alignment requirement that objects of a particular type be located on storage boundaries with addresses that are particular multiples of a byte address This concept is used when defining pointer conversion: 6.3.2.3 A pointer to an object or incomplete type may be converted to a pointer to a different object or incomplete type. If the resulting pointer is not correctly aligned for the pointed-to type, the behavior is undefined. Otherwise, when converted back again, the result shall compare equal to the original pointer. When a pointer to an object is converted to a pointer to a character type, the result points to the lowest addressed byte of the object. Successive increments of the result, up to the size of the object, yield pointers to the remaining bytes of the object. And also when talking about pointer dereferencing: 6.5.3.2 Address and indirection operators If an invalid value has been assigned to the pointer, the behavior of the unary * operator is undefined.87) 87) Among the invalid values for dereferencing a pointer by the unary * operator are a null pointer, an address inappropriately aligned for the type of object pointed to, and the address of an object after the end of its lifetime. If I understand these clauses correctly, converting pointers in general (except for converting anything to char *) is a dangerous business. The program is allowed to crash right there, during conversion. Alternatively, conversion may succeed, but produce invalid value that causes crash (or rubbish as a result) during dereferencing. In our case, either may happen if the alignment requirement for uint32_t enforced by this compiler is different from one (the alignment for the char*). Since the most natural alignment for uint32_t is 4, the compiler was completely correct. The sum0 version, although it does not resolve the problem, is still better than the original sum: the latter required the pointer to be of the uint32_t* type already, which required a pointer conversion in the calling code. This conversion may crash immediately, or produce an invalid pointer value. Let’s move the responsibility to deal with the alignment to the sum function, and, therefore, replace sum with sum0. These standard clauses explain why our attempts to fix the problem by playing with the types of pointers and the way they are calculated fail. No matter what we do to the pointer, eventually it is converted to uint32_t*, which immediately signals to the compiler that the pointer is four-aligned. There are only two solutions that work. Disabling the SSE The first isn’t really a solution – rather, a workaround. On x86 the alignment problems only happen when using SSE, so let’s disable it. We can do it for the entire file where sum is declared, or, if this isn’t practical, only for that function: __attribute__ ((target("no-sse")))
uint64_t sum1 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) res += q [i];
    return res;
} This code is even less portable than the original one, since it uses a GCC-specific and Intel-specific attribute. This can be rectified by appropriate conditional compiling: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif However, this isn’t really of much help, since all it does is make the program compile on other compilers and other architectures, but not necessarily work there. It may still crash if the target processor is RISC, or if the compiler uses some other syntax to disable SSE. Even if we keep within the limits of GCC and Intel, who can promise that another architecture, not called SSE, won’t be introduced ten years from now? After all, my original code could have been written 20 years ago when there was no SSE around (the first MMX is 1997). Still, this program produces very nice code: sum0:
        testq   %rsi, %rsi
        je      .L34
        leaq    (%rdi,%rsi,4), %rcx
        xorl    %eax, %eax
.L33:
        movl    (%rdi), %edx
        addq    $4, %rdi
        addq    %rdx, %rax
        cmpq    %rcx, %rdi
        jne     .L33
        ret
.L34:
        xorl    %eax, %eax
        ret This is exactly the code I had in mind when writing the function. I expect this code to run faster than the SSE-based one for small vector sizes, which is our case with IP. We’ll perform measurements later. Using the memcpy Another approach is to use memcpy. This function can copy the bytes representing a number into a variable of the corresponding type, no matter what the alignment is. And it does this in fully standard-compliant way. This may seem inefficient, and 20 years ago it really was. These days, however, it doesn’t have to be implemented as a procedure call at all; the compiler can treat it as an intrinsic, and replace with a memory-to-register load. The GCC definitely does. It compiles the following code uint64_t sum2 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    uint32_t temp;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) {
        memcpy (&temp, p + i * sizeof (uint32_t), sizeof (temp));
        res += temp;
    }
    return res;
} into the code similar to the original SSE one, except it uses movdqu instead of movdqa. This instruction allows misaligned data; its performance varies. On some processors it is much slower than movdqa even when the data is actually aligned. On others it runs at virtually the same speed. Another difference in the generated code is that it doesn’t even try to align the pointer. It uses movdqu on the original pointer even if it could align it and then use movdqa. This means that this code, being more universal, may end up slower than original code on some inputs. This solution is completely portable, for it can be used everywhere, even on RISC architectures. Combined solution The first solution seems to be faster on our data (although we haven’t measured it yet), while the second one is more portable. We can combine the two: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif uint64_t sum3 (const char * p, size_t nwords)
{
    uint64_t res = 0;
    size_t i;
    uint32_t temp;
    for (i = 0; i < nwords; i++) {
        memcpy (&temp, p + i * sizeof (uint32_t), sizeof (temp));
        res += temp;
    }
    return res;
} This code will be compiled into a nice non-SSE loop on GCC/Intel, but will still produce a working (and fairly good) code on other architectures. This is the version I’m going to use in my project. The code it produces for x86 is identical to that of sum1. Measuring speed We’ve seen that the compiler had full right to generate the code with movdqa. Was it also a good decision from performance point of view? Let’s measure the speed of all our solutions. First, we’ll do it on fully aligned data (the pointer is aligned by 16). The figures are in nanoseconds per word added. Size, words sum0 (movdqa) sum1 (loop) sum2 (movdqu) sum3 (loop, memcpy) 1 2.91 1.95 2.90 1.94 5 0.84 0.79 0.77 0.79 16 0.46 0.45 0.41 0.46 1024 0.24 0.46 0.26 0.48 65536 0.24 0.45 0.24 0.45 This table confirms that on the very small word count (1) the ordinary loops run faster than the SSE-based versions, although the difference isn’t really very big (1 ns per word, and there is only one word). The SSE wins on big word counts (1024 and more), and here the overall benefit may be big. The speeds are almost equal, with a small advantage of SSE (movdqu) on medium-sized inputs (such as 16). Let’s run the test for all the values between 1 and 16 and check where the break-even point is. The sum1 (non-SSE loop) and sum3 versions show very similar times (which is to be expected since the code is identical; the time differences demonstrate the measurement accuracy of about 0.02 ns). That’s why we’ll only include the final version (sum3): We see that the simple loops win over SSE versions up to the word count of 3, after which the SSE versions start to take over (the movdqu version, as a rule, being faster than the original movdqa). I think that, without any additional information, a compiler is right in assuming that an arbitrary loop will execute more than three times, so its decision to use SSE was completely correct. But why didn’t it go straight for movdqu option? Is there any reason to do movdqa at all? We’ve seen that when the data is aligned, movdqu version runs at the same speed as movdqa on big word counts, and runs faster on small ones. The latter can be explained by fewer instructions that precede the loop (no need to test alignment). What happens if we run the test on misaligned data? Here are the times for some options: Size, words Offset 0 Offset 1 Offset 4 movdqa movdqu loop movdqu loop movdqa movdqu loop</tr> 1 2.91 2.90 1.94 2.93 1.94 2.90 2.90 1.94 5 0.84 0.77 0.79 0.77 0.79 0.84 0.79 0.78 16 0.46 0.41 0.46 0.42 0.46 0.52 0.40 0.46 1024 0.24 0.26 0.48 0.26 0.51 0.25 0.25 0.47 65536 0.24 0.24 0.45 0.25 0.50 0.24 0.24 0.46 As we see, alignment introduces only slight variations in the times, except for one: movdqa version becomes a bit slower (0.52 ns instead of 0.46) at offset 4, size 16. The direct loop is still the best solution on small word counts; movdqu is the best on big ones. The compiler wasn’t right using movdqa. A possible explanation is that it is optimising for an older model of the Intel processor. The movdqu instruction used to work quite a bit slower than movdqa on Xeon processors, even on fully aligned data. It looks like this isn’t the case any more, so the compiler can be simplified (and the alignment requirements relaxed). The original function The original function that checks IP headers must now be re-written like this: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif _Bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    const uint32_t * q = (const uint32_t *) p;
    uint32_t temp;
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    memcpy (&temp, &q [0], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [1], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [2], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [3], 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, &q [4], 4); sum += temp;

    for (size_t i = 5; i < size / 4; i++) {
        memcpy (&temp, &q [i], 4);
        sum += temp;
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} If we’re scared of converting an unaligned pointer to uint32_t* (the standard talks about an undefined behaviour), it must look like this: #if defined (__GNUC__) && (defined (__x86_64__) || defined (__i386__)) __attribute__ ((target ("no-sse")))
#endif _Bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    uint32_t temp;
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    memcpy (&temp, p, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 4, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 8, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 12, 4); sum += temp;
    memcpy (&temp, p + 16, 4); sum += temp;

    for (size_t i = 20; i < size; i+= 4) {
        memcpy (&temp, p + i, 4);
        sum += temp;
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} Both versions look very ugly, especially the second one. Both remind me of writing in pure assembly. However, this is the correct way of writing portable C. Interestingly, even though we’ve established that the loop runs at the same speed as movdqu on the word count of 5, re-writing the function as one loop from 0 to size makes it slower (typical times are 0.48 ns and 0.83 ns per word). The C++ version C++ allows us to write the same function in much more readable way by employing some template programming. We’ll introduce a generic type called const_unaligned_pointer: template<typename T> class const_unaligned_pointer
{
    const char * p;
public:
    const_unaligned_pointer () : p (0) {}
    const_unaligned_pointer (const void * p) : p ((const char*)p) {}
    T operator* () const
    {
        T tmp;
        memcpy (&tmp, p, sizeof (T));
        return tmp;
    }
    const_unaligned_pointer operator+ (ptrdiff_t d) const
    {
       return const_unaligned_pointer (p + d * sizeof (T));
    }
    T operator[] (ptrdiff_t d) const { return * (*this + d); }
}; This is just a skeleton. The real definition must include equality test, a “minus” operator for two pointers, a “plus” operator in other direction, some conversions and, probably, other stuff. This type allows our function to look very close to the version we started with: bool check_ip_header_sum (const char * p, size_t size)
{
    const_unaligned_pointer<uint32_t> q (p);
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    sum += q[0];
    sum += q[1];
    sum += q[2];
    sum += q[3];
    sum += q[4];

    for (size_t i = 5; i < size / 4; i++) {
        sum += q[i];
    }

    do {
        sum = (sum & 0xFFFF) + (sum >> 16);
    } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL);

    return sum == 0xFFFF;
} This code produces exactly the same assembly as the code with memcpy and, obviously, runs at the same speed. Some more templates Our code only reads unaligned data, so the const_unaligned_pointer class is sufficient. What if we wanted to write it as well? We can make a class for that too, but in this case we need two classes: one for a pointer and one for the l-value produced while dereferencing this pointer: template<typename T> class unaligned_ref
{
    void * p;
public:
    unaligned_ref (void * p) : p (p) {}

    T operator= (const T& rvalue)
    {
        memcpy (p, &rvalue, sizeof (T));
        return rvalue;
    }

    operator T() const
    {
        T tmp;
        memcpy (&tmp, p, sizeof (T));
        return tmp;
    }
};

template<typename T> class unaligned_pointer
{
    char * p;
public:
    unaligned_pointer () : p (0) {}
    unaligned_pointer (void * p) : p ((char*)p) {}
    unaligned_ref<T> operator* () const { return unaligned_ref<T> (p); }
    unaligned_pointer operator+ (ptrdiff_t d) const
    {
        return unaligned_pointer (p + d * sizeof (T));
    }
    unaligned_ref<T> operator[] (ptrdiff_t d) const { return *(*this + d); }
}; Again, this code just demonstrates the idea; much more is needed to make it suitable for production use. Let’s try a simple test: char mem [5];

void dump ()
{
    std::cout << (int) mem [0] << " " << (int) mem [1] << " "
              << (int) mem [2] << " " << (int) mem [3] << " "
              << (int) mem [4] << "\n";
}

int main (void)
{
    dump ();
    unaligned_pointer<int> p (mem + 1);
    int r = *p;
    r++;
    *p = r;
    dump ();
    return 0;
} Here is the output: 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0
 We could have written     ++ *p; but this requires defining operator++ in unaligned_ref. The generated code looks very good:         call    _Z4dumpv
        addl    $1, mem+1(%rip)
        call    _Z4dumpv Conclusions Alignment issues are not only relevant for RISC processors. SSE makes them valid for x86, too (in both 32 and 64-bit mode). In our case the compiler was correct in using SSE in the generated code. However, it could have used an unaligned access – not only would it be more robust, it also would be faster (and would mask the problem, so that the program would crash some other time). There is a benefit in writing the code as portable as is practically possible: your own processor may suddenly start behaving like a totally different one. There is a lot of code lying around, which was written twenty years ago and only ever ran on Intel. This code may suddenly crash in a similar fashion. One practical advice is to disable all possible instruction set extensions while compiling such code – however, even that may turn out insufficient. This story demonstrates that there is something useful in code coverage tools. Here I was lucky that the input data caused all the code to execute. It might be different some other time. Update On /r/cpp on reddit, OldWolf2 pointed out that the checksum code contained a bug, in the last line:     } while (sum & ~0xFFFFL); He is correct: 0xFFFFL has type unsigned long, which is not necessarily the same as uint64_t. A long might be 32 bits, in which case the bit inversion would happen before expansion to 64 bits, and the actual constant used in the test would be 0x00000000FFFF0000. It is easy to construct an input where such test would fail – for instance, for the array of two words: 0xFFFFFFFF and 0x00000001. We can either perform bit inversion after cast:     } while (sum & ~(uint64_t) 0xFFFF); or use comparison instead:     } while (sum > 0xFFFF); Interestingly, GCC produces shorter code in the second case. Here is the version with the bit test: .L15:
        movzwl  %ax, %edx
        shrq    $16, %rax
        addq    %rdx, %rax
        movq    %rax, %rdx
        xorw    %dx, %dx
        testq   %rdx, %rdx
        jne     .L15 And this is with comparison: .L44:
        movzwl  %ax, %edx
        shrq    $16, %rax
        addq    %rdx, %rax
        cmpq    $65535, %rax

Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- It looks like product renders of the Windows-powered smartphone Dell was working on have surfaced, courtesy of trusted tipster Evan Blass. The photo shows what appears to be the phone that Dell was reportedly supposed to outfit an Intel processor with, in the same vein as those powering laptops out in the market today. When Evan Blass first posted the photo, many falsely assumed that it was the much-anticipated Surface Phone by Microsoft, but it wasn't. The photo actually shows the smartphone Dell was developing, "was" being the operative word here, since development was allegedly cancelled, so don't hold your breath for a Dell smartphone powered by an x86 Intel processor able to run Windows legacy software instead of miniature mobile counterparts. Specifications of the cancelled phone are scant, but the processor's x86 architecture speaks volumes for what could have been possible. The x86 tidbit came from Thurrott, citing a source familiar with the phone. If development came through, we could have seen a smartphone packing probably the most powerful processor inside a mobile device in history. Dell was wise to collaborate with Windows on this, since Windows 10 Mobile readily supports Intel X86 processors. With Windows 10 on the cancelled device, Microsoft's Continuum feature could have taken advantage of the beefy specs. We know how the Continuum feature works with the HP Elite x3, which HP advertises as capable of the full desktop experience, a quality it owes largely to Continuum, a Windows 10 functionality that turns capable phones into desktops by virtue of connecting an external display, a dedicated keyboard and a mouse. Just imagine Continuum coupled with a powerful processor on a phone and you get a true and seamless non-disruptive desktop experience made possible by a tiny flagship. It almost eliminates the need for a separate laptop, making it easy to assume that if the phone came into realization, a laptop dock could have come bundled with it, ready to harness the power of the phone's chip. It's up for discussion why the phone couldn't push through, but a key contributor to this might be the cancellation of Intel's low-end segment as a restructuring move back in May, putting a lid on the production of Intel Atom processor for mobile devices. While the phone remains a pipe dream even with the product renders, Evan Blass is slated to share more details about it shortly, slapping on a "More than just a concept" teaser tag along with a photograph showing several of the Dell smartphone's features. .@tomwarren Much more than just a concept.

Intel unveils a drone made for aerial light shows Engadget 11/7/2016 Jon Fingas © Provided by Engadget Intel isn't just using drone swarms to show off its robotics prowess -- it's building a business around them. The chip maker has unveiled the Shooting Star, a quadcopter drone tailor-made for light shows. Its companion software automates the animation process, telling the drone horde where to fly to create an intended image -- it'll even choose drones based on remaining battery life and GPS reception quality. Light shows that took weeks to design can now be ready in a matter of days, Intel says. You only need one pilot to run everything, and the LED light at the heart of the drone can shine in any of 4 billion color combinations. The hardware is designed to minimize damage if there's ever an accident. It's built out of foam, flexible plastic and caged propellers that protect the human audience below. Shooting Star can fly in light rain, as well, so that big night won't be ruined by less-than-perfect weather.

If you're just flying solo, there are likely better options available that can fly longer than the Shooting Star's 20 minutes, and at higher speeds. However, there's no question that the technology could be very useful for entertainers. While it was a big deal when Intel flew 100 drones in a swarm early in 2016 (enough to set a Guinness World Record), Intel successfully flew 500 Shooting Star drones together in October. That's enough to create truly complex patterns that are more likely to awe crowds.

By Sarmistha Acharya November 7, 2016 08:18 GMT Intel unveils Shooting Star drone designed especially for light shows Intel Intel has just launched its first drone, dubbed the Intel Shooting Star drone, designed specifically for light shows. It is the company's first drone created for entertainment light shows. The company has got the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approval to fly these drones as a fleet at night in the US, with one pilot manning the show. While the company did not divulge details, it said it is planning to use its new fleet of Star drones publicly soon. The new drone weighs only at 280gm or even less, almost equal to the weight of a volleyball. It is constructed with a soft frame made of flexible plastic and foams, without any screws. It features built-in LED lights that can create more than four billion colour combinations based on RGBW LED. The drone contains an improved software and animation interface allowing a light show that can be created in a few days. The company recently put the fleet of Shooting Star drones to test in Germany and successfully set a Guinness World Record for the most UAVs airborne simultaneously with 500 Shooting Star drones on 7 October. All the drones were controlled by a pilot. With the new fleet of 500 drones, the company outdid its own record set less than a year ago for 100 drones flying simultaneously. The announcement was made by Anil Nanduri, vice president in the New Technology Group and general manager of the UAV segment at Intel, who said the company will continue to invest in drone technology. So far Intel has acquired MAVinci GmbH, a drone company based in Germany offering flight planning software. "It demonstrates how a large fleet of drones can communicate and complete complex tasks," said Natalie Cheung, drone light show business director for the UAV Group at Intel. "This technology can be used for entertainment or for putting ads in the sky." She said a fleet of drones could be used to meet industrial needs, and that of search and rescue missions. Daniel Gurdan, the engineering lead for Intel Shooting Star drones, explained Shooting Star drones fly automatically, while maintaining stability in wind speeds of up to 33ft per second. "The flight controller is highly precise, very robust in gusty conditions and has proven reliability," Gurdan said. The earlier Drone 100 light show took about five months to build and required more than 15 people to manage. In the Shooting Star system the light show system can be ready in just a few days and needs only a handful of people or just an operator to manage. "The FAA approved Intel Shooting Star drones after reviewing the systems' protocols and safety implementation guidelines," said Cheung. "We're showing regulators around the world that UAV technologies used the right ways can help shape new rules for manned and unmanned aerial vehicles," added Cheung.

The company, which put its own drone swarms in the air around the world in 2015, has come out with another model — one with a software that will help a drone create an intended image. The software will even choose drones based on GPS reception quality and remaining battery life. This drone could help design elaborate light shows in a shorter duration.  Related Stories India, US Close In On Predator Drone Aircraft Deal Intel Acquires Voke VR Startup As It Moves Into Immersive Sports “With this drone, we will be able to demonstrate that drone light shows can redefine entertainment and create amazing new experiences in the night sky. ” Anil Nanduri, vice president, new technology group, and general manager UAV segment, Intel Corporation, said in the official press release. To design the Shooting Star, Intel has received a Part 107 waiver from the federal aviation administration (FAA), which will let the drone fly outside the regular limit for such devices. The company has equipped it with an LED, which can shine in 4 million different combinations.  One of the standout features of the drone is its form factor — it weighs just 280 grams and has a rotor diameter of 6 inches. It can also fly for about 20 minutes in light rain.  The company announced its developer-focused Intel Aero platform and Intel Aero ready-to-fly drone in August, expected to be available by 2016-end, according to its website. In October, it introduced the Falcon 8+ system — a multirotor drone with complete flight system redundancies built in.  Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

As a loyal Apple customer since 2004, I have to say that the fresh release of this year’s MacBook Pro has me excited. I am upgrading my system for the first time in three years; I generally upgrade computers, especially Mac laptops every three years or so; this helps with resale value and keeps hardware current to match the often-updated macOS software and ever-growing system requirements as technology continues to evolve. First… Design 2016 marks the first year you can grab a MacBook Pro in the Cupertino company’s popular Space Gray. The company’s marketing materials boast that the device is 17 percent thinner after the redesign. The keyboard has been overhauled to adopt a second-gen version of their butterfly mechanism, the first version of which debuted with last year’s ultra-thin, Retina display MacBook. There is less movement happening beneath each keystroke, yet early reviews find the increased key stability and tactile feel appealing, with one reviewer (YouTube user DetroitBORG who provided a comprehensive video review) remarking favorably about improved typing speed and accuracy, as well as the updated backlighting system: <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXBD_Ex4h8Y?start=384&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The trackpad has doubled in size, of course still sporting the Force Touch feature that simulates pressing a physical button through “taptic” motors; the trackpad itself is solid state, however, and there is no actual button beneath it. In addition, the speakers are dramatically louder, as well as a doubled dynamic range, louder bass, and direct link to system power, increasing peak power by up to three times (according to Apple). Ports / Connectivity Much to the chagrin of many, Apple’s continuing trend of homogenizing ports for the sake of thinness (and arguably to commodify connectivity with the necessity of adapters for peripherals) has come to fruition in this new MacBook Pro. There are four Thunderbolt 3 ports which each carry an extremely snappy 80 GB/sec throughput and can each provide power to the computer with the provided charger. Many were sad to see the famous MagSafe connector go, which the company touted for the first time in conjunction with the first-generation MacBook Pro in 2006. The benefit of the connector was the safety of your multi-thousand dollar machine from being yanked to the ground. Not to worry, however; third-party accessory makers have already shown a MagSafe-like fitting for the USB-C charging cable which allows for the same peace of mind. With all this said, Apple has decided to keep the traditional one-eighth-inch audio out jack in lieu of a Lightning connector. On the flipside, this makes the only two types of connections on the chassis the aforementioned Thunderbolt 3/USB-C and audio out. The USB-C port, seen here on a tablet, has been coupled with Apple’s Thunderbolt 3 standard for the new MacBook Pro, which uses the port for charging and peripherals. [Image by ruslan117/iStock] Performance For the first time ever, the 15-inch MacBook Pro offers 2 TB storage as an option, with vastly improved read and write speed for both screen sizes (just over 3 GB/sec read and 2 GB/sec write). These models also sport sixth-generation Intel processors. Dual-core i5s/i7s for the 13-inch model (3.3 GHz clock speed at the top end) and quad-core i7s for the 15-inch model (2.9 GHz clock speed at max spec). There was some disappointment at the choice to use slightly-dated “Skylake” Intel processor silicon, released in late 2015. The newest processor rendition from Intel codenamed “Kaby Lake” is rumored not to grace the MacBook family until 2017). Graphics Graphics are another sore point for die-hard power users; this year’s unit has integrated Intel Iris Graphics (500 series) on the 13-inch models, AMD Radeon Pro 400 series graphics on the 15-inch models, supplemented by integrated Intel HD graphics chips. For the first time in the MacBook Pro, graphics memory is upgradable to 4 GB. The main criticism is that for the price point of the machine, even the highest-tier AMD chips fall short of expectations. Critics on Apple forums have decried that this component will not be able to handle emerging VR gaming. With that said, there is now the capability to use an eGPU (external Graphics Processing Unit) to enhance the notebook’s graphics muscle. The speed of the peripheral interface that Thunderbolt 3 provides can be viewed as a mainline to the system’s logic board; with the proper eGPU, graphics performance increases of tenfold or greater are attainable… however, this comes with significant extra cost, and the eGPU market is only just emerging; this will make early sticker prices for third-party graphics units quite high. Display The new Retina-class display is 67 percent brighter; the utilization of the P3 color standard broadens the MacBook Pro’s color gamut by 25 percent more than conventional RGB. This will prove very desirable for color-intensive professions such as film/video and design, which require ever-increasing creative precision. The Touch Bar is a new addition to the 2016 MacBook Pro, offering increased usability and context-sensitive functionality via a changing touchscreen display. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] The Touch Bar, Piece de Resistance The newest feature (announced with perhaps the greatest fanfare by Tim Cook and company), is the Touch Bar, a glass, multi-touch capable OLED touchscreen panel that replaces the traditional row of function keys (still an option on the base model). Powered by an independent ARM-based “T1” processor (most likely similar to the first-generation S1 architecture used in the original Apple Watch), the Touch Bar also runs watchOS. In short, this intuitive panel functions as a contextually-relevant features panel. Depending on the application you’re using, the Touch Bar will respond. Fine-tooth adjustments to a project in Logic Pro, a long line of Emoji options while using Messages, word suggestions while typing; the potential is limitless, especially when Apple has published information for its independent developers on their website. Expect third-party apps to immediately make use of this new paradigm. Price The starting price for the 15-inch MacBook Pro including the new Touch Bar is $2,399; a 20 percent uptick over the starting price of the previous generation, as reported by Gregg Keizer in Computerworld. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar also sees a 20 percent entry-price hike at $1,799. Keizer continues in his article that this is not unprecedented for Apple. The stable prices of the past few years saw a similar jump in 2012 with the introduction of the first Retina displays. Conclusion Overall, Apple has released what amounts to a significant redesign over its previous generation MacBook Pro. While there may be some disappointment among the user base regarding the underwhelming graphics and last-generation processor, the aforementioned expandability that Thunderbolt 3/USB-C provides, the implications the Touch Bar has for increased usability and productivity, the optimized keyboard setup and faster storage, and of course brighter, richer graphics all add up to a significant improvement over the precious generation for many loyal Apple customers. Stay tuned for a review once I get my hands on the 15-inch model just before Thanksgiving.

Despite strong circulars from Kohl’s, JCPenney, Sam’s Club, Costco, and BJ’s, the largest retailers — notably Walmart, Best Buy, and Target — have all been quiet. While they still may hold out a few more days, it is likely all of their ads will be leaked by Friday. You can see a full selection of the latest 2016 Black Friday ads at BestBlackFriday.com, but here are the recently released circulars from Staples, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Michaels. Disclaimer: The author, Phillip Dengler, is the owner of BestBlackFriday.com, which is referenced in this article. The Inquisitr holds no ownership. 2016 Staples Black Friday Ad [Image by Staples] Leaked on November 6, the 15-page Staples Black Friday ad features an assortment of desktop computers, laptops, printers, monitors, office furniture, and accessories.

This is nothing new for them, as their ad last year was only a single page. Thanksgiving hours are going to depend on your specific location, but doors open on Black Friday at 6 a.m. Here are a few important facts about the sale. 20 Percent off Your Entire Purchase (Friday Only) Select Dyson Vacuums & Heater for up to $200 Off Save $30 on Keurig K55 Elite You can see the entire two-page Bed Bath & Beyond Black Friday 2016 ad at Savings.com. 2016 Michaels Black Friday Ad [Image via Michaels] Leaked on November 6, the 14-page Michaels Black Friday ad has an assortment of holiday-related items to get your home ready for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The sale begins early online on Thanksgiving at 4 a.m. EST. Retail stores will be open from 6 p.m. to midnight on Thanksgiving.

Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Update While the Walmart ad has not yet leaked, there is strong evidence that it will be released by the end of this upcoming week. Here are the dates over the past few years that Walmart’s ad has been released. 2012 – November 8 2013 – November 11 2014 – November 11 2015 – November 11 This upcoming week covers all of those dates, so Walmart’s ad should be out by Friday, November 11. Since Black Friday is earlier this year, November 25 compared to November 27 last year, it is unlikely Walmart would push their ad release back another week. Additionally, Walmart has already warned BestBlackFriday.com to not post their ad early. Traditionally, this notice comes a few days before the actual ad is going to be released, so it should be here soon. Expect it to come in the very early morning hours on November 10, with the possibility of it being pushed back to a little after midnight on November 11. As a reminder, Walmart’s website is currently hosting an “Early Bird” Pre-Black Friday sale, but you are better off waiting until Thanksgiving or Black Friday for the best deals.

A laptop-class Intel x86 processor was supposed to power the device, deftly harnessing the Continuum feature on Windows 10.  ( Evan Blass | Twitter ) Advertisement It looks like product renders of the Windows-powered smartphone Dell was working on have surfaced, courtesy of trusted tipster Evan Blass. The photo shows what appears to be the phone that Dell was reportedly supposed to outfit an Intel processor with, in the same vein as those powering laptops out in the market today. When Evan Blass first posted the photo, many falsely assumed that it was the much-anticipated Surface Phone by Microsoft, but it wasn't. The photo actually shows the smartphone Dell was developing, "was" being the operative word here, since development was allegedly cancelled, so don't hold your breath for a Dell smartphone powered by an x86 Intel processor able to run Windows legacy software instead of miniature mobile counterparts. Specifications of the cancelled phone are scant, but the processor's x86 architecture speaks volumes for what could have been possible. The x86 tidbit came from Thurrott, citing a source familiar with the phone. If development came through, we could have seen a smartphone packing probably the most powerful processor inside a mobile device in history. Dell was wise to collaborate with Windows on this, since Windows 10 Mobile readily supports Intel X86 processors. With Windows 10 on the cancelled device, Microsoft's Continuum feature could have taken advantage of the beefy specs. We know how the Continuum feature works with the HP Elite x3, which HP advertises as capable of the full desktop experience, a quality it owes largely to Continuum, a Windows 10 functionality that turns capable phones into desktops by virtue of connecting an external display, a dedicated keyboard and a mouse. Just imagine Continuum coupled with a powerful processor on a phone and you get a true and seamless non-disruptive desktop experience made possible by a tiny flagship. It almost eliminates the need for a separate laptop, making it easy to assume that if the phone came into realization, a laptop dock could have come bundled with it, ready to harness the power of the phone's chip. It's up for discussion why the phone couldn't push through, but a key contributor to this might be the cancellation of Intel's low-end segment as a restructuring move back in May, putting a lid on the production of Intel Atom processor for mobile devices. While the phone remains a pipe dream even with the product renders, Evan Blass is slated to share more details about it shortly, slapping on a "More than just a concept" teaser tag along with a photograph showing several of the Dell smartphone's features. .@tomwarren Much more than just a concept.

Intel did not waste any time and has already launched “Project Alloy”. Intel has acquired a small studio named Voke. Voke are the ones in charge with creating 360 degree content for public events such as basketball games or fashion events. A spokesperson for Intel stated that they bought Voke in hopes of accelerating their content creation process. The reason why Intel are interested in producing VR content is because first of all they can bring in some profits from that market, and second and most important reason is because the supply of VR content will increase VR headset sells. Intel are going to profit from people buying VR headsets because these headsets require quite a powerful PC, and most PC’s are powered by Intel CPUs. Intel has already started building a VR studio based in Los Angeles, and they have also purchased “Replay Technologies”. This company uses its freeD tech to present “bullet time” 360 degree replays of basketball matches in the NBA. All major tech companies are investing in virtual reality technology in hopes that the market will blow up. The only ones that are not involved in this movement is Apple. Sony are already selling their PS VR gaming headset, Microsoft announced that VR is going to come to Windows in 2017 and Lenovo, HP and Dell already have headsets on the market. If the virtual reality headset market blows up, Intel are surely going to profit off it, because they will provide both the content and the CPUs necessary. There have already been reports of huge profits from HTC which reportedly managed to sell over 140 thousand Vive headsets in just one month that cost $700 each. Oculus Rift have also stated in a report that their headsets have been used by one million people, and this was only in the month May.

Comments Computerworld | Nov 6, 2016 1:44 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Windows PCs Windows 7 Comments We're back. Windows 7 users can finally return to the normal world, where operating system bug fixes are installed in a reasonable amount of time. A few days ago, Woody Leonhard wrote about an improved version of Windows Update for Windows 7, one that installs bug fixes in mere minutes rather than hours or days. I have tried it on three Windows 7 machines, and it works fine, bug fixes install faster than a speeding bullet. This updated Windows Update is only for those in the know, but reading this blog makes you one of the privileged few. Spread the word.  The procedure for installing the fast version of Windows Update, as Woody describes it, is a bit intimidating at first. The biggest complication involves Bluetooth running on Intel hardware. What does installing a new Windows Update have to do with Bluetooth? Only Microsoft knows. Suffice it to say (Woody has the gory details) that the new Windows Update may break Bluetooth. So, the Defensive Computing thing to do is to make either a Restore Point or an image backup before doing anything else. INTEL DRIVER UPDATES Woody suggests first updating your Bluetooth driver using the Intel driver update utility. I was not impressed with the software.  For one thing, it installs the .NET framework version 4.5, without any up-front notice or warning. Then, it asks you to join the Intel product improvement program. Then, you have to reboot after installing it. And, when I first ran the software (version 2.6.1.4) it was so slow to start up that I thought something had gone wrong. Worse still, were the results; it wanted me to install two different versions of a graphics driver. Why two versions? It didn't say. Still not convinced? The version of the .NET framework 4.5 that Intel installed, needed about a dozen patches. Nothing inspires confidence like installing software with known bugs. The final indignity is that when you un-install the Intel driver update software, the buggy .NET framework remains. And, sad to say, any software from Intel now has to be considered suspect. Back in April, the company announced they were laying off 12,000 employees. There is no way to know which Intel software is still being maintained and which has been abandoned, especially since the company is shifting its focus away from PCs.  So, maybe skip the Bluetooth driver update and hope for the best. PRE-REQ The new Windows Update has a pre-requisite bug fix (KB3020369). Or, maybe two (KB3177467 supersedes KB3020369), it's a bit confusing. The three PCs that I tested all had the necessary pre-req software, so this was a rabbit hole that I didn't have to go down. One of the PCs was last updated at the end of August 2016, another at the end of September and the third in early October. According to Woody, if the pre-req software is missing, you simply get an error message, nothing breaks. DOING THE DEED To install the fast edition Windows Update, download either the 32 bit or 64 bit version of  KB3172605 (the links are in Woody's article). Then, I would reboot. Woody doesn't suggest this, but it's always safer to install bug fixes on a newly booted system rather than one that has been running for a while. Then, Woody says to go off-line, without saying why. My guess is that it insures that Windows Update is not running, something that Woody specifically says to check for. Step 1 of installing the fast Windows Update on Windows 7 To install the software, run the downloaded .msu file. As shown above, it starts off asking if you want to install KB3172605. The installation took about 30 seconds on my computers, expect it to look like the screen shot below. Step 2 of installing the fast version of Windows Update on Windows 7 After it installs, you have to reboot. Go back on-line, and Windows Update should be zippy again. The installation of KB3172605 creates its own Restore Point. MY 3 TEST COMPUTERS As noted earlier, I have tested this on three Windows 7 machines. None had Microsoft Office installed. The speeds that I refer to below are all in the first phase of Windows Update, where it detects the missing bug fixes. The downloading and installing phases have never been slow (if they are, that's a different issue). The first computer I tried was a desktop machine without Bluetooth (bullet dodged). The last time bug fixes were installed on this PC was September 28th. Earlier in the day, Windows Update ran for so many hours on this machine that I lost track and turned the machine off to put it out of its misery. Then, after installing the fast version, it took only three minutes (give or take) to find the missing patches. This was how I learned that the just-installed .NET framework v4.5, that the Intel driver utility had installed, was so buggy. I un-installed the .NET framework 4.5, rebooted and ran Windows Update again. This time it took about 20 seconds. Yes, that's seconds not hours. As expected, it found groups (a.k.a. rollups) of Windows ("October 2016 Security Monthly Quality Rollup ...") and .NET framework ("October 2016 Security and Quality Rollup for .NET Framework 3.5.1 ..." ) fixes. It also found a Definition Update for Windows Defender and the October edition of the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool. Nothing remarkable here, other than the timing. Next, I tested a laptop that never uses Bluetooth (bullet dodged again) and had last been updated August 28th. The new and improved Windows Update took about 5 minutes to find 8 missing patches. There were individual patches from September 13th and 20th along with the same updates as the first machine. The third machine was another desktop (yet again, no Bluetooth issue to deal with) where the last bug fixes were installed October 2nd. The wrinkle here was that I couldn't take the machine off-line. It was being remotely controlled and had no keyboard, mouse or monitor connected to it. Gambling that the point of being off-line was to insure that Windows Update wasn't running, I stopped the Windows Update service before running the .msu file. All went well, and the new improved Windows Update took about a minute and a half to find 5 missing patches. Initially however, the just-installed Windows Update failed on this machine with a 80244019 error. A minute later, it worked fine. My guess is that this was due to the delayed startup for the Windows Update service. I was over-anxious to play with my new toy. VIEW FROM A THOUSAND FEET Taking a step back from the trenches, it's important to note that Apple and Google have no problems installing bug fixes to their operating systems. Users of iOS, OS X, macOS, Android and Chrome OS don't have to deal with anything remotely like the situation described above. Yes, I know that most Android devices don't get bug fixes at all, but that's a different issue altogether. When there are bug fixes available for Android, the installation process is reasonably straightforward. Windows 7 users, like myself, have endured slow patch installations for months. There is an available fix, but we have to learn about it on our own, and potentially deal with the fix breaking Bluetooth. Then, if the necessary pre-req software is missing, we have to decide whether to install KB3177467 or KB3020369. And, what's the deal with missing patches that are not checked by default? If the fix is missing, why not install it? That Windows 7 users have to deal with things at this level is archaic in this day and age. An operating system should just work. Google is leading the way here as Chromebook users can attest. And, the latest Android, running on the latest hardware, is going to update the operating system just as seamlessly as Chrome OS does. That, is the future. I like Windows 7, but it's a dinosaur.

But impressive thin, light, gaming-ready laptops and wallet-busting desktop replacements aside—I'm looking at you, Razer Blade Pro—there's another small-but-compelling computer that's benefited from all this graphics goodness: the mini PC. For the first time (Gigabyte's awful Brix Gaming range and Alienware's modest Steam Machines notwithstanding), you can buy a PC that's smaller than a game console, yet packs in enough processing power to run games at ultra settings and 60FPS. Enter the Magnus EN1060, the latest model from mini PC champions Zotac. Inside its tiny 20cm-by-20cm footprint sits a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor and an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card, giving it enough graphics grunt to power games at the highest settings, even at resolutions above 1080p. It makes for a mean, highly portable, VR-ready PC. Unfortunately, stuffing such powerful components into a chassis barely bigger than a DVD case was always going to result in some compromises—and the EN1060 isn't quite the desktop powerhouse its spec sheet promises. Pragmatic, not pretty But let's start with the more obvious problem: this thing isn't a looker. The Zbox, with its metal chassis flanked by robust plastic top and bottom covers, definitely feels like it could take a few knocks, but aesthetically it feels awfully dated. Indeed, Zotac has been using the EN1060's chassis design for a few years now, and outside of a few small tweaks and internal changes it remains largely the same. It's the little things that do it: the large, highly visible vents that have been carved into its naff, textured black plastic; the entirely pointless glossy circle on the top cover; and the oversized power button sunk into the piano-black front. It's a mishmash of design elements that fails to form a cohesive whole. For something that costs £875 (or $1,000) before you put an SSD or RAM in it or load an OS, I expect better. The flipside is that, while the EN1060 isn't something you'd actively show off to people like you would a Mac Mini or even Intel's Skull Canyon NUC, its mundane appearance doesn't attract attention either. You could leave it out in the open in a living room and most people would assume it's a router, rather than a fully-fledged PC. Measuring a mere 210mm by 203mm, with a height of just 62mm, the EN1060 fits into spaces where even a PS4 Slim or Xbox One S would have a tough time, and while there's an external power brick, it's roughly half the size of the one that came with the original Xbox One. The EN1060 is impressively small considering what's inside. The EN1060 is impressively small considering what's inside. There's extensive venting on the sides of the case. The rear IO crams a lot in. Zotac includes drivers on a CD and a handy USB stick. The power brick is suitably small too. The design is practical too. Up front, to the right of the power button, is an SD card reader, a standard USB 3.1 port, a microphone jack, a headphone jack, and a USB 3.1 Type-C port, which covers pretty much every peripheral eventuality. Round the back is another large vent that gives you glimpse of the large copper heat-sink inside, along with two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, two DisplayPort 1.3 ports, two HDMI 2.0 ports, an external aerial socket for the internal 802.11ac/b/g/n WiFi, and—in an odd but welcome inclusion—dual gigabit Ethernet ports. The lack of USB 3.1 on the rear is disappointing, particularly if you're interested in hooking up fast external storage, but the dual Ethernet ports mean the EN1060 can pull double duty as a DIY router or a server. Barebones or go home The EN1060 is available in a few different configurations, coming with or without RAM, storage, and an OS. If you're comfortable with a small amount of PC DIY (we're talking very small here), then the barebones version is the way to go. To get inside the EN1060 you undo two thumb screws from the back of unit, then slide the bottom panel off—that's it. Inside is space for a standard 2.5-inch hard drive or SSD, an M.2 slot for super fast storage like Samsung's latest 960 Pro NMVe SSDs, and two laptop-style SODIMM slots—good for 32GB of RAM, until someone releases some larger SODIMMs. You can also get at the Intel wireless card if you prefer to swap it out for another model (read: anyone attempting to make a Hackintosh out of this thing). The rest of the EN1060 is standard across all configurations, starting with an Intel Core i5-6400T processor. While this is a quad-core chip, it comes from Intel's power-optimised range, with a TDP of just 35W, and is clocked considerably lower than a typical i5—at 2.2GHz with a 2.8GHz boost clock. It's an understandable inclusion given the small chassis, but bear in mind you won't be getting quite the same performance as you would from a chip with a higher TDP and clocks. It's a similar story for the GTX 1060, which sports the exact same specs as its desktop counterpart, but is clocked at a lower 1404MHz, with a 1607MHz boost clock. The EN1060 is easy to open by simply sliding this bottom panel up. The EN1060 is easy to open by simply sliding this bottom panel up. inside is room for a 2.5-inch SSD, M.2 SSD, and up to 32GB of SODIMM DDR4. With an SSD and RAM installed. Its desktop counterpart has a 1505MHz core clock and a rated boost clock of 1708MHz. While that 100MHz difference might not seem like much on paper, it doesn't take into account the far more aggressive boost clocks you get with a well-cooled desktop GPU. Indeed, in our review of the GTX 1060 Founders Edition—which sports a simple blower-style design rather than the more extravagant cooling systems of partner cards—it comfortably boosted up to just over of 1900MHz without overclocking. That's a hefty 300MHz more than the boost clock for the mobile part, and, as the benchmarks show below, it makes quite a big difference to performance. The mobile GTX 1060 simply can't boost as high due to its far more constrained thermals. Expand full story Page: 1 2 Next → Reader comments 66 You must login or create an account to comment.

Apple introduced three new MacBook Pro computers on Oct. 27: a premium 15-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, a premium 13-inch model with an OLED Touch Bar, and a 13-inch model without the OLED Touch Bar. The systems offer several nice improvements over the prior-generation 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros, ranging from improved displays and faster processors to sleeker industrial design. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Apple has built a great set of machines here, and I suspect that the new models will do very well in the marketplace. Nevertheless, there is one fly in the proverbial ointment with these new machines that needs to be discussed. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models use high-end Intel sixth-generation Core processors. The 13-inch MacBook Pro systems utilize dual-core Core i5 and Core i7 processors with Intel's premium Iris graphics, while the 15-inch models use quad-core Core i7 processors with lower-end vanilla Intel HD Graphics (though for graphics-intensive tasks, Apple has included more powerful stand-alone graphics chips in these systems). As of this writing, Apple's new MacBook Pros have some of the fastest notebook processors available on the planet. Unfortunately, though, these chips have been available for about a year now, and Intel will have more powerful notebook processors available in early 2017. Why did Apple choose older processors? The reality of the situation is that Apple launches its Mac systems—particularly the MacBooks—on its own schedule, rather than based on Intel's schedule. Apple likely wasn't ready to launch these new MacBook Pro systems when Intel's sixth-generation Core processors came out, so it simply had to wait until the system hardware and software were ready. The latest Apple Macbook Pro is expected to feature a 'Magic Toolbar' panel above the keyboard. Apple Now, Apple could conceivably have waited until Intel released its new seventh-generation Core processors in January (pushing out the MacBook Pro launch by a couple of months), but the company probably didn't want to hold off on releasing these long-overdue updates to its MacBook Pro line any longer than it had to. Furthermore, the differences between the sixth-generation and seventh-generation Core processors don't amount to that much; the seventh-generation Core chips can run at higher speeds for a given power envelope, and they have slightly enhanced media playback capabilities. Nevertheless, since Apple's MacBook Pro systems are marketed as premium products, it's probably going to come as a disappointment to some that soon they will be using one-generation-old processor technologies. Can Apple's Mac get back up to speed? Apple could conceivably update the processors inside of the new MacBook Pro models to incorporate Intel's newer seventh-generation Core processors early next year. The new processors should be pin-compatible with the current sixth-generation Core processors (meaning that the chips can be placed into the same systems without hardware modification), so upgrading the systems from sixth-generation Core to seventh-generation Core wouldn't be too difficult. Related Stories Is a 'Magic Toolbar' Coming to the Next MacBook? Four Ultra-Thin Laptops to Consider Buying Even if Apple doesn't do this, there's a pretty simple way for Apple to get back on track—skip the seventh-generation Core processors altogether. Intel's eighth-generation Core processors—which should bring significant performance/feature gains over the seventh-generation Core chips—should be available for notebooks during the second quarter of 2018, per a recent leak that's been circulating on the Web. Apple could just keep selling the recently released MacBook Pro systems until around May of 2018, at which point the company could release updated versions with Intel's new eighth-generation Core processors.

Samsung started preorders on Nov. 6 for its latest Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which will be generally available for purchase on Nov. 18. The Gear S3 smartwatches, which start at $350, include the Frontier watch in two versions—a WiFi and Bluetooth model, and a WiFi, Bluetooth and LTE model—as well as the Classic model, which is equipped only with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The Frontier model has more rugged styling while the Classic version looks more like a traditional digital watch and has a sleeker look that's designed to appeal to business professionals. Huawei has launched its latest wearable device, the $130 Huawei Fit sports watch, which provides multi-sport fitness tracking, heart rate and sleep monitoring, automatic step counting and more on a circular always-on display. Huawei designed the Fit to bridge the gap between a full smartwatch and a dedicated fitness tracker. The Huawei Fit has an aluminum body that comes in two finishes, Moonlight Silver and Titanium Grey. Three wrist band colors will be available—black, which is available exclusively at Best Buy through early January—blue and orange. Following the exclusive Best Buy arrangement, the devices will also be sold through Amazon, Newegg and other retailers. The Fit features a 1.04-inch circular black and white touch-screen display, 256KB of memory, 16MB of on-board storage and an 80mAh rechargeable battery that lasts up to six days on a charge with normal use. Google's efforts to push broad adoption of Rich Communication Services for cross-operator messaging on mobile devices appear to be gaining traction. The company announced on Nov. 4 that it has launched RCS messaging for Sprint customers that are using Android phones. The new support will allow Android users to conduct group chats, send high-resolution photos, receive and read receipts, and generally do more with chat than they currently are able to with standard Short Message Service. Sprint subscribers will see RCS support in Messenger for Android becoming available in 2017. All new Android devices from Sprint will have the RCS-enabled version of Messenger enabled by default on their systems starting next year. In recent months Intel has been demonstrating how aerial drones can be used for entertainment purposes. The company set a world record earlier this year by putting 100 drones into the air simultaneously, all of which were controlled by a single pilot. But on Nov. 4, Intel unveiled a new drone designed specifically for light shows and announced that the company in October had set a new Guinness World Record by having 500 of the drones—called the Intel Shooting Star—in the air at the same time, again being controlled by a single pilot in a demonstration presented in Germany.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

  News Apple Google Microsoft AMD Zen Summit Ridge Overclocking Variants Aimed At Overclockers By Talha Amjad  /  1 week ago Share Tweet Intel has their K-series SKUs when it comes to CPUs. These have unlocked multipliers, meaning that if you have the correct type of motherboard then you can overclock these a fair bit. AMD seems to be going down the same road with their AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors. Word has it that there will be AMD Zen Summit Ridge CPUs that will be aimed at overclockers as these overclockable variants will be able to go up a fair amount as compared to their non-overclockable variants. Rumors suggest that there will be at least one AMD Zen Summit Ridge overclockable variant and that these will come with a higher clock speed out of the box and will have a higher overclocking margin as well. It has been suggested that this AMD Zen Summit Ridge CPU will have 8 cores and a TDP of 95W. These special AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors will feature a higher price as they will be able to pack a punch. We will need to see how users respond to this. While Intel has only the K-series that can be overclocked, AMD offers unlocked multipliers across the board. We will have to see whether these new processors will be worth the extra money. More importantly, if users will deem them worthy or not. Last but not least, it seems that these AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors will not come with a heatsink out of the box like the regular models do. AMD did release their Wraith cooler a while back but it seems that these overclockable CPUs will need something much better than that. AMD Zen Summit Ridge series processors are expected to come out early 2017 so stay tuned for that. What do you think about these new CPUs coming out aimed at overclockers and PC enthusiasts?

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Nov 7, 2016 at 1:31PM Over the last several years, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has been working hard to bring down the losses associated with its mobile product development. Said losses peaked at just over $4.2 billion in 2014, but Intel says that they came down by nearly $1 billion in 2015 and are expected to come down by at least another $800 million in 2016. Intel's former Mobile and Communications Group general manager, Hermann Eul, at the launch of the company's Bay Trail platform for tablets. Image source: Intel.  This means that the losses in 2016 should be about $2.4 billion -- still substantial, but far better than where they were in 2014. The loss reductions have come from a combination of cost-cutting (e.g., cancelling projects and laying off workers) as well as a significant reduction in "contra-revenue" payments as its tablet processor shipments have dried up. Unfortunately, much of what has allowed Intel to dramatically reduce those losses are pretty much one-off impacts. Significant additional operating expense reductions are unlikely to be feasible considering the previous cuts, and the company's contra-revenue program looks just about done. This means that the next phase of Intel's mobile loss reductions needs to come from good old-fashioned improved business performance. The first place for Intel to start would be with its cellular modem efforts. Focusing on the modem Intel recently won the modem spot inside of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest iPhone 7-series smartphones, splitting the orders with wireless giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). This win is likely bringing in some much-needed revenue to the chipmaker's mobile division. And, if those modems are being sold at positive gross profit margins (they likely are), then those sales are likely helping to bring Intel's mobile losses down in 2016 compared to what they were in 2015. However, it's also likely that the margins on these modems aren't great. Not only does Intel's modem provide inferior performance to its Qualcomm-built version per Cellular Insights (which suggests that Intel can't charge as much as Qualcomm can), but the modem itself is believed to be built by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM). The lack of pricing power coupled with the fact that Intel relies on a third party to manufacture the part (and that third party makes about 50% gross profit margins on those parts) means that Intel is likely pocketing very little in terms of gross profit on these products. For Intel to improve its mobile profitability, it needs to make some changes to both improve what it can charge for its modems as well as the competitiveness of its products. What Intel needs to do To bulk up its modem average selling prices, Intel will need to narrow the gap with Qualcomm's offerings in terms of modem performance and features. Right now, Intel's best is several generations behind what Qualcomm has in the marketplace -- a fact that likely forces Intel to sell these modems on the cheap. Intel's mobile losses are still substantial and the company has made it clear the investing in modem technology is a key priority for the company. At this point, I don't think Intel's problem is that it's not investing enough in research and development, but rather inefficient use of those research and development dollars. Management needs to work to identify why its spending on modems is yielding sub-par results and take appropriate action to fix those problems. Beyond that, Intel isn't doing itself any favors by having these modems built externally when it runs its own chip manufacturing operations (and routinely boasts about how its costs are superior to what its manufacturing competitors can deliver). Intel is expected to build its next-next generation modem (XMM 7560) on its own 14-nanometer manufacturing technology. The good news is that by moving the modem in-house, Intel benefits in a couple of ways: Intel doesn't have to pay a contract chip manufacturer roughly 50% margins; the company can keep that for itself. Intel should be able to deliver a substantial power consumption benefit, all else equal, because its 14-nanometer technology is much more efficient than TSMC's old 28-nanometer technology. This could improve Intel's product competitiveness. The bad news is that a transition from XMM 7480 (built by a third party) to XMM 7560 (built by Intel) won't begin to kick in to the company's financials until mid- to late 2018. A potential mobile loss trajectory Intel may provide investors with an expected trajectory for its mobile losses during its investor meeting in February 2017. Ahead of that, I'd like to put my predictions out there. In 2017, Intel should get a revenue/gross profit benefit from having a full year of modem shipments to Apple relative to 2016, which should help overall profitability. Additionally, if Intel was still shipping significant quantities of mobile products that required contra-revenue payments during 2016 (and the first half of 2016), those should fade significantly during 2017. I don't think the loss reduction in 2017 will be anywhere near what it was in 2015 or in 2016, but something on the order of $200 million to $300 million might be reasonable to expect. In 2018, Intel probably won't be able to get any significant benefit from contra-revenue payments abating as I expect that program to be done long before then. During the second half of 2018, Intel could get a product margin/average selling price improvement from the XMM 7560, which could help further drive down those losses. Without Intel scoring significantly new mobile business outside of Apple, it'll be difficult for the company to meaningfully boost revenue to start driving down the losses. Intel has indicated that it still intends to remain in the mobile processor game, so if the company starts shipping significant volumes of mobile processors to various smartphone vendors in the 2018 time frame (something I frankly doubt), then those loss reductions could accelerate. We'll almost certainly know more about Intel's mobile strategy and longer-term financial expectations in a few months. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel and Qualcomm.

Unidentified leaked Windows smartphone is "much more than just a concept". By Owen Hughes November 7, 2016 18:17 GMT Do these photos show the Surface Phone, or another device entirely?Evan Blass/ Twitter Smartphone fans have been left in a flurry after a series of photos leaked online showing what some believe could be the long-rumoured Surface Phone. The shots, published to Twitter by serial smartphone sleuth Evan Blass, show a sleek black smartphone running what appears to be a full version on Windows 10. Alongside a collection of renders of the mysterious phone, Blass – known to the Twitterverse as @evleaks – uploaded photos that appear to show the handset being used in the wild. According to Blass, said handset is powered by a laptop-grade Intel processor. It should be noted that Blass never once mentions the term 'Surface Phone', although that hasn't stopped excited Twitter users speculating that the device could be the fabled Windows 10 flagship. Other sources claim that the subject of the images is in fact a Dell-made mobile phone that runs a full version of Windows 10, as opposed to Windows 10 Mobile. Tech news site Thurrott, which cites "sources familiar with the matter", goes on to report that the handset pictured was a planned Dell device based on x86 Intel architecture, that was scuppered when Intel abandoned plans for an Atom mobile chipset earlier this year. Whatever it is, Blass suggested in a Twitter exchange with the Verge reporter Tom Warren that the phone in the pictures is "much more than a concept", and suggested users keep their eyes open for further info. Exactly what we're looking at, then, remains a mystery. If Microsoft is planning a Surface Phone, it would likely be the company's last chance to turn around its mobile business. Windows Phone now accounts for less than one percent of the worldwide smartphone market and, with the arrival of entirely new product ranges like the Surface Studio and HoloLens, Microsoft may wish to cut its losses with mobile and instead dedicate itself to carving out a mantle for its new hardware. Either way, Blass usually tends to be on the money when it comes to all things smartphone, so one way or another we expect to hear more about this mysterious Windows Phone in the (hopefully) not-too-distant future.

Understanding how end-users access and experience network applications requires a new approach. Ten years ago, enterprises could count on Ethernet-connected, Intel-based Windows devices accessing on-premise applications. This made it possible to improve end-user experience within established use cases. But that scenario is the exception today rather than the norm. Most applications today are supported by a dynamic infrastructure distributed across on-premise and the public cloud.  And client devices are copiously diverse in terms of hardware, operating systems, drivers, and more. To add to the overall complexity, these devices are accessing networks via Wi-Fi over dynamic RF environments and potentially unreliable Internet connections. What insight can traditional application performance monitoring (APM) and related technology provide in this new landscape? APM tools answer the question of how long a client transaction takes to get satisfied once it hits the web server. This takes into account the transaction times between the web server, app servers, database servers, etc. APM homes in on the inner workings of a multi-tier application within the data center. Even a brief consideration of contemporary applications, however, reveals that this portion now constitutes just a tiny segment of the overall user application experience. First, IT is increasingly working with business critical applications beyond its control. When third-party applications are in use, IT cannot instrument a third party’s data center and the use of APM technology becomes moot. Second, using APM presupposes that clients are able to efficiently connect to the access network and subsequently reach the application webserver. When this connection fails, APM tools are not equipped to collect or analyze data from the wireless LAN infrastructure, the campus network services, nor the health of the WAN/Internet link. Limited by its scope, APM is simply not the right tool to address the complexity of issues users are facing before their transactions even hit the application webserver. What’s missing? To gain maximum visibility into the user application experience, network operations staff need insight into the client device’s ability to associate in a timely manner to a wireless access point, authenticate via RADIUS, obtain an IP address via DHCP, resolve domain names via DNS and finally transmit/receive data from the internet. If any of these steps fail, it would be pointless to consider the “application performance” since users have failed to even access the application. Maintaining complete awareness of all of these user network transactions is daunting for network managers who must sift through volumes of network, application and user data from a variety of domain silos. Evolving interdependences between networks, devices and applications are driving the need for a more holistic approach to IT analytics. Performance metrics about the application, wireless/RF, network services, Internet link, as well as device type and operating system information must be collected simultaneously across the stack. Next, these metrics need to be analyzed and correlated across time and other dimensions (e.g. locations, SSIDs, VLANs, etc.). Finally, advanced machine learning algorithms need to be applied on top of these metrics in order to surface insights and remediation advice proactively. Network managers largely concern themselves with the operation of the wired and wireless infrastructure, but as cloud-based SAAS applications, smart devices, unified communications (UC) and Wi-Fi become more pervasive, a broader, client-based perspective is required to answer fundamental questions about end-user experiences. User application analytics arrives A more complete view of enterprise application behavior from the perspective of the user requires simultaneously collecting and correlating client wireless performance metrics, network service performance metrics, device/OS information and, finally, application performance metrics. The most frictionless way to accomplish this is with a combination of real-time packet analysis along with data collection from other enterprise systems, including the wireless LAN controller, as well as APIs from UC and other applications. Finally, advanced analysis including machine learning must be performed on the data in order to automatically surface insights. New user application analytics (UAA)software technology looks to provide precisely this broad scope. UAA software runs passively within the enterprise access or campus network without the need for client software, synthetic testing, additional sensors or infrastructure hardware. Real-time application identification technology and deep packet inspection of wired packets, along with Wi-Fi metrics from wireless LAN controllers, are analyzed across the entire OSI stack for every client transaction as it occurs on the network. Applications are identified and performance metrics measured in real-time by looking at underlying protocol (e.g. HTTP, TCP, RTP, etc.) interactions and response times. How user application analytics works Application behavior for a given user, user group, discrete application, location or even a specific virtual wireless network (SSID) can then be determined and compared across a number of different dimensions to derive real answers to questions about the actual end-user application experience, such as: What is the baseline for user experience with application X? When the user experience of an application is poor, is it due to Wi-Fi, the device, the Internet link or the application itself? How does user experience vary across locations, subnets, SSIDs, RF bands, etc. Can users connect reliably to Wi-Fi and are link layer services being provided properly?  If I increase the capacity of my DNS server, how many client-hours worth of SaaS user experience problems can I mitigate? With UAA, IT staff are able to easily determine application adoption trends, traffic usage, individual and systemic client incidents and root-cause, historic trends as well as overall quality of experience for any user at any time. Unified Communications monitoring presents one of the strongest use cases for user application analytics largely due to the prolific uptake in UC and the investments in digital transformation of multimedia business content. For UC applications like Skype for Business, UAA hooks into vendor APIs to understand the user application experience with even greater fidelity. Call attributes such as mean opinion score (MOS), a standard telephony measure describing the actual user experience, are ingested, analyzed and correlated with other network transaction metrics. Today's enterprise applications are becoming highly distributed, often with components spread across on-premises data centers and public clouds. For network managers, a good user application experience can no longer be divorced from the underlying wireless access infrastructure, network services and mobile devices used to access them. This now places IT staff in a precarious position of having to delve deep into volumes of network, client, and applications data to understand the actual user experience.  New user application analytics technology promises to finally give IT staff a complete view of their network from every angle and quantitative justification for the billions of dollars in IT investments being made every year to keep user productivity on enterprise networks humming.

Mr Blass described this mobile as being "Powered by a laptop-class Intel processor," and asked, "Would this have blown your mind?" According to Thurrott.com the pictured smartphone was a Windows 10 'holy grail device', not the fabled Microsoft Surface Phone but a device made by well known systems maker Dell. Mysteriously, the Thurrott article says that the future almost arrived via Dell "but barriers have stopped this device from reaching the market." Its sources familiar with the phone model confirm that this was a Dell branded Windows 10 mobile with an Intel x86 processor inside. After being questioned about the device renders by various newshounds @evleaks revealed that the Dell Windows 10 mobile is/was "much more than a concept" and asked his Twitter followers to stay tuned. Another image accompanied this teaser with the smartphone shown in use in various environments. In further details about the product from Thurrott, the mobile apparently had a laptop-like companion to make the most of the Continuum experience. Looking a bit more about the reasons this smartphone was shelved, it was likely down to Intel's decision to give up on its low-end Atom processor development. It is noted that the HP Elite X3 gets close to the functionality offered by the Dell phone but its Continuum usage is limited due to its ARM processor and therefore its tie to mobile apps.

The funny thing is I'd actually pick a mid range WinMo phone over Apple or Android because of the rest of my MS integration at home/work but the one I'd be looking at seems so overpriced compared with the same spec Android phone. Admittedly I'm not a snapchat or similar user but for my usage (telephone calls/texts, navigation, web, email and ‘office’ stuff) it would suit me fine. Posted by Otherhand - Mon 07 Nov 2016 13:00 I loved my Windows Phones, but the platform was dead for me when (during an absurdly long OS redesign which apparently still isn't complete) they announced a guarantee that the app gap was over - that virtually anything on Android/iOS could and would come to WP, thanks to a cross-platform authoring system. The deployment window came and went, and Microsoft shrugged and pootled on. Nobody can dangle a carrot that large in front of its audience and not deliver. Its already small base suffered an exodus of people like me who had had enough of being treated poorly as customers. It's a shame, because it's a truly lovely OS in many ways, but they got into a whack-a-mole situation with bugs, and the new bugs that raised their heads were major. At one point, I couldn't reliably make or receive calls for a month and a half - an ability which a lot of people would say was a key reason for buying a phone in the first place. This bug resurfaced later, multiple times. The last phone I had was a flagship of its year, the Lumia 920. It had a serious overheating issue affecting all owners. There was a solution: turn off Bluetooth, turn off NFC. But even as this became clear, MS never admitted it was a fault. It was more important to them to keep selling a phone as having NFC/Bluetooth functionality than to consider the customers who, after suffering a phone getting to cooking temperature while idle in their pockets, would go to Android and never look back. Posted by 3dcandy - Mon 07 Nov 2016 13:45 It's dead as a platform. Apps are being discontinued left right and centre. Amazon app has gone, facebook app is months out of date.

It's a true 2-in-1 laptop, and allows you to separate the display from the keyboard, giving real tablet and laptop functionality. With it you get a full size keyboard, and the ability to pick from 4 different modes for viewing the display - laptop, tent, tablet, and stand. The HP Pavilion 12 x2 review also shows how the PC includes all the ports you need, from USB-C, USB 2.0, microSD, and even micro HDMI. The dual front-facing Bang & Olufsen speakers are a rare find on a laptop as well. Be sure to check out the full HP Pavilion x2 review to find out why this is likely the best budget laptop on the market today! You can pick up the HP Pavilion X2 now.

When used with the keyboard, it’s less than an inch thick, and weighs just under 3 and a quarter pounds. The metal keyboard base is easily detachable, allowing you to sit back and relax with it in tablet mode. Of course, if you need to bang out some emails, or just want the more traditional form factor, you also have the standard laptop mode. Other views include stand mode, which puts the display front and center, with the keyboard behind it, tucked out of the way, and tent mode, which HP says is great for watching TV, movies, or even my YouTube channel. Looking at the ports on the device, you have USB 2.0 and a 3.5mm jack on the left, and over on the right, there’s a microSD card slot, mini HDMI, and a USB-C port that’s capped at USB 3.0 speeds. This port is also used for charging the device. As for the processor, you can choose between the Intel Atom version with 2 or 4GB RAM which starts at $499, or opt for the version I have here, which rocks a sixth-generation Intel Core M3 chip and costs $549, just $50 more. That’s matched up with 4GB RAM, a 128GB SSD, and the touch display that you see right up front, with a 1920x1280 resolution and pen support - HP’s active pen is sold separately. It’s an IPS display, so viewing angles are good and don’t get washed out - you’ll wanna keep the brightness jacked up though, as I found the display to be on the dim side. On the sides of the display you’ve got a pair of speakers - don’t let the Bang & Olufson logo fool you though, as the sound that comes out of these is just average. The nice part is that they are front-facing speakers, which is a rarity on laptops and tablets. As for cameras, there’s nothing on the rear, but up front you get a camera that does 720p high definition video for those Skype calls. The keyboard itself is fine, you get enough space to not feel cramped, and also good travel distance on the keys so that you can feel that you are actually pressing something. The trackpad is also good - not the best I’ve ever used mind you, but for a budget machine, it gets the job done. One other cool thing here is when you open the Pavilion X2, you notice that the keyboard raises up, giving you a nice incline. It’s something you see other manufacturers do, like Microsoft does with the Surface, but it’s never this solid of a connection. It feels really nice here. All in all, the HP Pavilion X2 12-inch is a great machine for the money, and should get you through the majority of the day - I was managing roughly 6.5 hours of battery life. If you’re thinking of picking one up, I suggest going with the Intel M3 version, as you get a faster processor, as well as faster internal SSD storage. It looks and feels like a premium laptop, but won’t break the bank. Let me know if the HP Pavilion X2 is something you might consider, whether it be for school or work. If you need something with a similar form factor for business-class work, be sure to check out my video on the HP Elite X2 for comparison.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries e-edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Game designer's brainstormed ideas becoming reality Sunday Nov 6, 2016 at 12:01 AM Nov 6, 2016 at 5:49 PM Lindsey Tropf is close to launching "Tyto Online," an online video game in which the player creates a customized character who is an evacuee from Earth who must conduct ecosystem experiments on an alien planet to survive. Anthony Clark @AnthonyClarkbz Lindsey Tropf has been in the Intel Education Accelerator program in Silicon Valley since August with four other people from her Gainesville company, Immersed Games. The program mentors startup educational technology companies and puts them in touch with investors. In a couple weeks, Immersed Games will launch “Tyto Online,” an online video game available for PC and Mac through their website and the Steam online video game site. After starting the company with a $50,000 Kickstarter campaign and $400,000 from early-stage investors, the idea is to take data about the game’s use to the program’s demo day where startups pitch to venture capitalists. “We’re making our way in the Valley with investors out here,” Tropf, 30, said by telephone. Tropf started working on her idea for Immersed Games in 2012, recruited interns and employees, raised funds, and launched a smaller offline version of the game called “Tyto Ecology” earlier this year to make money — it has sold 15,000 digital copies — and prove that they were onto something consumers would enjoy ahead of the full launch. “It’s kind of mind-blowingly crazy to be able to think about this because ideas I was brainstorming three years ago are now in the game,” she said. In Tyto Online, the player creates a customized character who is an evacuee from Earth and settles on an alien world to conduct ecosystem experiments involving real and alien plants and animals. Maintain balance and your ecosystem survives and thrives. Out of balance and your ecosystem collapses. The game teaches real science concepts and includes links to videos and activities, such as a citizens' science website to figure out what invasive species live around you and what to do about it. “What’s really inspiring is our game is an educational platform where students are discovering really cool educational areas, but also learning they really like the stuff in real life and want to do something about it in the real world, too,” Tropf said. Tropf, who is from Vero Beach, was studying school psychology at the University of Florida and researching educational video games. What she found was that many games did not have a connection between the game and the learning experience, such as one in which you solve a math problem and then get to shoot a zombie, she said. Others only had a few hours to a week’s worth of content, requiring parents or students to constantly have to find new games. Having grown up playing online games such as “Star Wars Galaxies” and “World of Warcraft” that could hold players’ attention for a decade, she realized players could learn so much more from a better-designed and fun game. After talking about her idea for a year, her husband, Ryan, signed on. She met Creative Director Caroline Lamarque at a job and internship fair. She met technical founders Samuel Sewall and Victor Matos in a video gaming club on campus. The Kickstarter campaign allowed her to pay two people for development and others came on full-time with investment funding. Today, Immersed Games has 13 paid employees, including six through an on-the-job training grant from CareerSource North Central Florida, and 10 interns in an office in the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency building on Northwest Fifth Avenue. Employees include graduates of UF, the University of Central Florida’s game design program, the DigiPen Institute in Seattle and the Savannah College of Art and Design. Tropf said Gainesville has been a great place to get started with help from the grant, other entrepreneurs and the low cost of doing business. The challenge is recruiting millennials who tend to prefer big cities and investors who want businesses to be close to them, she said. Tropf said she plans to keep building on the game, adding more science, technology, engineering and math content over time, likely including heredity and possibly robotics. Science was a good starting point as an area of high concern and need that lends itself well to a video game where variables and systems are at play. Kids — as well as the Immersed Games team — are interested in animals, so ecology made sense. “This is a really big moment for us because this is the game we founded the company to do and plan on working on for the foreseeable future,” she said. “We see our company developing one game, but it’s a massive game you can play for years and years.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Subscribe Now Manage My Account Vacation Stops/Restarts FAQs Contact Us Terms of Service Submissions News Tips Letters to the Editor Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Advertising Advertising Advertise With Us Place an Ad Display Ads Classified Ads Online Services Newsletters Online Services RSS Feeds Text Alerts Archives Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Tech News Downloads Software Store Search for: BetaNews Hot Topics: Windows 10 Microsoft Apple Cloud Tablets Android Security Reviews Follow Us: Twitter Facebook Linked-in RSS Lenovo ZUK Z2: Promising smartphone, with a few caveats [Review] By Desire Athow Published 2 months ago 6 Comments Tweet Lenovo is already a well-established brand in Western Europe thanks to its personal computer brand which counts the legendary ThinkPad range and German manufacturer, Medion, amongst its ranks. It also absorbed storage vendor Iomega, IBM’s Intel-based server business and NEC personal computer range. The company has acquired phone manufacturer Motorola, inheriting yet another iconic brand whose name still carries a lot of value for a mainstream audience. But the latest move of the Chinese company, which is also the biggest PC vendor in the world, has been surprising. It launched a division called Zuk, which is a Chinese-only brand, apparently aiming to compete with the likes of OnePlus (a subsidiary of OPPO), Honor (a subsidiary of Huawei) and Xiaomi. Gearbest sent us the Zuk Z2 which is its latest addition to its portfolio, one that goes head to head against the Honor 8 and the OnePlus 2. The phone costs just under £200 including delivery; we would suggest that you read this piece about the pros and cons of buying technology from online Chinese retailers (links to our sister website, TechRadar). The Design No surprise there, ZUK uses the same sort of design that you’d find on premium models. Indeed, the phone has an air of iPhone 5 about it, with an entirely black finish. It sports lean lines and a minimalist design with dual 2.5D Arc glass front and back sides. As a business phone, the ZUK will have no problem displayed next to the latest high-end smartphones on the market. Not a hint of plastic here. The software is an entirely different story; more on that later. Glass is a premium material, but suffers from three big disadvantages. It is fragile (despite what Gorilla Glass will say -- note that the phone doesn’t use GG), it does attract fingerprints and it has a nasty tendency to slide on smooth surfaces (which often ends with a big thump when it hits the floor). To Lenovo’s credit, it seems that it used an oleophobic coating to make the rear and the front less greasy. The front fascia contains the speaker, a front facing camera as well as a physical home button that hides a few tricks. Just below that, on the shorter sides, is the headset input, the USB Type C connector and the speaker grill. On the side is the power button, the volume rocker and the SIM card holder. There’s no micro SD card slot -- the phone comes with 64GB by default -- and two nano SIM cards, both on standby, can be supported. At the back is a small ZUK logo -- no mention of Lenovo -- a single flash and the camera sensor. ZUK says that it used metal particle coating on the sides to enhance the phone’s look; what that means is that it makes it look matte. The Hardware The phone’s dimensions -- 8.5 x 142 x 69mm -- are great for whoever is not a big fan of phablets; ditto for the weight which tops the scale at only 149g. Bear in mind that it has a smaller than average 5-inch display, coupled with a full HD resolution, though, it does produce sharp pictures. More on that later. As for most of the high end vendors -- and unlike many of its tier-2 Chinese competitors which have opted for Mediatek chip -- the Zuk Z2 uses a Qualcomm one, the Snapdragon 820, a beast of a processor that runs four cores at up to 2.2GHz and has an Adreno 530 GPU. As expected, it supports 802.11ac, LTE (all UK 4G bands except Band 20/800MHz), LPDDR4 and Bluetooth 4.1. There’s also an array of sensors including a gyroscope, a compass, a hall sensor, a proximity sensor and a light one. As mentioned before the ZUK Z2 comes with 64GB onboard storage; note that the phone uses the slower eMMC 5.1 technology rather than the faster -- but more expensive -- UFS 2.0 one. The rear camera sports a 13-megapixel sensor from Samsung while the front one is an 8-megapixel model. Both have fairly wide apertures (f/2.2 and f/2.0 respectively). And the rear camera can shoot at 4K. The smartphone also came with a USB Type C cable and a tiny adaptor with a Chinese plug, but one which delivers far more juice than your average charger. It’s rated 2.5A at 5.3V which equals 13.25W or almost a third more than a standard mobile power adaptor. Sadly, there’s no NFC capabilities which is simply unacceptable on a phone in this category. This short-range, low power connectivity mechanism has become more popular and omitting it automatically excludes it from some use case scenarios like Android Pay. In Use As expected, the components in the ZUK Z2 deliver a stellar performance; it blazed through the popular Antutu mobile benchmark, delivering a superb score of 140,058 which is within spitting distance of the leader, the OnePlus 3. The display uses the LTPS technology, probably from Sharp (now Foxconn); that’s a similar display used by the Apple iPhone 7. The pictures look crisp even in broad day light with an average contrast and excellent brightness. Colors are not too saturated and looked natural with excellent viewing angles; out-of-the-box options to tinker with the display settings are limited though. As expected -- thanks to a pixel density of 441PPI -- the icons and texts remained sharp. The sound quality is one of the few weak spots; the mono speaker failed to deliver the oomph and reach the highs of devices like the Sony Xperia Z3 which deliver sound through two front facing speakers. Audio quality remains a recurrent issue with Chinese smartphones. One bright spot though has to be the fingerprint reader which can be configured and is not only fast (100ms response time) but also unobtrusive. The hardware only tells half of the story: bear in mind that this is a smartphone for the Chinese market so the installed firmware indicates that. We encountered Chinese characters when trying to update to the latest version of the OS (2.1.059 ST). Sadly, that didn’t go as planned and is symptomatic of the sort of experience you encounter with devices that are not location-optimized. We had to install a VPN to download the most recent firmware update as ZUK’s servers wouldn’t allow anyone from outside China to do it. And even then, we couldn’t install it because the phone was apparently encrypted (we couldn’t find any option in the settings to disable it). Furthermore, although the ZUK Z2 came with Google Play, most of the other Google services (Youtube, Gmail etc) were not installed by default. At the time of writing, there’s no English version of the ZUK website which means no official support (you can always rely on unofficial third party user forums, but at your own risk). As for the battery life, it was excellent. The 3,500mAh battery managed to keep the phone running for almost two days, albeit without any intensive tasks (no Youtube or gaming involved). Verdict Clearly, using this phone is not for the faint hearted. The number of hoops you need to go through to get an OTA (over the air) update is frightening and highlights the gulf that exists between established brands like Huawei or Samsung and those -- which, like ZUK -- aspire to match them. Obviously, Lenovo has no excuse to fall back on. The OTA experience should be much better than that even if it is a smartphone destined for the Chinese market. There’s also the lack of NFC which puzzled us as much as it disappointed us. And, while entirely subjective, the use of glass at the back instead of metal or plastic means that the phone is more likely to be scratched especially as it slides more easily on any surface with a gentle slope. Ours got a few scratches within 24 hours. Sure, a protective sleeve or case would help, but then doesn’t that negate the purpose of having a glass back in the first place? That combined with the fact that it doesn’t support band 20 (800MHz) makes it a no-no for O2 customers whose LTE service uses this frequency exclusively. MVNO customers from Giff Gaff, Tesco Mobile and Talk Talk are also in the same boat. In the end, the ZUK Z2 is a prime example of a phone that could certainly become a hit, but will probably have to be sidelined until the major issues highlighted before are solved.

Here, Jen Thornton – a Labour party campaigner from Cardiff – gives a glimpse of the time she has spent campaigning on behalf of Hillary Clinton in America “Hey, nice to meet you. Could you just talk a little. I love your accent!” This is how lots of my conversations have started in Charlotte, North Carolina. I’m out here campaigning for Hillary Clinton in the US Presidential Election. To be honest I also love their accents, and I have found myself occasionally saying “y’all” on the doorsteps. Americans are fascinated by the level of interest people around the world have in their Presidential race. We explain that whoever is the head of state in this superpower nation has a huge impact on the entire world, and that the entire world is taking rather seriously the possibility that a man like Donald Trump could be in the Oval Office. So, here I am. I’m with a group of over 70 British campaigners – connected as friends or campaigners – who have come out to Charlotte to play our part in this important election. 'Intel' When people think of canvassing it can seem like a scary prospect – knocking a stranger’s door to try to persuade them to vote for your Party or your candidate. In actual fact that’s almost never what it’s about. The early part of the campaign is all “intel” (finding out how they intend to vote) and then what’s known as GOTV – Get Out the Vote – when you go back to just favourable voters and make sure they’re actually casting their votes. The fear factor runs high as America prepares to vote In North Carolina, people can “Early Vote” from October 20 to November 5, so the focus of our door knocking since I’ve been here has been on that. Something like 60% of voters in Charlotte will vote early, so it has been really important to get the vote out for Hillary out during that time. Early voting is a really big part of the campaign here. People can vote early at any designated polling station in the county area, so it makes it easier for people to get to the polls when they’re working or have busy lives. An election forecast: Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in  Share this video Watch Next It also gives campaigners a lot more opportunities to remind voters to go and vote. If people haven’t yet registered to vote they can also turn up at an Early Vote location and register and vote at the same time. This is a game-changer for voter turnout, particularly in typically disengaged areas and communities. 'Many say they won't vote' In the UK registration closes several weeks before election days so once someone’s missed it, however passionate they are, they cannot vote. The other big difference over here is the “down ticket” races. In Wales this May we voted for our constituency Assembly Members, regional Assembly Members and Police and Crime Commissioners on three different papers. Read More Welsh Americans told us how they think life will change under Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump Here they’ll vote for everyone from the state Governor and Senator to the state Commissioner for Agriculture – and for the President – on one ballot paper. It’s complicated, but our goal is to get people voting the whole state-wide Democratic slate. Jen Thornton - a Cardiffian campaigning for Clinton On the doorsteps as we’re targeting people identified as Democratic supporters, almost all our conversations are positive, though we have spoken to some who say that though they’re Democrats they don’t want to vote for Hillary. Sadly, many of these people are saying they won’t vote at all. In a state this tight, turnout matters, so it’s our key priority to get those people to go to the polling stations. The negativity of the campaigns here is an interesting difference. “Attack ads” on radio and television are almost constant, and it’s much more likely to hear “Hillary - unfit for office” than what the Republican candidate would actually do for people. Read More We asked Welsh Americans who they would vote for as election day looms While there’s a little of this in the UK, political campaigns are not able to buy commercial broadcast advertising so their one-hit Party Political Broadcasts are more likely to be focused on what they will do for the country, rather than the negative aspects of the other parties. 'I can only hope' There’s also news cycle after news cycle with stories about Hillary’s possible indictment regarding some supposed improper emails. This, I know, is making headlines in the UK too. It seems to have an impact on some voters but at this late stage almost everyone has either made their mind up or won’t be voting at all. “Undecideds”, as they’re known, are more important earlier in the race. Right now we just want to get our vote to turn out. While we’ve been out here we’ve also been able to go to a couple of rallies and hear Bill Clinton and Joe Biden speak. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton greets a baby outside an early voting center in West Miami, Fla.,Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) These events are often used as a way to get people volunteering, and make sure they hear from the senate, state legislature and other candidates as well as the headliner. Today we’ll be seeing President Obama and it’s safe to say the group is excited. As I write this, the latest North Carolina state-wide poll has Trump 0.5% ahead. This is, of course, within the margin of error but polling this tight does send campaigners into frenzied activity. It really is too close to call at the moment, but I can only hope we succeed and Hillary Clinton is the next President of the USA.

Called "Chandrabhaga", this ancient river is believed to have existed at a distance of about two km from the 13th century Sun Temple at Konark, a Unesco World Heritage Site in the eastern state of Odisha. No trace of any water body is at present visible in the proximity of the temple, but "the mythical river figures prominently in ancient literature", the scientists report in the journal Current Science. Almost all myths regarding Konark, including illustrations and photographs, indicate the presence of the Chandrabhaga river in the proximity of the temple, they say. The IIT study aimed to verify this myth. They did this through integrated geological and geophysical exploration in conjunction with historical evidence and analysis of satellite data. Imagery from Landsat and Terra satellites of the US and those obtained by NASA Space Shuttle Endeavour's "Radar Topographic Mission" in 2000 were used. According to their report, the satellite imagery and Google Earth image showed a "sinusoidal" trace, characteristic of a typical "palaeo-channel" -- remnant of an inactive river -- passing north of the Sun Temple extending approximately parallel to the coast. The existence of a palaeo-channel was further corroborated through profiling the surface using "ground penetrating radar" that showed the existence of a V-shaped subsurface river valley, the scientists report. Field studies revealed that the suspected palaeo-channel is characterised by swampy lands covered with water hyacinth plants and geologically, the study area "is covered with alluvium, a deposit characteristic of rivers". The gravity data collected from past sources also showed a low gravity anomaly zone along the suspected palaeo-channel -- an indication of the presence of low density sedimentary deposits along the depressed zone. All the evidence, including sinusoidal pattern of the river as seen in satellite imagery; patches of water bodies at various locations along the channel and the V-shaped depression seen along the elevation profile suggesting a past river valley, "indicate the presence of a palaeo-channel near Konark", the scientists conclude. "Combining the myths with scientific and historical evidence, the identified palaeo-channel may be correlated to the lost river Chandrabhaga," they say. "What caused the extinction of this river remains a subject of further investigation." According to the IIT team, identification of such a palaeo-channel "may lead to the delineation of pockets of freshwater zones within a dominantly saline water environment, and may even partially alleviate the drinking-water problem along the Odisha coast".

The Leaked Intel-Powered Windows Phone Was Not the Surface Phone GO Report claims it was just a project developed by Dell Nov 6, 2016 08:51 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  A couple of days ago, famous leaker Evan Blass posted photos of what he suggested to be an Intel-powered Windows Phone, and it goes without saying that many of those who clicked them thought it was the Surface Phone. The Surface Phone is pretty much the most anticipated Windows Phone and is supposed to be Microsoft’s next big thing in mobile that should help reignite interest in the company’s smartphone platform. Given the previous rumors that the Surface Phone could come with x86 architecture, it’s easy to see why so many people believed this was it. But a new report from Thurrott and citing sources familiar with the phone claims this wasn’t the Surface Phone, but only a project developed by Dell. Information remains rather vague at the moment, and the source says that the shots we’ve seen online might only be renders and not photos of the actual product. Phablet or small tablet with cellular connectivity What’s more important, however, is that the device was developed to run on an Intel chip, and judging from the photos, it was supposed to come with a companion product like a laptop, which is a sign that Dell wanted to maximize the potential of Windows 10 Mobile and Continuum. Judging from how big it seems to be in the photos, the phone was most likely a phablet or a small tablet with cellular connectivity, so a 7-inch display seems very likely. As for the reasons why the phone was abandoned, very little is known so far, but it’s believed that bringing an Intel chip on phones is still a big challenge that manufacturers are yet to deal with. Cooling an Intel CPU without a fan in such a small body is still super difficult, while offering decent battery life continues to be impossible, especially if the end goal is to run desktop applications. On the other hand, this project gives hope that someone might at some point actually build an Intel-powered Windows phone and Microsoft could very well be the pioneer in this direction. The Surface Phone is expected to launch next year, but specifics are not available at this moment. #Microsoft#Windows 10#Windows 10 Mobile#Windows Phone#Surface Phone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Microsoft to Make Skype the iMessage of Android Photos of an Intel-Powered Windows Phone Get Leaked Microsoft Makes Windows 10 Updates Smaller and Faster with New OS Feature Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Creators Update Build 14959 Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year Firefox 50.0 Officially Released for Linux, Mac and Windows, Here's What's New Some U.S. Android Phones Have Secret Backdoor That Sends Data to China Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Microsoft Pledges to Completely Retire Office 2007 Next Year X.Org Server 1.19.0 Officially Released, Coming Soon to a Linux Distro Near You Red Hat Software Collections 2.3 and Red Hat Developer Toolset 6 Available Now Linux Kernel 4.4.32 LTS Adds Networking Improvements, Updated AMDGPU Drivers    Alleged Intel-powered Windows phone New Apps Battery Life Maximizer: Extend your laptop's battery life by identifying problems, such as power hungry processes and badly configured components, with this useful tool Exact Duplicate Finder: Find and delete duplicate files to free up space on the disk, filter files by type, send clones to the trash can or move them somewhere else Fotosizer Standard Edition: User-friendly and handy piece of software designed to help you resize photos to a custom size, apply several effects and convert them to a different file format using batch processing tasks Intel Remote Keyboard Host App: Seamless manage your Intel NUC or Intel Compute Stick from your mobile device over WiFi using this straightforward and intuitive tool AVS Document Converter: Perform conversion operations between DOC, PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF, HTML, GIF, PNG, EPUB, or other file format in a batch mode using this handy app Power-user: Take advantage of an extensive collection of templates, maps, diagrams, charts and illustrations, as well as a number of useful tools, by installing this handy PowerPoint add-in AIO Boot: Create a bootable USB drive or HDD with Grub2 or Clover, and integrate multiple support packages, with this minimalistic utility Reader comments Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

GamesRadar+ Awards News Reviews Playstation Xbox Nintendo Movies More TV Cool Stuff Magazines Official Xbox Official PlayStation GamesMaster Edge SFX Total Film Search Meet the $11,000 ultra PC based on a religious artifact (and how you can build it too) By Sam Prell Shares Our friends over at sister site PC Gamer have been busy these past few weeks, putting the finishing touches on what just might be the most powerful gaming PC ever built. At least, until they decide to do it again in a few years. Say hello to The Large Pixel Collider: Some of you out there might think this sounds a bit familiar. That's because PC Gamer started the project in 2013, with a similar (albeit less visually snazzy) build. But time marches on and technology improves, and before long it was time to unveil a new Large Pixel Collider, updated for 2016. Over on PC Gamer, you can check out everything there is to know about the LPC 2016, including a dissection of each component and a video series of games running on the beast. Now for the fun part: building your own. The case and cooling are both custom, crafted by veteran modders Lee Harrington and Ron Christianson. So if you want your version of the LPC to look just as gnarly, you'll need someone with skills in arts and crafts. But if you want to dig into the guts and build something comparable in terms of specs (and you've got about $11,000 to spend, almost $4,000 of which is on the GPUs alone) here's what you need, with links to where you can buy them on Amazon: Processor: Intel Core-i7 6950X 10 cores overclocked to 4.0 GHz 25 MB cache Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Socket LGA 2011‑3 GPU: 2x Nvidia Titan X Total 24 GB GDDR5X memory 1531 MHz boost clock Motherboard: ASUS ROG Rampage V Edition 10 Metal-reinforced PCIe slots SupremeFX Hi-Fi USB DAC + SupremeFX Audio 5-zone RGB onboard lighting RAM: 128GB Corsair Dominator Platinum Special Edition DDR4 SSD: 2x Intel 750 Series PCIe NVMe 1.2TB Read/write speeds of up to 2200/1200MB/s 4K random IO 440K/290K IOPS HDD: 4x Seagate Barracuda Pro 10TB Helium PSU: EVGA SuperNova T2 1600W Titanium efficiency rating  Cooling: EKWB water cooling Case: CaseLabs Mercury S8 (modified) Seen something newsworthy?

DPP's Blog Home About Archive Consulting Dell Precision: Works after a Fashion November 7, 2016 Put on your Linux Wading Boots Last week, I took delivery of a Dell Precision 5510 "pre-loaded" with Linux. It did not work so well. The folks at Dell worked to provide support, but at the end of the day, the version of Ubuntu shipped with the Precision was too fragile and the standard Ubuntu installer couldn't create a boot loader. However, the Precision 5510 is very nice hardware and I have a significant need for a laptop with more than 16GB of RAM. I've also using Linux since 1996 and Linux on laptops since 2000. What I needed was a mind-set change. I needed to change my mind-set from "this should work like OS X, Windows, or Ubuntu on my XPS 13" to "it's possible to do... so go do it." Skylake and Kernels The Precision has a Skylake (6th generation) Xeon CPU. The 4.8 Linux kernel has support for Skylake. Previous kernels do not. The key reason for needing support is power management as Skylake has far more granular settings than previous Intel chips. I needed a version of Linux that has a 4.8 kernel. This could be something like Arch or Ubuntu 16.10. I opted for 16.10 because, despite having had success with Arch in the past, I prefer to spend my time coding rather than configuring my Linux system. So... I downloaded Ubuntu 16.10 and did the guided install. That failed the same way the 16.04 LTS install failed: could not install the boot loader. So, I tried again. This time I did a manual disk partition. That worked... although I had to explicitly set the target for GRUB installation. So... yay... I installed Ubuntu 16.10 on the Precision 5510 and it booted. Not only did it boot, but it found all the devices (wireless, etc.) in the machine. Installing software The standard Ubuntu software management tools work. Sleep/wake works. Battery life is reasonable (5 1/2 hours). Sleep is problematic: a 10% battery drain every 8 hours. But this is a common issue with Linux on laptops. While my Dell XPS 13 sleeps like a Mac (a week, no problem), most Linux laptops (including those sold by System76) consume a lot of power during sleep. The trackpad has palm issues, so I had to disable tap-to-click. Yes, I spent 45 minutes trying all the different palm-detection related incantations... but none worked. At the end of the day, my Precision 5510 is now a functional laptop. The Hardware The Precision 5510 hardware is spectacular. The Precision weighs 71oz. My 15" MacBook Pro weighs 70.5oz. They weigh the same. The Precision is less deep and slightly taller than the MBP. But the difference in dimensions is trivial and the Precision fits all the MBP sleeves and such I have laying around. The Precision's screen is higher resolution and sharper than the MBP. It's also slightly larger. The only issue is the built in camera is at the bottom of the screen rather than the top. This could lead to less flattering video calls... plus issues with my hands on the keyboard getting in the way of the camera. The Precision's trackpad is very nice... it feels excellent. It is precise. With the exception of the palm issue, it's as perfect as the Mac's. The materials on the Precision are nicer than the Mac. The Precision's case feels more solid than the MBP. The carbon fiber palm area feels better than the MBP's aluminum palm area. The Precision's case is slightly rounded rather than the sharp edges of the MBP. The Precision's keyboard feels slightly better than the MBP and far better than the "dual butterfly" MacBook's keyboard. Just at the hardware level, Dell meets or exceeds what Apple did the with MBP. It's fast... really, really fast The Precision is the fastest computer I've ever used. It's faster than my 6 core desktop machine. It's faster than the MBP. And it's got 32GB of RAM which is useful when running a cluster of Mesos in VirtualBox on the go. Battery Life My MBP has a 7 hour battery life when I'm doing non-coding stuff. My 13" MBP has a 9 hour battery life. My MacBook has a 4 hour battery life. The Precision seems to have a 5 hour battery life for similar tasks. I have only tested the battery for a day, so I'm relying mostly on the battery indicator which seems to be accurate. While the MBP is better, I'm willing to take the hit to be able to travel and code on large projects. USB-C I've got a gaggle of USB-C dongles that I bought when I got my MacBook. With the exception of the power-related dongles, they "just work" with the Dell. The Precision's USB-C port is not advertised as supporting USB PD, so this is expected. Conclusion Dell should not be advertising this machine as a Linux machine. It's no more a Linux machine than any other Intel-powered laptop. It's not a Linux machine like the XPS 13 Developer Edition. But, I'm willing to be my own Linux admin and do my own Linux support in exchange for rock-solid hardware and a machine that meets my needs for large memory and a fast CPU. So, I'm going to keep this machine and it will become my development laptop. Will I buy Dell next time? That remains to be seen. (c) 2010-2016 David P.

At the start of the current decade, it changed, chopped and tinkered with its moorings for the lure of mega bucks it saw from venturing into IT services, even as its top four clients either filed for bankruptcy, exited some businesses or pivoted focus. And then founder and CMD Rajiv Mody decided to go back to doing what it knows best, with a diversified portfolio, including digital transformation solutions. Today, Sasken is confident enough to set an ambitious target to more than triple its revenue base of $72 million to $250 million by 2021. To achieve this, the BSE and NSE-listed company has fortified its senior leadership team with five new additions in the last 12 months and added 20 new customers in the last three quarters, taking its total customer base to 142.Revenue target The revenue target seems overly ambitious given that the company’s second-quarter results for FY2017 were discouraging. While Sasken reported a 1.3 per cent increase in YoY revenue at ₹240.17 crore in the first half of FY 2017 compared to the same period in the previous fiscal, the consolidated revenue for Q2 of FY2017 at ₹118.40 crore dipped 2.8 sequentially over the previous quarter. Attributing the poor performance to a customer defaulting on payment, Mody told BusinessLine: “I can’t remember the last time a customer defaulted. While achieving $250 million in five years is challenging, it is possible. We have our senior leadership team in place, a solutions portfolio for nine verticals, including automotive, industrial, retail, semiconductor, smart devices & wearables, satellite communications etc. And we are seeing good client traction for fixed-price projects vs time and materials projects, giving us more visibility into revenues.”Key clients Some of Sasken’s customers are Intel, Qualcomm, Intel, British Telecom, Honeywell, Sony, Inmarsat, Harman, Motorola Solutions, Texas Instruments, GE, Kroger and Lebara, among others. The top 10 customers contribute to 66 per cent of the company’s revenue. Mody says Sasken’s rough times, weathering heavy “body blows” since its inception in 1989, is now history. The 2008-09 economic downturn hit Sasken’s key customers hard. Nortel filed for bankruptcy, Motorola decided to refocus on the Android space and Texas Instruments decided to exit the wireless chipset business, taking Sasken’s revenue into a downward spiral from ₹574 crore in 2010 to ₹520 crore in 2012. Revenues fell further when Nokia, another big customer struggled, losing market share to Apple and Samsung. Left with an eroding revenue stream from its global customers, Mody was forced to drastically downsize the company’s workforce from 3,623 in 2009, when revenues were at ₹570 crore. The cuts started at the top, wit two of the five senior leaders asked to step down. A failed attempt to diversify into traditional IT services followed in 2013 when Sasken hired Mindtree co-founder Anjan Lahiri as CEO to turn the ailing company’s fortunes around. Lahiri quit a year later when Mody realised diversifying into IT services was the wrong decision for an IP-led product engineering company with 70 patents.The inflection point The turnaround for Sasken, according to Mody, happened in 2014, when he spotted an inflection point to take the company’s capabilities into the world of automotive, industrial and retail, backed by deep domain knowledge in the mobile space. The company hired 700 last year, taking its headcount to 2,000. Today, Sasken’s IP (protocol stack) is present in over a billion devices between Spreadtrum and Mediatek and its IP is a part of 200 plus commercially shipped unique products of global OEMs. “We are proud to say that 2 million cars in the world have our In-vehicle Infotainment systems and we have designed and developed satellite phones for UK based Inmarsat, which has sold 500,000 units to date,” says Mody, who is in no doubt that the company’s fortunes are on the upswing.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 7, 2016 at 11:06AM Throughout most of 2016, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) seemed to be a laggard in the virtual-reality market. Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive courted high-end PC gamers, Samsung's Gear VR and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cardboard introduced VR to mobile users, and Sony's (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation VR made PS4 games more immersive. Microsoft, however, merely hinted at Oculus Rift compatibility with its Xbox Scorpio upgrade. Image source: Getty Images. But that all changed in late October at Microsoft's Windows 10 event, which finally revealed the tech giant's VR ambitions. Let's discuss five key things investors should know about the company's upcoming VR headsets. 1. Tethered, with "inside out" sensors Like the Rift and Vive, Microsoft's VR headsets will be tethered to PCs. That means users can't freely move around as they could with a mobile-based device such as the Gear VR, or a standalone one such as Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Project Alloy. However, Microsoft claims that these new headsets can track a user's head rotation and position without setting up additional sensors around the room. The Rift and Vive, by comparison, both use external sensors to track the headset's position in space. Microsoft claims that its headsets use "inside out" sensors that can track a user's position with internal hardware -- making it much easier for multiple people to use headsets in the same area. 2. A much more affordable VR experience Microsoft won't make these headsets by itself. Instead, it's relying on its longtime hardware partners HP, Lenovo, Dell, Asus, and Acer to deliver the goods. The headsets will start at just $300, which is much cheaper than the $600 Rift and $800 Vive. Microsoft has also stated that its headsets won't require pricey high-end PCs as the Rift and Vive do. Hololens and VR head Alex Kipman recently told Polygon: "We've lowered the specs you need for PC from a $1,500 system to a $500 one." 3. Possible training wheels for the HoloLens During the demo, Microsoft's VR headset was entirely controlled by voice commands and hand gestures. That was quite different from the Rift, Vive, or PSVR -- which all use external controllers. But those controls closely resembled the ones for the HoloLens. Since the HoloLens' development kit costs $3,000, it remains out of the reach of mainstream consumers. But if Microsoft floods the market with $300 VR devices that use the same controls, they could serve as "training wheels" for the HoloLens before it's officially launched. Microsoft's HoloLens. Image source: Microsoft. 4. Locking in developers with a big Windows 10 update To establish a new computing platform, Microsoft needs to win over developers. It intends to do so with the upcoming Windows 10 Creator Update, which will add 3D image capture and editing tools. These tools will enable artists and developers to create 3D objects which can be viewed in Microsoft's VR headsets or HoloLens. To reach the largest number of developers, Microsoft is simplifying the tools so that 12-year-olds can use them. If the platform attracts enough new developers, Microsoft's vision of turning Windows 10 into a "holographic" OS -- as it has repeatedly demonstrated in HoloLens demos -- could become a reality. 5. Is this Microsoft's answer to the PSVR? Microsoft has spent a lot of time strengthening the bonds between Windows 10 and the Xbox One, with a shared app store and game streaming. Therefore, it's logical for Microsoft to tether its new headsets to the Xbox One as well. Doing so would help Microsoft counter the PSVR and offer Xbox One owners a way to play new games with VR features. That also means Facebook's Oculus VR and Microsoft won't really be allies in the VR market. The Oculus Rift runs on Windows PCs, but the company is aggressively growing its own VR ecosystem, Oculus Home, which would ultimately clash with Microsoft's vision for an AR/VR-powered Windows 10. Oculus has also been developing its own standalone device, the Santa Cruz headset, which would naturally become a rival to Microsoft's VR devices. The key takeaway Microsoft's VR ambitions seem well planned and could serve as a natural stepping stone between PCs and HoloLens. They could also finally help Microsoft evolve into a market-leading innovator to counter rivals such as Sony, Facebook, and Google across multiple markets.

While the traction of 10G is scaling in business and enterprise, cost remains a big barrier to home and prosumer networking, but also consumer based implementations. We recently posted a news update with the current 10GBase-T motherboards on the market, and this is the second review of that list: today we are testing ASUS' new high-end LGA2011-3 workstation refresh model, the ASUS X99-E-10G WS. The motherboard uses Intel’s latest 10GBase-T controller, the X550, which runs as a PCIe 3.0 x4 implementation.  Other AnandTech Reviews for Intel’s LGA2011-3 Platform The Intel Core i7-6950X, i7-6900K, i7-6850K and i7-6800K Broadwell-E Review The Intel Core i7-5960X, i7-5930K and i7-5820 Haswell-E Review The Intel Xeon E5 v3 Fourteen-Core Review (E5-2695 v3, E5-2697 v3) The Intel Xeon E5 v3 Twelve-Core Review (E5-2650L v3, E5-2690 v3) The Intel Xeon E5 v3 Ten-Core Review (E5-2650 v3, E5-2687W v3) X99 Series Motherboard Reviews: Prices Correct at time of each review $750: The ASRock X99 WS-E 10G Review [link] $600: The ASUS X99-E-10G WS Review (this review) $600: The ASRock X99 Extreme11 Review [link] $500: The ASUS Rampage V Extreme Review [link] $400: The ASUS X99-Deluxe Review [link] $340: The GIGABYTE X99-Gaming G1 WiFi Review [link] $330: The ASRock X99 OC Formula Review [link] $323: The ASRock X99 WS Review [link] $310: The GIGABYTE X99-UD7 WiFi Review [link] $310: The ASUS X99 Sabertooth Review [link] $300: The GIGABYTE X99-SOC Champion Review [link] $300: The ASRock X99E-ITX Review [link] $300: The MSI X99S MPower Review [link] $275: The ASUS X99-A Review [link] $241: The MSI X99S SLI PLUS Review [link] The State of the 10GBase-T Market Current integration of 10GBase-T onto a motherboard is an expensive process. In order to get full bandwidth, at the bare minimum, either a PCIe 2.0 x4 or PCIe 3.0 x2 connection per port is needed, and it depends on the controller used. This controller would traditionally interface with the CPU, reducing the PCIe lanes available for other large PCIe devices and co-processors, such as GPUs, storage cards or professional compute cards. In the last generation of consumer chipsets, the ability to run them direct from the large PCIe bandwidth on the 100-series chipsets is a future potential play, although technically the 100-series chipset connects to the CPU via a PCIe 3.0 x4 equivalent link which may be a future bottleneck. There are three main commercial controllers currently on offer that are used in both PCIe cards and motherboard integration. First, and what we’ve seen so far, is the Intel X540 family of controllers which require x8 lanes and runs at PCIe 2.0 speeds (i.e. in a PCIe 3.0 environment, it still needs x8 as the controller is only PCIe 2.0). The upgrade to this, the Intel X550 family, makes that leap to PCIe 3.0 and requires an x4 link which makes it easier to integrate into a modern platform but might be a touch more expensive by virtue of it being new. Third is an Aquantia / Tehuti Networks solution, which we’ve seen on 10GBase-T PCIe cards bundled with certain motherboard configurations or by third-parties for sale on their own. The Intel X540/X550 parts are families of controllers, offering single and dual port designs, and to our knowledge are better supported and use less motherboard area (but are more expensive) than the Tehuti solution. All these chips output up to 15W on their own, requiring a motherboard built to disperse the extra heat generated. As a result, any user looking at an integrated 10GBase-T solution has only a few options, and will have to find a way to justify the cost (which is easier in a business perspective). Aside from the 10GBase-T switch cost (cheapest is a 2-port unmanaged switch for $250 from ASUS, an 8-port previous generation Netgear X708 for $700, or a 16-port Netgear for ~$1400), the previous motherboard we reviewed with an integrated X540-T2 controller still runs at $700, over a year after its release. The controller cost is around $100-$200, depending on the motherboard manufacturers deal with Intel, which leads to a direct bill-of-materials (BOM) increase in the base cost. The PCIe cards with single or dual ports can be purchased for around $250-$400, depending on sales, support, and if they are new. (For those looking outside copper, there are also solutions available, but are less likely to be integrated into a home/current SMB setup without prior planning). For anyone looking to migrate a home network to 10GBase-T has to be aware of this outlay, and a number of users (myself included) are waiting diligently until the cost of such an ecosystem comes down. I do wonder exactly what the tipping point would be for a number of enthusiasts to make the jump, especially with a number of networking technologies in the works (such as 2.5G/5G, or 802.11ad wireless routers now coming into the market for consumers offering gigabit line-of-sight connectivity). I have had some companies ask me what that tipping point is, and to be honest I still think it’s the switch – a 4x10G + 4x1G port managed switch for $250 would sell like hot cakes, regardless of the cost of controllers. The ASUS X99-E-10G WS Overview The feature that’s hard to ignore is the 10G ports, and to be honest buying this motherboard relies on needing to use these ports (or trying to be ‘futureproof’ when building a 3-5 year system). Adding in the capability for a motherboard to also support x16/x16/x16/x16 with its main PCIe ports means that extra and expensive hardware is needed for full bandwidth support. This ability comes through PCIe switches, namely a pair of Avago PLX8747 switches. These ~$50ea final cost add-ons convert (mux/demux) sixteen lanes of PCIe 3.0 from the processor into thirty-two (32) lanes that are converted to x16/x16. As the main processors for this motherboard, such as the Intel Core i7-6950X, offer 40 lanes of PCIe, taking 32 away leaves eight lanes. This final eight lanes is split into four for the 10G controller and four for the U.2/M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 slot at the bottom of the board. ASUS intends to make this motherboard the single port of call for all your PCIe needs.   One of the benefits of the PCIe configuration is that the board can support a full complement of GPUs for 4-way SLI or 4-way Crossfire (or even more for compute tasks, depending on GPU size or riser cables). One of the main criticisms of using PCIe switches is that there is a small amount of overhead which could reduce peak performance, but in gaming as we’ve tested before, it is sub 1%. In fact, this is the only way to support 4-way x16, and allows for faster GPU-to-GPU communication (for adjacent GPUs), which can be required for compute tasks. As this is a premium motherboard, ASUS didn’t skip on the ‘regular’ features either. Starting their OC socket for premium LGA2011-3 platforms, the power delivery is enforced using ASUS’ high-end chokes as well as an extended heatsink arrangement for the high powered ICs present. The X99-E-10G WS will support 128GB of DDR4-2133, including up to ECC registered memory with the appropriate Xeon E5 v4 processor, and will have profiles up to DDR4-3333 for non-ECC gaming memory. Aside from the 10 SATA ports, U.2 and M.2, ASUS’ WS line is designed to be verified with a longer list of workstation-like hardware, such as RAID cards and FPGAs, to ensure compatibility. Thus given seven 16-way RAID cards, the motherboard makes an interesting storage proposition. Or add in more 10G ports. Due to the 10G ports, ASUS does not include any 1G ports, however the 10G ports do work at 1G speeds. For the audio, ASUS has their upgraded Realtek ALC1150 solution with filter caps, PCB separation and additional audio software. On the rear panel, ASUS has removed any USB 2.0 ports and left a pair of USB 3.1 (one A, one C) and a set of four USB 3.0 ports. The PCIe slots also get an upgrade here, with the four main GPU slots featuring semi-transparent latches that the user can light up via a DIP switch to indicate which slots are needed to maximize 2-way, 3-way or 4-way GPU use. Each of the seven slots also has extra metallic reinforcement embedded into the slot itself, designed to maintain rigidity when heavy PCIe devices are used or PCIe devices are installed during bumpy transit. Performance wise it is sufficient to say that the idle power of this WS board is higher than that of standard X99 motherboards however for consumer CPUs Multi-Core Turbo is enabled by default, giving a little extra speed (at the expense of a bit of power). Metrics such as DPC Latency and Audio Quality are both in the better halves of the tables for the tests, but with most WS boards with extra features there is a little more POST time than normal. We tested the board up to 3-way SLI (I didn’t have a fourth GTX 980, sorry), seeing game-dependent enhancements at 4K.

Also switches from Mikrotik ( CRS226-24G-2S+RM ) and Ubiquiti ( EdgeSwitch ES‑16‑XG ). Reply dsumanik - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link Fair enough, but one thing this article is NOT missing is better multi GPU testing, thank you Ian. In this day and age It is important to test every aspect of the board, not take the mfg's word for it or you wind up being a part of thier beta test. Then when the bugs occur and sales slow, the bios team gets allocated to the more popular boards And you wait in limbo -sometimes permanently- for fixes Reply Gadgety - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link I agree. Reply prisonerX - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link The XeonD has 10G MACs, which are not the particularly power hungry part of 10G ethernet, it's the PHY block, and in particular 10GBase-T which is the power hog. XeonD doesn't implement those. Reply BillR - Tuesday, November 08, 2016 - link Correct, the PHY is where the bulk of the power is used. I would expect the performance between the XeonD and the X550 to be similar since they use the same basic Ethernet MAC block logic. I would be a bit leery of using another LAN solution though, the Intel solution has been pretty rock solid. A problem I rarely have to think about is the best problem of all. Reply ltcommanderdata - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link You mentioned PCIe switches add a little bit of overhead which isn't a problem for graphics cards, but is the small added latency likely to be a concern for more sensitive applications like audio cards? Or is it better to use PCIe slots that are not on the PCIe switch for those? Also is there any sense yet on a time-to-market schedule for 2.5G/5G ethernet controllers and when motherboards and routers will start showing up with them? Reply TheinsanegamerN - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link My guess is never. Outside of a very specific niche, nobody needs more then 1Gbps. Reply JoeyJoJo123 - Monday, November 07, 2016 - link >My guess is never, nobody needs HD. The human eye can't see past 640x480 interlaced.

Do these leaked shots show a Dell Windows 10 phone or Surface Phone? by Joe Roberts 07 November 2016 0 shares Read Comments Many smartphone fans have been hoping to see a phone that runs a full version of Windows 10 for some time now, and it seems we've just got a look at a new handset that does just that – though whether it will ever launch remains unclear. Evan Blass, aka @evleaks, shared the following images, which some have said could be Microsoft's long-rumoured Surface Phone, while other reports claim it's a Dell device that runs full Windows 10. Related: Surface Phone – Everything we know There's no way to know if the images shared by Blass are the Surface Phone, but Thurrott claims it is a Dell-made device that uses Intel processors to run a full version of Windows 10, citing 'sources familiar with the phone". However, the report also states that Intel scrapped development on the silicon that would have been used to power the handset, so it seems we're unlikely to see this phone in the flesh any time soon. That said, Blass has 'confirmed' to The Verge's Tom Warren that the phone in question is "much more than a concept", and shared some shots of the device being used in the real world. Just what we're looking at here, and whether it will be released remains unclear, for now then, but it whatever the case, we're sure it won't be long until a full Windows 10 phone arrives in some form. While the images from Blass might not show the Surface Phone, the device is yet to be officially identified, so watch this space for more in the near future. WATCH: Surface Studio first look Let us know what you think of the latest Surface Phone developments in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments Rob Bush November 7, 2016, 6:21 pm Can't be a Surface phone because it has hard buttons for back, home and search. The current line of Lumia 950 phones has soft buttons that hide when you watch a video clip or look at pictures and they rotate when you turn to landscape mode. There is no way Microsoft would back track on this because it provides valuable screen real estate when they are hidden. The future of phones is no more hard buttons on the face of the phone (whether you like this or not, it's a reality.)

This should come as no surprise to those who’ve long perceived the Mac platform as inward-looking, limited in compatibility, and generally worse value for money than comparable Windows alternatives. Pros are smart with their tools and their money, after all. But the change with Apple’s 2016 generation of MacBook Pros is that those downsides have been amped up — more expensive and less compatible than ever before — to an extreme that exposes the fallacy of the continued use of the Pro moniker. These are Apple’s premium laptops, its deluxe devices, but not in any meaningful way computers tailored for the pros. A MacBook Pro is now simply what you buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and have a higher budget and expectations than the MacBook can fulfill. Those complaining about Apple's current Mac lineup are not haters, they're lovers. They've spent 10+ years and 5+ figures on Macs. — Jeff J. (@lapcatsoftware) October 29, 2016 The backlash from among pro Mac users that’s arisen in the wake of this new product launch is unprecedented, drowning out even the widespread grumbling about the loss of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 just a month prior. Just take a look at this studious blog post from Michael Tsai, which gathers together the broad negative consensus from among Apple's most passionate followers. The Mac community finds the specs underwhelming, even on the 15-inch model, which uses power-sipping AMD Radeon graphics instead of the world-conquering Nvidia Pascal chips. Emotions are running so low that people are even speculating about whether Apple should do with the Mac what IBM did when it sold off the ThinkPad line to Lenovo. This is partially because Apple hasn’t had a class-leading professional Mac computer for years — the Mac Pro is 1,054 days old now — and the new laptops have given an outlet and reason for expectant fans to vent. Many people were clinging on to their aging MacBook Pros in the vain hope of seeing a major spec and performance upgrade that simply didn’t materialize, and that's been frustrating. Here's how the 15" #MacBookPro 2016 component specs compare to the 2012 model: CPU: +8.9% to +13% MEM: +33% GPU: +53% to +184% /cc @mjtsai pic.twitter.com/uucjBzXe6C— Felix Schwarz (@felix_schwarz) October 28, 2016 The updated MacBooks from Apple have newer chips, but not that much newer, with Apple using yesteryear’s Intel Skylake CPUs and not this year’s Kaby Lake. They have faster storage, which is an indisputable benefit, but they also max out at 16GB of RAM. For consumer or casual use, that’s perfectly adequate, but "for a developer work machine, 16GB is the uncomfortable minimum requirement," as web developer Baldur Bjarnason points out. Apple seems surprised by the predictable backlash at betraying the trust of its most loyal customers Here’s the thing: if these new MacBooks simply didn’t carry the Pro label, we’d all have a lot less to complain about. It’s perfectly okay for a company to craft expensive, niche devices that will only match the particular needs of a select group of people. But over the course of the past decade or two, the entire tech industry has moved away from labeling things as exclusive or luxurious, opting for more inclusive language. If you can’t afford the premium model, that implies you’re not wealthy enough; but if you can’t afford the pro version, maybe you’re just not that into it. A subtle, but important distinction. And so it is, that we’re now living in a world populated by the PS4 Pro, DJI Mavic Pro, Surface Pro, iPad Pro, Beats Pro, Logitech Pro Gaming Mouse, and many others. Those of us old enough to remember ATI, the Canadian graphics card company that was taken over by AMD, will remember it pioneered many of these tags with such historic GPUs as the Radeon 9500 Pro, 9800 SE, X800 XT, and so on. They’re all meaningless as far as the company is concerned, but it just so happens that the "Pro" appendage is more meaningful to users than slapping on a "Plus" or "XL." With the obvious exception of leisure-time devices like the PlayStation console, a "pro" piece of consumer electronics is generally interpreted as a signal to actual professionals that this machine is for them. I'm out of apologia juice for defending Apple going with 4 USB-C ports on the new MacBook over a useful mix and keeping the MagSafe. — DHH (@dhh) October 28, 2016 Apple’s folly is in not recognizing just how passionate and committed its professional audience is. But the company should already know that all the iOS app developers that generate its unparalleled third-party software ecosystem are doing their work on Macs. It should be aware of their RAM requirements and the improvements they most want to see. "Pro" used to mean something when it came at the end of MacBook model names Beyond developers, there are the photographers and video producers that have made Mac computers the central hub of their home and work studios for many years, thanks to Apple’s early prioritization of high-quality displays and intuitive software. Leaving them without an SD card slot or an included adapter runs entirely counter to Apple’s fundamental principles of having a coherent ecosystem and a more user-friendly approach than the (previously) cold and aloof Windows PC manufacturers. Apple used to be a friend to creative professionals, and now that it’s acting against their wishes and interests, it seems surprised at their impassioned negative response. The backlash to the new MacBook Pro is so bad that Apple has slashed its accessory prices and LG's monitors to appease. Seems unprecedented — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) November 7, 2016 MacBook Pros were once professional computers that could also appeal to an aspiring consumer audience. They were pricey for a general-purpose laptop, but justifiable as a luxury purchase or as a device that pays for itself by making its user more efficient and productive. But today MacBook Pros are very definitely consumer devices that only gesture toward a professional audience without truly endeavoring to appease it. The new Touch Bar is not a pro feature. It’s cool, it works really well, and it has tons of potential for the future, but it clashes with professional workflows, many of which involve external monitors and keyboards. Apple showed how DJs might use it, but those same people would probably prefer to have dongle-free USB ports for the rest of their gear and a MagSafe charging adapter in the event of some inebriated clubber tripping over their cables. None of Apple's additions improve professional workflows yet, and its subtractions will lead to plenty of headaches The ultra-flat keyboard with 0.55mm key travel is also not professionally minded. Its purpose is overall thinness, but I know of no app developers, globetrotting businesspeople, or digital artists that had "more thinness" anywhere near the top of their priority list of MacBook Pro improvements. Professional writers might have asked for more tactile response, not less, and Apple's keyboard alterations seem to primarily serve to optimize and harmonize its design rather than enhance any functionality. Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pros carry on the Pro moniker dishonestly. At least we should all hope that's the case — because if Apple actually believes that these new laptops are suitable and sufficient for intensive professional needs, then the company's long and happy relationship with creatives may be heading toward a calamitous breakup.

Microsoft to Launch Multi-Million Euro Windows 10 Ad Campaign in Europe GO Microsoft Germany to launch online and offline Windows ads Nov 7, 2016 12:52 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft is preparing a new Windows 10 advertising push in Europe, with the company investing millions of Euros in this new effort as it plans to target users in both the online and offline worlds. According to a report from German website WindowsUnited, the campaign was created together with Intel, and it is scheduled to go live on November 7 and run through December 17. It will include ads that will be aired on German TV channels, but also online and on social media websites. Microsoft is focusing all of its efforts in this new campaign on two different advertisements that are specifically aimed at businesses, as they present two entrepreneurs that use Windows 10 devices for a variety of tasks. The HP Specter x360 and the Surface Pro 4 are both highlighted in these ads, which you can watch in full at the end of the article. Windows 10 running on 1 in 3 PCs in Europe According to third-party data provided by StatCounter, Windows 10 is running on 29.91 percent of computers on the Old Continent, very close to Windows 7, which leads the charts with 35.09 percent. But while Windows 10 is doing pretty well in the consumer market, not the same thing can be said about enterprise, where the operating system is still in piloting stage, and some large companies are only now evaluating the upgrade. Microsoft is clearly trying to show Europeans the advantages of using Windows 10 for their businesses, putting the emphasis not only on the operating system but also on the hardware and devices that make it possible to use all the features. It remains to be seen if the new ad campaign will be successful or not, but readers who live in Europe should get ready for a new advertising push from Microsoft that should bring Windows 10 anywhere they look, both online and offline.

The hackathon will be held at the fintech hub The Floor at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, in cooperation with Google and Intel, the organizers said in a statement. During the November 15-17 hackathon, RBS will ask Israeli entrepreneurs to come up with suggestions and ideas for innovation in digital and mobile banking, payment methods, data security and processing, and new financing technologies. International banks including Citi, Barclays Bank Plc., HSBC and Banco Santander have all set up fintech hubs in Tel Aviv as new technologies are changing the world of finance and especially the way consumer banks work. They look to Israel, with its strong innovative tradition, to help find solutions in the fast-changing financial world, in which banks are facing increased pressure to reduce costs and find new ways to engage users as technology-driven newcomers snap at their heels and bite into their market share. Global investment in fintech enterprises in the first quarter of 2016 surged 67 percent year on year to $5.3 billion, an April report by Accenture that analyzes global fintech trends shows. The percentage of investments going to fintech companies in Europe and Asia-Pacific nearly doubled to 62 percent. A Citi report in March showed that global fintech investments rose from just $1.8 billion in 2010 to $19 billion in 2015.

Zotac crams AMD's Radeon RX 480 into a tiny gaming mini-PC that's built for VR Zotac's new ERX480 is the first mini PC to come with the Polaris-based Radeon RX 480 GPU. Ian Paul (PC World (US online)) on 05 November, 2016 02:02 0 - - - - print email Zotac's newest VR-capable mini PC kit should fulfill the dreams of AMD fans everywhere. In what appears to be a first, the new Magnus ERX480 comes packing an AMD Radeon RX 480 Polaris-based GPU. Zotac's selling the new mini PC in three models: barebones, Plus, and Windows 10. The barebones version is what you’d expect in a kit like this. It comes with a 2.2GHz Intel “Skylake” Core i5-6400T CPU and the aforementioned Radeon RX 480, but lacks RAM, storage, and an operating system. The Magnus ERX480 packs two memory slots that can take up to 32GB of DDR4 RAM in 1866 or 2133MHz flavors. For storage, the ERX480 provides a 2.5-inch SATA 3.0 bay and an M.2 SATA SSD slot. The Plus version, meanwhile, might be a good choice for Linux fans who don’t want the hassle of inserting their own storage and RAM. It includes 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 1TB 2.5-inch hard drive, and a 120GB M.2 SSD. The Windows 10 version is simply the Plus version with Windows 10 Home 64-bit preinstalled. The rear port lineup of the ERX480. All three versions of the ERX480 come packing a veritable smorgasbord of USB ports, with two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, and singular USB 3.1 Type-A and USB 3.1 Type-C connections. The USB 3.1 ports are both gen. 2. The Magnus ERX480 can power four displays at once and comes with two HDMI 2.0 and two DisplayPort 1.3 ports. Zotac says the mini PC can do 4K at 60Hz. Beyond those highlights the ERX480 offers the usual niceties, including 802.11ac/b/g/n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and an SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader. The ERX480 measures 8.27 inches by 8 inches and has depth of 2.45 inches. Zotac did not announce pricing or a specific release date for the ERX480. Why this matters: Until now, mini-PC kits with built-in GPUs mostly stuck with Nvidia's GeForce parts, owing to poor power efficiency on the AMD side. That changed with AMD's new Polaris-based Radeon GPUs, which are far more power efficient than their predecessors. Power efficiency in a small rig like the Magnus ERX480 is paramount since more power equals more heat, and more heat makes cooling—which is already handicapped by the smaller space—that much harder to deal with.

Anthony Grifoni STYLISTIC Q572 For work use, Microsoft Word and Excel programs pre-installed on the device are adequate for preparing short documents. Steph Mundell LIFEBOOK UH574 The Fujitsu LifeBook UH574 allowed for great mobility without being obnoxiously heavy or clunky. Its twelve hours of battery life did not disappoint. Andrew Mitsi STYLISTIC Q702 The screen was particularly good. It is bright and visible from most angles, however heat is an issue, particularly around the Windows button on the front, and on the back where the battery housing is located. Simon Harriott STYLISTIC Q702 My first impression after unboxing the Q702 is that it is a nice looking unit. Styling is somewhat minimalist but very effective. The tablet part, once detached, has a nice weight, and no buttons or switches are located in awkward or intrusive positions.

Cerber had conducted more than 160 campaigns when examined in July targeting 150,0000 users and raking in a cracking US$195,000 in profits in that month alone. Of that figure, Cerber's developer pocketed some US$78,000. It is estimated the malware earns authors and affiliates some US$1 million to US$2.5 million a year. Those figures surpass 2015 ransomware profits said to net authors a conservative US$84,000 a month for slinging ransomware at a cost of US$6000. That's a whopping 1425 per cent profit margin. Security strategist Matthew Rosenquist says chasing businesses is the "next evolution" of ransomware. "[Cerber] now attempts to stop database processes running on the target system so it can encrypt the data," Rosenquist says. "This is a significant shift in focus from consumers to businesses, which typically run databases containing important operational data. "When database files are open and in use by software, they cannot easily be encrypted." It may not be the first to target businesses. The Register has been told of private ransomware variants sent to a limited number of highly-target organisations that encrypt very valuable databases and documents, demanding ransoms topping tens of thousands of dollars for the supply of decryption keys. Rosenquist warns administrators to be on alert for databases abruptly stopping which could signal Cerber is starting its encryption run. It appears there is no method to decrypt Ceber-encrypted files since an update to the malware rendered CheckPoint's decoding tool ineffective. Security engineers are continually working to find a dwindling pool of implementation and side-channel vulnerabilities to help decrypt files encrypted with high quality ransomware. The problem has this year been formalised into the NoMoreRansom alliance which unifies a formerly scattered and silo-ed, but furious effort by malware researchers to lay ruin to scores of ransomware variants, leaving a scant few including the latest Ceber, Cryptxxx, and Cryptowall unbroken. Victims who cannot decrypt their ransomware infections should also try Trend Micro's continually updated decryption tool. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 9 Comments More from The Register Action Fraud warns of fraudulent anti-fraud warnings posing as Action Fraud Phishing emails promise free money 16 Comments WikiLeaks uploads 300+ pieces of malware among email dumps Freedom.

While we await for the next generation of the 2-in-1 device, Lenovo seems to be building its own new version of the Surface Pro. This isn’t new as we have seen brands like Asus and Huawei doing the same. Lenovo’s upcoming product, the Miix 720, will be yet another attempt to create a Surface clone. Lenovo has tried this in the past with the Miix 510 and the 700, but the newest rumoured device seems to be as good and in some ways better than the Surface Pro 4. Image: WinFuture If reports are to be believed then we can expect the latest Intel Kaby lake CPU in Core i3, i5 or i7 options along with up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. While the basic version offering 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, it will feature a 12 inch 2880×1920 pixel resolution display along with Gorilla Glass 4 protection. Impressed? Well there is more as it also comes with its own stylus with 2048 pressure levels as well as Windows Hello iris scanner/infrared camera. Image: WinFuture Lenovo won’t be picky when it comes to ports as the device is expected to have USB 3.0, 2.0 and USB Type C ports. There will be a foldable keyboard with backlighting and a 5,319 mAh that should last up to 8 hours. Pricing is expected to start at $1100 (Rs 73,000 approx) which is as good as the Surface Pro 4 and making it a perfect alternative.

Are These Leaked Pics the New Surface Phone? Categories Microsoft Mobile PhonesAuthor by Chris Black November 5, 2016 2,036 0 Microsoft’s Surface Phone is already a myth, a legend in its own time, a Loch Ness Monster, something you can only whisper it, as it’s rumored for quite a while now but it fails to materialize. Well, at least until today. According to the famous leakster @evleaks, these renders/pictures or whatever you want to call them are showcasing the upcoming Surface Phone in all its splendor and then some. Truth be told, the leakster was ambiguous with regard to where he got the pics and what do they really represent, as they were first announced as concepts, as per the initial tweets. So, these leaked renders must be taken with a big grain of Himalayan salt, as @evleaks was vague and unclear. But in the same time, this guy chose to pour some extra gasoline over the napalm fire, saying that the Surface Phone will be powered by a laptop class Intel CPU, i.e. this smartphone will blow our collective minds. You know us, WP 10 aficionados. During the Twitter session, some geek replied that this was a nice concept, but nothing more than a pipe dream. And that comment made @evleaks to go berserk and to tweet some additional photos, saying it’s the same device but during a “real life”photo shoot and the whole palaver. So, judging from these pieces of intel, it sounds very plausible that the Surface Phone is really in the works, alive and kicking and waiting to hit the world in the teeth (just wait to see the price-tag). At least that’s my analysis, after considering @evleaks’s track record, which is pretty awesome to say the least. Not to mention that the man himself said at the end of the convo that this is more than a feeling, strike that, much more than a concept, stay tuned. So, there’s more than meets the eye and we’ll definitely find out what’s up with that in the days/weeks to come.

View Latest Posts >>> Russian combat experience in Syria is a major force multiplier By Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor on November 6, 2016 … from  South Front A technical edge in small ground-to-air missiles can make choppers a turkey shoot [ Editor’s Note: Although this South Front article is focused on improving their helicopter performance in terms of speed and pilot training, their whole command and control structure is getting a good vetting to expose the weaknesses that only real combat conditions can. Helicopter deployment itself is a complex decision-making process, as highly accurate Intel is needed for determining when NOT to send in the choppers, when the enemy is well-armed with ground to air missiles. Moscow has been quiet about what kind of electronic warfare capacity their current machines have, if any. And the expected loss rate of helicopters in combat makes putting one’s most advanced anti-missile countermeasures on them an almost guaranteed gift to one’s opponents when the first one is shot down. The US-NATO move on Russia when it was no military threat whatsoever, having let its military decline so as to build its peacetime infrastructure more quickly, caused Moscow to change priorities.  Moscow discovered major problems just from the brief Georgian conflict, which triggered a long overdue modernization program, but a slow one. Now the plan is not only being speeded up, but advanced even further based on the combat experience Russia would have never gained without the US jihad against Syria. One could make a case that someone actually wanted Russia to go in and become a stronger military to justify it being used as a bogeyman threat by the West. Color me suspicious… Jim W. Dean ] ___________ – First published  …  October 28th,  2016 – An experience of the usage of Russian military helicopters in Syria has allowed to find and work out to the last detail new tactical techniques to overcome air defense systems, Chief of combat training of the army aviation of the Russian Aerospace Forces, Major-General Oleg Chesnokov, said. “The specifics of army aviation operations in any local conflict, including the current conflict in Syria, are analyzed carefully to expose the weaknesses and strengths in the training of pilots and in the ways of operating technologies depending on the geography and details of the situation,” the TASS news agency quoted the words of Chesnokov. “New practical methods in overpowering of enemy air defenses and in delivering fire have been found.” He also noted that recommendations for pilots are developed on the basis on this analysis in a center for pilots training in Torzhok. Then these recommendations are sent to troops and “taken into account in a further scheduled combat training,” the RIA Novosti news agency reported. Chesnokov also added that the latest modification of the Mi-28NE Night Hunter combat helicopters would start to be supplied to Russian troops since 2017. “Currently, prototypes of the Mi-28UB combat helicopter with a dual control system have passed official tests with positive results,” Chesnokov said. He explained that initially, the Mi-28UBs will be sent to the 344th Army Aviation Centre of aircrews combat training and transition, and then combatant air units of the Russian Aerospace Forces will receive them. “An experience of usage of the Mi-28N helicopters showed the need of development of helicopters of this type with a dual control system, now pilots and instructors of the Torzhok’s center have already passed retraining for this modification,” the Major-General added. Chesnokov also announced that the Russian Helicopters company created a ‘flight-research tool’ – a prototype of a prospective high-speed helicopter. The central part in the construction of the flight-research tool of a high-speed helicopter is a main rotor blade. New design solutions for its creation allow to increase the maximum speed of the Mi-28 helicopter by 13%, the maximum speed of the Mi-35 – by 30%. Currently, flight tests are being conducted, and an intermediate result has already been achieved – “the speed of a horizontal flight reached 360 km/h in combination with a low level of vibration and structural loads on the flight-research tool,” Chesnokov pointed out. “The speed of a high-speed helicopter will be increased by 1.5 times compared with known models of attack helicopters, up to 400-500 km/h,” he added. Last week, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the operation in Syria has identified a number of design and production shortcomings of Russian military equipment. In the middle of July, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, General Valery Gerasimov, ordered to eliminate the shortcomings of Russian military equipment and weapons that have been identified during the Syrian operation, until the end of the year. On April 14, during a question and answer session that was televised live, Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged that many shortcomings of Russian military hardware have been revealed during the operation of the Russian Aerospace Forces in Syria, however, in general, Russian military equipment has approved itself excellent, and for this reason, foreign demand on Russian weapons has sharply increased. On May 11, Press Secretary for the Russian President, Dmitry Peskov, said that the main problem, revealed in the Russian Armed Forces during the operation in Syria, was operation of military equipment. He also stressed that this experience was analyzed for further improvement of military hardware. On May 12, Deputy CEO on production and innovation of the Russian Helicopters company, Andrey Shibitov, announced that the holding negotiated with the Russian Defense Ministry on program to modernize combat helicopters, based on the experience of their operation in Syria. ____________ Related Posts: Russia Defense Report: Nukes, Bugs, and Gas in Hybrid Wars Russia (and VT) ‘prevented’ potential NATO launch of 624 cruise missiles in Syria Supporters of Militants in Syria Are at Odds New World Order Doctrine Continues to Crumble Morally and Intellectually Confidential NATO Report Praises Russia’s Superiority in Syria The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Did the MI28 models use chainguns before the apache? Or was it the other way around? The placement of the sensor pods is also almost identical. I suppose that the best design is the best design no matter which army is using it. It is getting very hard to tell the fast movers apart anymore as their configurations are almost identical (except for the colors of the stars).

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 7 November 2016 Huawei MateBook: A New chapter by rouwen lin Easy on the eye: The Huawei MateBook boasts a slim and elegant design, with a faux leather case that can be folded into a two-angle stand. -- Huawei Huawei’s first 2-in-1 device looks and feels great, and comes with cool optional accessories. IF FIRST impressions count, then the Huawei MateBook is a winner. This is the company’s first foray into the 2-in-1 segment, an attempt to marry the convenience of a ­tablet with the performance of a laptop, and the result is a sleek and slim Windows 10 device powered by a sixth generation Intel Core chip. The impression I took away with me of the MateBook’s good looks at its launch in Spain earlier this year managed to hold up to closer ­scrutiny – and then some. With its fanless design, smooth metal body and rounded edges, this is one attractive device that will certainly turn heads if the world of tech is a runway show.   The MateBook's display resolution makes for sharp images. The MateBook is a slender 6.9mm thick and tips the scales at a mere 640g – it’s similar in thickness to most smartphones and the same as the iPad Pro. It’s even slightly lighter than the latter, although the MateBook’s screen is slightly ­smaller at 12in. The display is excellent and ideal for watching movies; the 2,160 x 1,440-pixel resolution makes for sharp images, and colours are bright and crisp. My review unit (Core m5 chip and 8GB RAM), has a gorgeous gold finish (most others would call it “champagne”, which is more apt) with a brown faux leather case that feels as nice to the touch as it is easy on the eyes. Laws of attraction Magnets are a recurring theme in the MateBook, keeping the design fuss-free and elegant. The keyboard attaches to the tablet via a magnetic port; the keyboard case wraps around the tablet and is secured in place with a magnet; the MatePen holder latches on to the case with a magnet; the MateDock sits snug in its wrap-around cover with yet another magnet. The case folds to form a stand that the tablet can rest on in either one of two angles, which is made possible, again, by magnets. The verdict? The kickstand works well when using the MateBook on a flat surface, like on a desk, but unfortunately it is a bit of a precarious undertaking to type with it on your lap or while ­lounging on the sofa. It falls flat more easily than I would like it to, and although it really doesn’t come unhinged that easily, with the right (or in this case, wrong) jostle, it ­certainly wobbles like it wishes to do so. The MateDock comes with two USB ports and an Ethernet jack on one side, and HDMI and VGA ports on the other.   Having said that, it is easy to switch back and forth between either desktop or tablet modes, and the spill-resistant keyboard is decently proportioned with ­adequate key travel to make typing a breeze. It has backlighting, with four ­levels of brightness and an ­ambient sensor, so it turns on when there is insufficient light. Sitting on the dock Huawei’s built-in fingerprint scanner, located between the ­volume controls on the tablet’s right edge, works like a charm for speedy unlocking and logging in. It is my first time using this feature and I am sold. Below the volume controls sits MateBook’s only data connection – a USB-C port that is used for both power or connecting to external devices. Unless you are a minimalist, this is where the MateDock (RM399) will come in handy with its multifunctional connections. It has two USB ports and an Ethernet jack on one side, and HDMI and VGA ports on the other. If the MateBook is being charged while in use, however, this means only one other USB port is free as the MateDock is plugged into the sole port on the ­tablet. The kickstand is good when using the MateBook on a flat surface. Plus, I would have liked a keyboard volume control, which it lacks. The MateBook is marketed as a 2-in-1 that can bring you through a whole day’s work with a single charge, but in practice this turns out being possible only if your work day ends shortly after lunch break. Or if you don’t actually do anything at work. With moderate usage, running it for five hours on battery is a safe bet. But I wouldn’t risk relying on the MateBook for any longer than that without a backup plan. This is quite a setback, as there are other options out there that beats the MateBook in this aspect. Mighty pen The MateBook comes with the option of a stylus called the MatePen (RM369) for drawing and making notes. Huawei is rather proud of this, and no wonder; it is responsive and precise. Don’t worry about accidentally touching the screen with your hand when using the MatePen – the MateBook’s palm rejection is spot on and I have never had my hand detected as an on-screen touch. At a touch of a button on the MatePen, you can flip through slides or scroll up and down pages, and the laser pointer for presentations or for playing with your cat is a nice touch. If you are on the go with your MateDock, there is a pen loop for the MatePen in the MateDock for storage, which does feel more secure than the holder on the case. A single charge of the MatePen can apparently provide you with 100 hours of usage time. Mine is still going strong on its first charge two weeks ago. But then again, I do not have a cat to torment. The MateBook (grey or gold, with either a brown or black case) starts at RM3,999, inclusive of ­keyboard. The MatePen and MateDock is available at vmall.my. Pros: Light, slim and looks good; has a fantastic display; handy optional accessories. Cons: Battery life could be better; kickstand works well only on flat surfaces.  MateBook (Huawei) OPERATING SYSTEM: Windows 10 Home PROCESSOR: 6th Generation Intel Core m MEMORY: 4GB/8GB RAM DISPLAY: 12in (2,160 x 1,440 pixels) STORAGE: 128GB/256GB/512GB SSD CONNECTIVITY: WiFi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac MIMO, Bluetooth 4.1 PORTS/SLOTS: USB 3.0 Type-C CAMERA: 5 megapixels OTHER FEATURES: Ambient light sensor, fingerprint reader, accelerometer, gyroscope DIMENSIONS: 278.8 x 194.1 x 6.9mm WEIGHT: 640g PRICE: RM3,999 (Core m3/4GB RAM/128GB); RM5,399 (Core m5/8GB RAM/256GB); RM6,699 (Core m7/8GB RAM/512GB) ACCESSORIES: MatePen (RM369), MateDock (RM399) RATING: Four stars Review unit courtesy of Huawei Technologies Malaysia, 1800-22-0086.   Tags / Keywords: huawei , matebook Related Stories Huawei Mate 9: To the nines Huawei launches the Mate 9 Honor 8: Top marks Huawei stays one step ahead with diverse product range How to use the P9 to get that Leica look You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Two French snorkellers die on same Great Barrier Reef tour Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Most Viewed in Tech Make perfect copies of old photos with PhotoScan GE acquires two artificial intelligence startups Best smartphones for the holidays Photo Kit: Taking better photos of your pets (and kids) Singapore to launch blockchain project for interbank payments Google commits to post-Brexit UK with major London investment US trade panel eyes Qualcomm patent complaint against Chinese firms Warning!

By Sean Portnoy for Laptops & Desktops | November 6, 2016 -- 22:39 GMT (14:39 PST) | Topic: PCs No Apple iPad deals in the Staples Black Friday ad this year. As Black Friday draws within three weeks, the ad leaks are starting to pick up in pace. For tech buyers, the Staples Black Friday ad leak may be the biggest so far, and it provides further evidence of an early trend: It's the latest retailer not to promote any deals on that former Black Friday stalwart -- Apple's iPad tablet. Part of that is due to Apple's stinginess on discounts in general, and part is due to the fading appetite of consumers for new tablets. Nevertheless, Staples still has the most tablet deals we've seen from a Black Friday ad this year, including matching BJ's Wholesale with a $33.33 special on the Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. It goes one better by also having an Amazon Fire HD 8 slate on sale, but this is a case where a little research shows it's not as good a deal as advertised. Staples hypes the sale price of $79.99 as $50, but there are two oddities in the listing. First, Amazon itself lists the price of the Fire HD 8 as $89.99, not the $129.99 regular price Staples is claiming. Even more egregiously, the Fire model shown in the ad has only 8GB of storage, whereas the current base Amazon version comes with 16GB. In other words, Staples is trying to sell an older model with less storage for a mere $10 less than the current version, but touting massive savings. You've been warned. Black Friday 2016 CNET 2016 Holiday Gift Guide Microsoft preview promises deals on Surface devices, Windows laptops Hhgregg ad has 12.9-inch iPad Pro deal Office Depot/OfficeMax ad features $119 Windows 2-in-1 tablet, $169 HP laptop Best Buy ad reveals $100 Windows laptop deal, $125 iPad Air 2, Pro savings Walmart ad features $199 Apple iPad mini 2, $119 Chromebook deals Target ad has iPad Pro for $449, iPad Air 2 for $274 HP ad leaks with PC deals from $250 Staples ad leaks with laptops, tablet deals Costco ad leaks with laptop, desktop, tablet deals Ads for Dell Small Business leak BJ's Wholesale ad features $33.33 Amazon Fire tablet Sam's Club ad leaks with HP laptop, desktop deals Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals Instead of iPads, the stores with Black Friday ad leaks have thus far listed Samsung Galaxy Tab discounts. Unfortunately for Staples, its specials are undercut by rivals: Its $99.99 price on the 7-inch Tab A is $10 more than in BJ's ad (and BJ's also throws in a 16GB microSD card), while its $129.99 price on the 8-inch Tab A is $10 more than in Costco's ad. Unlike its competitors, however, Staples has a sale on the budget-friendly 7-inch Galaxy Tab E Lite; at $69.99, it's actually $50 off the current price Samsung has on its site. But it's less successful with its $799 Surface Pro 4 pricing, which is $50 more for the same configuration as BJ's (though still $200 less than Microsoft's current price). As with Costco, Staples has a large number of Windows laptop deals for Black Friday, highlighted by a $229.99 HP 15-ay061 with Intel Pentium N3710 CPU, 8GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, and 15.6-inch display. That's $90 less than the current price, not $190 as the ad states. In fact, this is the case with many of the PC sales Staples list: The price currently on its website is already reduced, meaning the savings are less whopping than its ad suggests. While there is no $100 laptop like Dell has for a doorbuster, there are four additional notebook specials for under $300: The Dell Inspiron I5555-0012 (AMD A8 processor, 6GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $269.99; a Dell Inspiron (Pentium CPU, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 11.6-inch display) for $299.99, the HP 15-ay065 (Core i3-5005U, 6GB of RAM, 1TB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99, and the Lenovo IdeaPad 100 (also Core i3-5005U, 4GB of RAM, 500GB hard drive, 15.6-inch display) for $299.99. In addition to those sales, there are 11 further laptop deals that Staples is advertising: $349.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-1350SLV (Core i3/6GB/1TB/15.6-inch) $389.99 -- HP Pavilion 14-al062 (Core i5/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 14-al061nr (Core i3/8GB/1TB/14-inch) $399.99 -- HP 17-x061 (Core i3/8GB/1TB/17.3-inch) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron 13 I5368-2405GRY (Core i3/8GB/500GB/13.3-inch full HD touchscreen) $449.99 -- Dell Inspiron i5559-3349SLVV (Core i5/8GB/128GB SSD/15.6-inch) $479.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au062 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch-inch) $499.99 -- HP Pavilion 15-au063 (Core i7/12GB/1TB/14-inch) $499.99 -- Lenovo Flex 4 (Core i5/8GB/256GB SSD/14-inch full HD touchscreen) $599.99 -- Lenovo Ideapad 510 (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD) $629.99 -- HP Pavilion x360 15-bk010nr (Core i5/8GB/1TB/15.6-inch full HD touchscreen) There are also a half-dozen desktop deals split between towers and all-in-ones. The tower sales start at $279.99 ($70 less than current price) with the HP Slimline 260-p026, which comes with a Core i3-6100T processor, 8GB of RAM, and terabyte hard drive. Jumping up to $399.99 ($180 off) is the HP Pavilion 510-p026 with Core i5-6400T quad-core CPU, 12 gigs of RAM and 1TB hard drive, while the Dell Inspiron 3650 features a faster Core i5-6400 chip, 8GB of RAM, and 1TB of hard drive space for $449.99 -- though note you can get it for that price right now from Staples. As with the towers, the three all-in-one PC specials comprise a pair of HPs and a Dell. The HP 22-b016, with Intel Pentium processor, 4GB of RAM, terabyte hard drive, and 21.5-inch full HD display, is $299.99, or $80 off the current price, while the Pavilion 24-b016 comes a Core i3-6100T, 8 gigs of memory, 1TB hard drive, and 23.8-inch full HD screen for $449.99, or $50 less than the current price. Finally, the Dell Inspiron 5459 also includes a 23.8-inch display, but adds touchscreen capabilities, along with a Core i5-6400T processor for $699.99, or $200 off the regular price.

It’s a device that Tech Radar says is iterative in the best sense. “Has Microsoft at last crafted a tablet that can reasonably, without considerable compromise, replace your laptop? Short of going back to the drawing board on the battery, this looks as close as it’s going to get.” The Surface Pro 4 has received unanimously excellent reviews. [Image by Daryl Deino] The review especially praises the Surface Pro 4’s screen, the vastly improved Type Cover, and the improved Surface Pen. The only major criticism is the battery life, which a lot of others have complained about. There have been many Surface Pro 4 clones to hit the market recently, but the Lenovo Miix 720 may finally be the one that stands up strong to the Surface Pro 4. iTech Post has the news. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oaRXDVW4dhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> “The Mixx 720 features Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processor available in i3, i5 or i7 configurations (2.4 to 3.5 GHz with turbo boost), 4-16 GB RAM, 128 to 1024 GB storage, a 12 inch high-resolution 3:2 2880×1920 pixel display with Gorilla Glass 4, multiple USB ports, a stylus with 2048 pressure levels and Windows Hello via an iris scanning infra-red camera.” The article adds that a keyboard cover with a backlight will also be available. It will also come in both gold and black versions. The Verge isn’t sure when the Miix 720 will be released. “We still don’t know when the Miix 720 will release, or how much it will cost, but with this much information already leaked out, it probably won’t be too long before an official unveiling from Lenovo,” says columnist Chaim Gartenberg. There is certainly some excitement for Lenovo’s new device on Twitter. Somebody leaked @Lenovo Miix 720 info – USB-C port & Higher-Res Display coming soon! https://t.co/y7eJqArTHg pic.twitter.com/HMiW3gtMlA — Laptop Mag (@laptopmag) November 4, 2016 I am SO EXCITED for the Lenovo Miix 720. I'll get that instead of the Surface Pro 5. — Chad Goldberg (@Goldberg1Chad) November 6, 2016 Lenovo recently released another device called the Yoga Book, which some said was a Surface Pro killer — at least for the very low-end version. The Verge was one of the first sites to report on the device. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRYbGtkg-gA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> “But Lenovo, which has made a bunch of these convertible creations, has come up with something that not only makes sense, but nudges the category forward with a completely new kind of keyboard. It’s called the Yoga Book, and it’s an incredibly thin and light tablet-like machine with a flat, touch-sensitive surface that lights up into a glowing keyboard.” The article added that the lower panel on the Yoga Book also doubles as a Wacom digitizer surface, which means you can use a stylus pen to draw on it as well. Although critic Lauren Goode is fascinated with the device, she says the keyboard comes with a learning curve. Engadget wasn’t as impressed. The Lenovo Yoga Book, available in Android ($500) and Windows ($550) versions, is inventive. But Lenovo claims that the Yoga Book is the ‘ultimate tablet for productivity and creativity,’ and that’s where the company is wrong,” claimed columnist Cherlynn Low, adding that there are many well-intended elements such as multi-window support, but these enhancements never truly add up to anything productive. Apple’s next MacBook may be a tablet hybrid. [Image by Daryl Deino] Those who aren’t fans of Microsoft or Lenovo and want a laptop/tablet hybrid might want to wait until the release of the next MacBook. According to iTech Post, the design of the 2017 MacBook will be different in terms of color options. But the biggest difference is that Apple may add pencil support on the MacBook. Apple fans have been waiting for digital inking support on an OS X device for years, even though Steve Jobs was against it. If you need a laptop/tablet hybrid and can’t wait for the MacBook, the Lenovo Miix 720 or the Surface Pro 4 may be your best choice. But if you can just hold on a little longer, the Surface Pro 5 and the updated MacBook should be released next spring.

Obama, Clinton, helpless at Russian election grab Too Little Too Late for Merkel: Germany Begins Roundup of Erdogan Terror Cells Obama tours Europe to soothe fears over Trump’s stance on NATO, TTIP deal ‹ › Michael Shrimpton is a barrister, currently suspended of course, called to the Bar in London in 1983. He is a specialist in National Security and Constitutional Law, Strategic Intelligence and Counterterrorism. He has wide ranging connections both in Western Intelligence agencies and amongst ex-Soviet Bloc agencies. The late Generaloberst Markus Wolf, of the Stasi and DVD, was one of his contacts. Michael has earned respect in the intelligence community for his analysis of previously unacknowledged post-WWII covert operations against the West by the German DVD organization based in Dachau, near Munich, Germany, and its British, French and American client agencies. These continue to the present day, as politicians and the media are too nervous of standing up to them. Michael was formerly an Adjunct Professor of Intelligence Studies in the Department of National Security, Intelligence and Space Studies at the American Military University, teaching intelligence subjects at Masters level to inter alia serving intelligence officers. He has represented US and Israeli intelligence officers in law and briefed in staffers on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Joint Congressional Inquiry into 9-11. In the wake of that murderous attack he addressed panels on terrorism in Washington DC and Los Angeles organized by the respected Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs. Fellow panelists included a former head of Special Operations Command and a former Commander of the US Atlantic Fleet. Michael's active assistance to Intelligence and Law Enforcement agencies in the Global War on Terror produced some notable successes, including the exposure of the Abu Ghraib 'hood' photograph as a fake. His work on strategic intelligence took him to the Pentagon and he has also met with senior advisors to the President of the Russian Federation, in Moscow, in November 2005. He participated in the Global Strategic Review conference in Geneva in 2005 and was a speaker at both the Intelligence Conference (Intelcon) in 2005, and the Intelligence Summit in 2006, each at Crystal City. In 2006 he was flown out to, and flew off from, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN-65), as part of the US Navy's Distinguished Visitor Program. She was then working up her air group off the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, before operational deployment to the Persian Gulf. It is comparatively unusual for a foreign civilian to complete a carrier landing and launch cycle. Michael's ground-breaking, 700 page intelligence text "Spyhunter: The Secret History of German Intelligence" was published in England by June Press in April 2014. It features on a number of intelligence syllabuses, as does intelligence analysis prepared by Michael, e.g. on the brutal 2003 assassination of British weapons scientist Dr David Kelly CMG. In their unlawful raid on Michael’s home in Wendover, Buckinghamshire in April 2012 Thames Valley Police officers seized the manuscript of Spyhunter and all of Michael’s onshore backups. Publication was only possible because the draft had been backed up offshore. The police hung onto the seized copies long after it was decided not to use them as evidence. In November 2014 Michael was convicted at Southwark Crown Court by a tampered-with jury panel on two bogus bomb-hoax charges. Prior to bringing in the police the British Ministry of Defence, after consulting with the Cabinet Office, destroyed their recordings of Michael’s initial contact and qualified intelligence briefing re a DVD operation to target the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympics using a stolen Russian SS-N-19 warhead. Happily the NSA intercepted both Michael’s call to MOD and their call to him (on a number he had provided) and the intercepts are now in the hands of MI5. As Michael’s distinguished Veterans Today colleagues Gordon Duff and Ben Fulford have confirmed on this website, his intelligence briefing to MOD was substantially correct and two warheads, both off an SS-19, were recovered by the US. After inspection the Department of Energy estimated their yield at 20KT. View Latest Posts >>> Looks like Hillary will be Trumped By Michael Shrimpton on November 6, 2016 I’m calling this one for Trump and the GOP! I think the Democratic donkeys are going to be trampled under a herd of Republican elephants. Even the latest ABC poll only has Hillary leading narrowly. Since they had her leading by 12 points a week or so ago that should tell you something. So far as I can tell ABC only polls registered Democrats. The way I see it, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Colorado, all states supposed to be in play according to the MSM, are going for the Trump. All talk of Pence pulling out or the pro-German wing of the Republican Party doing a Trump dump has ceased. There was even talk this week of the Democrats dropping Hillary at the last moment and going with the Jesuit, ‘Father’ Kaine, presumably on the basis that Kaine is able not about to be indicted. Since the States of New York, Illinois and California appear to have rejected the principle of free and fair elections and do not propose to count the votes fairly, there is no way Donald Trump can win them. Even if he were to obtain a majority from living American voters, it would be outweighed by the dead voters, the Mexican vote and Democrats allowed to vote twice, or three times in the case of Illinois. In those circumstances I can’t see him winning by a landslide, but I think he’ll win comfortably. I see that Dick Morris is of the same view, and his opinions on the US political scene are always worth reading. He is drawing a comparison with 1980, when Ronald Reagan broke late and won by a landslide. The Democrats are trying to cheer themselves up by saying that the prospect of Trump winning is energising their supporters. That works both ways, however – I imagine Republicans (real ones that is, not RINOs) are feeling pretty energised right now. Contrast of Trump Clinton rallies The big difference lies in the enthusiasm of Trumpy’s supporters. Hillary is not generating the same level of interest. I suspect the donkeys are worried about turnout amongst the young and African-Americans. The big issue now is whether the Secret Service can protect the president-elect from the DVD, or indeed whether they will even try. President Kennedy trusted the Secret Service, which was a fatal mistake, with respect. The withdrawal of Secret Service protection from the Lincoln was the first sign that an assassination was going down on that shameful day in 1963 in Dallas TX, when Germany bloodily changed the face of America forever. With the Secret Service no longer independent and under the rigid control of the badly-penetrated DNI, Trumpy may need to be careful. Since the Secret Service are unreliable and have shown a willingness to withdraw protection from presidents the Germans want to remove, President Kennedy being the prime example, Donald Trump will need to consider supplementing the Secret Service with his own people. Hillary and the Fibbies Looks like the FBI have obtained a copy of that DNA report I advised on Barack Obama! The key to the independence of law enforcement and intelligence agencies from political interference is intelligence. It’s not what you know or who you know, it’s what you know about whom. I’m hearing all sorts of stuff – links to China, dirty dealings at the Clinton Foundation and some very interesting emails. My take is that the Fibbies, sensibly, have been talking to Meade, the Pentagon and the Virginia farm boys. Don’t forget, we live in a post Spyhunter world. Intel agencies now know that Germany has been interfering in the democratic process for 150 years, bribing, blackmailing and murdering her way to influence. That works both ways – corrupt candidates backed by the DVD can be exposed by the INTELCOM. Looks like the Good Guys have finally stopped sitting on the side-lines and joined the fight. This is the Super Bowl and the place to be is on the field, not sitting in the stands munching hot dogs and complaining about the score. _________ The Betrayal of Brexit You heard it here first! I was talking about establishment/German attempts to betray Brexit shortly after the vote. As I predicted there has been a desperate effort to keep the UK trapped inside the so-called Single Market, to allow European dumping of exports and labor on our more flexible and vibrant economy. We are to the EU what the US is to Mexico. Soros This week saw the judges weighing in, with an absurd and illogical ruling that the government can’t withdraw from the Treaty on European Union without primary legislation. It is being reported here that the case was bankrolled by the notoriously anti-British George Soros, named by Dr Robert Kaplan in his very good book on Soros as a German agent. The court, presided over by a committed Europhile, Lord Thomas, who very frankly should have recused himself, said in effect that the Royal Prerogative can only be used to accede to EU treaties, not withdraw from them. I was junior counsel to the late Leo Price QC in the early stages of the Rees-Mogg case, where the court upheld the use of the Royal Prerogative to sign up to the bitterly controversial Maastricht Treaty. With respect to the court, the proposition that the Prerogative can be used to sign up for a treaty but not withdraw from it only has to be stated for its absurdity to be apparent. The ruling is internally inconsistent, as well as being inconsistent with earlier, binding precedent, such as the Rees-Mogg case. In one paragraph it says that Parliament is supreme. A few paragraphs later, the court says in effect that Parliament is not in fact supreme and that its statutes can be ‘set aside’ by the courts! The Divisional Court also treated the Metric Martyrs case as rightly decided, which it wasn’t, and as a binding precedent, which it isn’t. The judges in Metric Martyr only came up with the ‘super-statute’ idea after argument was heard, reaching their decision in secret. What they should have done, with respect, was to relist the case for further argument. Had they done so I would have been able to point out that none of the cases they had come up with was in point, as none dealt with implied repeal. We don’t have super-statutes in Britain, as we don’t have a written constitution, thank goodness (look at the mess the Supreme Court has made of yours!). It follows that community law in Britain could never be supreme, as Parliament remained free to pass legislation in breach of community law. In Metric Martyrs I relied upon the Weights and Measures Act 1985, which allowed the martyrs to sell in pounds and ounces, i.e. in proper measurements. The prosecution relied upon the European Communities Act 1972, which required the use of French revolutionary measurements, like the kilogramme. Since the 1985 act was later, the 1972 act was impliedly repealed to the extent of the inconsistency. The judges got around this by refusing to apply the 1985 act and applying the 1972 act. In so doing, with respect, they acted unconstitutionally, as the courts are bound by acts of Parliament. Fortunately, since they didn’t hear argument on the point on which they decided the case, their decision wasn’t binding. For the claimants in the Article 50 case to assert that they were defending the rights of Parliament, at the same time as saying that Parliament’s statutes can be ignored by the court, was the height of hypocrisy. Fortunately the government has exercised its right of appeal. The decision should be overturned by the Supreme Court next month. Although none of the judges on the Divisional Court was a particularly good lawyer with respect, the Supreme Court contains some of the finest legal minds in Britain. The judiciary are now whinging about the savage political backlash, but what did they expect? Their decision can’t be justified on legal grounds, with respect, indeed it is barely reasoned at all. It was in effect a political decision. Having entered the political arena the judges will have to fend for themselves. Even the Lord Chancellor, Liz Truss, has refused to come to their aid, and rightly so. Judges should stay out of politics. When they become political, as they have on the EU, they risk losing the respect of the public and politicians. The Vienna Convention Theresa May Theresa May is badly bungling Brexit. She didn’t want it, hasn’t thought deeply about it and wasn’t familiar with the arguments. She’s also house-trained and over-dependent on her civil servants, including the hated and notoriously Europhile Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, whose knighthood was effectively awarded by himself, since the Cabinet Office controls the honors system. She should have used Article 50 straight-away. Even better she should have ignored Article 50 altogether, as it’s a trap, and gone with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This implicitly allows withdrawal from a multilateral treaty on 12 months’ notice, and expressly allows withdrawal on three months’ notice only, when there has been a fundamental change of circumstances. The referendum result was clearly one of those. _________ THE ASSASSINATION OF MAX SPIERS Max Spiers I have been somewhat remiss in not condemning this outrage before. I never knew Max, although we were due to meet at the Bases Conference in Pewsey, Wiltshire, on the weekend of August 13-14, where we were to be fellow speakers. Tragically, Max never made it, being assassinated in Poland in June. The Poles are claiming that he died of ‘natural causes’, indeed they put that on his death certificate. Who do the Poles think they are kidding? Had Max lived to speak at the conference I doubt I would have agreed with everything he had to say, although he and I were working, entirely independently, on similar subjects, like the DVD, for which he had a different name. He had a right however to hold his views and to speak his mind. He also had the right to live, although the connivance of the pro-German Polish government in his assassination shows how worthless that right is in the EU. Our own Foreign Office has backed down, sadly, and is going along with the Polish cover-up. The Munich Mentality is alive and well at King Charles St, the arrival of Boris Johnson notwithstanding. Warsaw needs to look out for itself. Agreeing to the assassination, probably by the DVD, of a prominent British conspiracy theorist on Polish soil was an unfriendly act towards Her Majesty. We’re not going to invade Poland, but neither are we going to lift a finger if the Russians do. If Warsaw wants military help against the Russians it can ask its friends the Germans to send a few panzers. Jerry knows the way to Poland. Before you even ask, yes I was told before driving to the conference that one of my fellow-speakers had been assassinated in Poland and no, I did not pull out. Indeed the Bases Project are making a DVD of the speeches and will be putting out a YouTube video. There are far too many speakers, if you ask me, pulling out of conferences at short notice these days on flimsy pretexts like another speaker being assassinated shortly before the conference. _________ KMS Prinz Eugen and HMS Hood Prinz Eugen There were some interesting comments in response to my column last week. One commenter wanted to know what the correct terms for the Germans are. The short answer is that the Germans can be referred to properly as the ‘Huns’, ‘Fritz’, ‘the Boche(s)’, ‘Jerry’, ‘the Jerries’, or, on more formal occasions, simply as ‘the Germans’. The expression ‘the Hun’ as a description of the Germans seems to have come into common usage in 1914, following the invasion of Belgium and Luxembourg by our community partner the Kaiser. ‘Jerry’ came into vogue in 1939, after our community partner Adolf Hitler invaded Poland. A most fascinating fact emerged in the discussion – the Prinz Eugen used High Explosive (HE) ammunition for her main battery during the Battle of the Denmark Strait, which saw the tragic loss of the beautiful and mighty battlecruiser Hood. The source given was Prinz Eugen’s logbook. I think that holds up and that our community partner Kapitän zur See Helmuth Brinkmann did indeed order the use of HE. Why? In order to start a few small fires, that’s why, in order to cover the detonation of an IED in Hood’s magazines by radio-control from the Bismarck. Given the lack of a trajectory for any of the shells from the Bismarck which would explain penetration of Hood’s well-protected main magazines, some naval historians have alighted on the possibility of a shell from Prinz Eugen as having delivered the fatal blow. As I point out in Spyhunter this doesn’t make sense. Prinz Eugen was only a 16,000 ton heavy cruiser, not a mighty 44,000 ton battlecruiser. Her main battery was equipped with 8”/60 cal. guns, scarcely powerful enough to punch through three inches of armor plate at combat range. Redesigned in the light of the painful experience of the Battle of Jutland, Hood’s main deck armor was basically designed to resist incoming supersonic 15” shellfire. Hood’s powerful 15”/42 cal main battery guns could throw out shells the size of Volkswagens at about Mach 2. No warship afloat today could sustain being hit by a broadside from HMS Hood – a nuclear carrier would probably fireball, as the shells penetrated her aviation fuel tanks or bomb and missile magazines. Prinz Eugen’s small 270 lb shells would basically bounce off 3” deck armor, if they even got as far as the main deck (a lot of their energy would be spent penetrating the steel shelter deck). If they were HE, not APC (i.e. armor-piercing) they wouldn’t even penetrate the strong shelter deck. They would explode on impact, causing havoc with ship’s boats, unprotected AA positions and possibly funnels, but they wouldn’t sink a capital ship. The Hun assassinated the Lord Kitchener in World War 1 using an IED, sinking the armored cruiser HMS Hampshire, which was carrying the great general to Russia. Looks like he pulled the same stunt again, this time using radio control rather than a timer. Lloyd George, of course, had wanted Lord Kitchener out of the way, and the Hun still hadn’t forgiven him for whipping his allies the Mad Mahdi (a religious nutter who today would be in ISIS, or the Democratic Party) and the Boers. I have discovered another fact this week about the Prinz Eugen, which confirms my analysis. She was equipped with sonar, and detected Vice-Admiral Holland’s battle squadron at 0500 hours on May 24. The British ships were over the horizon, but they were thundering towards the enemy at high speed, with their Battle Ensigns flying. Hood’s powerful steam turbines gave out 144,000 shaft horsepower, indeed when commissioned in 1920 she was the most powerful moving object yet constructed in the history of mankind. HMS Nelson The next British capital ships, the battleships Rodney and Nelson, had less than a third of Hood’s power. HMS Prince of Wales’s turbines also gave out over 100,000 SHP. The sonar operator on Prinz Eugen would have heard the screws of nearly 100,000 tons of warships (at full load displacement), pushing out nearly a quarter of million horsepower, charging directly towards his ship at 1,000 yards a minute. Under ordinary circumstances we would have expected Jerry to flee. Our community partners the Kriegsmarine had a firm policy of declining combat with a superior enemy, and Admiral Holland’s squadron packed 8 15” and 10 14” main battery guns, plus the 16 8” guns of Real-Admiral Wake-Walker’s cruisers, against Admiral Lutjens’s 8 15” and 8 8”. Why did Admiral Lutjens not withdraw whilst he had the chance? Because he knew the Hood was going to blow up, that’s why, indeed he actually ordered Brinkmann to swing his guns onto Prince of Wales BEFORE poor Hood blew up. He also knew that the treacherous and despicable Cabinet Secretary Sir Edward Bridges, a truly loathsome individual, was going to use the defeat as an excuse to force out Winston Churchill and install the pro-German Lord Halifax as Prime Minister. He also knew that Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess had taken the details of the plan to place an IED on board Hood and sortie the Bismarck to Britain two weeks before. He had of course allowed his ships to be photographed in a Norwegian fjiord by an RAF Spitfire, indeed he ordered his AA gunners not to open fire, to make sure the photos got to the Admiralty. _________ My Reading This Week Political treachery was the subject of my main reading this week (it’s only 512 pages, so obviously I was reading other stuff as well), Liberty’s Last Stand, by Stephen Coonts. Bringing his two heroes, Rear-Admiral Jake Grafton and Tommy Carmellini, together, the novel has a cracking plot. An evil, Muslim, socialist, black man called Barry Soetoro, who actually believes in global warming and hates whites, wins the presidency in 2008. By August 2016, after nearly 8 years in office, the Democratic candidate, a Mrs Hinton, is facing defeat in November. I wonder on which politicians Barry Soetoro and Mrs Hinton might be based? My goodness me, it’s a brain-teaser. I’ll leave you to guess. Soetoro then arranges some Islamic terrorist atrocities and declares martial law, planning to postpone the election. Jake Grafton is arrested by FEMA and flung into a FEMA concentration camp in West Virginia. Civil war ensues, as Texas declares independence. Other states follow. Liberty’s Last Stand moves at a tremendous pace, making serious political points along the way. Lots of FEMA guys get whacked, so it’s a fun read. The plot, moreover, is credible. In his blog about the book, Stephen makes some pertinent observations about the overreach of federal judges and bureaucrats, and the impotence of Congress. Huge swathes of American life are governed not by statutes or the Constitution, but by federal regulations, applied by a bureaucracy which manages to be both heartless and mindless at the same time. There will be a lot of work for President Trump to do. _____________ Related Posts: 1.8 Million Votes Behind, Trump Goes Neocon while voters stats suggesting “hack” are suppressed Prediction: Party of Lesser Evil will win US Election Disclosure: Beyond the Burning the FBI, VT Breaks New Ground(part IV) Adelson boosts Trump with $25 million to defeat Clinton TRUTH DIED at the Hands of Katherine Frisk The views expressed herein are the views of the author exclusively and not necessarily the views of VT, VT authors, affiliates, advertisers, sponsors, partners, technicians, or the Veterans Today Network and its assigns.

Yes, Reagan did this, got his own people after he was shot. I am concerned about the potential of violence at the protests this weekend and onward. If it’s imperative for Trump to have good protection, ditto ditto ditto for President Obama until Trump is sworn in. There is no room for complacency now. I will never forgive what was done to the King family along with the Kennedys, but let there be no repeat.

I got several of them last Saturday at a funeral, and I put one in the casket. It was appropriate for the wife of a WWII veteran. Max Spiers’ assassination in Poland… I want to echo Mr Shrimpton’s sentiments about Poland. I also feel betrayed. Most of the time, because of my family’s sacrifices for France, Belgium, Holland, and the UK, in both WWI and WWII, those are the countries whose politicians offend me. I will continue to pick on France. I see that there are some efforts on their part lately, to finally honor a few people with the Legion of Honour medal, one of which was handed out very recently to a 97-yr old Canadian woman who is alive to tell her story. But medals will NOT buy redemption. They need to clean up their act. Log in to Reply JS  November 10, 2016 at 7:08 am Russian Duma clapped spontaneously when given the election news. We have pulled back from the brink, and they know it. I will be blunt: the nuclear clock has been turned back, and they know it.

I did however call it right, not just predicting a win, but a big win for Trumpy. Great telegram from dear old Pooters in Moscow. I know I am breaking the habit of a lifetime and blowing my own trumpet, but nobody is else is blowing it, as it were, so I’ll have to blow my own!

JS  November 10, 2016 at 6:05 am MS, you got 6 of 9 swing states, not bad. The 3 western states were possible also, but they are also full of illegal aliens. The biggest new win is Pennsylvania, which I knew was going to happen. PA put Trump over the top. The pollsters, pundits, and so-called elites are now desperately trying to spin about why they got PA wrong. But they would have known the truth in advance, if they had left their ivory tower offices and walked around talking to real people on Main St. in small towns. JS  November 9, 2016 at 5:56 am Financial markets had a heart attack last night, right about the time the NYT election odds pendulum swung past 50% for Trump. DJIA futures fell 500 points, but later recovered, and are now down about 200. But on the opening bell of the NYSE 40 minutes from now, I expect the markets to blast off higher than the close yesterday. Why? We have a GOP trifecta revolution, getting the White House from an incumbent Dem, as well as getting both houses. And I don’t know the last time such a thing has happened. Maybe the 1950s? It’s insanely bullish for business in general, not just here in the US, but around the world. You heard it here first. Log in to Reply JS  November 10, 2016 at 6:41 am Well, I was right in that comment, made 34 minutes before the opening bell! Markets did blast off, with the Dow making a record high yesterday afternoon, before pulling back a bit. Markets and economies should get better and better over the weeks and months as the reality sinks in, that the election results were a “hat trick” (for those who like sports) or “the full monty” if you will. But there is no room for complacency. The Senate majority is razor-thin, and I would advise ALL Senators and Senators-elect to stay out of small airplanes for a while. Ditto for Trump and Pence! In addition, it is vital that the members of both houses be briefed about the national security situation, and that they put their personal agendas aside long enough for there to be real cooperation and horse-trading to pass or repeal bills, going forward, on the issues that are good for America. “Minor sins” will need to revealed and then forgiven, so that these people can’t be blackmailed for their pasts. JS  November 9, 2016 at 5:46 am Well, it has happened. Trump won. Apparently, Canada’s immigration website crashed last night around 8 pm ET, from the sudden flood of Hollywood celebrities trying to hedge their bets. Very funny! I am offering to teach these guys some Canadian English terms if they are serious. We’ll start with just a few words that start with M: Métis, mukluks, muskeg, moose. Log in to Reply JS  November 9, 2016 at 6:12 am Incidentally, I was in Canada over the weekend, and heard a lot of serious comments about the upcoming US election, as well as voting advice. Some representative comments, from different people: This election will affect the Canadian economy drastically, but we don’t have any say in it… US elections are too long, and too dirty… We feel so sorry for you; you get to choose between a-hole A and a-hole B… If Trump wins, I will close my US bank account because I won’t want to go visit there… Election advice: Make sure you vote for Hillary (accompanied by laughter)… Vote for Trump, he is God’s wrecking ball (no laughter)… JS  November 10, 2016 at 6:52 am In case there is doubt, I did not vote. I am not a US citizen, not yet. I am waiting for Washington DC, NYC, Chicago, and Hollywood, to be cleaned up quite a bit first. I hope Hollywood takes their cue from Vogue UK: less cleavage, and more class, would be nice. jensingr  November 7, 2016 at 3:28 pm Thank you for mentioning the murder of Max Spiers. Another truth seeker they absolutely feared and poisoned. So many have died who exposed a bit of the large picture of corruption that they control with their bloody hitmen, I hope things change for the better soon!

Log in to Reply Laura Green  November 7, 2016 at 6:39 am As to Poland invasion ( like 1939 then ???). That depends who has written your history. The victory over German Nazis is also twisted, and is stolen by Anglo -American coalition in spite of the knowledge that it (coalition) joined Russians against Germ. close to the end of war. Michael Shrimpton  November 6, 2016 at 2:31 pm Indeed, we do not have administrative law in England as understood in Europe. The SI Act really only codified the arrangements for SIs. They still had to be intra vires or lawful. The concept of supremacy of community law sits uneasily with our concept of the supremacy of Parliament. Log in to Reply Pyotr  November 6, 2016 at 12:58 pm A good read Mr Shrimpton, thank you. In particular I am fascinated by the whole EU congame being played. But one point I would really like to see clarified is the interface between EU law which is I believe Administrative Law, and British Law Practices which rely upon Common Law: I comprehend that the statutory instruments act in (1946/7?) is supposed to render legal Britains takeup of continental Administrative Law; but does it? I remember reading a long time ago in Halsbury’s Law that Administrative Law is not legal in Great Britain. Might you write upon the convolutions: Probably unlawful, that are relied upon to seemingly regularise this?

A Yale law graduate and a former official of the Obama administration, Khanna, 40, is pitted against his own party's Mike Honda.PTI | Nov 6, 2016, 10.02 PM IST Rohit "Ro" Khanna (Image: twitter/RoKhannaUSA) WASHINGTON: Backed by top IT companies of the Silicon Valley, Indian-American Rohit "Ro" Khanna hopes to get second-time lucky in his effort to enter the US House of Representatives against Democratic Party's sitting lawmaker. A Yale law graduate and a former official of the Obama administration, Khanna, 40, is pitted against his own party's Mike Honda to represent the 17th Congressional district of California, whose residents stretch from Tesla Motors factory in Fremont to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino--taking in Intel, Yahoo, and eBay along the way. In the primaries, early this summer, Khanna received more votes than eight-term incumbent Honda. California electoral system allows the top two winners of the primaries to proceed to the general polls, even if they are from the same party. Khanna narrowly lost to Honda in 2014 Congressional polls. "From what I hear a lot of internal polling shows that he is six-eight points ahead," M R Rangaswami, a Silicon Valley investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist told PTI. But based on his experience, he is not taking for granted and is campaigning hard in his constituency. "He would be a fantastic face to the Silicon Valley," said Rangaswami, a leading Indian-American figure in the Valley. Rangaswami said having Khanna represent California would be one of the best things for Indian-Americans, who have a quarter-million presence in the Valley. "He is going to be a go-to guy, because he is a person who really understands technologies. He is going to be fantastic," he said. Among others, Khanna has been endorsed by former president Jimmy Carter, California Lt Governor Gavin Newsom and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. Khanna's commitment to public service was inspired by his grandfather Amarnath Vidyalankar, who told him stories about his participation in Mahatma Gandhi's Indian independence movement and spending years in jail to promote human rights. "He was my early inspiration," Khanna said in an interview. He became involved in politics while attending the University of Chicago, where he worked on the campaign of the then Illinois State Senator Barack Obama. Khanna was born in 1976 in Philadelphia to parents who migrated from India. He also interned for Jack Quinn when Quinn served as the Chief of Staff for Vice President Al Gore. The San Francisco Chronicle has identified the 17th Congressional District as one of the top three most important races outside of the presidential race. Like 2014 elections, local media is predicting a close race in this Congressional district. "Six weeks ago I would have picked a free and clear victory for Khanna. But now I'm not so sure," said Larry Gerston, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State.

Drones are an important part of Intel's growth plans, and the chip maker continues to expand its presence in the nascent space. Drones have become a consistent presence in keynote addresses and showroom floors during such events as the Intel Developer Forum, the company has bought and invested in a number of drone technology vendors, and CEO Brian Krzanich chairs an advisory board to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) created to help the agency create regulations for drones. In August, Intel unveiled its Aero Platform aimed at developers and the Aero Ready to Fly drone that is coming at the end of the year. Last month, Intel introduced the Falcon 8+, the company's first branded drone built off work done on the Falcon 8, a commercial eight-rotor drone developed by Ascending Technologies. Intel had worked with the startup before buying it earlier this year. Intel officials see their products—from processors to software like the 3D RealSense technology—as good fits for drones. The company also has shown how drones can be used for entertainment purposes, setting a world record earlier this year by putting 100 drones into the air simultaneously, all of which were controlled by a single pilot. Now Intel is taking that aspect of drones even further. The chip maker on Nov. 4 unveiled a new drone designed specifically for such light shows, and announced that the company in October had set a new Guinness World Record by having 500 of the drones—called the Intel Shooting Star—in the air at the same time, again being controlled by a single pilot. Most drones currently being used for commercial purposes are focused on such work as inspections and mapping, according to Natalie Cheung, director of marketing and light show business development in Intel's UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Group. With Shooting Star and the demonstration in Germany with the 500 drones, Intel officials want to show how drones can be used for entertainment purposes, Cheung told eWEEK. "It's a very different perspective of drones," she said, adding that it was "mind-blowing" to see what 500 lit drones looked like lighting up the night sky. In a post on the company blog, Anil Nanduri, vice president in Intel's New Technology Group and general manager of unmanned aviation systems for the Perceptual Computing Group, wrote that "with this drone, we will be able to demonstrate that drone light shows can redefine entertainment and create amazing new experiences in the night sky." The Shooting Star quadcopter is fairly unique, Cheung said. It's been designed for safety—it's made of foam and plastic, uses LED lights, has cages around the propellers and uses geofencing to limit where it flies. It weighs about half a pound, and is about 15 inches long and just over 3 inches high, she said. Intel uses algorithms to place the drones and determine flight paths. The drone market—for both consumers and business users—is expected to grow rapidly. In a recent report on the general state of aviation in the United States, the FAA earlier this year predicted that by 2020, about 4.3 million UAVs will be sold to consumers and another 2.7 million will be sold to businesses for commercial use. Cheung said Intel officials can see multiple commercial uses for the Shooting Star drones, from fireworks-like displays during large public events to in-sky advertising. Along with the Shooting Star drone and new world record, Intel this past week also announced it bought MAVinci, a German drone company known for its flight planning software. "With this transaction, we are gaining expertise in flight planning software algorithms and also fixed-wing drone design capabilities that complement the technology and knowledge Intel previously acquired from Ascending Technologies," Nanduri wrote. "This new acquisition will play a key role in providing solutions for industries such as agriculture, insurance, construction, mining and more."           LATEST MOBILE ARTICLES   Apple And PayPal Enable Payments Through Siri Voice Commands Revamped Google Play Music to Use Machine Learning to Suggest Songs Google Rebuts EU Complaint About Android Bundling Charges GoPro Recalls All 2,500 of the New Karma Drones Sold to Customers Google Gives Gmail for iOS Major Overhaul                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Nouveau Needs Help Testing Their New Atomic Mode-Setting Support Written by Michael Larabel in Nouveau on 6 November 2016 at 08:42 AM EST. 4 Comments A few days ago I wrote about Nouveau atomic mode-setting and DP MST patches while now DRM subsystem maintainer Ben Skeggs is soliciting more testing from the open-source NVIDIA community for trying these big changes to the Nouveau KMS driver. Ben wrote Friday on the Nouveau mailing list, "As the atomic modesetting transition is basically a rewrite of the KMS portion of the driver, I would be very grateful for any additional testing that people could provide (even as simple as just booting and making sure you get a display is valuable)." If you have some time this weekend or in the week ahead and don't mind building an experimental kernel, fire it up. The Nouveau code continues to be developed on GitHub. Nouveau's atomic support trails the Intel driver which has good atomic support since Linux 4.9 while is coming out sooner than the AMDGPU code that depends upon DAL and haven't seen any atomic work for the mature Radeon DRM driver. Atomic mode-setting allows setting output modes more cleanly and straight-forward by either being able to succeed or fail in one-go while also being able to test a desired mode in advance of the commit operation, reducing possible flickering situations while being faster. The DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport (DP MST) allows for powering multiple monitors off a single DisplayPort connection while is also used by some higher-end displays. So far the comments from this test request on the mailing list do indicate some regressions, including miniDP to DVI adapters not working. Hopefully the Nouveau atomic support will be ready to go for Linux 4.10. 4 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Click here to navigate Beauty & Fashion Food Technology Travel & Leisure Health & Wellness Home & Garden Money Saving Tips 8 Best Things to Buy in November November 4, 2016 ♦ Alyssa Miles ♦ Money Saving Tips ♦ 0 Comments Tweet Like Plus Pin It Share What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of November? If you’re a shopper, Black Friday and Cyber Monday might be on par with that other day when people eat turkey — what’s it called again? And it’s the month when you’ll find some of the best deals of the year. The good news is you don’t have to wait until Thanksgiving night to find low prices, especially if you shop online. Here are some of the best deals to track this month. TVs and Electronics Just about anyone with a screen has seen viral video of the fights that break out over big screen TVs. Yes, the prices are that good; but this year skip the madness, spend turkey day with your family, and order online on Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2016. Among the most popular electronics items are HDTVs, especially 4K. Go with this highly rated Samsung 55″ LED 2160p Smart 4K Ultra HD TV. Best Buy Coupon Codes Computers and Tablets ‘Tis the season for new desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones. The best news? With Intel’s faster new Skylake processors released in September, there’s a glut of last generation models on sale. These computers and software work just fine for the average family. Apple lovers know that the best the brand can usually do is offer a gift card with purchase. Buy online at big box stores to save the most. For example, you can expect to shave about $200 off a MacBook Pro 13.3-inch notebook at Best Buy. Best Buy Coupon Codes Discount Cookware Rarely are good deals and necessity so perfectly aligned. If you have a crowd to cook for over the holidays, get your oven mitts on cookware, bakeware and small appliances. Some of the most popular appliances this season are upscale blenders and food processors and the Instant Pot, a programmable pressure cooker, rice cooker, steamer and warmer. It’s achieved cult-like status among busy moms and whole foods aficionados alike. Walmart Coupon Codes Hardware and Tools Get going on those last minute home improvement projects, or replace the old drill that was on its last thread in August. You’ll find November deals on both power and hand tools. And the handy person in your life will probably thrill to see a new miter saw under the tree. Save the most by ordering online and picking up in the store. Popular this year are cordless stick drills and this brand new, adjustable length screwdriver by Klein Tools. Buy direct from the company or use a coupon code for Amazon. Amazon Coupon Codes Popular Toys Toy sales on Black Friday have outshone December sales for three years now. Plan to shop Black Friday for the major wants, and pick up extras in December. Every year has an I-gotta-have-it gizmo. This year, the “it” toy is the Star Wars collection, hands down. The hottest: Legendary Jedi Master Yoda with voice recognition, the ability to speak 115 phrases, and 360-degree motorized movement. Walmart Coupon Codes Clothing and Accessories Everyone knows Black Friday is one of the best times to snag a new outfit, especially what’s on-trend right now. Sometimes it’s important to eyeball the fabric and cut; but some things, like hoodies, jeans, and things you’ve bought before, are easier and cheaper to buy online. This is a good time to stack coupon codes with markdowns for an even better deal. In demand: a faux suede moto jacket from the limited edition LC Lauren Conrad Runway Collection at Kohl’s. Kohl’s Coupon Codes November Travel Deals The dollar’s strength makes for some incredible European travel savings. Book now and enjoy a steal of a deal on holidays abroad, or get rock-bottom prices on a summer 2017 vacation. Look around and you will spot European cruises for under $1,300 a person, or six-night stays with airfare in Ireland for less than $900. Closer to home, Las Vegas hotels also offer some of their best rates of the year this month, too. Cheap Tickets Coupon Codes Halloween Candy and Costumes News flash:  the trick-or-treat candy you’ve shoved in the back of the closet is now half off in stores.  If it’s not something worth stashing away for next year, like chocolate, indulge your sweet tooth now. You might need the pick-me-up during shopping marathons. Costume Halloween retailers are also eager to get rid of costumes, yard animatronics and other decorations. Think ahead and get some for next year, like this Gaseous Fog Zombie Animatronic. Spirit Halloween Coupon Codes Retailers are predicting a strong season to parallel a strengthening economy and lower unemployment. Perhaps you’re just ready to flex those shopping muscles, too. If so, November is the perfect time to fire up the computer and go for it. No related posts.

Freedman | November 3, 2016 03:22 pm MORE The new MacBook Pro has some actual pros up in arms. With only two USB Type-C ports on the base model (four on the Touch Bar model), no SD card slot, the end of MagSafe charging, an older 6th Generation Intel CPU and a $1,499 starting price, some Apple lovers are considering alternatives. In our 13-inch MacBook Pro review, we said that we really like its beautiful display, improved butterfly keyboard, louder speakers and long battery life. That’s why we awarded it 4 out of 5 stars. But if you’re looking to dip your toes into the Windows 10 waters for a truly Pro machine, here are the best options: Dell XPS 13 Our favorite overall laptop now has Intel’s 7th Generation Kaby Lake CPU, and should be considered seriously by anyone in the market for a new laptop. At 12 x 7.9 x 0.6 inches, it’s thicker than the superthin MacBook Pro, but you’ll get two USB Type-A ports, a USB Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3, an SD card slot and your choice of either full-HD nontouch or QHD+ touch screen options with virtually no bezel around its beautiful Infinity Edge display. Dell XPS 13 Review » From $799.00 Dell Razer Blade Don’t let the fact that Razer makes gaming machines fool you — you can get some serious creative work done on its machines. The Razer Blade uses the latest 7th Generation Intel CPU, has options for 14-inch displays up to 3200 x 1800 and includes a USB Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3. It’s a little hefty at 4.2 pounds, but you’ll get 16GB of RAM and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 GPU, which will let you play intense games as well as boost your Photoshop performance. The one catch? No SD card slot; you’ll need to upgrade to the 17-inch Razer Blade Pro for that. Razer Blade Review » From $1799.99 Microsoft Surface Book If you need more versatility, check out Microsoft’s Surface Book, which is one of our favorite combinations of laptop and tablet so far. The 13.5-inch, 3,000 x 2,000 touch-screen display is sharp and ready for artists who want to use the included Surface Pen. You’ll get two USB 3.0 ports, an SD card slot and Mini DisplayPort, but you’ll have to do without the latest USB Type-C port. The Nvidia GTX 965M GPU and 6th Generation Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs aren’t the latest and greatest, but the Pro’s design and tools make it a contender for artists and other creatives. Microsoft Surface Book Review » From $1246.00 Amazon Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga If the OLED Touch Bar on the Mac isn’t enough for you, how about an OLED display? The ThinkPad X1 Yoga 14-inch OLED screen gives you astounding colors and extra-wide viewing angles. Plus, you’ll enjoy full-day battery life and an SD card slot, though there are no USB Type-C or Thunderbolt options here. At 2.8 pounds, you can carry it anywhere with ease. But if you want the latest and greatest, you’ll have to wait for a refresh with Kaby Lake CPUs; current models sport older Skylake processors. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (OLED and Regular Screen) Review » From $1394.10 Lenovo HP Spectre x360 Apple isn’t the only company that makes laptops that are thin, light and well-designed. The HP Spectre x360 is drop-dead gorgeous and light at 2.8 pounds and 0.5 inches thick. You can get it with the latest Kaby Lake CPU and a speedy PCIe SSD, and it has both USB Type-C and Type-A ports. But HP ditched the SD card, too, so you may still need a dongle for that. We also love the Spectre for its amazing audio and long-lasting battery. HP Spectre x360 Review » From $1159.99 Bestbuy Asus ZenBook Pro UX501VW If you want to replace the 15-inch MacBook Pro, try Asus’ ZenBook Pro. The UX501VW has a beautiful all-metal build, a USB Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3 and a 15.6-inch 3840 x 2160 touch screen. Like the new MacBook Pro, it’s only available with a Skylake CPU, but the 16GB of RAM and discrete Nvidia GeForce 960M GPU with 2GB of VRAM allow for great performance. At 5 pounds, though, it’s a bit chunky compared to other devices of this size. Asus ZenBook Pro UX501VW Review » From $1499.00 Dell XPS 15 It’s hard to argue with the Dell XPS 15 — it’s the XPS 13, but bigger. This model doesn’t have a Kaby Lake option yet (that’s likely coming early next year), but there’s an option for an Nvidia 960M GPU and up to 16GB of RAM. You also get a whole bunch of ports, including two USB 3.0 ports, a Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3, HDMI and an SD card reader. At 4.4 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, you’ll be able to carry it around in any bag without a problem.

I'm not concerned about cost but really unhappy with the MBP15 losing USB-A and SD card. I would love Kaby Lake, 32gb ram (16gb min), as light as MBP15, USB A & C (or just A if I have to choose), SD card slot. I think an updated XPS15 might fit the bill. But currently nothing on the market seems comparable. Fernando Says: November 4th, 2016 at 7:18 am I have purchased the Dell XPS 15 9550 super powerful USD 2K+ version and it was the worst experience I could ever have with a laptop. Screen flickering, Audio noises, video drivers problems and performance. Never again a Dell product until another company buys them and fixes how they work. I am thinking on going to the Thinkpad line with 3 years on-site warranty for peace of mind. Ruturaj Says: November 4th, 2016 at 2:00 am Xps 15 has upto 32gb of RAM not 16gb. SouthFloridaWireless Says: November 3rd, 2016 at 10:22 pm Awesome selection of laptops.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Microsoft Surface phone images leak; when will Windows 10 mobile flagship be unveiled? The Windows 10 mobile OS-powered Surface phone series is expected to make its debut either at CES 2017 or MWC 2017. Rohit KVN   November 6, 2016 16:12 IST 4 Shares 4 Shares Microsoft Surface phone images leak; Windows 10 mobile flagship phone launch imminent?Evan Blass (aka @evleaks) via Twitter Microsoft launched the mid-range Lumia 650 in February 2016. But since then, the company has not launched any smartphone, leading many to believe that the Redmond-based company might be working on the rumoured Surface phone series. And now, images of the speculated device have leaked online, hinting that the launch is just around the corner. Popular spy Evan Blass (@evleaks) has shared three images of Microsoft Surface phones powered by Intel's PC grade processor. This apparently led to a raging debate on social media platforms over the authenticity of the Microsoft phone. Some claimed it to be a concept phone and others suggested it was Dell's rejected phone model. Why advertise with us? Related New image of HTC Bolt with attractive black shade leaked ahead of launch Verizon rolls out Android Marshmallow to BlackBerry Priv Blass, in a bid to end the confusion, released a few more pictures this time with promotional snapshots of the fully working smartphone and confirmed it was a real deal. So far, Microsoft has not made any official comment on the Surface phones, but going by the leaked images, it looks like the company has completed the prototype testing and finalised the model for mass productions. That being said, Microsoft is unlikely to unveil Surface phone series this year, as it is a bit late. We are already in November, penultimate month of the year, and all the rivals — Samsung, Google, Apple and others — have all launched their respective flagship phones of 2016. .@tomwarren Much more than just a concept.

A Yale law graduate and a former official of the Obama administration, Khanna, 40, is pitted against his own party's Mike Honda to represent the 17th Congressional district of California, whose residents stretch from Tesla Motors factory in Fremont to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino—taking in Intel, Yahoo, and eBay along the way. In the primaries, early this summer, Khanna received more votes than eight-term incumbent Honda. California electoral system allows the top two winners of the primaries to proceed to the general polls, even if they are from the same party. Khanna narrowly lost to Honda in 2014 Congressional polls. "From what I hear a lot of internal polling shows that he is six-eight points ahead," M R Rangaswami, a Silicon Valley investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist said. But based on his experience, he is not taking for granted and is campaigning hard in his constituency. "He would be a fantastic face to the Silicon Valley," said Rangaswami, a leading Indian-American figure in the Valley. Rangaswami said having Khanna represent California would be one of the best things for Indian-Americans, who have a quarter-million presence in the Valley. "He is going to be a go-to guy, because he is a person who really understands technologies. He is going to be fantastic," he said. Among others, Khanna has been endorsed by former president Jimmy Carter, California Lt Governor Gavin Newsom and San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo. Khanna's commitment to public service was inspired by his grandfather Amarnath Vidyalankar, who told him stories about his participation in Mahatma Gandhi's Indian independence movement and spending years in jail to promote human rights. "He was my early inspiration," Khanna said in an interview. He became involved in politics while attending the University of Chicago, where he worked on the campaign of the then Illinois State Senator Barack Obama. Khanna was born in 1976 in Philadelphia to parents who migrated from India. He also interned for Jack Quinn when Quinn served as the Chief of Staff for Vice President Al Gore. The San Francisco Chronicle has identified the 17th Congressional District as one of the top three most important races outside of the presidential race. Like 2014 elections, local media is predicting a close race in this Congressional district. "Six weeks ago I would have picked a free and clear victory for Khanna. But now I'm not so sure," said Larry Gerston, professor emeritus of political science at San Jose State. © Copyright 2016 PTI. All rights reserved.

When it comes to getting things done, they prefer a PC and browser over anything else. This is a far cry from the “PC is Dead” mantra we’ve been hearing for some time. You can read the survey results yourself. For right now, let’s talk about why Apple’s success with the iPod and iPhone didn’t lead to another digital revolution with the iPad, which was the device that caused all this false uproar. The iPod Success What made the iPod a success over all of the other MP3 players was that Apple was the only vendor that really didn’t care about DRM (digital rights management) and instead focused on ease of use. Sony, which had dominated with the Walkman, had acquired a lot of content and was so concerned about content theft that it locked up its MP3 player with DRM, making it impossible to rip music. Microsoft’s Play for Sure platform didn’t play for sure and was too difficult to use reliably. So by focusing like a laser on what people were going to do anyway, rip CDs, and making it easy, the iPod fueled what was Apple’s impressive turnaround. Microsoft had a strategy to displace the iPod by coming up with a product that was more robust and technology to easily migrate playlists and songs between the two devices. It didn’t execute and exited the market. It was soooo close. The iPhone Success Realizing that in a smartphone, music could be a feature that could cannibalize the iPod, Steve Jobs moved aggressively to cannibalize it himself. The first iPhone was basically an iPod with phone capability and it caused the demise of the iPod, eventually, once he got it to work as a viable phone. The formula was to take something that was successful, add one key feature that defined an adjacent market, and then move to dominate that market. And given that the cell phone market was vastly larger than the MP3 market, by combining the two, Jobs drove the firm to even greater heights. The iPad Mistake The iPad was basically a larger iPod Touch, so it looked like the same kind of thing that Apple had done to smartphones, which is add a feature and then go after an adjacent market: in this case, PCs. But the problems were three-fold with this move. First, the iPod had been weakened by the iPhone, making it a far weaker launch platform; Apple didn’t want to cannibalize its PCs so never allowed it to fully embrace what the MacOS did; and the product didn’t do telephony so Apple couldn’t cannibalize its smartphone position, which was far stronger. So rather than repeating the iPhone success, it effectively launched an additional product and once again showcased that people generally don’t like to carry three devices. The iPad did make a nice consumption product but, given that most mobile games were on smartphones and games drove performance, after consumers bought one tablet, most tended to stop buying. Then smartphones started to grow to phablet sizes and instead of the iPad taking over for the smartphone, we got a reverse revolution: The smartphone started to displace the tablet, and PCs were pretty much left alone. Microsoft Continuum Microsoft did have a better idea with Continuum, which was to do what Apple should have done: embrace the PC with the smartphone. Several smartphones sort of provide this function today. However, because Intel was never able to be successful with smartphones, or get into a Microsoft phone, and Microsoft never was competitive with mobile apps, the result hasn’t risen to its potential. The HP Elite X3  is the closest to this ideal in market but because it uses an ARM processor, its Windows capability is very limited and HP Inc. rightly targets this at a business market where it does have some potential. Rumors said a Dell product running an Intel processor was in the works but allegedly has been cancelled, but the issue would still be mobile apps and whether the phone could also embrace the Android marketplace (something that the Kindle does, but not perfectly, largely by forking Android). But emulators are possible, Android apps tend to be written to run on older phones, and Microsoft has allegedly been working on this since 2014. The best strategy might be to wait until Google is hit by an anti-trust action out of the UK before launching this feature, and then use that as a lever to help assure not only that apps will initially work but that Google won’t work to break compatibility once it is in place. Currently, Google, like Microsoft unsuccessfully did in the 1990s, is fighting the EU charges. Wrapping Up: Microsoft Is So Close The recipe for success that the iPhone showcased was to embrace and then cannibalize a market where Apple was both dominant and successful. The iPad needed to cannibalize the iPhone and the Mac, but it didn’t do either, even though that was the initial promise. That promise did hurt the PC market but because of consumers’ unwillingness to carry three devices, particularly when, as smartphones increased in size, they could actually better cannibalize tablets, a reverse trend emerged. Now the bigger risk is that smartphones eventually cannibalize PCs. Microsoft has the best elements of a plan in place but it still needs to execute. The elements of success are Windows phones that can run a full selection of Windows and Android apps, and this may hinge on what the EU eventually does to Google. For now, the PC isn’t going anyplace, largely because it appears that no one, including Apple, is yet willing to put all of the elements together to dislodge it. But Microsoft is again soooo close.

It sees problems with software-defined, hyper-converged systems and traditional array-based products because they can't meet the needs of customers that are getting "SaaSified," in that they want software provided as a service. To do that, Kaminario says the storage infrastructure has to have five guiding principles: Rackscale economics Disaggregated capacity and compute Dynamically composable systems Simplified stack Smart analytics CEO Dani Golan told a press party at Kaminario's Israeli headquarters that customers emphasize cost-efficiency, scalability and performance. Kaminario says larger SSD drives help on cost efficiency and its K2 arrays support 500GB, 1TB and 2TB drives. Now they say: "Very soon we will quadruple that," which implies 8TB drives and, allowing for marketing hype, possibly means Samsung's 7.4TB drives. Golan said: "We will make a very significant announcement about performance and density ... There will be major-major news on scalability, quadrupling our capability ... We'll introduce a new price-point that will be revolutionary for all-flash again. We'll announce breakthroughs in performance for mixed workloads – essentially doubling that." Kaminario CEO Dani Golan Kaminario sees a way to increase deduplication effectiveness by 30 per cent, with an announcement coming in 2017, and dedupe development progress continuing beyond that. Our understanding is that the announcement could come in the first half of next year, possibly the first quarter. Over the longer term, NVMe over Fabrics will help with disaggregating compute and capacity in the K2 array with NVMeF-connected shelves and an ability to dynamically create virtual K2 arrays with varying amounts of compute and capacity. The network shelves need a ROCE target device to connect them to an NVMe fabric, and that device could be Intel-based or ARM-based. The ARM route may take longer to arrive, but would be less expensive. This composability capability will use a virtualization layer and will enable fault domains to be isolated to virtual arrays and not a full physical K2 array. There will be global spares for compute (controllers) and storage. We also expect to see the Clarity cloud-based monitoring and predictive analytics tool to have automatic performance tuning through alert-triggered scripting routines – "global" – meaning across a data center or even beyond that. Kaminario could also move to selling its controller software on its own along with networked capacity shelves. Kaminario market position It's perceived that Kaminario is lagging the leaders in the all-flash array market but Golan says they – the big five – as well as a group of five wannabee players, have a problem: "My belief is that three and a half of them don't have a good answer for next-generation storage and nor do the wannabee big five." He mentions Cisco, Oracle, Huawei, and Lenovo, and also component suppliers that want to get into all-flash arrays. It takes five to seven years to mature a storage product and its stack, and they don't have the time because the market is developing too fast. They will have to partner to get the technology, and Kaminario will be ready and waiting. It's tectonic shift time for the leaders and the balance of power in storage. Reg Comment Kaminario has hundreds of customers – there are 50 listed in EMEA alone, with the largest customer having a 12PB (effective) system. Its quarterly revenues are growing at triple digits year-on-year. It will not reveal actual customer numbers or its revenues. Golan says: "Going public is our plan; we're not disclosing a specific timeline for a public offering but that is our goal." He's a man on a mission to build a successful stand-alone company. On Golan's heights he wants K2 to be the highest mountain in the all-flash array storage world. ® Sponsored: Transforming software delivery with DevOps Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register A Clarity cloud gathers around K2.

Intel has smashed its own record-breaking spectacle from a year ago, setting 500 drones in flight simultaneously to show off the capabilities of its new firework-killing aircraft, the Shooting Star. Intel only announced its first commercial drone last month, the Falcon 8+ designed for surveying and mapping. But apparently it was busy behind the scenes prior to that, building obstacle-avoidance technologies and drone-development kits to try to inspire new applications in the field. One part of its push into the area has been exploring how drones can be used to create a new kind of light show. Earlier this year it revealed it had used 100 LED-equipped drones flying in a pre-programmed formation and synchronized to the sounds of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to light up the night sky, claiming a Guinness World Record for the Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously in the process. Now it has outdone itself in a big way. It's latest Guinness World Record-winning spectacle involves the use of 500 drones flying simultaneously, piloted by one person using a single laptop. Intel says a few improvements and advances were necessary to achieve the feat. The weight of the drones has been cut from more than 2 lb (900 g) to 0.6 lb (280 g) thanks to a much lighter plastic and foam frame. A new flight controller, which is the same used to fly the 18-rotor Volocopter, means a light show can now be arranged in a few days rather than five months, and allows for a much higher level of precision. For the previous Drone 100 effort, Intel's programmers had to map a path for each drone manually, but the company says the new software can take just about any picture and use algorithms to determine the fastest flight path automatically. "We run through a simulation on a laptop, see how it works, and then load it onto the drones with a click of a button," says Natalie Cheung, drone light show boss at Intel. Intel appears to have no plans actually sell its Shooting Star drone. Rather, it intends to fly them to publicly demonstrate the advantages of using unmanned aircraft in place of conventional pyrotechnics, which include better safety and the potential for more choreographed sequences. But beyond that, the technology demonstrates the advances being made in having autonomous drones work together to pull off certain tasks, something that has real potential to reshape things like construction, city maintenance and military defense.

By Shira Ovide. Added by Agency Staff on 7 November 2016. Saved under Editor's pick Tags: Google, HTC, Lenovo, Microsoft, Samsung, Viv Labs, Xiaomi Tweet The Android operating system for smartphones is one of the most successful technologies ever created. Apple sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software, backed by Google, powers more than 85% of the roughly 1,5bn new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart. That’s because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit — principally Google and Samsung Electronics — are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers. Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi, have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC and Lenovo, are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That’s no longer a given with Android. Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google’s Web search on smartphones. Android was Google’s effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world’s digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones — even on Android phones — the more data is being generating out of Google’s reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google’s efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a start-up working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it’s possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn’t willing anymore. It isn’t unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and PC manufacturers haven’t always been on the same page about the Windows operating system — a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion’s share of the profits, too. In short, it’s hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out. The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond PCs and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn’t even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It’s not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, Web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can’t stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one — the laser disc player of computing.  — (c) Bloomberg LP Share this article Tweet André Schild Excellent analysis! Skerminkel Android is simply becoming too big. It is a fantastic success and the fact that it is open source is probably the single greatest benefit to consumers. Unfortunately progress requires competition and a monopoly not very conducive to that. Andrew Fraser While there is little wrong with the facts presented in the article (except for using Siri on an android phone), I’m not convinced about the conclusions. Yes, Android is big and somewhat fragmented, but Android as such is not Google’s main business. Google is a service business, selling advertising primarily, and all products are designed to supplement that. The Pixel is not the first Google phone, there have been multiple generations of Nexus phones made by manufacturers like Motorola, Huawei, Asus, LG and, yes, even Samsung. And Google doesn’t even make the Pixel, it is manufactured by HTC. Arguing that, because Samsung is considering introducing a voice assistant, that the Android coalition is foundering is specious. Samsung has considered releasing devices without Android in the past using an OS called Tizen, but stopped that project because it couldn’t replace the huge number of services and applications available in the android stable. That hasn’t changed. While every handset manufacturer will try to differentiate their offering, that doesn’t mean that the Android alliance is dying. On the contrary, having multiple companies developing services on the core of Android is healthy for innovation. As Mark Twain may have said – the news of Android’s imminent demise are greatly exaggerated. André Schild Except for the sheer fact that Android doesn’t have just one, single “core” and is as fragmented as dark matter over the entire universe. There are thousands of versions running on even more devices, hence “somewhat fragmented” is quite the understatement 🙂 Andrew Fraser That’s true, but also a bit of a bogeyman argument. Yes there are multiple versions of Android in the wild but what of it? André Schild “Multiple”? Another big understatement 🙂 Fragmentation =-> losing control =-> negative impact on general product quality (security, UX, performance, version management, optimization, versatility etc etc.) Can’t make it any simpler than that 🙂 But that’s just my opinion… Kabelo Mpyatona I agree.

He goes on to reveal that Apple had in fact built several touchscreen prototypes that however didn’t impress Apple executives enough to greenlight the project. The video runs five minutes and twenty seconds long. Federighi is clearly excited for the Touch Bar, the new MacBook Pro’s marquee feature. Other Apple executives went on a PR offensive following the unexpected backlash over some of the controversial MacBook Pro features, like the removal of all ports in favor of USB-C, yesteryear’s Intel Skylake chips that don’t support 32GB RAM and more. Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing boss, recently explained the reasoning behind the removal of an SD card slot while Chief Design Officer Jony Ive defended Apple’s stance on not releasing a touchscreen Mac. I wouldn’t go as far as to call these interviews damage control on Apple’s part. That’s because Apple’s been saying for years that a touchscreen Mac wouldn’t make much sense from a productivity standpoint due to the Gorilla arm syndrome. According to Ive, Apple didn’t feel that the Mac was the right place for a multitouch touchscreen “for a bunch of practical reasons”.

Rolf Bause I have to say: I share Spanish guys view on that matter way more than Craigs 🙂 Jayy Can any spanish speakers tell me the context of that subbed video? I’m curious to know what’s so funny! Lol FFF84 Even so I still think that the touch bar is so gimmicky (and I might be wrong). Because your eyes normally concentrate on the the screen and due to the fact that the touch bar has a dynamic content and you can’t feel it like keys you need to look each time you want to used. I think every one how has a Nintendo 3DS knows what I means. you (or at least I) can never use both screens at the same time or use one while looking at the other. askep3 At the same time, look at the pages/word touch bar usage, it takes the entire tool bar at the top and puts it on the touch bar. Either way you would have looked away from your writing, and moved the mouse to click on something like bold or italics, but now instead you can just tap FFF84 But in my opinion (and personal experience with the 3DS) looking elsewhere on the screen is not as bad as looking on the keyboard. Anyway I might be wrong and testing the bar is the only way to find out. Unfortunately I’m not going to be able to as I decided not to upgrade my mid 2012 mac pro because of the pricing. In Europe base model 13″ with touch bar starts at 1999Euro. 1699 for the one without a bar.

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases eBay’s New Holiday Campaign Captures the Emotion and Excitement of Giving the Perfect Gift SAN JOSE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–eBay (www.ebay.com) today unveils a new holiday campaign, “The Gift They’re Waiting For Is Waiting on eBay,” and debuts television spots on November 9 – marking the brand’s first holiday national television ads in nearly two years. The efforts are part of eBay’s broader holiday mission to help shoppers find perfect gifts for everyone on their list, by offering the best choice and amazing deals all season long. “Our new campaign illustrates why eBay is a top destination for holiday shopping – delivering incredible inventory and inspiration, along with a seamless shopping experience,” said Suzy Deering, Chief Marketing Officer for eBay North America. “As a global marketplace, eBay is the only place to find this year’s most in-demand items, from small and mid-size sellers to top brands like Mattel®, to one-of-a-kind personal or bespoke items. We empower shoppers to be the ultimate gift-givers with our unparalleled selection.” eBay collaborated with the San Francisco-based advertising agency Pereira & O’Dell to develop the new television creative. The marquee spot, titled “The Giver,” takes viewers on the emotional and gratifying journey of finding and giving perfect holiday presents. The marketing campaign also uses digital video, display ads and social media to inspire shoppers looking for unique gift ideas this season. “While the convenience of holiday shopping has increased, the thoughtfulness of gifting has simultaneously decreased,” said PJ Pereira, Chief Creative Officer and Co-founder of Pereira & O’Dell. “The holidays are about spending quality time with family and friends, and the gifts we exchange should reflect these special relationships. eBay is uniquely positioned to help people find perfect gifts for the ones they love, and the new campaign brings this idea to life.” The Gift They’re Waiting For Each year, it becomes increasingly difficult for shoppers to find gifts they truly can’t wait to give. Last year, two-thirds of Americans gave up on their holiday shopping due to a lack of time or inspiration. Even more challenging is that consumers are failing to find great gifts at great prices; 74 percent of Americans surveyed struggled to find deals for the gifts on their shopping lists.1 “In the lead up to this holiday, no single standout gift has emerged, which represents a significant departure from past seasons,” said Hal Lawton, Senior Vice President of eBay North America. “Since shoppers aren’t clamoring for a specific must have item there’s actually more pressure to find perfect gifts. With more than 1 billion listings, only eBay promises unique items and exclusive deals, combined with a cutting edge shopping experience, fast and free delivery, and great service.” Throughout the holidays, eBay will feature some of the most competitive deals on must haves from top brands across electronics, fashion, home and toys: eBay’s Holiday Hub (http://www.ebay.com/holiday) combines gift inspiration with amazing deals and inventory from brands like Mattel® and Sony PlayStation®. Browse and buy the season’s most coveted items – pieces from KENZO x H&M and FENTY x Puma, along with Adidas YEEZY Boosts, an iRobot Roomba, and the Nutri Ninja® – and visit eBay’s Daily Deals page (deals.ebay.com), where 100% of items ship for free. On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, eBay will host a collection of deals exclusively created for mobile shoppers using the eBay app, making it even easier to shop on-the-go. eBay will also introduce a new feature on the Holiday homepage – a countdown clock – to enable shoppers to track when new deals will be released. All season long, eBay will reveal new gift inspiration and innovative ways to shop, as well as one-of-a-kind experiences through eBay for Charity benefitting a variety of causes. Visit ebay.com/holiday for more information. eBay By the Numbers eBay, Inc. has 165 million active buyers worldwide 81% of all merchandise sold on eBay is new, and our wide selection keeps growing ~87% of items sold on eBay are Buy It Now – no bidding necessary Approximately 1 billion listings at any given time 100% free shipping on all items in Daily Deals About eBay eBay Inc.

Methodological Notes1: The eBay Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com) among 1,000 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18+, between October 7th and October 13th, 2016, using an email invitation and an online survey. Quotas have been set to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the U.S. adult population ages 18+. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.

You can also make the case that Red Hat, the leader in Open Source software, saved the CFL because without the Tiger Cats it would have been very hard to sustain the league. Red Hat’s connection to the CFL team does not necessarily begin with its owner Bob Young, the Hamilton-born co-founder of Red Hat. It actually starts with Bob’s younger brother Michael, who was a die-hard Tiger Cats fan. Young bought the struggling team in 2003 out of bankruptcy. The main reason he did it was to honour his brother Michael who died a year earlier from melanoma. But Young had other reasons to acquire the Tiger Cats. He knew growing up in Hamilton what the team meant to the community. And, so he decided to give himself the title of Caretaker instead of President or Owner. And, he told the fans he was willing to incur losses to maintain stability for the franchise for the next generation of fans. Bob Young “The Ticats story is a cute story,” Young admits. But the team’s revival was fueled by Red Hat’s rise starting in 1994. But back in 1994 things were beyond tough for the company. They were in the midst of releasing a new version of the software and it was missing some key management tools needed to give the new version a chance at success. Also there was no sight of any sales. “We had no money,” Young jokes now. The company was in crisis mode and Young was searching for answers. At the same time, Red Hat was open to what Young calls “Love Money Financing”. This is where family members can invest in the company. One of those family members was his brother Michael. “Michael never graduated high school and he would only see the very good in people. My Dad would always worry about Michael and he managed his investments. He too gave me money,” he said. Then in 1998 the breakthrough came as venture capitalists got over their reluctance with Open Source and the company was also boosted by significant investments from Intel and NetScape. Red Hat investors were suddenly looking at an eight times return. But Bob’s brother Michael did not sell, which went against is father’s wishes. Young’s father did end up cashing in his shares at that time, but Michael for some reason held on telling his older brother that he could do more with the company. A year later the bet Michael made on his brother paid off big time. Red Hat went public and the stock rocketed up the charts. That’s when Michael sold his stake in Red Hat. Michael would not survive melanoma cancer. His estate was left to his two brothers. The youngest brother decided to honour Michael who loved comedy by opening a club in Toronto’s entertainment district. And, as luck would have it; when Bob found out about the comedy club the news broke that the Tiger Cats went bust. “Michael was a big Tiger Cats fan and when I got the cheque that same week I could not let my brother down and have his favourite football team pass away too. We are not in this for ourselves but for our community. That is why I bought the Tiger Cats.” Post to Twitter Post to Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share with Google+ More Articles Future Adobe products could let you put words into someone’s mouth Big banks have nothing to fear, but need to learn, from fintech, Salesforce says Tech in Sports CFL, football, Hamilton Tiger Cats, open source, red hat PageBooks - A collection of articles chosen by our editors and compiled into a magazine format designed for our readers.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Prevent Your Computer From Waking Up Accidentally Putting your PC to sleep is a great way to save energy while still making sure you can resume work quickly. But what can you do if your PC keeps waking up on its own? Here’s how to figure out what’s waking it up, and how to prevent it. When you put your PC to sleep, it enters a power-saving state where it shuts down power to most of the PC’s components, keeping just enough power trickling to keep the memory refreshed. This lets you quickly wake the computer back up to the same state it was in when it went to sleep—including any documents and folders you had open. One of the differences between sleep and hibernation is that when a PC is alseep, activity from certain devices can wake it up. Scheduled tasks can also be configured to wake the PC up so that they can run. RELATED ARTICLES PSA: Don’t Shut Down Your Computer, Just Use Sleep (or Hibernation) What’s the Difference Between Sleep and Hibernate in Windows? How to Find Out What’s Waking Your PC Up Before you can fix the problem, you need to determine the problem. There are a few different steps you’ll probably need to take here, as no one solution fits everyone. See the Last Thing That Woke Your PC The first step in figuring out why your PC is waking up before you want it to is determining what’s doing the waking. You can usually figure out what event caused your computer to wake up most recently with a simple Command Prompt command. Start the Command Prompt by hitting Start, typing “command,” and then selecting the “Command Prompt” app. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter: powercfg -lastwake I can tell from the output of the command above, for example, that I used the power button to wake my PC. You may also see listed devices—like your mouse, keyboard, or network adapter—or events like wake timers or automatic maintenance. This won’t always give you the information you need, but often it will. Explore Other Wake Up Events with Event Viewer RELATED ARTICLE Using Event Viewer to Troubleshoot Problems While the Command Prompt command we just talked about is great for showing you what last woke your PC, sometimes you need to go a bit further back in history to see what’s woken it up before. For that, we’ll turn to Event Viewer, a handy logging tool that will help us see when your computer turned off (be that because it was shut down, put to sleep, or hibernated) and when it woke up. To open Event Viewer, hit Start, type “event,” and then select “Event Viewer.” In the left-hand pane, drill down to Event Viewer (Local) > Windows Logs > System. You’ll see a lot of information here, but don’t worry. You don’t need to read through or attempt to understand everything going on in the log. We’re going to filter it to just the stuff we need to look at. Right-click the “System” log and choose “Filter Current Log.” In the Filter Current Log window, on the “Event sources” drop-down menu, select the “Power-Troubleshooter” option and then click “OK.” Back in the main Event Viewer window, you’ll see that we’ve filtered out the hundreds of messages that aren’t relevant to our problem and honed right in on the thing we care about: when the computer is waking up from a low-power state. In the new filtered view, you can scroll through every instance where your computer has woken over the duration of the log (which should be hundreds of entries). What you should focus on is the time the event was logged (did it wake at a time you were at the computer or was it a random middle-of-the-night wake up call) and what Wake Source is indicated. If the Wake Source says “Power Button,” that indicates that the power button on the PC was pressed to wake it up—an action you most likely took yourself. If the Wake Source says something like “Device–HID-Compliant Mouse (or Keyboard),” that indicates the PC is configured for key presses and mouse movements to wake it. If the Wake Source lists your network adapter, that indicates your PC is configured so that incoming network activity can wake it up—something that’s useful if you like having your PC go to sleep but still need it available to other network devices at times. If the Wake Source says “Timer,” it means that a scheduled task woke the computer. The source information usually includes some indication about the task that woke the PC. For example, in the previous screenshot, I can tell that my PC was woken up in order to do a scheduled restart after an update. You may also see something like “Wake Source: Unknown,” which is a bit more cryptic but at least it tells when the PC was awoken. Once you’ve established that there is in fact a pattern of odd computer wake up calls and you’ve identified the source, it’s time to do something about it. How to Stop Your PC From Waking Up Randomly Hopefully, one of the above tricks helped you figure out what’s waking your PC. Now, it’s time to solve the problem. Skip down to the section that applies to your situation. Limit Hardware Devices That Can Wake Your PC As you probably noticed from looking through Event Viewer logs, there are four primary hardware devices that can wake your PC: mice, keyboards, network adapters, and power buttons (or laptop lids if that’s what you’re using). You can easily view a complete list of the hardware devices allowed to wake your PC with a Command Prompt command. Open up a Command Prompt window and run the following command: powercfg -devicequery wake_armed In this example, I’ve got several devices that are allowed to wake my PC, including an Intel Ethernet adapter, two keyboards (I switch between regular and gaming keyboards), and a mouse. Whatever your setup, now that you know what devices can wake your PC, you can head over to Device Manager to tell them not to. We’ve covered in detail how to prevent your mouse from waking your PC and how to prevent network activity from waking your PC. So, in our example here, we’ll be preventing the keyboard from waking the PC. Why would you want to do this? One word: cats. (This should, however, work for other devices that may be waking your computer—not just keyboards.) RELATED ARTICLES How to Stop Your Mouse from Waking Up Your Windows PC How to Stop Network Activity from Waking Your Windows PC Open Device manager by pressing the Windows key, typing “Device Manager,” and then pressing Enter. In the Device Manager window, locate the device you want to prevent from waking your computer. It will have the same name as it does in the output of the powercfg command you just ran. Right-click the device and select “Properties” from the context menu. On the “Power Management” tab of the device’s properties window, disable the “Allow this device to wake the computer” option and then click “OK.” While you’ve got Device Manager open, go ahead and disallow any other devices you don’t want waking up your computer. When you’re done, you can exit Device Manager. Disable Wake Timers and Scheduled Tasks The other thing that can wake your PC is a scheduled task. Some scheduled tasks—for example, an antivirus app that schedules a scan—can set a wake timer to wake your PC at specific time to run an app or command. To see a list of wake timers set on your computer, you can use a Command Prompt command. You’ll have to run Command Prompt with administrative privileges for this one. To do so, hit Start, type “command,” and when you see the Command Prompt app, right-click it and choose “Run as administrator.” In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and then press Enter: powercfg -waketimers In this example, you can see I have one wake timer—a scheduled task set to check whether I have any large files queued for downloading so that I can have the downloading happen when I’m not using the PC. You have to choices for stopping this: you can disable that specific wake timer, or disable all wake timers. RELATED ARTICLE How to Automatically Run Programs and Set Reminders With the Windows Task Scheduler If you just want to stop one task from waking your computer, you can uninstall the app that created the task or adjust the scheduled task settings. You can read the full instructions for working with scheduled tasks in our article on automatically running programs with the Windows Task Scheduler, but here’s the short version. Find the task in Task Scheduler, right-click it, and then choose “Properties”. In the Properties window, on the “Conditions” tab, turn off the “Wake the computer to run this task” option. This leaves the scheduled task in place and, if your PC is awake, Windows will run the task. It just won’t wake the PC in order to do it. If you don’t want any programs waking your computer up automatically, you can disable wake timers entirely. To do so open the Power Options Control Panel app it by hitting Start, typing “power options,” and then pressing Enter. In the Power Options window, click the “Change plan settings” link next to the plan you use. In the next window, click the “Change advanced power settings” link. Expand the “Sleep” entry, expand the “Allow wake timers” entry below it, and then set the entries below it to “Disabled.” If you’re on a laptop, you’ll see two entries—“On battery” and “Plugged in”—and you can configure these for different settings if you want. If you’re using a desktop PC, you’ll only see one setting under the “Allow wake timers” entry, as in this example. Note that if you’re using Windows 10, you’ll also have a third option other than just enabling or disabling the wake timer. This option is called “Important Wake Timers Only” and wakes your PC only for major Windows system events like a scheduled restart of your PC outside active hours following a Windows update. You can try setting your wake timers to “Important Wake Timers Only” and see if it solves your problems. If your PC is still waking up more often than you’d like, you can always come back and set wake timers to “Disabled” instead. Prevent Automatic Maintenance From Waking Your PC By default, Windows runs automatic maintenance tasks at 2:00 am every night if you’re not using your computer. It’s also set to wake your PC from sleep to run those tasks. These tasks include things like checking to see if your hard drive needs defragmenting, running system diagnostics, checking for disk volume errors, and more. They are important tasks to have run periodically, but if  you’d prefer that Windows not wake your PC to do it, you can turn that setting off. We’re using Windows 10 as our example here, but you’ll find the settings in the same place in Windows 8 and 7. In Control Panel, switch to icon view and then open the Security and Maintenance app. On the Security and Maintenance page, expand the “Maintenance” section and then click “Change maintenance settings.” On the Automatic Maintenance page, turn off the “Allow scheduled maintenance to wake up my computer at the scheduled time” option. Of course, you can also set the schedule time to something you like better if you want. If you do turn off Windows’ ability to wake your PC to run maintenance tasks, you should still let it run those maintenance tasks occasionally. You can do that by setting the scheduled time to when you’re more likely to have your PC turned on or you can do it manually by clicking “Start maintenance” back on the main Security and Maintenance page. Sleep is a valuable tool for preserving energy while still keeping your PC immediately available when you need it. While you’ll likely want some devices (like your keyboard) and some scheduled tasks to be able to wake up your PC, it’s good to know that you have some tools for investigating why it’s waking up and options for stopping it from happening when you don’t want it to. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (11 REPLIES) November 7, 2016 Steve Kohn Long a lurker at HTG, I'm moved to register just to express admiration for such a well written article. Many thanks to HTG and the author. November 7, 2016 Yu0 Great summary! Just really, it is kind of sad, that this is even necessary. Laptops should really disable all wake-events other than opening the lid and pressing the power button when they are not connected to the power grid. When sleeping on battery, chances are that the battery time will be needed and that the laptop is inside a bag or other storage, where waking risks heat-damage to either the device or its environment. Hence wake-on-battery should be whitelist-based, rather than having to track down the origin of unwanted wake-events. If needed for centralized maintenance in a company, it could still be changed by group-policies. November 7, 2016 Christian M. off-topic, but that cover picture made me laugh a good time! November 8, 2016 Rocky Rodenbach My computer would wake up during the night sometimes, and I figured out through observation it was Windows update that was causing it to come on. It wouldn't initiate, but just wake the computer from sleep mode. Unchecking "Allow this device to wake up the computer" is also helpful especially things like network cards. November 9, 2016 Rob B Excellent article!My power settings should prevent wake timers while on battery, but it does not appear to be working. Using powercfg, it appears that svchost.exe woke the system to run 'Maintenance Activator' last night, waking my laptop (Dell XPS13 running Windows 10) about every 15 minutes and draining the battery in the process. I don't know if that relates to Windows update or McAfee. My guess is that it is related to Windows update, but most of the wake options are greyed out in Task Scheduler. Any suggestions for a fix? November 9, 2016 Walter Glenn @Rob_B: Thanks! I do have a suggestion for you. Windows does automatically run maintenance tasks daily when you're not using your PC. If you would prefer that these tasks not wake your computer, you can make that happen. In Control Panel (category view), go to Security and Maintenance. Expand the Maintenance section and click "Change maintenance settings." Here, you can choose the time maintenance tasks run and also turn off the option to wake your PC to run them. I should probably add that to the article UPDATE: I did add it toward the end of the article if you want better guidance with screenshots! November 10, 2016 Yu0 Had the issue today again. In the evening, I closed the laptop, sending it to standby. In the morning I put it into the bag. Halfway in the tram I had to open the bag, because it was smelling of burnt dust. Thankfully it didn't actually damage anything though. Really, I see no good reason to allow a laptop to wake from sleep by default when not connected to a power-supply. At best it wastes battery when needed otherwise, at worst it is a fire hazard. November 10, 2016 Yu0 By any chance, do you use Google Chrome? I noticed that something sleep is prevented entirely, until Chrome is closed. The device will go to sleep, but will wake up right away. November 11, 2016 Keith R. Starkey Great, great, article. Since of of those major updates for Win 10, I've had problems left and right trying to get my system to both sleep/hibernate and then stay that way. This article will help a lot. Thanks! November 13, 2016 Sean Ivo Regardless of how your computer wakes up, there are programs out there that can ensure it goes back to sleep. One example is MollieSoft WinSleep, which uses cpu/disk/network usages to put it to sleep when it is under-utilized, on a time schedule. Got Feedback?

Here are six gadgets which could be a reality in the future....Read more 2 / 7 Wireless charging for laptops While we have wireless charging available for smartphones, tablets and even smartwatches, it has not been introduced for laptops. The reason behind this was that the tech is not powerful enough to charge a laptop battery as fast as a wired charger -this means it will take a long time to charge the large battery that laptops use. However, the technology has improved over the years to deliver a faster charge. Intel recently showed off its wireless charging solution for laptops that delivers four times more power than a standard wireless charging mat. This means your laptop will charge as you place it on your desk. Another company called WiTricityhas tied up with Dell for wireless charging solutions -- Dell showed a demo of the tech last month at Computex 2016. Although we don't have a fixed date of when this feature will be available for laptops, it looks like we might get it as soon as next year....Read more 3 / 7 Self-driving or autonomous cars The issue with self-driving cars is that they rely on precise virtual maps for directions that are difficult to create on a large scale. Self-driving cars use a LIDAR system that scans the area around the car to generate a 3D map that works in conjunction with maps for an accurate drive and aids in avoiding any collisions. Google's self-driving car project has been around for a few years and they have also been successfully testing them in San Francisco since last year. Google aims to offer this technology to users by 2020. Going a step further, Tesla has already added self-drive capabilities to their cars which are available for users to buy from October 2016 itself. Ford has also tied up with BlackBerry to provide software for their autonomous cars that are expected to be launched by 2021....Read more 4 / 7 Keyboards & touchpads with OLED screens Many computer users still prefer to use a keyboard and touchpad compared to a full-touchscreen interface. Having a touchscreen does have some advantages -- you can use gestures for control, easily select an item via a tap and improve your productivity via multitouch. Apple included a touch-sensitive OLED display on the new Macbook Pro -- the display can show you contextual buttons depending on the app you use. Apple might introduce a keyboard for its iMac systems with a similar touchbar soon. Lenovo launched its Yoga book laptop few months back also that has a touchscreen panel instead of a physical keyboard that can be used with fingers or with a stylus. In the future we can expect more devices to offer this kind of hybrid physical and touch input now that Apple has started the trend....Read more 5 / 7 Modular phones, TVs and gaming consoles Most of us would have heard of modular smartphones -- Google tried this out but has now shut down the project while others such as the Fairphone are available. In India, we have the Motorola Moto Z and MotoMods. It's safe to assume that we will see more modular phones in the future. The idea did not stay confined to the phones -- Xiaomi announced a modular SmartTV last year with the Mi TV 3. The Mi TV 3 has two components -- a display panel and a removable TV bar that houses the speakers and hardware for smart functionality which can be upgraded when needed. While other brands have not followed suit to Xiaomi, we are hoping that the idea will pick up sooner or later. The latest in modular devices is the Nintendo Switch -- a gaming console that can be used standalone or docked into a station to work like a TV console. Even the controllers are modular -- you can attach them to the Nintendo switch in stand-alone mode to act as a game-pad with left and right control, use them wirelessly for motion control like the Nintendo Wii controllers or even as individual controllers for multi-player gaming sessions. Going ahead, more and more categories of devices are expected to experiment with this kind of modular form factor....Read more 6 / 7 ​Toys that interact with you Board games are now a passe -- more and more children are being exposed to digital entertainment early on. This is why toys are also evolving from the standard boring versions to a smart interactive toys that use a simple form of artificial intelligence. A great example of this is the Anki Cozmo -- a palm-sized robot that can identify and speak out names of its user. It works with an app and you can play various games using it -- Cozmo has daily challenges to accomplish in the games you can play with it making this robot toy reminding you to play and interact with it. There are other interactive toys also available that are not as smart as Cozmo -Sphero BB-8 and Vortex robot are also interactive toys that show how toys have evolved for the tech-savvy generation of today. With AI being one of the major areas of focus for a number of companies, we expect more smart toys to launch in the coming years -you just might have your personal `Wall-E' by 2020....Read more 7 / 7 ​Hardware for your touchscreen devices Touchscreen are now common on many devices that we use, be it laptops, phones, wrist wearables, car audio systems and even home appliances. However, only a few devices offer precision touchscreen interaction ­- a few examples include the Samsung Note series of phones and tablets, Wacom tablets, Apple iPad Pro and high-end laptops that use Wacom technology for pen input. The use of precise touchscreen control is not just limited to professionals anymore with more and more users now preferring this technology for device interaction. Microsoft showcased the new Surface Dial at its October event -- this is a small dock that works with the Microsoft Surface Studio PC's touch-screen to offer advanced multi-touch functionality.

Master Herald Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Menu Sports Technology TV Social Cars Politics Middle East Pulse Features, News And Update Rumors For Apple MacBook Air 2017, Will It Support Up To 32GB Of RAM? Let’s See Posted By: Arash FekriPosted date: November 08, 2016In: Technology Page 1 of 212» It is expected that a new MacBook Air will launch sometime next year in spite of rumors suggesting that Apple has discontinued the entire lineup. Several reports suggest that the device which was dubbed the MacBook Air 2017 will make a debut next year, hopefully in March. Currently, tech experts and fans are looking forward to the release of the new iPad Pro version. There have been a lot of rumors surrounding the iPad Pro along with its probable successors, and the idea of a new MacBook has been discarded. It is yet to be confirmed that Apple has discontinued the Air series of laptops. MacBook Air series received the last major update back in 2015, and even though it received an update this year, it’s not that significant. The new MacBook Pro 2016 was released last month, but news about the MacBook Air 2017 has not been revealed. According to MacWorld UK, the minor upgrade in 2016 could probably signal the release of a major one next year. Considering that, a 2017 release is still possible for the MacBook Air 2017. In the meantime, WCCFTech revealed that MacBook Air 2017 is happening, but the laptop is expected to be the last entry in the series. An impressive update was not received by the current model, and there isn’t a lot that the company can do to the device because of limitations with dimensions. Considering that, MacBook Air’s legacy of being the thinnest ever laptop could soon be over. However, other reports suggest that it will be lighter and thinner compared to its predecessor. The specifications will be improved, and new batteries should be included on board. It will also come with a cooling module and improved chassis. The device could feature a USB Type-C connection as well. Take all this information with a pinch of salt since the specs, and rumored features are all based on guesses and speculations. It is recommended that you wait for official updates from Apple. Meanwhile, Ming-Chi Kuo, the famous KGI Securities Analyst expects that there will be price cuts for both new and old MacBooks in 2017 along with a refresh which adds 32GB of RAM and more. He also believes that the plethora of USB Type-C devices and software which takes advantage of the Touch Bar will become more advanced, thereby exciting more users. Kuo also expects that refreshed MacBook Pros will be launched in the second half of 2017 and will include support for 32GB RAM. Kuo also mentions that this is dependent on whether the Cannonlake processors are launched by Intel. Many customers have reported that the new MacBook which runs on Skylake processors continues to max out with 16 gigabytes of RAM and also costs more than previous-generation models. Phil Schiller, the Apple marketing chief told in an email to David, a MacRumors reader that if Apple makes a notebook with more than 16GB of RAM, it will start consuming a lot of power. Schiller said during an interview that price is something they care about but the company focuses more on designs for experience instead of price. Kuo expects that the 12-inch MacBook and new MacBook Pros will undergo price-cuts, it is unclear whether Apple will introduce support for a maximum of 32GB RAM for the MacBook 12-inch variants, besides the MacBook Pro.

Excelsior JET Control Panel screenshot Excelsior JET Embedded is a complete implementation of the Java SE Embedded technology, enhanced with an Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) optimizing native code compiler. It helps vendors of Java-powered devices protect their intellectual property and improve the run time characteristics of their Java code. When run on traditional JVMs equipped with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers, Java applications are known to start slowly and exhibit bad response times until the JIT compiler kicks in and compiles the performance-critical pieces down to native code. These may be non-issues for a server-side enterprise application that runs for many days on a cluster of multiprocessor servers. In the context of an embedded device, however, fast application startup and immediate demonstration of short, consistent response times are often among the top requirements. An AOT compiler enables embedded Java developers to circumvent the restrictions of their target hardware. "AOT compilation not only reduces the startup time of Java applications and eliminates the "JIT non-determinism", as one of our prospects has put it, but also makes reverse engineering of application code much more expensive, which is good for security and intellectual property protection," said Dmitry Leskov, Excelsior's Director of Marketing. The ARM architecture flavors initially targeted by Excelsior JET Embedded are ARMv7-A with VFPv3-D16 extension or better, and 32-bit ARMv8-A. Future versions will also support 64-bit ARMv8 CPUs; support for the lower-end processors will be driven by customer demand. Excelsior JET Embedded 11.3 for Linux/ARM and Intel-based platforms is available for evaluation and purchase immediately direct from Excelsior at https://www.excelsiorjet.com/embedded. Pricing depends on the customer's choice of a support plan and project parameters. Excelsior is an Oracle Java Licensee, so, on the one hand, its product has passed the official compatibility test suite and includes Oracle's implementation of the Java SE Platform API, but, on the other hand, the use of a licensed Java implementation in an embedded device requires paying per-unit royalties to Oracle. Also released today is Excelsior JET 11.3 for desktop and server platforms based on Intel CPUs: https://www.excelsiorjet.com/evaluate About Excelsior LLC Excelsior LLC provides advanced Java-compatible solutions and software development services with particular focus on optimizing compilers, high performance runtime environments, and the Java technology. Excelsior is a Java Authorized Licensee. The company's flagship product, Excelsior JET, is a complete solution for acceleration, protection, and deployment of Java applications.

Microsoft Corp on Tuesday unveiled a larger but lighter version of its Surface Pro tablet as it ramps up efforts to make an impact on the mobile computing market and counter the popularity of Apple Inc's iPad and MacBook Air laptop. Reuters/Brendan McDermid Microsoft is reportedly developing the next generation Surface Phone patiently and it is expected to be for the mass market. The phone could be launched in 2017. In fact, reports suggest that Microsoft could be launching three smartphones from the Microsoft Surface Phone line-up. It was reported back in January that Microsoft had registered SurfacePhone.com domain name and information about the launch of three new smartphones in 2017 is based out of this domain registration. The Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 would be Microsoft’s yet another attempt to make a mark in the smartphone segment especially after the failure of the Windows phones. However, this time Microsoft has been able to establish the Surface brand name and is reportedly bringing a host of specs and features in the Surface Phone. If rumours are to be believed, the basic version of the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 will have a 4GB RAM while the premium variant will sport an 8GB RAM. There is also a possibility that the Surface Phone will have Intel’s Kaby Lake processor, liquid cooling tech, USB port and also 5.5 inch Active-Matrix Organic Light-emitting Diode display. There have been a lot of speculation regarding the top features the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 will have such as the rumoured 20MP Carl Zeiss primary camera, compass, proximity sensor, barometer and fingerprint scanner. There have been reports stating that the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 may also have a fingerprint scanner embedded on the display. This is a trend that is fast catching up. As per WCCF Tech, Microsoft is looking to consolidate the Windows 10 platform via the Surface Phone 2017. It is being designed strictly for business, some tech enthusiasts believe. There is no word on why the launch of the smartphone has been delayed. Many believe that it is due to the Kaby Lake chipset that Microsoft is waiting for. However, there has been no word from Microsoft. Some rumours suggested that the Microsoft Surface Phone 2017 will be able to run both iOS and Android apps on Windows 10 with minimal coding, known as “Bridge Solution.” Submit Correction 0 0 0 Related Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to get 4K/UHD display?

If youve dabbled with Linux distros in the past, then youve likely heard of KDE before. KDE stands for K Desktop Environment and its one of the main desktop environment options (next to GNOME) that can be used on Linux distros. KDE e.V. is a registered non-profit organization that represents the KDE community when in legal and financial matters. The team behind this organization has just announced a new, open source smartphone OS called Plasma Mobile. The team describes Plasma Mobile as a way to turn your smartphone into a fully open hacking device, just like a PC. Those of you who have used KDE in the past might be familiar with the Plasma workspace by the name KDE Plasma. KDE Plasma is available for desktops, netbooks, media centers for TVs, tablets and now mobile devices. If offers an adaptable user interface and in the future it will also offer a rapidly-maturing software system that is developed with an open life cycle. The software has built the Plasma workspace into it, and offers KWIN/Wayland and Voicecall/Ofono while also integrating Plasma Apps, Plasma Widgets, Ubuntu Touch Apps and the possibility of installing Sailfish and Nemo Apps. Plasma Mobiles development team will be aiming to run many Qt/GTK/X11-based applications on the OS, and hope to implement package installation via the apt-get install packagename command. The platform will utilize libhybris on ARM devices while opting for DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) on Intel devices. As of right now, Plasma Mobile only supports the Nexus 5 and the OnePlus One, along with some Intel-based devices. If you want to try this out on the Nexus 5, Plasma Mobile can be installed as a secondary ROM on your device thanks to MultiROM support. The team describes the state of MultiROM support for the Nexus 5 as Solid (so while it isnt perfect, its past the Experimental state). Be sure to check out their forums if you are interested in trying out the software.

However, the ongoing campaign has faced criticism by human rights groups for its use of internationally banned cluster bombs, which scatter into explosive fragments, and are thus highly dangerous to civilians, and particularly to children. The coalition has been responsible for the majority of the 10,000 deaths in the conflict, including 140 people who were killed when a funeral was targeted in the capital Sanaa in October. Following the release of a 12-second video of the exchange, Yemenis and Saudis took to social media to criticize the remarks both for showing a lack of compassion for Yemeni lives, and a lack of respect for Saudi wives. نحن نقدم دمائنا رخيصة لكي لا تستخف بنا #السعودية أو تهيننا وغيرنا يقبل أحذية حكامها لتهينه وتهيننا اللعنة#السفير_السعودي_بواشنطن_يهين_اليمن— محمد عودين (@m_audin) November 3, 2016 “We offer our blood cheaply, so that #Saudi does not disparage or insult us, and others accept the 'shoes' [an insult in Arabic] of their rule so that they [can] insult them and insult us. #SaudiAmbassadortoWashingtonInsultsYemen” والله مش عارفه هي اهانه لليمن ولا للزوجه السعوديه"كـ متحدث سعودي" الي يتكلم عن ضربها بصوره ضاحكه #السفير_السعودي_بواشنطن_يهين_اليمن— هيـلا (@hyol_ali) November 3, 2016 “I swear, I don't know if this is an insult to Yemen or to Saudi wives, as "a Saudi spokesman" talks about beating with humor. #SaudiAmbassadortoWashingtonInsultsYemen” Moreover, some Saudis suggested that the comments do not represent Saudi Arabia. كان رده بعيداً عن المهنية وقريباً من الوقاحة وهو أبداً لايمثلنا لاشعبياً ولا رسمياً..اليمن منا ونحن منهم #السفير_السعودي_بواشنطن_يهين_اليمن— مُستَقِلٌ (@znklonee) November 4, 2016 “His response was far from professional and close to audacity, and he does not represent us at all as a people or officially... Yemen is us and we are them.” However, others have criticized what they saw as the misrepresentation of Mr Saud’s words, suggesting that his statement was meant to indicate that he felt that he was not being questioned so much as accused.  #السفير_السعودي_بواشنطن_يهين_اليمن بضروف عصيبه يجب اختيار الألفاظ المناسبه الأعداء يتربصون بنا— morad (@almoradi7) November 3, 2016 "#SaudiAmbassadortoWashingtonInsultsYemen In difficult circumstances we must choose the appropriate words as enemies lie in wait for us." Moreover, a longer, six-minute clip, later uploaded to Youtube by Capitol Intel Group, shows the Ambassador accusing the reporter of “coming here with questions you have already in your mind.” This led some to argue that it was aggressive reporting on the part of the Intercept journalist, which pushed the prince to use evasive western political tactics. #السفير_السعودي_بواشنطن_يهين_اليمن التعبير دبلوماسي غربي ليس له علاقة بالإحتقار والتسفيه https://t.co/a1T9Yg9GAkhttps://t.co/UzK6j7FNhi— منصور الشريف (@mansour1956) November 3, 2016 “The comments were just western diplomacy and have nothing to do with humiliation or impudence.” Mr Saud was speaking at the annual Arab-US policymakers conference, which is partly funded by oil companies and arms manufacturers. The US and UK have both come under increased pressure to cease arms sales to Saudi Arabia, as it is feared that western-manufactured weapons are being used to kill Yemeni civilians.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Intel “Windows phone” identified as a prototype Dell mini-tablet with phone features 5 by Surur  @mspoweruser Nov 6, 2016 at 2:32 GMT1 week ago The dream of many of our readers is Windows 10 on x86 in a phone form factor, which can then be used with UWP apps when mobile and docked for the full Windows desktop experience. It seems some-one did not think this was a complete fantasy, as Brad Sams from Thurrott.com has revealed the above device, leaked by Evan Blass, was an early Dell prototype of full Windows 10 running in a smartphone form factor, but with cellular connectivity, and that it would have used an early version of Continuum for Phones and a lap dock to enable full functionality. He reports the device was killed when Intel dropped its low-end Atom range but that we may see the idea resurrected with the much vaunted Surface Phone. Do our reader think the time has come to go back to this idea? Let us know below. Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News eBay’s New Holiday Campaign Captures the Emotion and Excitement of Giving the Perfect Gift National television ads feature the incredible gifts that can only be found on eBay, and inspire shoppers to give thoughtfully this holiday season SAN JOSE, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–eBay (www.ebay.com) today unveils a new holiday campaign, “The Gift They’re Waiting For Is Waiting on eBay,” and debuts television spots on November 9 – marking the brand’s first holiday national television ads in nearly two years. The efforts are part of eBay’s broader holiday mission to help shoppers find perfect gifts for everyone on their list, by offering the best choice and amazing deals all season long. “Our new campaign illustrates why eBay is a top destination for holiday shopping – delivering incredible inventory and inspiration, along with a seamless shopping experience,” said Suzy Deering, Chief Marketing Officer for eBay North America. “As a global marketplace, eBay is the only place to find this year’s most in-demand items, from small and mid-size sellers to top brands like Mattel®, to one-of-a-kind personal or bespoke items. We empower shoppers to be the ultimate gift-givers with our unparalleled selection.” eBay collaborated with the San Francisco-based advertising agency Pereira & O’Dell to develop the new television creative. The marquee spot, titled “The Giver,” takes viewers on the emotional and gratifying journey of finding and giving perfect holiday presents. The marketing campaign also uses digital video, display ads and social media to inspire shoppers looking for unique gift ideas this season. “While the convenience of holiday shopping has increased, the thoughtfulness of gifting has simultaneously decreased,” said PJ Pereira, Chief Creative Officer and Co-founder of Pereira & O’Dell. “The holidays are about spending quality time with family and friends, and the gifts we exchange should reflect these special relationships. eBay is uniquely positioned to help people find perfect gifts for the ones they love, and the new campaign brings this idea to life.” The Gift They’re Waiting For Each year, it becomes increasingly difficult for shoppers to find gifts they truly can’t wait to give. Last year, two-thirds of Americans gave up on their holiday shopping due to a lack of time or inspiration. Even more challenging is that consumers are failing to find great gifts at great prices; 74 percent of Americans surveyed struggled to find deals for the gifts on their shopping lists.1 “In the lead up to this holiday, no single standout gift has emerged, which represents a significant departure from past seasons,” said Hal Lawton, Senior Vice President of eBay North America. “Since shoppers aren’t clamoring for a specific must have item there’s actually more pressure to find perfect gifts. With more than 1 billion listings, only eBay promises unique items and exclusive deals, combined with a cutting edge shopping experience, fast and free delivery, and great service.” Throughout the holidays, eBay will feature some of the most competitive deals on must haves from top brands across electronics, fashion, home and toys: eBay’s Holiday Hub (http://www.ebay.com/holiday) combines gift inspiration with amazing deals and inventory from brands like Mattel® and Sony PlayStation®. Browse and buy the season’s most coveted items – pieces from KENZO x H&M and FENTY x Puma, along with Adidas YEEZY Boosts, an iRobot Roomba, and the Nutri Ninja® – and visit eBay’s Daily Deals page (deals.ebay.com), where 100% of items ship for free. On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, eBay will host a collection of deals exclusively created for mobile shoppers using the eBay app, making it even easier to shop on-the-go. eBay will also introduce a new feature on the Holiday homepage – a countdown clock – to enable shoppers to track when new deals will be released. All season long, eBay will reveal new gift inspiration and innovative ways to shop, as well as one-of-a-kind experiences through eBay for Charity benefitting a variety of causes. Visit ebay.com/holiday for more information. eBay By the Numbers eBay, Inc. has 165 million active buyers worldwide 81% of all merchandise sold on eBay is new, and our wide selection keeps growing ~87% of items sold on eBay are Buy It Now – no bidding necessary Approximately 1 billion listings at any given time 100% free shipping on all items in Daily Deals About eBay eBay Inc.

Methodological Notes1: The eBay Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research (www.wakefieldresearch.com) among 1,000 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18+, between October 7th and October 13th, 2016, using an email invitation and an online survey. Quotas have been set to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the U.S. adult population ages 18+. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.

Today, China has passed new cyber security laws requiring service providers and internet company to record users' personal data, Samsung's forthcoming S8 phones will include a new digital assistant by the creators of Siri, Turkey has blocked access to social media in the wake of political arrests and more.

China passes new cyber security laws China has brought in new laws that require providers of online messaging and other services to record personal data about users and censor content (TechCrunch). Service providers will be required to record the real names of users when they register, censor "prohibited" content transferred using their services and store data within China's borders. Sophie Richardson, director of Human Rights Watch China, says that the broadly stated law could apply to a surprisingly wide range of companies and that it "will effectively put China’s Internet companies, and hundreds of millions of Internet users, under greater state control."

Samsung's new digital assistant to feature in Galaxy S8 Samsung has confirmed that its forthcoming Galaxy S8 smartphone will feature a new AI-driven digital assistant service to rival Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa (Reuters). The news follows Samsung's October acquisition of Viv Labs, founded by members of the team that first developed Siri. While it's not immediately clear what services will be on offer through Viv, Samsung Executive Vice President Rhee Injong said that "developers can attach and upload services to our agent. Even if Samsung doesn't do anything on its own, the more services that get attached the smarter this agent will get, learn more new services and provide them to end-users with ease." 3. Turkey blocks social media as arrests continue Turkey has once again blocked social media nationwide, coinciding with the latest in a string of arrests of opposition politicians and journalists (Ars Technica). The social media blocks were first reported by the Turkey Blocks monitoring service on Friday. Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube have all been affected. 4. Apple cuts the price of USB-C adaptors In response to the furore prompted by the new MacBook Pro's sparse selection of ports, Apple has reduced the price of its adaptors and dongles (BBC). The most broadly useful is a USB-C to USB adaptor, allowing you to connect standard USB devices to the new computers' ports. Previously priced at $19, it's been reduced to $9, as have other connection devices, including a Lightning to USB-C cable required to plug an iPhone into the new laptops. Apple said that "we recognize that many users, especially pros, rely on legacy connectors to get work done today and they face a transition. We want to help them move to the latest technology and peripherals, as well as accelerate the growth of this new ecosystem."

Samsung's washing machines are 'exploding' Just as the furore around Samsung's 'exploding' Galaxy Note 7s starts to die down, more than 2.8 million of the company's top-loading washing machines are being recalled in North America following injuries, including an alleged broken jaw caused by the tops of the machines coming loose (WIRED). The official recall, by the Consumer Product Safety Commission says: "Samsung has received 733 reports of washing machines experiencing excessive vibration or the top detaching from the washing machine chassis. There are nine related reports of injuries, including a broken jaw, injured shoulder, and other impact or fall-related injuries." It goes on to explain that the recall involves 34 models of Samsung top-load washing machines and lists the model numbers directly affected by the recall.

The company will continue funding growth-stage companies, while sister company GV (formerly Google Ventures), focusses on startups, and its web portfolio reveals that previous CapitalG investments included SnapChat. In a tweet, CapitalG said that "though our name has changed, our goal remains the same: to make returns-driven investments in leading companies around the world."

A new study published by the American Psychological Association has identified the factors that make a song into an aggressively memorable earworm (Motherboard). Using data from an ongoing survey being run by BBC 6 Music, the University of London and the British Academy, the study found that a successful earworm, such as Lady Gaga's Bad Romance, typically had a fast tempo, "unusual" pitch intervals between notes, used melodies widely found in Western pop music and got a great deal of radio and TV airplay. The most popular earworms in the survey were Bad Romance, Kylie Minogue's aptly named Can't Get You Out of My Head and Don't Stop Believin' by Journey. Kelly Jakubowski of Durham University said that "our findings show that you can, to some extent, predict which songs are going to get stuck in people’s heads based on the song’s melodic content.

No filter no BS no stone left unturned this time for pigskin critics from Gabriel Allred seat. RNC on Sports Radio WEEI. It and. And and the yeah I should change. Last couple things articles on days until 1230 feet immigrant rights and broadcast studio and time now for. It's depicted the reds he's working great feeling gotten up that it's wise sports and finished eighth in the locker biggest super contest that here. I've 2000 people like cool. 55. I think we're widget good last week that propagated retreat keyboard this week I saw bad. Did you tricky aborted. You know I would charge only what a bat like I wish I just got to take an hour our conversation. Just stop all bought into my bookie had nothing else I do get to be like if I told you are getting better editing else. Besides what I gave other show last week but. Ya ya what you're such an early Eagles are blowing now late muddy lie in that occurred we want Biden won last week show hopefully keep his role in this week. They're quick question for wanna know how USA handicap or take into account a stat. Like Eli Manning being won it eight in his last nine games as old. Against the Philadelphia Eagles how would that affect your judgment. You know what I've got one of these guys I know I haven't numbers guy but I warmest spot in this situation better. I believe in stocks notch French and I think I did a lot when somebody who wanted against the football even called that just I it's been a socket. Tony Romo worker hasn't been a good old favorite it's not a trend. It just fine. You know some of the strategy get into ya wanna wind blocked what mile an hour you're wearing Red Sox and red. And blue Jersey and figure out and it's like all right guys let's you know. You know I didn't personal and direct and honest on the I would talk about this earlier in the week actually create. I don't hold virtual divisions in the National Football League in which history repeats itself as much as it does. Be it ceased. And the NFC east. It's just it's a cycle like musical chairs here I'll be the goal always when a New York the giants always went. In Philadelphia the giants always women in Washington get direct and always way America the cowboys all agreed to reds games. It's like history repeats itself saying earlier in the air FC east. You know as part of it has to pick winners in this stop there either we got a little bit but got out that the talks topple ball game. Blog I'd do we with the Philadelphia Eagles I want my topics I didn't make the it beg your shot last year last year we were just systematically mentally into three into every week. A major sort got it up would be added you know we ended up crushing hit aggression this year a little proper to contest like coming to the contest up. A 12 teams one of their team that we are we get last year. I mean it's just tanking camp library to save our lives and the other one on one to nineteen and one. Australia doing better look blocked and I am in a contest dubbed and we're still in this thing I've made it out so discreet. Do we we got a couple of really sneaky good this Chris pressed by the we got a couple really sneaky good teams this week quote what stands out for you the most. About the way some of these matchups stack up going into a corner of the day's action. You guys I look I'm looking at the Carolina Panthers are right now currency and I don't think this team. I think this game has been leopard debt but we've seen this team rattle off consecutive victories in a row. This game is more than capable we saw last year was shot beer or when they won what seven of the last eight games seven of the last nine down the stretch. I think this is almost this season I don't I mean you know week this week you know what pops up boy Puerto worked initially thought I played point guard here. And their standings don't really mean anything it's almost like college football polls everyone freaked out last week when a natural oh yeah. You know put in Jersey last year guy to only one team could only one game that weren't the original ranking get it up playing in the black ops right. And I think we're at this point now where it's almost like why were up late ruler only god should be doing literature to beat Dallas it's gonna be no way no England went in the actually bought. Would you kind of ceased a lot culprit. A new book about the patient neglect as streaky they are capable of losing your a couple of games that are. You look at the raiders. To an article raiders' locker call operators are flawed. Tell you what the Broncos are one of my top critics shut tonight the other raiders and Jimmy internal better than the chargers figure properties or should do. And caught a break ever differential guy's point differential twelve points. Truly gauge their odd item I like Denver a lot so to me encrypted procedure and that finding. Week did this week you really are similar situation. Other we can go down the list you know what I would arrive to the poverty years like coach ourselves shut your what your record says you are. I think you are what you are today I really believe this year I think there's shot. You're here really adjusting to as far as the standings and I don't batting guy I have the standings are relevant or they can make it could team to win great teams cover. Luka up standing like are covered the point spread but it's hardly stand to conservatives are huge week guys. So illness this gamers getting back the Broncos raiders games you like democratic they're plus one right out even without Talib and Harris play you still like their chances. I really do I really do it won't be replaced actually black sweet and would the idea she defensive player of the week. A bigger deeper to back good. When you delve into the numbers here you look at the raiders. This is what I machine. Football soared well. You know shade of perception of reality. In which it apparently took last year you gonna get a player Roger struggle last year. Yeah it was appropriate for yards shorter and also would hurt blah blah and it was under Green Bay Packers shocked the other killer meet all the data to kill a white banners seagate. Roger detail of my Spanish speaking population is kilowatt anti gay band that organic search for quality computer club won a playoff game. They didn't shock. So here we are this situation. Because David cars out there he saw on per Euro 400 yards or used bought or it ought strategy port Purcell great. There are so great report give the numbers here a little bit. The raiders and Broncos sooners got about our stretched. Everyone water writers like you better off that's not even close Trevor certainly had and David not even close. Well you're the differential is two point Doug seven point two gained two point jump what you did the raiders are scoring 26 points a game. 26 point nine the Broncos are scored 44 point two towards get the rumors about 25 point game got. The other group the winning differential 4625. Specter seat and averaged. The Broncos give up seventeen. Points per game they lost last year when the Broncos sort out the little QB situation. Bill they they were caught napping but they're all this year he's been one H I ate a lot Canton is about to recover data a lot of times. They've got the book the raiders are the Broncos attention tonight they are and all the talk with a box call GAAP. You know you don't want to leave you heard your car locked in a parking lot when you're not scared to go and their plight selling you out though that some dominant home field advantage to have democracy topic though they know every year there at all no they're not. So there's going to be a couple of dude just like dark greater a year ago. Hulu the senator's career everything with respect with cable RC from sport straight TV dot com and FA NTS wise it's at an estate blessed you are the biggest super cut us at 2000 people. A cable some of the other couple of Europe a top plays and I wanna ask you about the colts and Packers while it looked like you want your top placement it was a couple of games to really like today. I like to Denver Broncos allot to it I'll hopefully we have a nice shot strong today and I'm gonna do it every Smart guy will do to take all the money got mating call Ali had an apartment and I. I can Dick winters got money management is not quite scale I. Upload out of Minnesota Vikings into Detroit Lions game guys. That Minnesota Vikings these guys were the coolest kids on the block rendered Albert nineteen go up 41 all Gabe doesn't two weeks ago while I was dead and this is now and we all met winning and losing is contagious is a fine line between where you lose Norv Turner resigned this week. I don't I don't ever call option rumors offense ever lighting it up anywhere he'd ever be able or really can't run the ball all they can't protect Sam Bradford. I think the point spreads too high here. I think Minnesota is going to be an adult like just when this came out right spot. A particular Detroit Lions. Plus bishops are a little sprinkle on the Moneyline. In a cluster twenty range out what solid I think JJ is a winnable football games for the the others want to see. This why and you know this you know this guy. I'm gonna recommend were taken directors Patrick and York jets oh boy and I'm not Michael got Laker LA out of your check this out loud. Your bills that's all you're bills they had so this has developed two weeks wrote you are against your own your team. And you're right now they're saying now they all or nothing nice about this we all know guys. You know demise we golfers struggle within the division they don't win a division against the Buffalo Bills show one back at your age I egos are are good for that. Are they beat up on the Steelers web network Andrew Jones catcher come up on what the Miami Dolphins. Are selling ads you're talking about trends earlier. Let's get him a surge threatens our right now Miami oh and seven against the split in the second of back to back division engaged. Leo a lot of balls for an all against a spread. The raiders career as a dog would bitter division jets' 22 would sport division underdog gets all meiji actual way to go to age fifteen and all against the spread while getting more than three points to lower mark courses database. I mean opt Jimmy. Johnston. And god yacht club the doctor doesn't sort of ball over three times. If jobs are going to be in this game had a project probably won outright regularly report points. Are you finally gable wanna ask you but I mean the colts Packers a total at 53 seems the most obvious play that day the Packers may put up 53 on their own. It's this one of those games were a looks too obvious just to take the over. You know it feels doubt wait doctor I think until lobbyist game in the days of Dallas Cowboys and I'm gonna be staying away from apple Watergate I'll let you know. We've talked about there's an a plus speed actually I wish I occurred updated number but I Ain it's pretty much. Last week there were a couple of games there where mr. Dean Barkley to KC game. Stayed under the numbered Albert 48 Packers Atlanta game was where you'll learn about what went all but you know gathering Intel last week I. There were not in games to which the total was trickier more some of them went over the number and basically like I'm six of those won over by double digits. Sometimes lets not over think change at. We you know and I have been talking about this whole week I I want whoever seven point severed and applicable popular but I'd be encouraged and I'm pretty much of Aaron Rodgers hater but occurred at one are being from the offense. We dollar Dovonte autumn to actually start apply. You know as well this year or strategy got water than to last year actually about receiver. Are right now I loved the over in this game how big over batter eater I'm an optimist preacher. Absolutely if you Olmert. I want to Carolina Pampers other campers are gonna win this week we're gonna win next week they're gonna win a week after. I think in three weeks will be sitting here talking guys go look preparers are our five replied right now. Another big bandage up academic I know what about visual bought. It better Levys are batting about I hope my light street up towards the where it would Landry Jones bought. You ought to under thirteen of the last sixteen games between these two games this shot record for points or less it's almost free money just that she's the underdog to the under. In their series over the years bodyguards spurred a desperate game you know they need to win ball games electric spark to get it done. Bears while also liked all pitched out of Detroit Lions the Denver brought coach the Carolina Panthers. Bambi I Pittsburgh Steelers and a New York Jack that's what I play and mister Carter as we. Are some reggae great stuff is always loved the inspirational for talking to you next Sunday decks were different. Owners talk change our leaders of property like you get it over 176 and a half yards. If Iran over 200 today we got him out to the winners back. No reason why doesn't Russia first 77 yard so we're at least eighty let's go all over our somebody's stick around guys. All right Erika a great couple talk next Sunday effects.
