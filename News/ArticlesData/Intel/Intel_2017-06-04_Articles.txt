Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 6 June 2017 | MYT 6:00 AM Intel has seven trillion reasons why it wants autonomous cars to become the norm Autonomous vehicles could create a new US$7tril (RM29.8tril) economy by 2050. — AFP Relaxnews According to a new study commissioned by Intel and conducted by Strategy Analytics, as consumers transition from driving their cars to being driven by them, it will create something the firms are calling the "passenger economy."  And it could be worth over US$7tril (RM29.8tril) by 2050. That's a very long way off, but even if autonomous driving technological developments continue at their current pace, by 2035, 15 years after the first self-driving cars from mainstream manufacturers are expected to make their production debut, the passenger economy will be a huge US$800bil (RM3.4tril) income stream. "Companies should start thinking about their autonomous strategy now," said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. "Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the Passenger Economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding." As for how the two firms have arrived at the huge financial figures the economy will represent, they estimate that mobility-as-a-service, be it ride hailing, ride sharing or car sharing, will generate US$3.7tril (RM15.7tril) in revenues within the next 30 years, solely among consumers. And when people who would have traditionally had their hands on the wheel have their hands on a mobile device, instead, Intel believes that new apps and services aimed at riders will generate upwards of US$200bil (RM853bil) a year. The report paints a picture of a future utopia where in the US alone, consumers will be US$900bil (RM3.8tril) better off because they no longer need to buy, insure or maintain their own car. Local government will save a combined US$234bil (RM996.6bil) that would have had to be invested in public safety initiatives and systems aimed at curbing traffic accidents. What's more, with no need to park a car, new spaces for commerce, entertainment and relaxation can be built instead, reshaping the urban landscape forever. "Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape, the first green shoots of which will appear in the business-to-business sector," said study co-author Harvey Cohen, president, Strategy Analytics. "The emergence of pilotless vehicle options will first appear in developed markets and will reinvent the package delivery and long-haul transportation sectors. This will relieve driver shortages around the world and account for two-thirds of initial projected revenues." It will also cut congestion and pollution on many major routes, giving back time lost to commuting to many around the world. And, once the technology becomes both proven and affordable to all, Intel expects to see mobile restaurants, clinics and beauty salons spring up that come to the customer's door. But that's just the start, and part of the point of the study is to fire up people's imaginations in order to truly seize a moment that is as significant as the space race in terms of our modern history. "[It] is a rallying cry to the world to put its best minds on this challenge," said Greg Lindsay, urbanist and mobility futurist. "The future of mobility, economic advancement and the emergence of new growth opportunities like the Passenger Economy demand ongoing dialogue." — AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Digi offers a new fleet management solution Sony's PlayStation VR headset sales top one million units Uber culture probe said to extend to handling of India rape case 5 superpowers that makes mum a hero 6 places you must visit in your lifetime Others Also Read Spanish manager Gracia leaves Russia's Rubin Kazan Political historian joins think tank Most sticking with London travel plans advertisement Latest News Digi offers a new fleet management solution Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats Amazon error sends some shoppers to dog photo, not product page Super glitch strikes Philippine bank again Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Most Viewed in Tech Digi offers a new fleet management solution Chinese exam authorities use facial recognition, drones to catch cheats Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with borderless display could land by September Super glitch strikes Philippine bank again Ikea to try selling through third party websites Amazon error sends some shoppers to dog photo, not product page Apple’s two futures: VR is for desktop, AR is for mobile Loophole allows Uber to avoid UK tax, undercut rivals Chinese Apple staff suspected of selling private data Is Facebook CEO Zuckerberg making a run for the White House?

Those machines relied on Intel's Skylake processors instead of the higher-boosting, more-responsive Kaby Lake mobile chips that launched about two months later. Subsequent complaints about performance, limited memory capacity, and battery life from MacBook Pros may have been related to that choice of CPU. Today, Apple is harmonizing MacBooks and iMacs with Intel's latest CPUs by replacing Skylake with Kaby Lake. iMacs now come with Kaby Lake quad-core CPUs ranging up to 4.2 GHz base and 4.5 GHz Turbo Boost clocks. Apple is also taking this opportunity to add its Fusion Drive hybrid storage system to all 27-inch iMacs, and the highest-end 21.5" iMac will also benefit from that upgrade. New iMacs will come with two Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of Thunderbolt 2, and Apple further claims the SSDs in these machines will be 50% faster than those in its outgoing all-in-ones. 21.5" models will top out at 32GB of RAM, and 27" models can take up to 64GB. The latest iMacs will also feature optional Radeon RX 500-series graphics chips. The entry-level 21.5" iMac will rely on its Kaby Lake CPU's Iris Plus graphics, while 4K versions of the 21.5" machine will offer Radeon Pro 555 and Radeon Pro 560 pixel-pushers with up to 4GB of RAM. The 27" iMac will give buyers a choice of the Radeon Pro 570, Radeon Pro 575, and Radeon Pro 580 graphics processors with up to 8GB of RAM. Apple announced that it's partnering with Valve to bring the SteamVR SDK to the Mac, and the new graphics options for the 27" version offer the hardware foundation required to power VR headsets for folks who prefer to create VR experiences in macOS. Other improvements to the iMac line include displays with 10-bit color support (through dithering) and 500-nit maximum brightness ratings. The 21.5" 4K iMac now starts at $1299, as well. On the mobile Mac side of the aisle, the MacBook's infusion of Kaby Lake lets Apple's thinnest and lightest laptop hold low-power CPUs up to a Core i7 with 1.3 GHz base and 3.6 GHz boost speeds. Apple also says the CPU upgrade allows the MacBook to address twice the maximum amount of memory compared to older models. MacBook SSDs should run up to 50% faster than their predecessors, as well. The 13" MacBook Pros get (presumably dual-core) Kaby Lake Core i7s running at up to 3.5 GHz base and 4.0 GHz Turbo speeds, while the 15" models will get quad-core Core i7s running at up to 3.1 GHz base and 4.1 GHz boost speeds. 15" MacBook Pros will also get more powerful discrete graphics chips at the base of the lineup. The 13" MacBook Pro is now more attainable with prices starting at $1299. All of these machines will be available to order today from Apple's online store.

Even if you're not gaming, you should probably update to the new 15.45.19.4670 driver thanks to "important security enhancements" when using the IGPs in Skylake and Kaby Lake processors. Intel is pretty vague about what those enhancements may be. It does go on to say that this driver supports the newly-released Tekken 7 and the upcoming Dirt 4, as well as the aforementioned games. This driver also improves performance in The Division and For Honor, and resolves a bug that was causing extremely long load times in Star Wars: Battlefront, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Battlefield 1. Further bugs bashed in the updated driver include video stuttering in Battlefield 1, audio cut-outs in Skyrim Special Edition, audio issues when using a single display over USB Type-C, and "stability improvements" when using Miracast. Intel also says that Netflix playback should be improved, and that overclocked IGPs should be a little more stable. Finally, the DX9 driver for Windows 10 got some love and should no longer cause artifacting in Unigine benchmarks or apps with D3D9 overlays. As with any driver, there are still a few creepy crawlies hanging around. Intel notes that Euro Truck Simulator 2, Fallout 4, Guild Wars 2, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Assassin's Creed Syndicate, Guilty Gear Xrd, Titanfall 2, and "some DX9 games" might still show artifacts or incorrect graphics. The Division and Batman: The Telltale Series may crash or hang, while PowerDVD on Windows 10 may not show 3D video correctly. HDCP may not work properly after video standby when using a Type-C to HDMI adapter. You can pick up the new driver at Intel's download site, or from a link in the forum post announcing the release. If you go to the download site, Intel cautions users to ignore the notice that "a newer version of this software is available." Folks actively gaming on Intel hardware should check out Intel's gaming site for tweaks and hints on getting games running smoothly on the integrated adapters.

The company's new datacenter-oriented SSD DC P4501s utilize Intel's next-generation NVMe controller in conjunction with 3D TLC flash to reach smaller form factors and power envelopes compared to most many server SSDs. The DC P4501s are available in 500 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB and 4 TB capacities. As is often the case, performance varies with the amount of storage on hand. The smallest model's peak sequential read speed is 2500 MB/s, while its bigger brothers reach peaks of 3200 MB/s. Sequential writes vary substantially, ranging from 300 MB/s for the 500 GB drive all the way up to 900 MB/s for the 4 TB model. Random read IOPS range from 146,000 to 362,000 depending on capacity, and random write IOPS go from 16,200 on the smallest drive to 46,700 on the largest. Endurance ratings range from 650 TB written on the entry-level 500 GB units up to 5000 TB on the 4 TB version.  Intel offers nearly all the DC P4501 drives in both the 2.5" U.2 and M.2 form factors, though the largest variant is only available as a U.2 drive. According to Anandtech, this is Intel's first NVMe datacenter SSD to fit into these formats. The site also says that the new drives perform better than Intel's older DC P4500 and DC P4600 drives models, despite using just 12 channels of 3D TLC NAND instead of the old drives' 18 channels of planar MLC flash. Power consumption is listed as under 5W when idle, and up to 12.5W under load. Intel did not provide pricing or availability information for the SSD DC P4501 drives, but gerbils in the market for these probably don't get them through retail channels anyway. All the drives are covered by a five-year warranty. Tags: Servers Log in | Register Tip: You can use the A/Z keys to walk threads.

The clock frequency has been increased to 1.3 GHz, but Intel’s Turbo Boost technology can temporarily increase the CPU clock speed to up to 3.6 GHz during heavy workloads. Flash storage is now up to fifty percent faster and the notebooks now support up to twice the RAM than before, for up to 16GB of RAM. Configure-to-order options available via Apple’s online store allow you to outfit your new 12-inch MacBook with up to a 1.4 GHz Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6 GHz. The following stock configurations are available: $1,299 MacBook 12-inch 2304-by-1440 LED-backlit display with IPS technology and 16:10 aspect ratio 1.2GHz dual-core Intel Core m3 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.0GHz 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 615 Built-in keyboard with second-generation butterfly mechanism $1,599 MacBook 12-inch 2304-by-1440 LED-backlit display with IPS technology and 16:10 aspect ratio 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.2GHz 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory 512GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 615 Built-in keyboard with second-generation butterfly mechanism “Weighing just two pounds and measuring 13.1mm thin, MacBook is our thinnest and lightest notebook for all-day, on-the-go computing,” says the company.

Iliyan They are still fanless. Intel just renamed the “m” CPUs to “i” with Kaby Lake. Windham Cato Still can’t play good games on a Mac though. Leopoldo Pereira But you can install windows on a Mac. Mallouk Malek Surface pro, cheaper same tech specs. I think now I have finally made my choice to buy the surface pro 😀 Donato Bearint Yea like a surface pro compares to a MacBook. Not even in the same solar system. It’s a laptop, you not suppose to write or touch the screen. If someone wants that that’s why there is tablets. Any PC compared at an apple never compares. Plus when is the last time you ever got a PC to last longer than even three years when a Mac will last five no problem at all. Mallouk Malek Maybe not the same solar system, but if it does exactly what I want then it is the right choice for me no? It is neither a tablet or a computer. “Maybe” if apple actually changed the OS of the iPad I would have got an iPad Pro, but this is not happening any time soon. I did not say that the new MacBooks are not good tho! God, whenever someone says windows here every one get so mad relax guys it’s a persons opinion that’s have no intention to fight here 😀 ! And by the way I’m still using a 2012 windows pc, but all tablets and phones are from apple. Anonymouse I’ve had my Fujitsu S6410 for about ten years now with Windows 7. Only update in 10 years was up to 4gb ram and 512gb ssd. Do you think if I buy the latest Macbook Pro/Air, will it still run in ten years and allow some upgrades? Donato Bearint Yup without a doubt. Especially if you double the strage and update to the latest hardware. EimaiNintzas you do understand that surface pro runs windows right? Mallouk Malek I can’t be that blind right 😀 !?

All MacBook Pro models now include enhanced SSDs, up to 50 percent faster than before. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $1,799. If you need a notebook with a 15-inch display and Touch Bar, that’ll be a cool $2,399, at least. The 13-inchers have Intel CPUs up to 3.5 GHz Core i7 with Turbo Boost up to 4.0 GHz while their 15-inch counterparts include up to 3.1 GHz Core i7 chips with Turbo Boost up to 4.1 GHz. In terms of graphics, the baseline non-Touch Bar model uses Intel’s Iris Plus Graphics 640. The more powerful Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 is powering other 13-inchers without Touch Bar. All models of the 15-inch MacBook Pro have been upgraded to Radeon Pro 555 discrete graphics with 2GB video memory. A Radeon Pro 560 GPU with 4GB memory is available as a build-to-order option on Apple’s web store. Here are the stock MacBook Pro configurations: $1,299 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,499 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 2x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports $1,799 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID $1,999 13-inch MaBook Pro 13.3-inch LED-backlit 2560-by-1600 display with IPS technology at 227PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 3.1GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.5GHz 8GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 512GB SSD storage Integrated Intel Iris Plus Graphics 650 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID $2,399 13-inch MaBook Pro 15-inch LED-backlit 2880-by-1800 display with IPS technology at 220PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.8GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.8GHz 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Discrete Radeon Pro 555 graphics with 2GB video memory 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID $2,799 13-inch MaBook Pro 15-inch LED-backlit 2880-by-1800 display with IPS technology at 220PPI, with 200 nits of brightness and wide color (P3) support 2.9GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.9GHz 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory 512GB SSD storage Discrete Radeon Pro 560 graphics with 4GB video memory 4x USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports Touch Bar and Touch ID The updated machines are available with 1-day shipping, in Silver or Space Gray. It’s worth reiterating that the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro model without Touch Bar now costs $1,299 instead of $1,499. Being a cool $200 cheaper actually makes in comparison MacBook Air a tougher sell as it’s only gotten a faster 1.8GHz Intel chip today.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Apple updates iMac lineup with Kaby Lake chips, better graphics, improved screens 06/05/2017 at 2:00 PM by Brad Linder 4 Comments Apple is updating its iMac line of all-in-one desktops with new models sporting Intel Kaby Lake chips, improved displays, and support for faster graphics, more memory, and speedier storage, among other things. The new models continue to come in 21.5 inch and 27 inch varieties, but the smaller model now supports up to 32GB of RAM and Intel Iris Pls 640 graphics for entry-level models or AMD Radeon Pro 555 or Pro 560 graphics on higher-end configurations. Apple’s new 27 inch iMac supports up to 64GB of RAM, comes with up to 2TB of solid state storage and a Fusion Drive that’s 50 percent faster than other SSDs (according to Apple), and each version supports 10-bit HEVC/H.265 video decoding. The 5K 27-inch iMac is available with Radeon Pro 570, 575, and 580 graphics options, and every new model has two Thunderbolt 3 ports. The new models also have displays that are 43 percent brighter than their predecessors, and which support 1-bit dithering and a billion colors. Among other things, the new iMacs support Apple’s new Metal 2 graphics technology with support for external graphics, Steam VR, and the Unity and Unreal engines. Prices for the new iMac start at $1099. The announcement came during today’s WWDC keynote, where Apple also introduced watchOS 4, Mac OS X High Sierra, and teased an update for Apple TV: Amazon Prime Video support is coming to the TV app later this year. There’s also a new iMac Pro that offers up to an 18-core Intel Xeon processor, and Apple’s MacBook laptop lineup is also getting a spec bump.   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 4 Comments on "Apple updates iMac lineup with Kaby Lake chips, better graphics, improved screens" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Max L L Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

And while Apple continues to update MacBook Air with faster Intel chips and graphics, the latest hardware refresh to the popular notebook leaves a a lot to be desired. The notebook now ships with a faster 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor from Intel—a step up from the previous 1.3 GHz one—but that’s about it in terms of hardware upgrades. It didn’t even get Intel’s Kaby Lake chips, introduced in March. The tech giant briefly mentioned the update during the keynote and made only a passing one-sentence mention in the press released announcing other Mac updates. “Apple today also updated the 13-inch MacBook Air with a 1.8 GHz processor,” reads the release. Here’s the updated MacBook Air lineup. $999 MacBook Air 13-inch non-IPS LCD 1,440-by-900 display 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 6000 $1,199 MacBook Air 13-inch non-IPS LCD 1,440-by-900 display 1.8GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 2.9GHz 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory 256GB SSD storage Intel HD Graphics 6000 Apple hasn’t given the notebook faster SSD storage, nor has it updated built-in graphics, like with today’s updates to other Mac notebooks. It still ships with the pixelated non-Retina display and does not include support for the USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 standard. The 11-inch MacBook Air models were discontinued last October. I love all Mac notebooks, but that MacBook Air has a special place in my heart and I’m saddened that Apple has decided to phase it out, slowly but surely. Until that slim 12-inch MacBook Air gets a decent CPU, I’ll be sticking with my Air. How about you?

So it’s TN? kohyuta Sadly, yes. burge The MacBook is a poor machine compared with the Air ok it’s got a Retina screen but that’s all it has over the Air I’ll be sticking with my Air for at least another year then. And the Pro is over priced for what it brings. Vince Reedy Makes sense to just go with the non touch bar 13″ pro at this point which I don’t think is a bad deal at all. Especially after the price drop and spec bump. Can’t see why anyone would want the 12″ or the air now. cdlenfert Does the 12 inch not have a “decent CPU” now? I’m curious, not being sassy. kohyuta The $1299 MacBook uses an Intel Core m3 CPU which emphasizes power efficiency over performance. Good enough for email and web browsing. It benchmarks slower than the i5 & i7 CPUs in the MacBook Pros, and is roughly equivalent to the i3. You can spend more money for an i5 ($100) or i7 ($250). For my $1299, I’d rather get a MacBook Pro with a 2.3GHz i5 than a MacBook with a 1.2GHz m3.

Apple has major updates in store for the All-in-One computer, including a new iMac Pro, which will become Apples most powerful Mac. But thats coming later, lets start with the new iMacs and also cover the MacBook refresh. iMacs An eye-catching feature - literally - are Apples best displays, ever! They are 43% brighter than the previous generation (up to 500 nits) and feature 10-bit dithering (so 8-bit panels simulating 1 billion colors). These iMacs will be much faster than the previous generation. They use Intels new Kaby Lake processors (which offer higher frequencies and HEVC decoding). Also, you can spec the 21.5 iMac with up to 32GB RAM, the bigger 27 model can go up to 64GB. For storage, you get up to 2TB fusion drives (i.e. HDD+SSD) with SSDs that are up to 50% faster. Graphics got a big boost too. You start of with Intels Iris iGPU, which still offers up to 80% increased performance over the previous generation. For serious work, Apple turned to AMD Radeon Pro 5xx series. The big 27 iMac gets Radeon Pro 570/ 575 or 580 with up to 8GB of VRAM. The top-specced version offers up to 5.5 TFLOPS of computing power, great for VR. The smaller 21.5 iMac gets Radeon Pro 555 or 560 with up to 4GB VRAM. Now for the price. The base 21.5 model starts at $1,100 and if you want a 4K screen, then its $1,300. The 5K iMac Retina starts at $1,800. MacBooks Nothing much to see other than Intel Kaby Lake processors and lower prices. The base MacBook starts at $1,300 (and has up to 50% faster SSD), the base MacBook Pro 13 also stats at $1,300. The big dog, the 15 MacBook Pro, gets faster graphics options and a base price of $2,400. These Macs are up on Apple.com today. iMac Pro Who needs a Mac Pro when an iMac offers better performance and an amazing screen? Note that this is just a sneak peek, the real deal will not be available until December. But heres what you have to look forward to. It shares its outer body and 5K display with the 27 iMac (but comes in an exclusive Space Grey color). However, the internal cooling is much improved thanks to the dual centrifugal fan setup. You can spec the Pro with an Intel Xeon with up to 18 cores! More affordable 8 and 10 core options are available as well. Also, you can stick as much as 128GB ECC RAM and 4TB SSD (3GB/s). The graphics are workstation-grade - the upcoming Radeon Vega with up to 16GB VRAM. It offers 11 TFLOPS in single precision and 22 TFLOPS in half precision - a boon for machine learning. The connectivity on the iMac Pro is as great as you'd expect. Its the first Mac ever to feature built-in 10Gb Ethernet and with 4x Thunderbolt ports, you can feed two external 5K displays and connect two two RAID arrays. Oh, and theres a 1080p FaceTime camera and a UHS-II port. Scared to look at the price? Dont be - the iMac Pro (8-core Xeon, Vega GPU, 1TB SSD) starts at $5,000. Again, this will come out just in time for the holidays at the end of the year.

The 5K models of new iMacs sport the same 5,120‑by‑2,880 pixel resolution and wide color gamut (P3) support like the models they’re replacing. In fact, the previous-generation iMac lineup is no longer sold on Apple Online Store. The new desktops with Retina 4K and 5K displays are available to order today on Apple.com, and available to buy in Apple Stores starting on Wednesday, June 7, with one-day shipping. Using Intel’s seventh-generation Core processors, code-named “Kaby Lake” that were introduced in March 2017, the new iMacs have the clock frequency of up to 4.2 GHz with Intel’s Turbo Boost technology increasing the CPU speed to up to 4.5 GHz during heavy workloads. In the graphics department, the updated iMacs feature the new Radeon Pro 500-series graphics with up to 8GB of dedicated video memory. The 21.5-inch iMac model delivers up to three times faster graphics performance, with the 27-inch models being up to fifty percent faster in terms of graphics than the current generation. The new lineup supports up to twice the memory as the previous generation and SSD storage options are now up to 50 percent faster as well, Apple has said. Speaking of which, Apple’s made its Fusion Drive (a hybrid SSD/HDD drive) standard across all 27-inch iMac configurations and it’s now included by default on the top-end 21.5-inch iMac model, too. The $1,299 21.5-inch iMac model now features a brighter Retina 4K display, an upgrade over the previous 1080p screen, and discrete rather than integrated graphics. And with the macOS High Sierra update due this fall, the new iMacs will deliver even faster graphics performance via Apple’s updated Metal graphics framework for 3D graphics, video editing and gaming.

The company said at its annual WWDC keynote on Monday that it is refreshing the ultra-thin notebook with Intel’s latest “Kaby Lake” processors, which should bring slight boosts to speed and battery life. Along with that, Apple also mentioned the notebook will now get up to a 50% bump in performance to its solid-state drive storage.  If you can afford it, you can also upgrade the boost the MacBook's performance by doubling the amount of memory to 16 GB — previously, you were maxed out at 8 GB.  Finally, Apple also said the MacBook's keyboard has been updated to be more like its equivalent in the MacBook Pro. That means it should feel a bit clickier and more responsive than before. On the whole, though, the pitch here remains the same. You’re still getting a very slim, nicely-built chassis with a high-resolution “Retina” display and a lone USB-C port. Apple still positions the MacBook for people who are okay with good enough performance in a package that’s easy to take on the go. If you want an Apple laptop that’s powerful enough to do heavier work, you’ll have to look to the MacBook Pro. View photos Tim Cook macbook (smaller)More (Apple CEO Tim Cook.Getty) More specifically, the new MacBooks use Intel’s lower-power “Y-series” chips. Those aren’t as strong as the more traditional "U-series" Intel Core chips you’d see in a MacBook Pro — or some Windows laptops around the MacBook’s size — but they've generally improved to the point of respectability over the past couple of years. Kaby Lake is a relatively small upgrade over Intel’s previous generation of chips. It brings minor gains in overall performance and power efficiency, so it's an improvement, but not the most visible one. It works more smoothly with 4K video, too, but since the MacBook’s display isn't that sharp, those increases will likely go unnoticed by the majority of buyers. One pain point critics have had with the MacBook is its webcam, which shoots at a grainy 480p resolution. Unfortunately, that hasn't changed here. Another thing that's stayed the same is price: The MacBook will still start at $1,299 — which will get you a model with a entry-level Core m3 chip and 256 GB of storage — and reach up to $1,949 as you go up the specs ladder. Either way, the notebook is still expensive for the relatively limited power and ports it’s packing; comparable Windows laptops typically go for less. But it is well-made, and with the Mac becoming less and less relevant to Apple’s bottom line, the company's laptop business seems to be focusing exclusively on the high-end. The new MacBook models are available to order through Apple's store now, with retail availability starting on June 7.

X Apple unveils number of upgrades to Mac computers Tech giant also pushes Siri to the fore at annual developer conference Mon, Jun 5, 2017, 20:36 Updated: Mon, Jun 5, 2017, 20:37 Craig Federighi, senior vice-president of software engineering at Apple, during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, on Monday. Photograph: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg         Technology giant Apple upgraded most of its Mac computers on Monday, including a powerful new offering for professional users, showing renewed commitment to a product line that critics say it neglected amid lackluster growth. At its developer conference in San Jose, California, Apple unveiled new iMac desktop computers with brighter displays and faster Kaby Lake chips from Intel Corp and more powerful graphics processing for virtual reality applications. Updates to the 12-inch MacBook and flagship 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros also included Intel’s Kaby Lake processors to make the laptops more efficient, and could result in improved battery life. These computers cost $1,299 to $2,399, the company said. The 13-inch MacBook Air also got a faster processor in a rare update. The iPhone remains Apple’s most important product by far, but the company needs a range of devices to keep consumers locked into its profitable and growing ecosystem of services and apps. That means updating products for some markets that aren’t growing as fast as they once did. The PC market, where Apple is fourth, grew less than 1 percent in the first quarter, compared to a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. Criticised The company’s Mac revenue fell last year, and while well received by many consumers, recent MacBook Pros have been criticised by some longtime Mac loyalists and creative professionals for not meeting some of their needs. Apple has acknowledged that it needs to do better and addressed some of these concerns by unveiling a new iMac Pro with super-fast Intel Xeon chips, Advanced Micro Devices Inc’s Radeon Vega graphics processor, and up to 128 GB of pre-installed RAM. Starting at $4,999, it’s the most expensive and powerful computer Apple has made. The Mac upgrades are Apple’s first to the MacBook Pro since the computer was revamped last fall with a slimmer design and the Touch Bar touchscreen strip on the keyboard. The 12-inch MacBook was last updated earlier last year with faster chips and a rose gold colour option. Alongside the Mac hardware upgrades, Apple also is discussing software updates to both at its conference this week. The new operating systems are expected to be released in the autumn. Apple chief executive Tim Cook also announced that content from Amazon Prime Video, long absent from the Apple TV product, would come to Apple devices such as the TV, iPhones and iPad later this year. ‘Siri face’ Apple kicked off its conference by unveiling a “Siri face” for the Apple Watch that will enable the voice-activated assistant to provide users with information such as commute times for upcoming appointments. Apple was expected to unveil improvements to Siri, its digital voice assistant that competes with Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant helper. The Siri face for the Apple Watch was the first step in that direction, blending users’ calendar information with other useful details, like airline tickets they may have booked. While Siri was previously available on the Apple Watch, the assistant’s ability to automatically show information was limited.

Apple seems to be trying to show they are listening to users, as their updates to the Mac line address many things professionals have been complaining was missing from the line for quite some time.  More details will likely be available soon, but this is a quick summary of the most pertinent topics we think you'll want to focus on. iMac Updates The new iMacs are much improved, with better monitors, faster processors and SSDs, and higher memory capacity. The display has been improved to 500 nits brighter which is 43% better than the current versions. They also have 10 bit dithering (a billion color reproduction). The entire line of iMacs is moving to Kaby Lake, the 7th generation Intel processor. They support 10-bit HEVC decode (better for HQ video) and can be configured to 32GB of RAM on the 21.5-inch and 64GB RAM on the 27-inch machines. Apple also announced that Fusion drives on their machines will now be standard. For those that prefer SSD, their SSD options are 50% faster and available in up to 2 TB. The new machines will include two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 connectors in addition to (and not singularly replacing) the traditional USB connections.  Every configuration in new iMacs gets a big bump in performance. They now include integrated GPU Iris Plus Graphics from Intel for 64MB of eDRAM. This makes them up to 80% faster than the previous generation. The iMac 21.5-inch is getting Radeon Pro 555 & 560 for up to 4GB VRAM. This new system is up to 3x faster than previous gen for graphics. The 27-inch version gets 570, 575 & 580 Radeon processors with up to 8GB of VRAM. New iMac Features: Best displays faster processors higher memory capacity Faster storage Better graphics performance Pricing is also improving, with a new model designed to be more affordable to get their high resolution monitor. The base model 21.5 inch starts at $1099, with the 4K monitor add available for $1499. The 27-inch model starts at $1799. MacBook Pro There aren't newly-designed MacBook Pros, but they are getting updated. New MacBook Pros (available today) also now feature Kaby Lake processores, faster SSDs (50%), and a new model that is more affordable:     iMac Pro Reveal Apple showed an upcoming professional computing machine. It's called the iMac Pro and it uses the same design as the iMac but with a “space grey” finish. It’s going to be by far the most powerful iMac... actually it will be the most powerful Mac ever, besting even the Mac Pro which saw a minor spec upgrade in April and has not seen any major upgrade since the line moved to a cylindrical design in December 2013. Apple are going to put workstation-class performance in the iMac design, which required a better cooling system (see below). It’s still very quiet, but way more powerful.     The iMac Pro will ship with an 8-Core Xeon Processor, but it will also come with 10-Core Xeon Processor option. However, you can ALSO can get up to an 18 Core Xeon Processor. It will feature a Radeon Vega Graphics from AMD, which is a totally new GPU core. It will be available with 16GB of VRAM, and this implementation will offer 11 teraflops of single precision computation and 22 teraflops of half precision computation. You can configure with up to 128GB of ECC memory (insane) and up to 4TB of 3GB/S SSD. It will feature four thunderbolt 3 ports, four USB-3.0 ports, and built-in 10 GB ethernet. With the kind of computing power in the iMac Pro, you can hook up two more 5K displays and 2 high performance raid arrays. This means that the iMac Pro can drive up to 44 million pixels.     Apple says it will be available in December starting at $5000. MacOS High Sierra Apple claims that Safari is “the world’s fastest desktop browser with High Sierra.” It delivers 80% faster performance than Chrome. In addition to speed, they also instituted autoplay blocking, allowing you to avoid annoying videos that play when you load a page and let you decide when/if a video plays. Safari also has Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which uses machine learning to identify tracking of any kind, and protects privacy. It's not just about ads, but any of your browsing habits. On the surface, this looks like it could be as effective at blocking browsing history as a VPN.  Apple also made Photos on the Mac better, by letting you filter by keywords, favorites, media types, etc. They improved facial recognition in images, and when you put effort into categorization and naming, that syncs across devices. They also made enhancements to editing photos: They added curves, selective color (cool I guess), and any edits you make in Photoshop sync with the Photos app. Printing services like Animoto, Wix and Shutterfly are now partnered with Apple Photos for printing services. The Mac file system, HFS, is over 30 years old. Apple is changing to a new file system, Apple File System or APFS, to Mac. It’s 64 bit top to bottom, with safe and secure build. It’s ultra responsive and fast. With the new system, files duplicate and transfer MUCH faster than before. In video, Apple is supporting H.265 which will save 40% better compression. All apps will support the new format. High Sierra is on developer beta today, there is a public beta at the end of June, and a free update this fall to everyone. iOS 11 There are a lot of changes to iOS 11, but here are some of the things we thought would interest you. Messages has a redesigned app drawer, for faster and easier access to stickers and interactive messages. Messages are now stored in iCloud, and all conversations automatically synchronize (finally) across devices. With Messages in the cloud, only the most recent messages are cached on the device with the rest are stored in the cloud, reducing storage on your device. By EOY, more than 50% of retailers will support Apple Pay. To make it even beter, Apple is introducing person-to-person payments. It will be integrated into Messages, so you can send and receive money via the messages app. Authenticated via touch ID, money sent to you goes into an Apple Pay cash card in your Wallet, you can make purchases with it, pay others with it or you can transfer to a bank. Siri has a much more human voice, which includes better inflection and a more "human" sound. One word can be said multiple ways, as you probably know, and now Siri has the ability to know when to say something a certain way. She has a new visual interface, and can provide multiple results to queries you pose to her. You can now use her to translate as well. Ask her anything, and she will repeat it in the correct language. At launch, it will support English to Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish, with more languages coming soon. Siri will understand your voice, and context. Interests, usage of your device, etc. can be used to better understand what you’re asking for. She uses on-device learning to better understand topics of interest to each user. Additionally, Siri is synced across devices now. Control center is being redesigned: it’s now a single page with all the features that used to be spread across two. 3D touch gives you more controls on each of the buttons, which let them compress the view and only show you more when you need it.     Lock screen and notification center are now one item. Swiping down now shows the lock screen and older notifications can be accessed as well. Camera Improvements: With the newest update, Apple is introducing HEVC compression for up to 2x better compression with high resolution video. The video quality won't suffer, but it will take up considerably less space on your phone. They are also replacing JPEG capture with a file type called HEIF, which maintains quality at half the size (2x better compression). All this said, Apple promises that their phone is still compatible across all devices, Apple or not. With the camera specifically, Apple says they improved image quality and low light performance. Optical image stabilizer is better, too. Developers can now have access to the Depth API.     Live photos are improved, and editing of the live photo is now enabled. Sometimes the best photo isn’t the still, but something inside the live photo. Now you can edit it so that the key photo is whatever was captured in the live photo. They also added looping of live photos, edited to your liking. You can also loop in reverse, which is popular on gifs these days. You can also add long exposure looks with your phone without a tripod, it can do it all in the camera. It’s just an editing option now. Apple says that in Photos, Memories is better thanks to the use of machine learning to identify events like weddings, anniversaries, sporting events, etc. You can view movies it makes in portrait as well as landscape mode.  iPad Pro Apple also announced a new size to its high-end iPad Pro lineup, a 10.5-inch model, which replaces the smaller 9.7-inch "Pro" tablet. Sitting below the larger 12.9-inch model, the new 10.5" iPad Pro offers an increased screen real size thanks to its thinner, narrower bezels. The larger screen offers a full-sized on-screen keyboard. It, along with the 12.9-inch model, gains a processor speed bump, going to an A10X Fusion chip. The displays on both iPad Pro models get upgraded display technologies, as well, with 50% brighter True Tone displays and "Pro Motion" technologys that offers up to 120Hz refresh rates. Storage capacity for both new iPad Pro models begins at 64GB. Prices start at $649 for the 10.5-inch model, and $799 for the 12.9-inch one.

Dell, HP and Lenovo showed off new designs that were both attractive and compelling. Mixed-reality headsets hit; based on Intel and Microsoft technology, they were far more affordable than the strong virtual reality stuff already in market (and some aren't bad looking). New core wars broke out, as AMD's 16 Core Threadripper was challenged by Intel's 18 core i9. It seems that gaming was huge at Computex this year. The product -- or the concept really -- that stood out most to me was Nvidia's Max-Q gaming laptop concept, which promises a gaming laptop with dimensions that would rival a MacBook Air. I'll focus on that this week and close with my product of the week: the new smartphone that Apple is working furiously to kill before it can be launched (which is why I immediately ordered one). The Historic Gaming Laptop Problem Here is the deal -- I love to play games both at home and when I travel, and I tend to lock in on one game and play it to death. I'd rather do that than watch TV -- yes, I'm a tad addicted. Currently my game of choice is Ashes of the Singularity, which has as a core plot element the birth of a true artificial intelligence that identifies as female. We try and fail to kill her -- which, as you might expect, pisses her off and results in some epic battles. You get to play both sides, and the combination of story and gameplay creates what is an interesting combination of energetic place, strategic thinking and story ideas. (I'm trying to write my first science fiction book.) The problem is, this game needs a decent graphics processing unit, and that means it won't work on most lightweight laptops using Intel's graphics solution. The game won't even load. However, gaming laptops tend to have two problems: They are heavier, and you pay a huge penalty in battery life. The latter is the bigger problem, because I'm expected to work when I travel, and it is damned hard to work with a dead battery. Recently I've started using the Microsoft Surface Book with the second-generation base, which has both a GPU and decent battery life (10-plus hours), but it is a middleweight, and it barely has enough power to run the game. What I wanted seemed impossible: something that was very light, had decent battery life, and enough power to really enjoy a game like Ashes of the Singularity. Enter the Max-Q. Nvidia's Max-Q I really didn't see this coming, but Nvidia announced its prototype Max-Q, a design for a gaming laptop that is as thin as a MacBook Air, in the ultra-light class of notebooks. It sports 1080-level graphics, which is the baseline for gaming that's more typical on a desktop computer. If you are like me, you likely are wondering about how this thing will be cooled -- largely because if you combine a thin laptop with lots of performance, the little fans that have to keep the thing cool start sounding like jet engine. That doesn't bode well for meetings or using in the same room with your spouse. Nvidia's WisperMode technology keeps that fan noise down to a minimum, unless you are really stressing the system. Overall, there has been a ton of effort on fan acoustics for both laptops and desktop computers. While not totally eliminating the sound, these advances certainly have reduced it to far more acceptable levels (and you really shouldn't be gaming in meetings, or with your spouse in the room anyway). Battery Life One thing we don't know about yet is battery life, and that likely won't be something I can chat about until the manufacturers start sharing what they are building. Lenovo is one of them, and it typically places battery life very high on its list of requirements. If anyone produces a perfect laptop with all of this and 10-plus hours of battery life, my early bet is that it is likely to be Lenovo. Keep your eyes on Alienware, though, as the most powerful gaming computer company in the segment. It's also on the list of firms building Max-Q solutions. I'll touch on this once I'm released from related NDAs or at product launch in a few weeks. (Actual products launch on June 27, which, coincidently, is exactly a month to the day before my birthday. Hint, hint...) Wrapping Up While I'm sure I'll still want the performance of a desktop computer when I'm at home, being able to play games while on the road and having a laptop that is light and easy to carry used to seem as impossible as having a car that could drive itself. Apparently, we are in an age when doing the impossible is becoming an almost everyday occurrence. I mean, self-driving cars, flying cars, people-carrying drones, hoverboards that actually hover, and now a gaming notebook that is also ultra-light. Now we just need antigravity -- oh wait... Remember the scene in Jerry Maguire when he goes back to his wife to make up with her and offers a lengthy explanation about why he is an assh*le in an effort to get her back? She responds with "You had me at hello." Well before I knew anything more than it was coming, I planned to order this phone, because of the huge effort Apple went to in order to try to make sure it never shipped. I've only ever seen Apple this worried twice before and both were during the days of the iPod and Steve Jobs. First, it was because Apple found out about an MP3 player from HP. The second time was when it learned of one coming from Dell. Apple aggressively worked to kill both products before they even launched -- and succeeded. I never even saw the HP product. Given that very little actually seems to scare Apple, short of a U.S. president, I had to have the phone that did. The Essential Phone was designed from the ground up to be an iPhone killer by Andy Rubin, the guy who was at the heart of Android's success. Essential Phone If you go down a list of things that seem to target the iPhone directly, the first is the Qualcomm 835 chipset, the most advanced currently in market. This gives the Essential Phone unmatched connectivity at a time when Apple is being accused of crippling its own phone's connectivity solution. iPhones use aluminum and glass, making the glass the most rigid part of the phone and resulting in lots of breakage. The Essential Phone uses titanium, ceramic and glass, making it far harder to break the phone's screen. Instead of a plug-in connector that lets water into the phone and creates a hazard if you trip over the wire, the Essential Phone uses magnetic connectors reminiscent of what Apple used to use in it portable PC products. These connectors allow the phone to be upgraded with accessories. Yes, Motorola did this first, but Apple didn't do it at all. Oh, and the fingerprint sensor is on the back of the phone, where it always should have been, along with a camera that is designed -- hold your breath -- to work well in low light! In the end, the Essential Phone is very much what you'd get if you went down a list of things you didn't like about the iPhone and created the anti-iPhone. That alone is enough to make it my product of the week. You can pre-order it unlocked for US$699. Don't let Apple tell you what you can and can't buy.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Computers Apple announces upgrades across all its Macs at WWDC 2017 David Nield June 5, 2017 Apple's MacBooks and iMacs are getting performance boosts View gallery - 4 images Apple has announced hardware upgrades across its entire Mac line, including spec boosts for the iMac, the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. The company also unveiled what it's calling its most powerful computer ever, a brand new iMac Pro. Mentioned as part of the keynote at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, the most notable upgrade is the arrival of Intel's latest seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors across all of Apple's MacBook Pros and iMacs. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW That should mean better performance with less power across the board, as well as more capable graphics. iMacs were the first group of computers mentioned by Apple. The display resolutions on the all-in-ones are staying the same, but the underlying technology is getting a boost to provide 500 nits of brightness, which should lead to a 43 percent increase in brightness over the older models. The 21.5-inch models can now fit up to 32 GB of RAM, with up to 64 GB available on the 27-inch models. Combined with the Kaby Lake upgrades, users should see significant performance improvements, though Apple didn't quantify the speed boosts. Graphics are also getting an upgrade on all iMac models: The top-end 27-inch 5K edition can now fit the Radeon Pro 570, 575 and 580 graphics cards, for example. Judging by the demos we saw at WWDC, part of the thinking behind these upgrades is to finally get Apple a seat at the table in the realm of virtual reality. With the new hardware and new software partnerships announced by Apple, it's now possible to develop VR games and apps straight from an iMac. Prices are sticking at US$1,099 for the entry level 21.5-inch iMac, while the top-end 27-inch 5K model stays at $1,799. There is a drop for the 21.5-inch 4K iMac though, which is going down to $1,499 for the cheapest configuration. As for the MacBook and MacBook Pros, the new Kaby Lake processors make them a more compelling proposition. The basic MacBook is also in line for a faster SSD, Apple says, while the long-neglected MacBook Air will be getting a processor upgrade to an as-yet-unspecified Intel model. Prices remain largely unchanged despite the specs bump: the MacBook starts at $1,299, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $1,799 and the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch bar is $2,399 and up. The one difference is a drop to $1,299 for the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro. In short, the machines you can now buy from Apple are faster and more capable than the ones you could buy yesterday, with improvements in display technology, graphics power, and processing speed. The new models all go on sale today. Apple also had time to show off a brand new iMac Pro coming to its range soon: fitted with a Xeon processor with up to 18 cores, Radeon Vega graphics, a maximum of 128GB of RAM, up to 4 TB of SSD drive storage and four Thunderbolt ports, this is a serious machine for serious users. Apple is calling it the most powerful Mac it's ever made, and you'll need to pay for the privilege of using it – prices start at $4,999, with no release date yet announced. As for the software running on all these machines, WWDC also saw Apple announce macOS High Sierra, the successor to last year's Sierra. The operating system, available as a free upgrade later this year, brings with it a smarter Safari, a revamped file system, and better graphics processing, including (surprise surprise) native VR support.Product page: Apple View gallery - 4 images Apple announces upgrades across all its Macs at WWDC 2017 1 / 4 Apple's MacBooks and iMacs are getting performance boosts Upgrades include brighter screens, faster processors and more capable graphics for the iMacs All of Apple's MacBooks and MacBook Pros now use Intel's Kaby Lake processors As for the upcoming iMac Pro, improved ventilation and air flow means Apple can pack in more powerful components Tags #Apple #iMac #MacBook #MacBook Pro Share this article Post a comment Top stories Apple's answer to Amazon Echo is the $349 HomePod Review: Panasonic's DC-FZ80 superzoom is more than a one-trick pony The Workhorse Surefly could become a two-seat sportscar of the skies Streamlined pickup camper features lightweight composite design Sponsored Content Recommended for you Sponsored Content Latest in Computers Apple announces upgrades across all its Macs at WWDC 2017 IBM's new 5nm architecture crams 30 billion transistors onto fingernail-sized chip Voice-imitation advance means we can't trust what we see or hear anymore Adobe Scan puts a document scanner with text recognition on your phone Shadow Brokers hacking group reveals bizarre data dump subscription plan Acer announces new laptops for work and play Google's AI beats world's top-ranking Go player NEC earbuds showcase hands-free biometric verification Rise of the mind-reading machines HP unleashes "The Machine" memory-centric supercomputer prototype Ransomware, Windows XP and the NSA leak that started it all Microsoft unveils Story Remix, a multifaceted video creation app Editors Choice In photos: Big rigs, 4x4 retromods and other earth-eaters of Overland Expo 2017 Compare the latest tech gear World's most beautiful car up for sale The revolutionary redox system that produces and stores energy in the home Rise of the mind-reading machines Masterclass: 25 legendary cars that prove beauty is more than skin deep 2017 Smartwatch Comparison Guide Fast Radio Bursts: How close are we to decoding these strange space signals?

Andrew Cunningham - Jun 5, 2017 6:08 pm UTC Enlarge / The one-ported MacBook. Andrew Cunningham reader comments 124 Share this story SAN JOSE, Calif.—Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference is usually all about software, but every once in a while it brings some hardware along with it, too. Today, Apple provided a minor but wide-ranging refresh to its modern MacBooks and MacBook Pros by adding new processors from Intel and making a handful of other tweaks. Further ReadingIntel unveils Kaby Lake, its first post-“tick-tock” CPU architecture The new processors are from Intel’s “Kaby Lake” family, and some of them have been available for the better part of a year. Compared to the outgoing Skylake architecture, Kaby Lake introduces a gently tweaked version of Intel’s 14nm manufacturing process, provides small boosts to CPU clock speeds, and supports native acceleration for decoding and encoding some kinds of 4K video streams. The 12-inch MacBook, last updated in April of 2016, stands to benefit the most. The low-power Y-series chips the MacBook uses see the biggest performance boost from the Kaby Lake upgrade, and Apple has also added the refined butterfly switch keyboard introduced in the MacBook Pros last year. The keyboards both have the same layout and offer the same amount of key travel, but the newer version of the keyboard has a slightly more satisfying feel. The new MacBook will also get a faster SSD. The Kaby Lake chips make less of a difference in the new MacBook Pro, which was updated just eight months ago after a year-and-a-half or so of neglect. It’s a fast turnaround, which means there are few differences between the new 2017 versions and their predecessors. As before, the 13-inch models use dual-core CPUs and integrated GPUs across the lineup, while the 15-inch versions include quad-core CPUs and dedicated AMD GPUs that can be used to push multiple 5K displays at once. The new 15-inch models will have faster GPUs. The 13-inch versions come with Intel’s “Iris Plus” GPUs, which are pretty similar to Skylake’s Iris GPUs, aside from the new “Plus” branding. They still include a performance-boosting 64MB of eDRAM, which gives them a big leg up compared to MacBook Pros from 2015 and earlier. MacBook prices start at $1,299 while the non-Touch Bar version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro will also start at $1,299. The MacBook Pro 13-inch laptop with a Touch Bar will start at $1,799, while the 15-inch version will start at $2,399.

Apple is bringing Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors to the new iMac, along with what Apple calls “the best Mac display ever,” offering 500 nits of brightness, or 43 percent brighter than the previous generation. The 21.5-inch model now can be configured up to 32GB of RAM, while the 27-inch goes up to 64GB, twice what had previously been offered. The new iMacs also are getting two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, making it Apple’s first desktop computer to embrace the port standard. The new iMacs will support VR Graphics cards are getting a spec boost in the updated iMacs, too. The entry-level 21.5-inch model will have an Intel Iris Plus 640 GPU, while the 4K 21.5-inch models will get Radeon Pro 555 and 560 graphics cards. Meanwhile, the 27-inch 5K model will have a choice of Radeon Pro 570, 575, and 580 graphics cards, topping out at 8GB of VRAM. (The top model Radeon Pro 580 is roughly equivalent to an Nvidia 1060.) Those new GPUs, along with updates in macOS High Sierra, also means that the new iMacs will support VR. While the design of the iMac is mostly unchanged from the outside, it’s still a significant update, given that it’s been almost almost two years since Apple last updated the desktop line in October 2015. And it’s especially important, given that these new iMacs are pulling double duty as Apple’s primary desktop computer until it sorts out the situation with the Mac Pro sometime next year, although the newly announced iMac Pro slated for later this year should help with that. The 21.5-inch iMac will start at $1,099 and the 4K 21.5-inch model at $1,299. The updated iMacs will be available later today.

As had been previously rumored, last year’s MacBook Pros are getting Intel’s Kaby Lake processors, as is Apple’s 12-inch MacBook, which is also getting faster SSDs. Additionally, there’s a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299, while the 15-inch model now has discrete graphics included standard. Otherwise, the MacBook remains unchanged, with the same screen, design, and ports. Diving into the hardware specs, the MacBook now maxes out at up to a 1.3GHz Core i7 processor, the 13-inch MacBook Pro has up to a 3.5GHz Core i7, and the 15-inch MacBook Pro goes up to a 3.1GHz Core i7 processor. Finally, the long-languishing MacBook Air is getting an update, albeit a minor one — Apple is giving the Air a desperately needed speed boost, now offering a faster 1.8GHz Intel processor — the company has yet to offer more details, aside from the speed boost — but that’s about it. The screen is still the same 1440 x 900 panel, the design remains unchanged, and there are no USB-C ports. It seems that the Air is sticking around as an entry-level budget model, even as Apple looks to push users to the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Overall, the updates across the MacBook line show that Apple is committed to staying competitive in the laptop space, even if the spec boost fails to address larger problems with the products like Apple’s unwavering commitment to USB-C or the gimmicky Touch Bar. Still, given the huge amount of time that has historically gone between even spec boosts for some Apple products, like the iMac or Mac Pro, it’s nice to see that the company seems to be trying harder to keep things updated going forward. The newly updated MacBook laptops will be available today.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 5, 2017 at 12:15PM Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) recently announced its next-generation high-end desktop processor family, known as the Core X-series of chips. This product family is aimed at gamers, content creators, and other users that demand more computing power than typical personal computer users need to perform their tasks. Intel's high-end desktop processors have historically been derived from the chips that the company builds for the server/workstation market, and the Core X-based processors are no different in this regard. Image source: Intel. Where Intel has made a change in this generation -- and it is a subtle one, to be sure -- is in the platform controller hub, or PCH, that powers the motherboards the new Core X chips plug into. In this column, I'd like to go over that change and what it could mean for the company's high-end desktop platform business now and in the future. How things were Prior high-end desktop platforms used the same PCH chip that was used in the company's high-end datacenter platforms. The datacenter PCH chips generally pack a lot more "stuff" than their mainstream desktop computer-oriented PCH counterparts. It's worth noting, though, that Intel has traditionally updated its datacenter PCH chips at a slower pace than it has its personal computer-specific PCH chips. This meant that at launch, the high-end desktop platforms were often more feature-rich than their mainstream desktop counterparts, but the mainstream desktop platforms would enjoy quicker PCH updates. What this ultimately resulted in is that in the middle of and toward the end of an Intel high-end desktop platform's life, the cheaper mainstream Intel desktop platforms were often simply more robust and, therefore, more desirable. Mainstream and high-end desktop now share common PCH Intel launched its latest high-end desktop platform a few days ago, and the PCH that pairs with it -- known as X299 -- isn't the same PCH that will be part of the company's upcoming Purley server platform. Instead, based on the published specifications of the X299 PCH, it appears to be nearly identical to the mainstream desktop Z270 PCH that Intel released earlier this year in capabilities; the only difference is that the X299 PCH supports a maximum of 8 SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports, while the Z270 supports just six. I suspect that Z270 and X299 are the same chip, with a couple of SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports disabled on the PCH chips sold as Z270s. What this means for Intel's high-end desktop business The potential downside is that, at launch, a "new" high-end desktop platform going forward won't be as feature-rich as "new" high-end desktop platforms were in the past. However, there are numerous positives that I think will ultimately outweigh that negative. Indeed, Intel should be able to update its high-end desktop PCH chips on an annual basis (in line with the mainstream desktop platform) now, rather than once every two to three years, as was the case when the high-end desktop PCH chips were the same ones as those used in the datacenter platforms. This should allow Intel's high-end desktop platform to feel "fresher," and it could also make life better for Intel's motherboard partners. In the past, the motherboard makers would try to build a second wave of motherboards based on the same chipset (usually by revamping the look of the board, adding auxiliary chips to enable new features, and so on). That worked, but it's obviously a costly, inelegant, and frankly less marketable solution. It's better and cheaper for motherboard makers to be able to avail themselves of a new, more feature-rich/integrated platform controller hub to release refreshed high-end desktop motherboards. And, to the extent that Intel can get paid a premium for the features that it integrates into future PCH chips (since motherboard makers would no longer need to buy third-party chips for said features), the better it is for the company's platform average selling prices, revenues, and profits. Finally, the mainstream desktop PCH chips are likely more cost-optimized than their datacenter counterparts, which should lead to lower high-end desktop PCH manufacturing costs. Intel may choose to pass some, or all, of those cost savings onto its motherboard partners. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel. The Motley Fool recommends Intel.

  Processors PC Cases Video Cards Motherboards Storage Mobile Memory Cooling Misc News Home | Forum | Shop | RSS Search Legit Reviews Reviews  The Best GPU For Ethereum Mining – NVIDIA and AMD Tested The Best GPU For Ethereum Mining – NVIDIA and AMD Tested Posted by Nathan Kirsch | Mon, Jun 05, 2017 - 10:28 AM We’ve never done an article on GPU mining on Legit Reviews before, but continued interest in the ethereum project has caused Ether (the name of the cryptocurrency that runs on the ethereum blockchain app) to skyrocket in price by more than 2,800% this year alone. On Sunday, ethereum traded at an all-time high of $250.41, according to data from industry website CoinDesk. With increases and coin prices like that it has spiked the demand for discrete graphics cards in order to do GPU mining. Ethereum discourages the use of custom ASICs and FPGAs when it comes to mining, so this is something you could do if you wanted to on a PC with a powerful discrete graphics card. When you dive into the world of GPU mining you’ll quickly find that to make any serious money that you’ll need to invest in a fair bit of hardware. Let’s go trough the hardware that one would likely need if they wanted to build a 6  or 7 GPU ethereum mining machine. Over at the Ethereum Community Forums you’ll find hundreds of threads about building a 6-7 GPU mining machine and you can make some pretty good money off a system like that. With 7 AMD Radeon RX 480 video cards that have been optimized for mining you should be able to get around 200 MH/s when mining etherum, so if you plug that into a profit calculator you are looking at making a profit of $12,870 per year at the current ETH price of $245. That’s guessing the rig uses around 1,000 Watts 24/7 and electric costs $0.1265 KW/h. (Please keep in mind the price of etherum could always drop to zero or skyrocket, so think long and hard before you buy hardware to do this.) Custom Mining Rig Build By mininghardware (MHW) on ECF So, you want to building a mining PC? This is a quick summary of what you’ll need to get going. Motherboard:  You’ll need a little luck and possibly some magic or a custom UEFI to find a motherboard that supports six to seven video cards. The Intel Z87 and Z97 chipsets for LGA1150 processors offer a pretty good bang for the buck as they are being cleared out to make room for the newer Intel Z170 and Z270 motherboards for the LGA1151 processors. Our favorite board right for GPU mining is the MSI Z170A GAMING PRO CARBON as it has the ability to run SEVEN GPU’s at a time when using the latest UEFI for $129.99 on Amazon. That board is starting to get hard to find, so grab one sooner rather than later! Processor: If you go with an LGA1150 motherboard the Intel Celeron G1840 Processor is often used as it a TDP of just 53 Watts and costs $55.99 shipped.  If you opted for the newer Intel LGA1151 platform something like the Intel Celeron Processor G3930 at $51.00 shipped would be a bad choice and has a TDP of 51 Watts. Since the CPU load is minimal (usually under 15% for pooled mining) you can get away with a low-cost processor and they both come with a heatsink fan (HSF) that you can use. Power Supply: Your system is going to be running 24/7 and using close to 1000 Watts of power non-stop,  so you’ll want to drop some coin on a good model. We highly suggest an 80 PLUS Platinum rated power supply that is 1200W or greater. We’ve used the Enermax Platimax 1350W ($239.99 shipped) with good success. If you plan on undervolting the GPU and reducing the power consumption you should be able to get away with a 1,000 Watt power supply. The EVGA SuperNOVA 1000 is solid 80 PLUS platinum model for $213.72 shipped or you can go with a lower cost Corsair RM1000x that is 80 PLUS gold certified for $179.99 shipped. Depending on the model you get and the model of video card that you are running you might need to get some SATA to 8-pin PCIe power adapters. Memory: Depending on what motherboard you got you’ll need DDR3 or DDR4 memory. Chances are you’ll need DDR4 memory and we suggest using an 8GB of memory. Some people say you can get away with single channel memory, but we’ve always run dual-channel in our mining rigs. A typical DDR4 2133 MHz 8GB (2x4GB) memory kit will run you about $59.99 from a big name brand. Storage Drive: Small and inexpensive is again the name of the game here. You likely don’t want to use a M.2 PCIe graphics card as some boards will disable PCIe slots when a M.2 PCIe SSD is inserted into the board. For that reason we suggest going with something like a low-cost 120GB SATA III SSD. The Kingston A400 120GB SATA III SSD at $47.99  or PNY CS1311 120GB SSD at $52.99 are hard to beat. Riser Cards: Most go with USB powered 1x to 16x riser cards. These sell out often and they are mostly all made by companies that no one has heard of. The reviews on most are mixed, so you’ll just need to pick some and roll the dice. You’ll likely be paying around $8 each. Case: Get creative and make your own! Our favorite GPU mining builds are done using milk crates, some PVC pipes and zip ties. The might not look fancy, but they cost under $15 to make. Mouse/Monitor/Keyboard: Whatever is cheap! OS: Windows 10 works, but ethOS Mining OS is a 64-bit linux OS that was designed just for ethereum mining and runs $39. Video Cards: AMD Radeon RX 470/480 and Radeon RX 570/580 video cards are all the rage right now when it comes to ethereum mining, but they are extremely tough to find since they are all being bought to mine.   Since we couldn’t find any Radeon RX 580 video cards to purchase at Amazon, Newegg, Micro Center or Best Buy we figured we’d try mining on some of the cards we had laying around to see how they perform. Let’s take a look at the results on our system running Claymore’s Dual Ethereum GPU Miner v9.4 and Windows 10 v1703. Best Performance:  AMD Radeon R9 295X2 The AMD Radeon R9 295X2 came out in April 2014 and is over two years old, but this Dual-GPU card is able to be at the top of the performance chart with 57.6 MH/s of performance. We’ve seen these selling for as low as $500 on eBay, but the TDP on this card is an awe-inspiring 500W, so packing 7 of these into a single system would be more than what any one power supply could handle. The thought of a single system pulling  3,500+ Watts is pretty crazy! Best Value Performer:  The AMD Radeon RX 480 and Radeon RX 580 are solid performing cards.When the AMD Radeon RX 480 first came out it the prices started at $199 and for that you get around 24 MH/s of performance ether mining in stock form, but you can easily get that up to 25-27 MH/s if you wanted to mod the BIOS and dial the cards in. You can reduce the power usage in AMD Wattman to get the power draw on these cards well below the 150W TDP rating. The new AMD Radeon RX 580 uses more power and costs more than the Radeon RX 480, but it gets higher performance and many are able to get 29 MH/s per card at around 135 Watts of power when you do all the widely known power adjustments. No wonder the AMD Radeon RX 580/570 cards are all sold out. Biggest Upset:  When we saw the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 getting 27.4 MH/s in stock form we were impressed, but then the faster clocked NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 with more CUDA cores only got 20 MH/s. We talked to NVIDIA about this and they said it’s because the Ethereum base code fits the GDDR5 latency characteristics better than GDDR5X. So, when it comes to Ethereum mining a GeForce GTX 1070 is better to have than the GeForce GTX 1080. That said the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti uses GDDR5X memory and is getting 32 MH/s. Looks Good On Paper:  The AMD Radeon R9 NANO gets an impressive 27 MH/s, but that’s all you can really get on that model as AMD doesn’t allow you to overclock the HBM memory and if you reduce the power usage at all the hashrate drops as well. This 175W TDP card has good performance, but at $515 it will take a longer time to recoup your money. You can actually buy two Radeon RX 480/580 cards for this price and overclock them to get up to 27 MH/s and reduce the power usage/voltage to get about 40-50W lower power use per card. The AMD Radeon R9 390 gets an impressive 30 MH/s in stock form, but the cards 275W TDP makes is less desirable. Worst Performer: The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 900 series cards don’t mine well on Windows 10 and use a fair bit of power, so if you have one of these cards you’ll want to run Windows 7 or EthOS where you can get around 10 MH/s.   Final Thoughts:  We could have talked about mining for days, but it really depends on what hardware you get and how you configure all your software. The AMD Radeon RX 580 and Radeon RX 480 are the cards to get right now, but it’s tough to find them. You can build up a rig like this for $2,500 or less and make an extra $1,000 a month at the current rates. We highly suggest looking at Ethereum profit calculatorsEthereum profit calculators and factor in the build cost and electricity to see if mining is right for you! Let us know if you have any questions in the comments below! Angel Cota Why recommend 480/580 when you can get a GTX1070 for less at current prices? the gtx does about the same MH at much less power draw so it should be a better choice. Am I missing something? sukstobeu I’ve seen some BIOS modded 480/580’s can get 29 to 31MH/s and that’s with lower stock voltages. iq100 You wrote>”… If you opted for the newer Intel LGA1151 platform something like the Intel Celeron Processor G3930 at $51.00 shipped would be a bad choice and has a TDP of 51 Watts.

If so, please correct, and try put in place procedure that do NOT make major errors, like I believe you did here. Thanks! John Hopkins How did you connect 7 graphics card to one PSU? They look like they only have 6 8 pin connectors on the PSU. Nathan Kirsch As mentioned in the PSU section: “Depending on the model you get and the model of video card that you are running you might need to get some SATA to 8-pin PCIe power adapters.” You’ll need something like this: http://amzn.to/2r57XW0 Anthony Vitale Total System power use would have gone a long way to help further differentiate these results. Performance per watt is an important factor if electricity isn’t free. Nathan Kirsch I made the decision to skip that since most miners don’t run the cards at stock settings. They flash the card with a custom BIOS, underclock the voltage on the GPU/Memory, Overclock the memory, and reduce the cards overall power usage. With a dozen of the same model card that isn’t hard to dial in, but on this many cards that is very time consuming. Paul Henta I am surprised when you say that GTX 900 are bad miner. I can get 42mh/s using two gtx 970 in sli which mean 21 for a single one. it is documented that soem nvidia drivers are better than others. if you mine ether with a gtx 900 series you must use the 347.88 drivers and fiddle a bit with the nevidia settings. as always google is your friends. consumption is the issue but its not that bad. Nathan Kirsch Thanks for the additional info and hopefully that will help folks. I admit that I only tried GeForce 382.33 and then the GeForce 368.81 drivers recommended in Claymore’s utility. Both performed under 3 MH/s on this Windows 10 build, so I called it a day as I had a stack of cards to test. You can dive deep into optimizations on each card, but I was trying to show what you get with the latest drivers with stock settings (with the exception on a couple cards)! Rolling back to a driver that old isn’t a big deal on a dedicated mining rig, but might be a tough sell to gamers that are looking to make some spare cash when they aren’t gaming or using their PC. Coach I fiddled with ethereum mining a bit. My antivirus and malware software fights it constantly. I had disabled them but upon a reboot, my mining program was quarantined and deleted due to a known trojan that was in it. Do I trust the mining program or not? I found my Ryzen 1800x seems to mine as well, I doubt as well as my gpu but it was scrolling along pretty good. Nathan Kirsch What mining program did you try? Claymore’s Dual Ethereum GPU miner is one of the more easy utilities to use and it’s multi-GPU friendly. I’ve even had it running on an AMD/NVIDIA system running Windows 10 with no issues. There is a 1% fee to use his utility, but considering how easy it is to use many aren’t bothered by it. Some go to great lengths to negate his fee by being creative and others have released utilities with bad stuff in them to reduce the developer fee. Sound I just had the same problem last night. I tried a modded Claymore’s Dual Ethereum miner from BuriedONE and my Kaspersky virus scanner called it a Trojan. Not sure if it is actually a trojan, or if its just the scanner. Going to try the non-modded Claymore tonight. Sound Update – tried Claymore not modded.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search Is Now a Good Time to Buy an Intel CPU or Motherboard? By Michael Crider on June 5th, 2017 When you’re assembling a new computer (or upgrading an old one), the motherboard and CPU have a few extra considerations that you need to keep in mind. First, they’re the most restrictive parts to pair: only a relative few processors will fit with your motherboard’s specific socket type. And second, the motherboard selection itself is going to determine a lot of the core capability and direction of your PC build. You definitely need both of these components to build anything that broadly counts as a PC. But is now a good time in terms of economy and tech to invest in some new Intel-branded parts? Short answer: No. Intel’s current crop of “Kaby Lake” processors has met with disappointing reactions due to modest bumps. The next generation is going to be only slightly optimized, and it hasn’t been confirmed that the much faster “Cannonlake” processors in late 2017 will use the same LGA 1151 motherboard socket. If you have the option, you should wait on a purchase. 14nm Processors Are On Their Way Out CPU manufacturing generations can generally be split up into years (Intel releases a new model for each price/performance point almost every year), but you can also group them by semiconductor size. The second one is crucial, and at the current level of fabrication it’s measured in nanometers—the smaller the better, since smaller semiconductors can be crammed into a CPU more densely. It’s a lot more complicated than that, of course, but “fewer nm = faster processor” is a decent rule of thumb. Right now, Intel is selling the third iteration of its 14nm CPU designs: “Broadwell” began in 2015 (model numbers 5xxx), followed by “Skylake” (6xxx) and now “Kaby Lake” (7xxx). All of the consumer versions of these chips use the LGA 1151 CPU socket, so named because (wait for it) it has 1,151 contact pins connecting the processor to the motherboard. Intel is definitely planning at least one more 14nm processor generation, “Coffee Lake” (model numbers 8xxx), with a release scheduled for sometime in the second half of this year. It’s confirmed that Coffee Lake will once again use the LGA 1151 processor socket, making it compatible with all of the consumer-class motherboards now on the market. That said, as an iteration of the current fabrication design, Coffee Lake is expected to come with a relatively modest fifteen percent bump in performance levels. Kaby Lake was already pretty shallow in terms of performance gains at each level of Intel’s processor hierarchy, and it’s likely that the company’s dominant position over AMD is allowing it a bit of wiggle room in the market. With Ryzen CPUs making notable improvements, at generally better prices to boot, all eyes are on the 10-nanometer chip designs expected to be available starting at the end of 2017. …and 10nm CPUs Might Come With A New Socket Cannonlake is adding a bit of ambiguity to Intel’s immediate future. At this point it’s been proposed, but not proven, that the big shift for CPUs will use the LGA 1151 socket—the same one in use on most Intel-compatible motherboards since 2015. With new chipsets on LGA 1151 motherboards as recent as the first quarter of 2017, it seems at least possible that Intel would want to preserve compatibility, making a new motherboard (if not CPU) purchase at least somewhat viable at the moment. The LGA 1151 will stick around for one more Intel CPU revision—after that, its future is unclear. But Intel has yet to formally confirm that Cannonlake-class CPUs will be available in LGA 1151 configurations, as they’ve done with Coffee Lake. Since the older LGA 1150 socket and several before it lasted for two processor generations—about two years—we’re due for a new one. A dramatically smaller fabrication process with the expected performance gains therein would be an apposite time to introduce a new socket with more capable chipsets. There’s also a new RAM standard, DDR5, expected to hit the wider market in early 2018 (LGA 1151 motherboards support DDR3/4). It’s possible (though less likely) that Intel will release a few Cannonlake CPUs that work with LGA 1151 before transitioning to a new socket. Either way, the uncertainty of Intel’s socket intentions should be enough to make spec-hungry buyers wait to see if the current standard holds or if the market will transition to new hardware at the usual time. Even if Cannonlake keeps to the LGA 1151 format, it’s likely to be the last generation of Intel processors that does. Intel’s Market Position Means Deals Are Thin on the Ground Even if Intel’s current lineup of chips isn’t setting the world on fire with performance gains, the company still has a staggering lead over its only competition in the desktop space, AMD. Though the latter’s excellent Ryzen designs have given it a slight sales bump, Intel still sells four out of every five chips. As the direct supplier of its CPUs to retailers like Newegg and TigerDirect, that doesn’t give the company much incentive to discount its current production hardware. Let’s take a look at the Core i5 6600K, a popular mid-range Skylake-class processor for gamers and overclockers. According to the Amazon price tracker CamelCamelCamel, it spiked in price after its initial availability, then settled into the $220-250 range for over a year, and dropped below $200 only when its Kaby Lake replacement came out in early 2017. You can see that Intel processors tend to hold their price fairly steadily, unless driven up by scarcity, which only tends to happen at the start of production. You might be able to find better deals on motherboards, since the socket and chipset specifications are licensed by Intel to third parties. With vendors like Asus, Gigabyte, Asrock, MSI, and EVGA competing amongst themselves to give enthusiasts the most features at the best price, there’s definitely a lot of room to save some money. But since a mid-range CPU will usually cost as much as the motherboard itself, your overall savings are always going to be limited. Motherboards are more likely than CPUs to fluctuate in price. Even if you’re not interested in a Coffee Lake or Cannonlake-class processor, it would be wise to wait until they start to hit the market if you want to save money on a CPU. With newer units on shelves (especially with Coffee Lake confirmed as LGA 1151 compatible), older processors and overstocked items will be discounted at specialty retailers to move them out of inventory. If you can, hold off on a new Intel CPU or motherboard purchase, at least until Coffee Lake and preferably until Cannonlake. Your new build will be faster or cheaper…though probably not both.

Late last week Intel announced graphics driver version 15.45.19.4678, delivered for Intel 6th and 7th generation CPUs, and for Windows 7/8.1/10 PC systems. The headlining changes in Intel's latest Skylake and Kaby Lake integrated graphics driver seem to revolve around games performance and game loading times. With the latest driver release Intel is boasting that it is game ready for both DiRT 4 and Tekken 7 (as long as your CPU has Intel HD Graphics 620 or better). Other recent big name titles such as Prey, and Rising Storm 2: Vietnam are supported by systems packing Intel Iris Pro Graphics. Less GPU-specific are the following game title load-time reductions thanks to the update. Star Wars Battlefront, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Battlefield 1 are all said to start with "significantly reduced load-times". Intel hints that other unnamed titles benefit from similar load-time optimisations. Last but not least for the gamers, Intel says that World of Warcraft: Legion, Tom Clancy’s The Division, and For Honor players will all see performance improvements and smoother gameplay using Intel iGPUs from the Skylake or Kaby Lake families. A driver update wouldn't be complete without a raft of bug fixes and Intel has fixed numerous issues in driver 15.45.19.4678. As well as a few gaming issue fixes the driver removes annoying audio issues with USB Type-C display second screens, patches rotating screen view mode problems, adds Netflix optimisations, implements OC stability improvements and fixes some graphics anomalies in DX9 apps. You can read the full release notes via a link here, where you can also download the 243MB driver executable.

Blog Intels Passenger Economy: Whats the Point? Junko Yoshida, Chief International Correspondent 6/5/2017 09:21 AM EDT  3 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Intel Corp. last week issued a report predicting that the future of fully automated vehicles would unleash a $7 trillion 'Passenger Economy' in 2050. It sounds far-fetched? Yes. But it's worth reading, and here are five reasons why. Intel Corp. last week issued a report predicting that the future of fully automated vehicles would unleash a $7 trillion "Passenger Economy" in 2050. Passenger Economy Report To mark the occasion, Intel hired Strategy Analytics, a market research firm, to examine the concept and write a report.   Any forecast designed not only to predict the long-term future of a commercial product, but also to cover a broad swath of social and economic impacts, faces a few accountability issues. For one thing, how many of us who read the report today will be around in 2050 to check the results?   Moreover, a big number like $7 trillion, which the report describes is “more than the projected 2017 GDPs of Japan and Brazil combined,” catches the eye, but it also renders the report somewhat suspect. One can’t help but wonder if the report is a little self-serving to the company who paid for the research.     Given such caveats, it’s easy to dismiss this report. But as I read through, I found that, wittingly or unwittingly, it explains fully automated cars more effectively than most other market forecasts I’ve seen.    The report does not provide sales forecasts for fully autonomous cars over the next 20 years, profiles of potential buyers, or penetration rates for autonomous vehicles per household. I suspect such omissions are by design.    The report’s key takeaway is that the future -- to be created by fully automated cars and autonomous technologies -- is neither about vehicles nor the automotive business. It’s about the world beyond transportation affected by fully automated technologies.       Let me explain what led me to this conclusion, and why I think the report is worth reading.   1. Why does Intel care? First, the report offers a rare look into the corporate mind at places like Intel, who are heavily invested in driverless cars. It illustrates their need to identify – if not justify – the opportunity for a pilotless vehicle future.   During the press briefing on the report, when asked why Intel cares enough to commission this costly forecast, Intel's vice president and general manager of Automated Driving Solutions Group, Doug Davis, explained that knowing the future is essential to anticipating the challenges ahead.   “Evident from other technologies we’ve lived through,” Davis said, “The more we understand the future, the better positioned we will be to adapt to it.” Next page: Shift from manufacturers to service providers   Email This Print Comment Page 1 / 3 Next > Comments View Comments: Newest First | Oldest First | Threaded View [close this box] User Rank Author stock stock stock alex_m1   6/5/2017 4:09:51 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate The point is simple:"Level 4 model – not Level 5, though – is expected to reach the market in 2021. "  Since this is implied by Intel, this opens a lot of growth potential for Intel/MobileEye in a few years, and this could affect Intel's stock - in a much bigger way than the cost of this report.  Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Freelancer 2050 AD?

Businesses need efficiency and will be mostly for deliveries not travel. Consumer (that includes commute) will have much higher ASPs per mile. You start with how low must the price be to capture 100% of a person's needs in a certain market but soon enough the thinking transitions to how to increase ARPU. If you have 2 billion users at $150 ASP per month, that's already 3.6 trillions per year. By the time you get to 3 billion, ASPs are lower but once you add deliveries you somewhat get to 7 trillion. And don't forget that this includes buses but mostly in rural and developing. The ARPU in developed markets will matter a lot and we'll see a luxury and marketing escalation as such services try to convince consumers to pay more. Not knowing Japan at all, i can safely say )LOL) that Japan will likely have some of the craziest offerings. If folks want cars with hotubs, that's what folks will get but i wonder how far things might go. Take an 18-wheeler, turn it into a club or a condo and off one goes for some price they can actually afford. It is replacing car sales, maintenance, the fuel supply chain, insurance and so on - the sum of those is much larger. On top of that it is creating new opportunities and greatly expanding the global miles traveled. The shift is cost driven, you either pay a lot less or you get a lot more for the same money. It's also more convenient not to deal with maintenance, refueling, parking .. or owning a garage. And more flexibility as you can ride in different types of vehicles, according to one's needs at a given time. Nothing really there to stop consumers from a very fast transition once safety concerns are gone There are plenty of skeptics but on gut feeling and no arguments. PS: how long before CaaS prices on a per mile basis are lower than subway tickets in the most developed nations? With a note here that taxes are hard to predictt and might be a killer.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman 4 Companies Embracing, and Finding Value In, the Circular Economy SOURCE: USCCF Corporate Citizenship Center DESCRIPTION: The circular economy – an economic model focused on designing and manufacturing products, components and materials for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling – promises big opportunities for the private sector to drive new and better growth and accelerate innovation. Shifting to the circular economy could release $4.5 trillion in new economic potential by 2030, according to Accenture. But how do we take that vision of a circular economy – which imagines a world without waste – and translate that into profitable and scalable action? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Corporate Citizenship Center, a nonprofit organization driving the circular economy agenda in the US, is releasing a new report featuring case studies that illustrate how companies are translating their circular economy aspirations into action – and how that in turn drives greater resource productivity improvements, eliminates waste and inefficiency, and contributes to a stronger and more competitive economy. Let’s take a look at some of the companies featured in the report. Aramark: Reducing food waste Food services provider Aramark has set a goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030 from its 2015 baseline, such as by setting standards for ordering, receiving, preparing, serving and tracking food production. Through its partnership with food waste reduction experts LeanPath, Aramark is accelerating its waste prevention and minimization efforts by integrating LeanPath’s tracking and analytics technology platform into its largest 500 accounts. Since 2016, Aramark has rolled out LeanPath’s platform across 161 sites, slashing its food waste on average by 44% and reducing the amount sent to landfill by 479 tonnes. In instances of overproduction, Aramark donates unserved food to local food relief agencies or for composting. EILEEN FISHER: The path to 100% circularity EILEEN FISHER’s take-back programme, in which employees and customers can bring back unwanted EILEEN FISHER clothing for $5 store credit per piece, started in 2009 under the name Green Eileen. Funds raised from the programme are donated to organizations that support women, girls, and the environment. In 2017 Fisher Found was launched as the next iteration of Green Eileen, a circular take-back programme that focuses on reselling, renewing (repairing slightly flawed pieces, for example), and remaking EILEEN FISHER garments. Since 2009, EILEEN FISHER has taken back over 800,000 garments and donated $2 million to its chosen causes. EILEEN FISHER currently takes back 3% of the products it creates each year, and is working towards a goal to take back 100% of its output. Intel: Finding value in waste material Computer chip manufacturer Intel has set a goal to recycle 90% of its non-hazardous waste and divert 100% of its hazardous waste from landfills by 2020. Since 2008, Intel has recycled 75% of the total waste generated from its operations, such as through upcycling, recycling, recovery, and reuse. For example, Intel developed an onsite electrowinning system to recover solid copper for reuse from an aqueous waste stream generated by semiconductor manufacturing. The recovered copper can enter the metals market supply chain for reuse in other industrial or commercial applications. The copper recovery process has been replicated at Intel’s microprocessor manufacturing sites and more than two-thirds of the waste was recovered in 2016. Additionally, over the past 10 years Intel has donated more than 1,000 pounds of copper to Arizona State University for use in the creation of works of art. Johnson Controls: Closing the automotive batteries loop Johnson Controls has designed its conventional automotive batteries so that 99% of the materials can be reused. Customers can return old batteries that are collected by Johnson Controls and turned into new batteries. The company’s circular supply chain has pushed recycling rates for conventional batteries to 99% in North America, Brazil, and Europe in 2015, enabling Johnson Controls to produce batteries containing more than 80% recycled material. In partnership with suppliers, customers, and logistics partners, Johnson Controls has enabled hundreds of millions of batteries to be properly recycled and recovered into new batteries. The benefits include a more resilient raw material supply, job creation and economic development for local communities and suppliers, and a 90% reduction in energy by using recycled plastics instead of virgin plastic. The case study report will be released at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation Circular Economy and Sustainability Summit, From Aspiration to Implementation, on June 26-28 in Washington DC. In partnership with The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and with support from the World Economic Forum’s Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy, this event will explore the ideas, innovations, technologies, and partnerships needed to leverage winning circular economy strategies that enable growth and well-being.

Intel's first NVMe controller—introduced with the SSD DC P3700—had a great run, but it's been showing its age for a while now. The new controller used on the P4500 and P4600 enables higher performance despite the new drives using 3D TLC NAND compared to the P3700's 20nm planar MLC, and despite the newer controller having only 12 flash channels instead of 18. More significantly, Intel's second-generation NVMe controller is much smaller and more power-efficient, allowing it to be used in product segments that Intel's first generation controller literally couldn't fit in. Intel's new SSD DC P4501 is a lower-power take on their new generation of NVMe technology, putting Intel controllers into M.2 and 2.5" 7mm U.2 SSDs for the first time. With capacities from 500GB to 4TB, the P4501 delivers somewhat lower performance than the P4500 and P4600, but with reduced power consumption and substantially higher density. Intel has previously shipped the SSD DC P3100 M.2 SSD, but despite using the same 3D TLC, it was not at all in the same league as the P4501. The P3100 is based on the same platform as the consumer Intel SSD 600p, with a Silicon Motion controller, poor sustained write speeds and no power loss protection. The P3100 was pitched as a boot drive for servers, but the P4501 can be a serious workhorse. The P4501 supports the same advanced feature set of its bigger siblings, including full power loss protection, NVMe Management Interface, and support for up to 128 queues for optimal performance even in systems with the highest CPU core counts. The P4501 even comes with a slightly higher endurance rating than the P4500.

The 2.5" U.2 version uses the same 7mm thickness as consumer SSDs and many of the more value-oriented enterprise SSDs, compared to the 15mm thick form factor that Intel's previous enterprise SSDs have used for thermal dissipation reasons even when the extra volume was not necessary for higher storage capacity. The U.2 version of the P4501 will provide capacities up to 4TB. The P4501 will support tunable power limits: the U.2 version can be capped at 8W, 10W or 12.5W while the M.2 version will support limits of 6W or 8.25W. Idle power is not a priority for datacenter SSDs, but the U.2 version is specified for less than 5W at idle and the M.2 version is specified for less than 3W. Intel's first-generation NVMe controller came to the consumer market in the SSD 750, the first consumer NVMe SSD. It raised the bar for consumer SSD performance, but as soon as truly client-oriented solutions like the Samsung 950 Pro hit the market, the SSD 750's inconveniently large form factors, high power consumption and lower peak performance started to erode its cachet. The new Intel SSD DC P4501 shows that Intel is in a position to offer a new generation of high-end client NVMe SSDs that will be much better fit for today's market. With new firmware optimized for client workloads and possibly with cost savings from dropping the power loss protection or using Intel's upcoming 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, Intel could have a serious contender for the consumer market in the near future.

It's a total nonissue for enterprise, where sinking <10W of heat from forced airflow alone is a "what, but we were already doing that anyway" non-problem.

These aren't for your laptop. The top side can have heat management solutions in servers the bottom side can't. This is critical because the expectation is 24/7 full speed operation in the smallest possible form factor. Reply Bullwinkle J Moose - Monday, June 05, 2017 - link "Bingo.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print CAPITOL HILL BRACES FOR COMEY – Lawmakers fret about September ‘train wreck’ – ISSA TOES THE LINE BACK HOME – GOP senators downplay Obamacare repeal 06/05/2017 07:55 AM EDT By Heather Caygle (hcaygle@politico.com or @heatherscope) With assists from Daniel Lippman, Elana Schor and Kyle Cheney Story Continued Below THE CAPITOL BRACES FOR COMEY — Welcome back Huddle readers! The big news on Capitol Hill this week is former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday. Comey hasn’t spoken publicly since he was abruptly fired by President Donald Trump on May 9. The former FBI chief is expected to be peppered with questions from both Democrats and Republicans about his conversations with Trump, including reports that the president pressured him to shut down a probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. “We’ve known since Watergate rules of the road that the president shouldn’t intervene in an ongoing investigation. It would be unthinkable if the president actually did what was reported,” Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, top Democrat on the Intel Committee, said Sunday on CBS’ "Face the Nation.” That’s not all folks: Comey’s testimony may be the main attraction but he won’t be the only newsmaker on Capitol Hill this week. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers are all slated to testify before the Intel panel Wednesday. The hearing will be Rosenstein’s first public testimony since he appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to take over the FBI’s Russia probe. Kyle and Austin preview the week: http://politi.co/2rskgzo Playbook tidbit: Press gallery staff are scheduled to meet with aides on the Intel panel today to discuss the specifics of how many reporters will be allowed in the hearing room Thursday, Anna, Jake and Daniel report this morning. Usually about 120 reporters, not including photographers, are allowed to sit in the press section. I HEAR THE TRAIN A COMIN’… With Republicans in total control of Washington since January and little to show for it, concerns are mounting that Congress is heading for disaster come September, with a debt default and government shutdown both looming possibilities. Democratic leaders are already signaling they won’t back down from a debt limit fight. And while GOP leaders insist their big plans (repealing Obamacare, overhauling the tax code) are still on track, the chamber has done little lately other than process delayed nominations, Burgess and Seung Min report. ‘Give me a break’: “There have been zero amendment votes on regular legislation, with only a non-binding budget vote-a-rama in January. …It’s the fewest such votes in a new Congress since 1981," Burgess and SMK report. “I’m very frustrated,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “We’re going to do all these things by Sept. 30? Give me a break. We’re going to cut taxes, pass health care, set aside sequestration?” Much more on what’s to come this summer, described as a “train wreck” by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.): http://politi.co/2qX9Ns5 Reality check, via the AP’s Erica Werner: “Seven legislative weeks are left before Congress scatters for a five-week August recess, a period when lawmakers are likely to lose momentum if they have failed to act on health care or taxes, and face GOP voters frustrated that they haven’t delivered.” More: http://apne.ws/2rspj2J AND WE’RE BACK! Welcome to Monday, June 5 and thanks for reading POLITICO’s Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill. Your Huddle host is happy to be back at the helm after a little time away getting married and hanging out with the wild roosters in Key West. REPUBLICANS TAMP DOWN REPEAL EXPECTATIONS — Senate Republicans are growing increasingly pessimistic that an Obamacare repeal will happen this year, publicly airing their concerns over the Memorial Day recess. “I don’t see a comprehensive health care plan this year,” Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told a local news station late last week. And Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said over the weekend “tax reform is an easier lift,” reiterating his idea to shift to a two-prong plan to dismantle Obamacare. On the flip side, Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said he thinks the Senate will vote to repeal Obamacare “by the end of July at the latest.” Elana and Madeline Conway with more: http://politi.co/2qXeNwK Dems weigh in: “Make no mistake, Senate Republican leaders are working as hard as they can to get to 50 votes and jam their version of Trumpcare through the Senate—and the minute they do, this bill is going to move fast,” Senate HELP Committee ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) told Huddle. “That’s why we’re going to keep the pressure on.” Risky premium pledge: Even if Senate Republicans can agree to an Obamacare repeal plan, they are in danger of overpromising and underdelivering on their pledge to reduce insurance premiums. Jen Haberkorn explains: http://politi.co/2rscLZg. And Jen teamed up with Burgess to profile Bill Cassidy, the gastroenterologist turned Republican senator who is determined to bridge his party’s Obamacare repeal divide. From Covington, La.: http://politi.co/2rshmdP ** A message from Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America: It is imperative that state laws concerning sales and delivery of wine, beer and spirits be respected. WSWA is opposed to permitting direct shipment of beverage alcohol via the U.S. Postal Service. ** DISPATCH FROM THE BEST COAST — GOP Rep. Darrell Issa won reelection by less than 2,000 votes in November, struggling to hold onto his seat in a southern California district that’s turning more blue with every election. Rachael went to San Juan Capistrano to see how he’s doing back home: “Anger from the left — and more than a little from his own party — has dogged Issa here in a Republican-leaning part of his increasingly Democratic district. Every seat in a nearly 500-person auditorium at the San Juan Hills High School was filled, and hundreds of constituents protested outside, irate that they couldn’t get in.” Much more: http://politi.co/2rswPdV SOMETIMES IT PAYS TO BE A WRITER — Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) pocketed a $332,750 advance for his latest book, “Giant of the Senate,” according to personal financial disclosure records filed in May. HuffPost reported in 2015 that Franken’s memoir would garner him at least $1 million. His office didn’t comment Friday on whether the total listed in Franken’s financial disclosures is the full amount or part of a larger advance. Seung Min with the deets: http://politi.co/2rsiX3q THINGS ARE LOOKING UP FOR TESTER — Montana Attorney General Tim Fox has decided against challenging Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in 2018, becoming the second high-profile Republican to pass on jumping in the race in recent months. “Fox is also known to be interested in running for governor, and Montana Republicans said that became more likely after Rep.-elect Greg Gianforte was charged with assaulting a reporter shortly before his election victory last month. Gianforte, a wealthy tech executive, had been the Montana GOP's gubernatorial candidate in 2016. ‘This all changed post-bodyslam,’ said a D.C. Republican.” Kevin Robillard and Elena Schneider report: http://politi.co/2rspb3r NOT SO FAST — As President Donald Trump renewed his travel ban push over the weekend (and this morning), lawmakers on both sides of the aisle came out against the idea on Sunday. Several lawmakers making the Sunday show rounds said the ban “is no longer necessary since the administration has had the time it claimed it needed to develop beefed-up vetting procedures,” Paige Winfield Cunningham reports for the Washington Post. “It’s been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place,” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Fox News. “I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.” More: http://wapo.st/2rsfodj GOV WATCH: WHO’S IN, WHO’S OUT — Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) is quietly exploring a bid for Florida governor, Marc Caputo reports this morning. “DeSantis today is in Tallahassee to meet with potential donors and supporters as he weighs a bid for governor or, possibly, attorney general. DeSantis has held similar exploratory meetings in Miami and Naples.” More: http://politi.co/2rsjYIF Meanwhile, Rep. Rick Nolan (D-Minn.), who sits in a Trump-won district, ruled out a 2018 gubernatorial run in a Facebook post. More from the Pioneer Press: http://bit.ly/2rs1sAc VIA PLAYBOOK: TUESDAYS WITH TRUMP — Trump is hosting a half dozen members of Congress for dinner at the White House Tuesday night, Jake and Anna report. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), and Reps. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) and Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) are all on the invite list. TODAY IN CONGRESS — The Senate meets at 3 p.m. today with a 5:30 p.m. vote on a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. The House is out until Tuesday. AROUND THE HILL — Not much happening today as everyone gets back into town post-recess. ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES — Katie Niederee has a new gig as press secretary for the Senate Finance Committee. Previously, she was communications director for Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). Daniel Cameron, who most recently was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's personal office legal counsel, is returning to Louisville to practice law at Frost Brown Todd. Reagan Payne starts a new gig next week in government relations at Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle startup acquired by GM last year. Payne previously worked for Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.). FRIDAY’S TRIVIA WINNER(S) — Jeremy Berkowitz was the first to correctly guess that Maine elected two independent governors since 1940: James Longley and Angus King. Then Heinz Kaiser noted that Alaska, too, had achieved the feat when Wally Hickel (who later registered as a Republican) and current Gov. Bill Walker were elected. So it’s a joint victory today. TODAY’S TRIVIA — I’ll take today’s question: This person, a central figure in the history of the United States, appears many times in the Capitol, including above a room previously used by the Committee on Post Offices. Name this person. For bonus points, name another place he/she is featured in the Capitol.

This record is a result of the three-tier system and each tier’s commitment to working cooperatively with their licensing authorities. The 21st Amendment gives states the primary authority to regulate the manufacture, distribution and sale of beverage alcohol. As Congress works to make the U.S. Postal Service solvent, it is imperative that state laws concerning direct to consumer shipping of wine, beer and spirits be respected. WSWA opposes legislation that would permit the U.S. Postal Service to deliver beverage alcohol.

Thanks to a big part to a household name in the world of tech, who's been pushing for tech applications in India’s biggest pastime.  Intel has been chosen as the Innovation Partner for the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy by the International Cricket Council, and the effects are showing in how the matches are being broadcast. Here are the three coolest things you can see in action at the Champions Trophy right now. Drones Intel’s new Falcon 8 drone is flying the field in the UK, bringing us the best in pitch analysis ever. Equipped with high-definition and infrared cameras, these little helpers capture images to give us data on the grass cover and health, topology , and can even generate daily pitch reports to help commentators during a broadcast, so they don’t need to resort to poking something into the soil. Bat sensors Anuj Dua, director of marketing for Intel’s New Technology Group, introduced a new bat sensor during a recent presentation, currently being implemented for the trophy. The bats in play have embedded Speculr BatSense sensors in the handle, using Intel’s Curie technology, which capture data with every stroke the batsman makes. The sensors are capable of measuring parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through, and can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Several batsmen are using these bat sensors in the current games enabling new insights and analysis during broadcasts. “Coaches can use their insights and expertise along with the bat sensor data to make specific adjustments to a batsman’s technique ultimately helping him perform better,” said Speculur Managing Director, Atul Srivastava. In addition, the technology will also be available to consumers later this year, so hundreds of thousands of aspiring young cricketers can make use of it to improve their skills in preparation for the big leagues. Speculur plans to make BatSense with Intel Inside available in Australia, India, the United States and the UK in the second half of 2017. Virtual Reality Aside from technology applications to help the players and broadcasters, Intel has also provided a way for fans to be more engaged, using special VR zones at The Oval and Edgbaston stadiums. A wearable VR headset allows fans to face off against a virtual bowler in an immersive cricketing environment and test their batting skills. As they play, fans will also be able to see real-time data from their swing, as well as a score from their session.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Why Intel Corporation's Cascade Lake Is So Important It's about the memory opportunity. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 5, 2017 at 7:45AM On May 16, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) put out a press release titled "Intel Shows 1.59X Performance Improvement in Upcoming Intel Xeon Processor Scalable Family." In the press release, Intel talked up the performance benefits of its upcoming data center chips relative to its prior-generation chips. The most interesting bit of this press release, though, was the company's disclosures around its upcoming 3D XPoint-based memory modules for data center applications. Image source: Intel. Investors may recall that at Intel's analyst day back in February, the company said that it believes that the total addressable market for such 3D XPoint-based memory modules could be worth approximately $8 billion by 2021. Those memory modules were supposed to ship this year alongside the Intel Xeon Processor Scalable family mentioned above, but the technology was delayed. In that same press release, Intel says that a refreshed version of its Xeon Processor Scalable family, known as Cascade Lake, will support this technology. Of course, the fact that Intel intends to refresh its server platform in 2018 is encouraging. But the real story here is that we now know approximately when Intel still start enjoying revenue from 3D XPoint-based memory modules -- something that could help the company reaccelerate growth in its data center group (DCG). Two ways it can help reaccelerate DCG growth Intel previously aspired to a 15% compounded annual revenue growth rate for DCG, but it has had a rough time achieving that goal in recent years. The company has indicated that growth in some of the markets that DCG serves, like cloud computing and networking, continues to be robust, but sales of platforms into traditional enterprise servers have slumped. With the introduction of Cascade Lake and the 3D XPoint memory modules, there are two obvious ways that Intel's DCG could benefit. The first is that Intel will go from generating no revenue from sales of memory modules into the server market, to generating some positive amount of revenue once it starts shipping those 3D XPoint modules. At this point, the amount of revenue Intel will be able to rake in from these memory modules is unclear, as Intel hasn't guided such a figure, and any estimate on my part wouldn't be particularly valuable. However, Intel did indicate at its most recent analyst day that it expects DCG revenue to return to double-digit growth in 2018 and beyond. That acceleration, Intel indicated, will be driven in part by an expectation of a 30% compounded annual revenue growth rate in its non-processor products from 2017 through 2021. I suspect that a large part of Intel's expected non-processor revenue growth will come from the 3D XPoint memory module opportunity. There's another thing that could help accelerate Intel's DCG revenue growth. If Intel's 3D XPoint memory modules are as big a deal as Intel claims they will be -- and only the new Cascade Lake platform (and beyond) will support those modules -- Intel could see an uptick in processor/platform upgrade activity among some customers for 3D XPoint.

Coffee Lake will be the successor to Intel’s 7th-generation Kaby Lake processors and is expected to use the LGA 1151 socket – the socket used by Intel’s 6th-gen and 7th-gen chips. Intel has not revealed detailed specifications of its upcoming processors, but has shown off performance figures and surface details about the new platform. Architecture Intel’s 8th-gen desktop processors will be based on its Coffee Lake architecture, which is manufactured on the 14nm process node. This is the same manufacturing process used for the chipmaker’s Skylake and Kaby Lake processors, which confirms that Intel has dropped its “tick-tock” architecture design model as it approaches smaller process nodes. As Kaby Lake was a refinement of Intel’s Skylake architecture, Coffee Lake will be a further refinement of Kaby Lake chips – offering improved power efficiency and performance. The integrated graphics on Intel’s 8th-gen processors will include support for HDMI 2.2 and DP 1.2 connectivity. 8th-gen processors will also use a new 300 Series Chipset manufactured by Intel. According to KitGuru, the 300 Series chipset will add support for integrated USB 3.1 ports and Intel Wireless A-C Gigabit Wi-Fi. A variety of motherboard models will be available for Intel’s Coffee Lake processors, while previous-generation motherboards – such as the Z170 and B250 – are expected to support Coffee Lake CPUs via a BIOS update. With Intel’s 200 Series chipsets featuring support for the company’s Optane storage technology, the 300 Series is also expected to support Optane drives. Performance Intels 8th-gen processors will be available in Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 models, in addition to lower-end and mobile products. The chips will support dual-channel DDR4 memory and boast a marginal performance improvement over Kaby Lake. Intel said its Coffee Lake processors would boast up to a 30% increase in performance over Kaby Lake in certain benchmarks. While Intel’s 8th-gen chips are set to remain on the 14nm process node, the company plans to launch its 10nm Cannonlake processors following the roll-out of Coffee Lake chips. These chips will coexist until 10nm becomes adopted for use in mainstream desktop processors. Leaked SiSoftware data shows the 8th-gen Core i5 and Core i7 processors will both feature six physical cores, although only the Core i7 model will include hyper-threading. The data also pointed to increased clock speeds across the board, along with a 50% increase in L3 cache.

Supplier Though Imagination Tech hasn't indicated that it wants to sell its PowerVR graphics business, here are two companies that might be interested if Imagination does decide to sell. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 5, 2017 at 6:30AM Back in April, longtime Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) publicly disclosed that Apple will cease using Imagination's intellectual property within the next 15 to 24 months. After this disclosure, Imagination's shares lost over half of their value -- an appropriate reaction, considering that Imagination relies on Apple for roughly half of its net revenue. The iPhone fueled Imagination's rise, and now it could bring about its downfall. Image source: Apple.  Following this disaster, Imagination announced to investors that it plans to sell its MIPS and Ensigma businesses in a bid to "concentrate its resources on PowerVR and strengthen Imagination's balance sheet." Once Imagination unloads these businesses, it'll still have to face the grim reality that its anchor customer for its only remaining business is gone and probably isn't ever coming back. Imagination will also have to face the bitter truth that only a relatively small portion of the smartphone applications processor total addressable market is open -- and that competition is still quite fierce. I suspect, then, that once the company has rid itself of MIPS and Ensigma, it could be attractive to potential customers who might want to use Imagination Technologies' intellectual property and whatever talent hasn't jumped ship by then. Here are two potential suitors that come to mind. The chip giant Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) could potentially make use of Imagination's technology. Intel has its own in-house graphics efforts, and its graphics technology is found in many, if not most, personal computers that are sold today. However, Intel's graphics technology, though it has gotten better with time, still isn't great. When Intel tried its hand in the smartphone and tablet applications processor markets, it only used its own graphics technology in higher-power tablet chips. Even in tablets, Intel's graphics performance was mediocre at best. Indeed, Intel's internal graphics technology was so woefully inadequate that it used Imagination's graphics technology in almost all the smartphone processors that it brought to market -- with ARM Holdings' Mali graphics intellectual property being used in the ill-fated SoFIA chips. I don't think Intel would buy Imagination with the intention of swapping out its own graphics technology for Imagination's, but I wouldn't be too surprised to see Intel pick up Imagination for its patents, technology, and talent to bolster its own efforts. In other words, it would be like Intel's acquisition of processor maker Soft Machines. Fellow IP vendor Another potential buyer could be fellow semiconductor intellectual property vendor CEVA (NASDAQ:CEVA). On CEVA's homepage, the company says that it develops "ultra-low power [intellectual property] for vision, deep learning, audio, communication, and connectivity." It's not a stretch, then, to see CEVA buy Imagination Technologies to add graphics to its portfolio. Graphics processors could complement CEVA's imaging and computer vision offerings, as well as its deep learning offerings, especially since graphics processor technology is proving to be quite popular in deep learning/artificial intelligence. What's even more interesting is that CEVA once tried to buy MIPS Technology, but it was outbid by Imagination Technologies. Perhaps CEVA might be interested in the entirety of Imagination Technologies -- or at least the PowerVR graphics and MIPS processor businesses. Ashraf Eassa owns shares of Intel.

It is perhaps the most anticipated phone since the original iPhone in 2007. Consequently, leaks about this extensive redesign have been unparalleled, but now they have reached a new high. Much of the tech news for months now have been covering rumours of the said phone ranging from assembly issues to component specifications. There were new reports from last week that might shed some light on Apple’s upcoming flagship phone. There reports pertain to issues like the phone’s wireless modem, its size, and the vertical dual camera on its back. Intel wireless modems Apple has been known to use Qualcomm-made wireless modems on the iPhone. In fact, back in 2016, 70 percent of the iPhones sold used a chip that was manufactured by Qualcomm. However, it seems like this year Apple will be favoring Intel-made wireless modems more and more. According to a report, Apple has increased the order volume for Intel wireless modems to 50 percent. This is a considerable increase since last year, only 30 percent of the iPhones sold contain wireless chips from Intel. Also Read: Much awaited iPhone 8 will feature wireless charging iPhone 8 size On a slightly more interesting topic, last week, the guys at iDrop News were kind enough to share what they think the iPhone 8 would look like when released. Furthermore, the website also shared additional images of the iPhone 8 renders showing how big it will be compared to other Smartphones. In one of the images, it can be seen that the new phone is only slightly taller than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Vertical dual camera Apart from the mockup units shared by Geskin, Slashleaks also leaked the CAD drawing that has been the basis of the renders done by iDrop News. It can be seen that dual camera setup for the iPhone 8 is in vertical position. This new leak strengthens the earlier rumors about the said camera setup. Furthermore, one can see from the image that the cameras are separated by the LED flash. Another interesting bit about this leak is the circular outline near the rear cameras. Experts also speculated that this might be the Touch ID sensor for the iPhone 8.

Taking into its fold cutting-edge innovations like autonomous cars, smart cities and machine-to-machine communications, it will make the world more interconnected. It’s going to be so transformational that every technology company is gearing up to ensure they are fully equipped for the data-rich, ‘new world order’. One of the companies that is leading research on this front is Intel. It recently announced the Xeon Processor Scalable family, which the company said represented the biggest platform advancement in this decade. The new product has the design flexibility to take on common applications and mission-critical operations, and also to harness actionable insights from areas like advanced real-time analytics and Artificial Intelligence. In January, Intel unveiled a 5G modem, with the aim of augmenting computing power and access to cloud resources. The device, with speed exceeding 5Gbps, hundreds of MHz of aggregated bandwidth and ultra-low latency, would lead to significant improvement in the efficiency of self-driving cars, drones, smart-city facilities etc. Venkata Murthy Renduchintala, President, Client and Internet of Things Businesses and Systems Architecture Group, Intel Corporation, who was in Bengaluru recently, spoke to The Hindu on how 5G would pan out, its challenges and opportunities. Edited excerpts: In the context of the huge data explosion, how can we get to the most relevant data quickly? That will happen in two ways. With large amounts of data, you aren’t going to transport that across your network to data centres for aggregation. You need to have data aggregation at the edge of the network. And that will be a fundamental transformation as we move towards 5G. You’d see functions that exist in data centres distributed into the very fabric of the networks. So it’s compute and storage within the fabric of the network to deal with data explosion at the edge of the network, instead of overburdening the network infrastructure. The other will be Deep Learning, where you have greater context and search precision around the information you are looking for. Essentially, the context of search will be rapidly residualised into data-retrieval criteria, which will quicken the access to the information that you need. How different will the transition to 5G be? The move from 4G to 5G will be as profound as the move from analogue to digital. It will be more than merely supporting mobile devices. It will support vehicles, drones, robots, aeroplanes, connected factories and connected cities. 5G is going to be as much about the transformation of the network and the services offered over the network, as it is going to be about the mobile environment. So the infrastructure is going to be tremendously evolved to support the explosive changes in the user environment. What would the challenges be? Most of us are familiar with megabytes per day of usage and gigabytes per month. But an autonomous vehicle, for instance, will generate through its sensors and navigational capabilities gigabytes per hour, and terabytes per day and perhaps petabytes per month. You can’t transport that amount of data, from say 150,000 cars, simultaneously. Your network infrastructure will grind to a halt. How will the network of the future be? With 5G, you will move from the network being a dimension for Internet telephony and mobile broadband, to the interconnectedness of everything. Smartphone and PC traffic, thought of as the burden of the network, will represent a small proportion of the network bandwidth and traffic. So what Intel is doing is really reinventing the fabric of network architecture to be able to embed the compute and storage capabilities in the network elements themselves. The network of the future will have more capability to adapt and evolve as the load and nature of the traffic changes. So concepts such as network function virtualisation and software-defined network would become very important. 5G will offer capabilities like network slicing. An operator can basically say my network is no longer a monolith. A part of the network capacity can be sliced and offered to a customer over here and create a virtual private network for that person. We hear a lot about the way Artificial Intelligence will change our world. How much is hype and how much is reality? There is a difference between setting a vision and practical implementation of that vision. I am sure when Orville and Wilbur Wright were going to emulate a bird and fly in the sky, a lot of people probably thought it is just as aspirational as having an automated car. Maybe having cars driving around without drivers is utopian. But in an urban situation, if you move into autonomous control of the car, and you plug in a route, your route could be centrally planned. Traffic is distributed more optimally around various roads, so that everybody has a predictable way of getting to a certain location, as opposed to everybody thinking they know the fastest route and everyone taking that route. Just as flight safety has been helped by the autopilot technology, it could be applicable to a vehicle as well. We have in many countries fairly advanced forms of automated driving, like for example, lane deviation, and we are very close to a point where you can go into a semi-automated driving mode. It is more of a legislative environment rather than the technology setting the timeline. In the context of rapid digitisation in the country, are you partnering with projects? The Indian government has made some very bold visions of the future through its Digital India initiatives, and a lot of the visions of the Prime Minister and the government in that regard are aligned closely with Intel’s view of the world. There are a lot of opportunities for us, and one of the things we are trying to figure out is what is the right constellation of partnerships and key activities. Anything specific you are looking at? When the time is appropriate, we will be able to say more. But certainly for us, India represents a tremendous opportunity, because our general strategic thinking is very much aligned with the whole Digital India programme, and there are a number of key players within India that have aligned thinking with Intel’s.

It is so popular, that there have been a lack of reports for Apple’s other iPhone models, the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus. Much of the tech news for months now have been coverings rumors of the said phone ranging from assembly issues to component specifications. That said, there were new reports from last week that might shed some light on Apple’s upcoming flagship phone. There reports pertain to issues like the phone’s wireless modem, its size, and the vertical dual camera on its back. More Intel wireless modems on the iPhone 8 Apple has been known to use Qualcomm-made wireless modems on the iPhone. In fact, back in 2016, 70 percent of the iPhones sold used a chip that was manufactured by Qualcomm. However, it seems like this year and the years to come, Apple will be favoring Intel-made wireless modems more and more. According to a report from Digitimes last week, Apple has increased the order volume for Intel wireless modems to 50 percent. This is a considerable increase since last year, only 30 percent of the iPhones sold contain wireless chips from Intel. Alleged iPhone 8 mockups (by Benjamin Geskin) The fallout between Apple and Qualcomm is said to be due to the ongoing legal battle between the two companies. To those unaware, Apple withheld around $1 billion of royalty to Qualcomm on the count of “unfair monopoly” on its mobile wireless technology. Qualcomm then retaliated by asking the US Trade Commission to ban the import of iPhone devices to the United States. To make matters worse, some of Apple’s suppliers have also follow suit in not paying the chip maker of its royalties. iPhone 8 size On a slightly more interesting topic, last week, the guys at iDrop News were kind enough to share what they think the iPhone 8 would look like when released. Furthermore, the website also shared additional images of the iPhone 8 renders showing how big it will be compared to other smartphones. In one of the images, it can be seen that the new phone is only slightly taller than the 4.7-inch iPhone 7. Meanwhile, compared to the Samsung Galaxy S8, the iPhone 8 is a bit wider as well as shorter. iPhone 8 size comparison with Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ (via idropnews.com) On other notes, these renders are based on the leaks that were shared online a few weeks ago. Most of these leak have come from Benjamin Geskin, a known iPhone leaker. In addition to mockups shown by Geskin, there were also images of alleged CAD drawings of the iPhone 8 on the Internet. Vertical dual camera Also last week, apart from the mockup units shared by Geskin, Slashleaks also leaked the CAD drawing that has been the basis of the renders done by iDrop News. In the said CAD leaks, it can be seen that dual camera setup for the iPhone 8 is in vertical position. This new leak strengthens the earlier rumors about the said camera setup. Furthermore, one can see from the image that the cameras are separated by the LED flash. iPhone 8 CAD drawing (via slashleaks.com) Another interesting bit about this leak is the circular outline near the rear cameras. Some experts speculated that this might be the Touch ID sensor for the iPhone 8. On the other hand, there are still some that say this may not be the fingerprint sensor at all. Instead, it could be the location for the usual Apple logo of the device. For more updates on the iPhone 8, be sure to check us out at TheBitbag.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Technology Autonomous cars to spur new ‘passenger economy’ Autonomous cars to spur new ‘passenger economy’ Technology company Intel has revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realised economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. By: FE Bureau | Published: June 5, 2017 3:53 AM Intel study estimates the value of goods and services in the early years of the ‘passenger economy’ will be more than twice the size of the ‘sharing economy’ Technology company Intel has revealed the findings from a new study that explores the yet-to-be-realised economic potential when today’s drivers become idle passengers. Coined the ‘Passenger Economy’ by Intel and prepared by analyst firm Strategy Analytics, the study predicts an explosive economic trajectory growing from $800 billion in 2035 to $7 trillion by 2050. “Digital business models ushered in by personal computing, internet, ubiquitous connectivity and smartphones gave birth to whole new economies. Autonomous driving will do the same,” the report noted. “Companies must start thinking about their autonomous strategy,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. “Less than a decade ago, no one was talking about the potential of a soon-to-emerge app or sharing economy because no one saw it coming. This is why we started the conversation around the passenger economy early, to wake people up to the opportunity streams that will emerge when cars become the most powerful mobile data generating devices we use and people swap driving for riding.” You may also like to watch: Key report highlights: – Business use of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is expected to generate $3 trillion in revenues, or 43% of passenger economy. – Consumer use of MaaS offerings is expected to account for $3.7 trillion in revenue, or 55% of total passenger economy. – $200 billion of revenue is expected to be generated from rising consumer use of innovative applications and services that will emerge as pilotless vehicle services evolve. – Conservatively, 585,000 lives can be saved due to self-driving vehicles in the era of passenger economy from 2035 to 2045. – Self-driving vehicles are expected to free more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the most congested cities in the world. – Reductions in public safety costs related to traffic accidents could amount to more than $234 billion over the passenger economy era from 2035-2045. The future scenarios explored in the study include: Car-venience: From onboard salons to touchscreen tables for remote collaboration, fast-casual dining, remote vending, mobile health clinics and treatment pods, and platooning pod hotels, vehicles will become transportation experience pods. Movable movies: Media and content producers will develop custom content formats to match short and long travel times. Location-based advertising: It will become more keenly relevant, and advertisers will be presented with a new realm of possibilities for content brands & location. Mobility-as-a-perk: Employers, offices, apartments, universities and housing estates will offer MaaS to add value to and distinguish their offer from competitors or as part of their compensation package.

Computex is the third major show we attend this year, and it looks like it's here to remind us about all the innovation and work happening in the hardcore computing arena. After all, while mainstream PC sales have stagnated, the segment occupied by computer enthusiasts, gamers, and e-sports has continued to flourish. While CES is simply immense, covering anything from consumer appliances to car tech and everything in-between, and MWC is dedicated to mobile technology and smartphones, Computex is PC power user haven. That notion was fueled this year thanks to AMD's comeback and Intel's announcements to counter those moves. But along with them, there were dozens of relevant announcements during the show (see our Computex 2017 coverage). Now as usual, here's the shortlist of products that caught our attention the most while touring Computex 2017's show floor. Asrock X299-ITX/ac One of the most surprising finds for me at Computex 2017 was Asrock's upcoming Mini-ITX motherboard for Intel Core X processors using that rather large LGA2066 socket. I was on the hunt for a Mini-ITX Ryzen board and instead found this and I have to say it’s a bit of a masterpiece. Despite its small size, the X299-ITX/ac does a really good job of taking full advantage of Intel's X299 platform. Naturally you have support for the Core i9-7980XE, if dropping $2000 on a CPU is a reality for you, quad-channel DDR4 memory via four SO-DIMM slots, three PCIe 3.0 x4 M.2 slots along with the more standard stuff for a small form factor board such as Wi-Fi. Quad-channel memory support is an amazing feat considering the company's X99 model was limited to dual-channel. Not only that but including the kind of VRM required to support 165-watt CPUs on such a small motherboard is an impressive engineering achievement in itself. Gigabyte X399 Aorus Gaming 7 I was really keen to check out AMD X399 boards and there were plenty on display. The Gigabyte X399 Aorus Gaming 7 was the one that stole the show for me. AMD’s Threadripper CPUs support quad-channel memory, so on either side of the massive CPU socket we find four banks of DIMM slots. The DIMMs feature steel reinforcing along with embedded RGB lighting. There are three M.2 slots and one of them is hidden under the chipset heatsink. So Gigabyte has created something similar to MSI’s M.2 Shield, though hopefully this works a little better and it certainly looks like it will. Audio is provided by the Realtek ALC 1220 codec and wired LAN via an embedded Killer E2500 network controller. The CPU will be powered by an 8 plus 4-pin connector, or at least the extra 4-pin will be optional. The demo board on display only featured a 6-phase VRM, but Gigabyte did state that the production model would have an 8-phase Vcore VRM using sporting International Rectifier 3553 MOSFETs, with an IR 35201 for the voltage controller. The board has five PCI-Express x16 slots and an array of OC buttons as well as a diagnostic POST LED. Since X399 will bring support of up-to 64 PCIe Gen3 lanes bringing anything and everything multi-GPU support multi-GPU into play, including full-on quad GPU support, Gigabyte has designed the X399 Aorus Gaming 7 with that in mind. Threadripper will likely see its official announcement late June, with a tentative release date on August 10th. Cooler Master MasterCase H500P This is without question one of the most unique looking computer cases I’ve seen in a very long time. I came to Cooler Master's booth to check out the new Cosmos C700P, however I came across the MasterCase H500P and loved it. This is the latest installment in the HAF (High-Airflow) series. The design manages to be aggressive but also clean and elegant at the same time. The tempered glass side panels and RGB LED lighting help give it some flare as well. Crammed at the front of the case are two 200mm fans which are again RGB lit. They can force a huge amount of air through the case and I really like how they are visible through the front window. Cooler Master has done a good job of showing the cooling off without inhibiting its ability to work efficiently. A clean build can be easily achieved with the help of a two-part PSU cover and several additional covers at the front and backside of the MB tray. The H500P should be available later this year, around September, and should retail for just $140. Corsair Concept Zeus Currently I'm using the Logitech G900, which is great for playing games wirelessly, performance is excellent and certainly lag free. Unfortunately it doesn’t last more than a few days before the cable is required for charging, it’s not a big deal but I do need to make sure the cable is handy at all times. Corsair has set out to solve this minor inconvenience and in doing so attack a few other issues as well. Essentially what they have done is create a Qi charging mousepad, so you can charge your mouse by leaving it on the mouse pad. Additionally, the mouse pad can charge your phone while you’re at the PC. For phones that don’t support Qi wireless charging Corsair has developed a Lightning and micro-USB charging dongle. Corsair says this is still a working concept, not even reaching the prototype phase yet. That said, what they demoed worked well and looked like a complete product to me. The complete mouse specs haven’t been released though Corsair told me they're aiming for a 36 hour run time from a single charge. Intel Core i7-7820X The 8-core/16-thread Core i7-7820X will come in at $600. That means we are seeing a notable 40% reduction in price when compared to the 10-core model and just a 20% reduction in core assets. At that price the 7820X will come in 20% more expensive than AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X, so it will be interesting to learn how the two compare. It comes clocked at 3.6 GHz for all cores but can boost as high as 4.5 GHz, a higher clock speed than what Ryzen can currently achieve. Intel has rated the CPU with a 140 watt TDP. When compared to the Core i9 models which offer 44 PCIe lanes, the 7820X is limited to 28, though this is still plenty for most power users. We anticipate this new 8-core model should be the perfect option for enthusiasts and power users alike. Nvidia Max-Q Design = Thinner gaming laptops Ever since Pascal debuted we started to see slimmer designs on true gaming-capable laptops, most of them powered by the GTX 1060. So while huge and not-very-mobile devices have its place, most gamers will likely be pleased with something more portable to be carried on a daily basis. According to Nvidia’s CEO, Max-Q design will make future machines three times thinner and three times faster than what we have today. Big claim. Nevertheless, backing up Jen-Hsun Huang's words, several laptop manufacturers are readying their first wave of Max-Q laptops to debut as soon as late June. Vendors include Acer, Alienware, Asus, Clevo, Gigabyte, Hasee, HP, Lenovo, Maingear, MSI, Origin PC, Sager, Scan and XoticPC. Various parts of the laptops are optimized and refined through Max-Q, such as its overall design, chips, game drivers, thermal and electrical components, and Pascal-based GPUs. So, expect super-slim, power-efficient laptops with GTX 1060, GTX 1070, and GTX 1080 cards that perform better without overheating. Huang demonstrated a Max-Q laptop, the Asus Rog Zephyrus, powered by a GTX 1080 using a slim 5-pound body. Certainly looking forward to it. MSI Lightning Z GTX 1080 Ti MSI’s Lightning range is one of my favorite graphics cards series. The previous GTX 980 Ti and R9 290X models were particularly good, however unless you were building a black and yellow themed rig they did look out of place. This time around MSI has gone with a more neutral black, white and silver theme. As you might have guessed providing the bling is a plethora of RGB lighting, though MSI has done a nice job here. Using translucent plastic to carry the light from the source, it provides a really sleek effect, similar to how G.Skill’s RGB memory looks. Fancy lighting aside the GTX 1080 Ti Lightning Z looks to be the real deal. Strapped onto the PCB is a bulky 2.5 slot cooler with triple Torx 2.0 fans. The fans force air over two massive arrays of aluminum fins which are connected using over half a dozen copper heatpipes. Flipping the card over we find a beautifully crafted backplate featuring some cool looking cut-outs and a good peak at that translucent acrylic strip for the RGB lighting. MSI has gone with a 14+3 power phase design and a double up design which helps to spread the thermal load. Onboard MSI uses International Rectifier controllers and advertises a board TDP of 350 watts which is 100 watts above Nvidia’s reference spec. The card carries three PCIe 8-pin connectors, each capable of delivering up to 150 watts of power, so that’s pretty insane. The Lightning Z supports three clock profiles. Out of the box the card runs in the Gaming mode (slightly overclocked), but there's also silent and Lighting which takes it to more extreme clock speeds. Around the I/O end, connectivity includes dual link DVI outputs, dual HDMI 2.0 outputs and two DisplayPorts. There’s no official word on availability or pricing yet, but MSI tells us to expect more details in the coming month. Asus ROG Strix XG32VQ The most impressive gaming monitor on display was the Asus ROG Strix XG32VQ, a gorgeous looking 31.5” curved IPS panel. The display is curved on an 1800R radius for a better view of the far edges and corners. As this is an IPS panel view angles are great offering 178° so the picture quality is preserved even if the viewer is not facing the screen dead on. Resolution-wise, we are looking at WQHD 2560x1440 and Asus says they have prioritized performance over pixel density, so this is a 144Hz panel. Inputs include dual DisplayPort 1.2 ports and one HDMI 2.0 port. Also included are a pair of USB 3.0 ports. Asus believes given its size and flexibility, it’s easy to see the Strix XG32VQ replacing a traditional TV in dorm rooms and small apartments, especially for cord cutters addicted to streaming Netflix, YouTube, and Twitch. AMD Ryzen 9 "Threadripper" CPU AMD is hard at work on a new line of CPUs that will bring its Zen architecture to the high-end desktop market. From 10-core (20-thread) chips working at 125W TDPs, all the way up to the crowning jewel of AMD’s upcoming enthusiast lineup: the Ryzen 9 1998 and 1998X, 16-core / 32-thread monsters with a base / boost clock of 3.2GHz / 3.6GHz and 3.5GHz / 3.9GHz, respectively, and 155W TDPs. All Ryzen Threadripper CPUs will have quad channel DDR4 support as well as the full 64 PCIe Gen3 lanes. That is 20 more lanes than Intel’s highest end Skylake-X Core i9 processors and incredibly 40 more lanes than its 8-core and 6 core Core i7 models. So AMD has Intel against the ropes when it comes to PCI Express lanes, those X399 motherboards are going to be quite incredible. Now, if all these multi-threaded talk doesn't excite you, how about AMD putting more pressure to Intel to take them out of their comfort zone. Also, more affordable Ryzen 7 processors. Woot! Image credit: PC Gamer Thermaltake Level 20 This beautiful creation is a concept chassis that Thermaltake has been working on for a very long time. The case looks like it'd lend itself well to a modular type design, almost like a Lego block PC, but Thermaltake was not sharing full details at the show. What they did say is that each chamber is designed to house different hardware. For example, at the front of the case you can install radiators, fans, pumps and reservoirs like Thermaltake have in this demo build, or you could simply fill it with storage drives. Then up the top we obviously have the power supply and this module also houses all the front I/O. Finally, we have the largest module which houses the motherboard, graphics card, and so on. The glass panels all open on hinges and this provides easy access to the hardware inside. I have to say coming from the Level 10's unique but also highly impractical design, the Level 20 not only looks better but I feel like this is a case you could easily live with. MSI GT75VR Titan MSI had plenty of new gaming laptops on display at Computex this year, and the GT75VR Titan was the biggest and beefiest of them. This high-end laptop can be configured in one of three ways: a single GTX 1080, dual GTX 1070 SLI, or just a single GTX 1070. Helping unleash all that GPU power is the Core i7-7820HK processor and that’s one of the most powerful Kaby Lake-H CPUs available right now. The GT75VR Titan also sports a mechanical keyboard with customizable per-key RGB lighting. This keyboard is the first mechanical type to be designed specifically for a gaming laptop. The previous GT80 Titan, for example, was a 18.4-inch monster using a mechanical keyboard that was essentially designed for desktop use. The new Titan is considerably more portable with a 17” footprint and a low-profile tactile keyboard. The keyboard was designed by SteelSeries and I have to say despite the low profile, the feedback is excellent. Complementing the new keyboard is a really nice palm rest that has a diamond-shaped cut around the offset arrow keys. This is a softer material than the hard plastic or brush aluminum that most gamers are used to. MSI tells me there will be multiple 17.3” screen options. The base model is a 1080p TN panel supporting a 120Hz refresh rate, but if you go for the GTX 1080 option or even the dual 1070’s then perhaps the 4K option with 100% Adobe RBG coverage will be the way to go. If you prefer, a 1080p IPS version will be offered as well though not many details were given about that config. The Titan is designed to be a full-on desktop replacement with space for up to 64GB DDR4 RAM, a 2.5-inch HDD and two NVMe M.2 SSDs. Everything mentioned so far is great, but what ultimately caught my eye was the stuff inside. MSI was keen to show us their new Cooler Boost 5 solution which allows the laptop's CPU to overclock all the way to 4GHz. The system combines two Whirlwind Blade fans with 12 heat pipes and four ventilation points. Pricing info is yet unknown for the various configurations, but you can bet they won’t be cheap.

The most essential element of a custom PC build is buying the best gaming computer processor on the market today.  You know, the little piece of hardware that drives every application you’ll run, every game you’ll play, and everything else you can do on your PC. Moreover, building your own gaming PC is always the best route to go when you’re looking to get the best bang for your buck. Sure, you could go to some big box retailer, pick something off of the shelf, go home and play most games. But, the problem with doing that is that you’re spending a great deal more compared to if you were to build your own rig. So with that in mind, don’t spare too little expense on a best gaming computer processor. With computer hardware, it’s typically true that you get what you pay for. Here are Gadget Review’s top picks for the best gaming computer processors currently available. Best Gaming Computer Processor 2016 #1 Pick  Intel Core i7-6700K The Intel Core i7-6700K is the top-of-the-line option. Price: $344.99 | Speed: 4 GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Instant on technology, highest performing Intel i7 processor Intel’s 6th Generation Intel Core processors have finally arrived, and the Intel Core i7-6700K is the top-notch option for those who want to spare no expense. It offers blazing fast speeds and comes packed with useful features that will take your PC gaming to the next level. Not only will it play any high-end game you throw at it, it’ll also run any 3D game in the highest resolution available, offering better details and faster frame rates. In fact, Intel claims it’s 30X better 3D graphics than a five year old PC. What’s more, the card features Instant On technology that allows your PC to resume full functionality in under 0.5 seconds. It has 4 cores, and it supports up to 64GB of memory. The processor also has 8MB Intel Smart Cache. It runs quietly and it’s easily cooled, so you don’t have to worry about having a loud PC or frame rate drops. I’ll note that this processor can be overclocked easily to 4.5 GHz if you’ve got the proper power supply to do so, although Intel recommends going no higher than 4.2GHz. Still, it’s the best gaming Intel processor available, which is why three out of our five best gaming PCs 2016 use the i7-6700K. View on Amazon #2 Pick  AMD Octa-core FX 9590 Price: $228.76 | Speed: 4.7GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: AMD’s most powerful card can be overclocked to a whopping 5.0GHz. The AMD Octa-core FX-9590 is AMD’s best option, so if you plan on building an AMD build — which I personally have, myself — you won’t find a better option than this. In fact, when I’m looking for the best gaming computer parts, I typically start with AMD because of their significant savings. Without any overclocking or tweaks, the FX-9590 pushes out an impressive 4.7 GHz, and it comes in at under $250 ($228 at the time of writing this). If there were an official measurement of cost/speed, the 9590 would be the best option. Most notably, you can push this card to 5.0GHz using AMD’s own tools, and you can likely take it a step further if you’re feeling risky (although, I have not personally tried). Unfortunately, AMD gets a bad wrap in the gaming computer, and is often looked down upon by elitists, so great AMD options often get overlooked. But, the FX-9590 is getting rave reviews, with many praising the speed you’re getting for the cost. It offers a full eight cores to deliver impressive performance by the most demanding games, allowing for those who seek ultra-high resolutions to achieve their goal with ease (and without breaking the bank). Note: AMD has a compatible list of motherboards that will work with this powerful gaming processor, and for now, it’s relatively short when compared to a high-end Intel card. Before purchasing, make sure you can get a motherboard that works with it (as you should always do when building your own rig). View on Amazon #3 Pick  Intel Core i5-6500 You won’t beat an i5-6500 for $200. Price: $199.99 | Speed: 3.20GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Best gaming CPU under $200. If you are planning to go the budget route, the Intel Core i5-6500 is the best gaming computer processor under $200 on the market. It runs cooler than the previous generation of i5 processors, and it consumes less power. Admittedly, you’re not gaining a major performance boost if you already own a previous generation i5 processor, but you don’t really need one (and there is a slight boost in power). It has a 3.2GHz processing speed out of the box, and it can be boosted to up to 3.6GHz safely, without worrying about damaging your PC. It has four cores, and it automatically allocates processor power to the applications that need it the most, making it incredibly efficient in its use of those four cores. It has a 6MB Intel Smart Cache. View on Amazon #4 Pick  AMD FX-8320 Black Edition Don’t let AMD’s past dictate your opinion; their 8 core processors are incredible, and much cheaper than Intel counterparts. Price: $131 | Speed: 3.5GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: Best processor under $150. Can be overclocked to 4.0GHz, and you can buy it with a 256GB SSD for just $75 more. Need power and not too much cost? The AMD FX-8320 Black Edition is a great choice if you’re building an AMD-based build. It uses 125W of power, but it uses that power well. What makes it so appealing is its price. At under $150, it’s a price that any PC builder on a budget can swallow. It can handle running numerous apps at one time, and your multitasking could certainly use a powerful processor like this one. With a full eight cores (that’s right, eight cores for under $150), you can reach up to 4.0GHz safely (although, I’ve read reports of those overclocking to 4.2GHz without any issues). I will note that the stock cooling “solutions” that come with it aren’t really up to par, and you should probably pick up a better CPU cooler if you want this thing to run as best as possible. View on Amazon – $199 #5 Pick  Intel Core i7-4790 Price: $305 | Speed: 3.6GHz WHY IT’S A TOP PICK: A great i7 option that comes in at $40 cheaper than its successors. If you’re looking to save a buck or two on an Intel i7 CPU, your best option is the Intel Core i7-4790. Sure, you’re not getting all of the bells and whistles that the 6700K has, but you’re still getting a high-end gaming computer processor that can stand up to most everything you throw at it. You can’t overclock it, at least there aren’t any tools offered by Intel, themselves, to overclock it. So if you’re looking to really push your PC to the limits, you might want to consider the 6700K above. But if price is more important to you than squeezing out every last ounce of speed, the i7-4790 is a good choice. It’s compatible with Z87 and Z97 motherboards. View on Amazon – $305 Key Factors and Features to a Good Gaming Computer Processor Price: One of the most important factors to consider when buying a gaming computer processor are its price. For price, you’re going to want to consider what is included versus what isn’t included, whether you’re going to need a different cooling option or if the stock one works well enough.  To that end, if a processor has exceeded its typical refresh cycle, you might be best to wait as pricing will go down for that model or a new one will appear. Games You Plan to Play: If you plan to play games like Hearthstone or CS:Go or League of Legends, you’re definitely not going to need to purchase the top-notch, best-of-the-best gaming processor. Instead, you’re going to want to go for the budget option that might not be as fast, but it’ll still run those games at full speed. Conversely, if you plan to play Battlefield 1 on ultra settings when it comes out, or The Witcher 3 without sacrificing graphical fidelity, you’re going to want to purchase the absolute best. Motherboard Cost: When you buy a CPU, you also need to buy a motherboard that will allow you to use that specific CPU (and the newer the CPU, the harder the time you’ll have finding a motherboard to match it). More importantly, if you don’t already have a motherboard that will allow you to use the CPU you want, you’ll have to buy a motherboard with it. So even if the CPU you want is a great price, how much is a motherboard to go along with it? Mistakes to Avoid Avoiding AMD: Avoiding AMD would be a grave mistake. PC gamers tend to shy away from AMD based on its initial run of high-end processors, but they’ve come a long way over the past five years, and they’re now a much more formidable foe for Intel. Cheaping Out: Paying more now might save you in the long run. CPUs are a fast-evolving technology, and new processors are introduced every couple of years, at least. So if you buy a top-notch CPU right now, you won’t need to upgrade again for a few years. However, if you buy a middling CPU, you’re going to have to pay again to upgrade sooner. Which Gaming Processor is Right For You This list includes a fairly wide spectrum of prices. For some, it’ll come down to price per power. It all depends on what you have in your PC already, or if you’re building a fresh new build and will need to purchase other things to go along with it (like a better cooler, a completely new motherboard, etc). There are other factors to consider when looking to speed up your PC so that it will run the latest games, but you should always start with the processor and motherboard combination that best fits your budget and the types of games you intend to play.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → WWDC Hardware  June 4, 2017June 4, 2017 ⌘ Permalink WWDC has been, for most of its run, a software show. Numerous new versions of macOS have first appeared there over the years, and summer iOS announcements settled into place once the iPhone 4S introduced the era of fall iPhone hardware releases. That’s not to say Apple has not done hardware at WWDC since. However, hardware releases at the conference need to either serve the software story, or fit with the developer-heavy audience. Examples of the former are hard to come by in the modern age. My favorite example from before the iPhone 4S-inspired calendar shift may be the Intel Developer Transition Kit, which prepared developers for the transition from PowerPC to Intel processors. It was introduced as part of the Intel announcement at WWDC 2005, and Intel Macs started rolling out just a handful of months later. The biggest hardware announcement at WWDC in the recent era has to be the original MacBook Pro with Retina display. It checked both boxes; software developers had to prepare their Mac apps, and the hardware was well-suited to power users. That brings us to tomorrow’s keynote. There are rumors of refreshed MacBook Pros, which would please power users who have felt neglected in recent years. That always-rumored-but-never-released 10.5″ iPad Pro would be a great way to showcase new iOS 11 iPad goodies, and appeal to the pro iPad users in the crowd. Then there’s the Siri Speaker. The timing of this is very interesting to me. Apple could pre-announce it at WWDC, and ship it in the coming weeks or months. If it comes with SiriKit support, and if Apple expands that in iOS 11, does it make sense to launch it now with SiriKit being limited to such a small handful of app categories in iOS 10?1 Rumors say that the thing may already be in production. If that’s true, I expect the initial emphasis won’t be on apps as much as it is on things like Apple Music and overall sound quality. That may help keep the Siri Speaker out of the same “what is this supposed to do for me” rut that the Apple Watch fell into after launch. If Apple announces the Siri Speaker, regardless of a ship date, it would mark the return of meaningful hardware announcements to the WWDC stage. That is always fun. I’ve been thinking a lot about the Siri Speaker being like the Apple Watch: tethered to a single iPhone where the real computing happens. I can see why Apple would do that. It would let SiriKit apps run as extensions (again, like the Watch) without much configuration needed by the user. However, these devices are best used in a place like the kitchen, where multiple user support is important. Amazon isn’t doing anything there, and Google has just really dipped its toe in the water. What if the Siri Speaker could know who is talking, and load up the right stuff based on voice? App extensions from a single iPhone wouldn’t scale to something like that. I’m probably being too hopeful. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Sponsor: Working Copy Your sourcecode, websites, and images on your tablet and phone, even when offline.

Images captured by the drone will offer visual data on pitch conditions such as grass cover, grass health, and topology, which will be used to generate daily pitch reports leveraged by commentators during broadcasts.   Bat Sensor This one is a new solution. In this, a sensor powered by the Intel Curie technology that can be mounted on any cricket bat to generate data for every stroke that the batsman plays. With this technology, parameters like back-lift, bat speed and follow-through can be tracked for every cricket stroke. Former English Captain turned commentator, Nasser Hussain, said “ technology has and will continue to impact cricket in a lot of ways positively. Player performance, Game strategy, adjudication and fan experiences will all change with the introduction of new technologies to the sport.”   Virtual Reality At the stadium,   Intel is also creating Virtual Reality (VR) experience zones for spectators as well players. Using a head-mounted display (HMD), the player will be able to test his or her batting skill against a virtual bowler.   Intel ICC 2017 First Published : Wednesday, May 31, 2017 - 11:07 Advertisement Similar News Motorola Moto Z2 Play vs OnePlus 3T: Who will come out strong?

Prices start at $1299 for the new MacBook models. That’s the price for either an entry-level MacBook or a 13 inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar. Apple’s latest MacBook supports up to a 1.3 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, measures about half an inch thick, and weighs about 2 pounds. Apple says it now supports up to twice as much memory as earlier models. The new 13 inch MacBook Pro is available with up to a 3.5 GHz Core i7 processor, and the 15 inch models now come with discrete graphics on all models. The new MacBook Pro 13 inch laptop with Touch Bar starts at $1799, while the new 15 inch MacBook Pro starts at $2399. Apple is also updating the MacBook Air with a more modest spec bump: the company says it’s giving it a CPU “megahertz” bump to bring it a bit more in line with the company’s other laptops. The new Apple laptops should be available starting today, and they’ll all support the new features in Mac OS X High Sierra that Apple’s introducing at WWDC today, including a speeider version of the Safari web browser (with automatic blocking of auto-playing videos), improved Mail and Photos apps, and more. Apple is also updating its iMac line of all-in-one desktops.

(Apple) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn & Mike Murphy June 05, 2017 Apple’s annual developer conference felt especially like a show for consumers this year, with announcements of seven laptop updates, a new iMac Pro desktop computer, a new iPad, and a new home smart speaker called the HomePod. But Apple also had something for developers: new versions of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Apple computers, which will be available to consumers this Fall. Augmented reality, a theme of recent Google I/O and Facebook F8 developer conferences, also made an appearance on the San Jose stage. Apple spent significant time talking and demoing its ARKit, a set of tools for developers to use the iPhone and iPad camera lenses to overlay digital objects on the world, like in the popular mobile game Pokémon Go. However, the coming changes announced today that might be most important to users are things Apple didn’t talk talk about. Based on a presentation slide shown onstage but not discussed by company reps, the new iOS 11 will bring a slew of little changes meant to make life easier, like a one-handed keyboard for little thumbs reaching across gargantuan screens, and easier wi-fi sharing. Here’s a rundown of all the news. HomePod The HomePod, with Siri. (Apple) Apple unveiled its answer to the Amazon Echo and the Google Home: a squat, 7-inch speaker called the HomePod. The fabric-covered smart speaker can do pretty much everything an Echo or Home can do, from controlling internet-of-things devices, to playing music, providing updates on your calendar, and answering general questions. You control it by talking to Siri, Apple’s digital assistant (who isn’t known for consistently providing the most reliable of responses). The HomePod features seven tweeters and a 4-inch woofer that Apple suggests will provide sound that will “rock the house.” The device comes in black or white, and will be available in December for $349—or about $200 more than Amazon and Google’s costliest speaker models, for roughly the same functionality. New iPads For a while now, Apple has been trying to convince us that, for the average person, the iPad is a worthy replacement for a laptop. After today’s announcements, that may finally be true. Apple debuted a new version of its massive 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and a new 10.5-inch model with smaller bezels. Both feature brighter screens and faster processors. But what really sets them apart is the new software they’ll come with: iOS 11, the next iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system, expected to launch in the autumn. Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro running the forthcoming iOS 11 software. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) A new app called Files gives iPad users access to all the files on their device in one place, so you can actually find photos to attach to a tweet, or a spreadsheet to add to an email. You can even drag and drop files right from one window to another, just like you would on a computer. You can float apps as windows from the iPad’s dock, or have them in split-screen, giving the iPad the feel of something you might actually be able to put into a bag and feel confident taking with you instead of a laptop—assuming you purchase an Apple Pencil and keyboard case to go with it, of course. The new iPads start at $649 (for the 10.5-inch) and $799 (for the 12.9-inch), and are available today. Apple expects them to start shipping next week. iMac Pro There’s a new Mac in town. Apple previewed the iMac Pro, a new version of its iMac desktop that only comes in its “space grey” color. Other than its more aggressive coloring, it also features some powerful innards: It can hold up to a 4 TB solid-state hard drive, 128 GB of memory, as well as run two 5K monitors and two RAID data storage arrays at once. The iMac has its own 27-inch 5K screen and a new cooling system that Apple says can run 80% cooler than its other iMacs, allowing it to run far more efficiently. The super-powered iMac Pro starts at $4,999, and will be available in December. Making sure the iMac Pro looks just right. (Quartz/Mike Murphy) New Macs and MacBooks On top of the new iMac Pro, Apple refreshed just about its entire line of Macs today. The MacBook and MacBook Pro laptops received new processors, featuring Intel’s new “Kaby Lake” processors, with speeds up to 3.5 GHz. Its non-Pro iMacs also got some upgrades: New iMacs will also feature Intel’s new processors, as well as faster hard drives, new graphics cards, brighter screens, and a new Thunderbolt 3 port. Both the iMacs, the new MacBook, and MacBook Pros will all start at $1,299, and are available today. Apple also revived its long-sidelined MacBook Air, upgrading it to a slightly more powerful 1.8 GHz processor. But the Air still doesn’t have a HD Retina display—like every other Mac computer. VR on Macs One of the more surprising announcements at the convention was that Apple is now working to support virtual reality systems on its computers. Onstage, a team from Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), the special-effects arm of Lucasfilm (the company behind Star Wars), showed a demonstration of Darth Vader roving around a lava planet breathing dramatically while surveying some destroyed starships, running on an iMac through an HTC Vive VR headset connect. A video showed an ILM employee walking through the Star Wars planet as Darth Vader walked by her. After the keynote, journalists could try out the Vader demo, as well as a few games from the HTC Vive library. The experience felt no different than it did playing on a Windows computer. Apple even had VR headsets connected up to MacBook Pro laptops, which however did require an external graphics card to power the VR experience. There's actual demos of the HTC Vive running on Macs and I thought it was as neat as the Windows experience is #WWDC2017 pic.twitter.com/KqIyWv4qIu — Mike Murphy (@mcwm) June 5, 2017 While these demonstrations were just proofs of concept of what Apple systems could do with VR, they do suggest Apple is taking the medium more seriously and that more could be in store—especially when one considers that the primary audience of today’s keynote was the myriad developers who build games and apps for the company’s existing platforms. iOS The annual iOS update is here. (Apple) Perhaps the most impactful announcements Apple made today concerned iOS, its mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads. Rather than redesigning the entire experience, Apple decided to change specific pieces of the software and add new features into existing platforms like iMessage and Siri. iPhone owners will now be able to use Apple Pay to transfer money between each other, much like the popular Venmo app. Of course, because Apple Pay requires a phone made by Apple, you won’t be able to easily send money to your friends who have a Google Pixel, which might still give Venmo an edge. Swiping up from the bottom of the iPhone screen will reveal a new Control Center, the bevy of buttons used to manipulate things like wireless connectivity, screen brightness, and music. The new Control Center is all on one screen, rather than a series of pages that the user swipes through. There is also a dedicated button for turning cellular signal on and off, great for the times when you don’t want to lose signal to Bluetooth headphones, like on an airplane. Best of all, it’s finally customizable, so you can create your shortcuts in your own image. Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, wasn’t neglected either. Apple says Siri will be in even more places on the phone, reading iMessages and browsing history to help predict when you want to see information, create events, or even type certain words. Siri can also now translate English to Chinese, French, German, and a few other languages. You’ll also be able to type messages to Siri—instead of just talking to it—making it so much more than just a voice assistant. On the iPad, iOS 11 will bring an entirely new app switcher and bottom dock (like the one on traditional Mac laptops), as well as a new file explorer app. Called Files (nice), the app attempts to turn the iPad into a viable work machine; trying to put files in a folder or work with a few files at once on an iPad was previously a Sisyphean task. It’s not really a iOS feature per se, but Apple is also redesigning its entire App Store for the first time since its creation. A new “Today” tab will emphasize recently released apps, and there’s a dedicated section for games. Then, as mentioned earlier, the final iOS 11 presentation slide revealed a slew of other features not discussed by Apple execs onstage—but that will significantly change the iPhone and iPad experience for most users. To name a few: There’s now one-handed typing, where holding down the emoji key on the virtual keyboard brings all the keys closer to your preferred thumb, making it easier to tap out messages while holding a coffee or crying baby. There’s also a new way to set up your iOS device: Just hold it near one of your old ones, and a new setup process will automatically import data from that device’s iCloud. macOS High Sierra MacOS has a new name: High Sierra. Apple made a significant tweak under the hood, changing the way files are constructed and stored into a different proprietary format. This will likely speed up some operations like copying files, but doesn’t really mean much for the average user. It will probably still be a nightmare to transfer large files between Mac and Windows environments. Other than the new file system, nothing groundbreaking is happening on MacOS. watchOS 4 Smarter notifications. (Apple) Is the fourth time the charm for the Apple Watch? Since the device launched in April 2015, Apple’s premiere wearable has had three complete iterations on its operating system. They just can’t seem to get it right. But that’s okay, because nobody really has—smartwatch software is generally terrible. Apple is trying a slightly different approach this time, with a Siri-backed watch face. Based on a variety of factors, like the time of day, amount exercised, and location, Siri will suggest information that you might want to see. Given Apple’s past problems with slow load times on the Watch, we’ll have to see whether this feature is quick enough to be actually useful. Other faces added include a kaleidoscope and Toy Story characters for some reason. The Workouts app is being overhauled for easier use, and Apple has partnered with gym equipment manufacturers so Watches can sync with them for better health data. But unless your gym changes its equipment every year on an Apple hardware cycle, you probably shouldn’t get too hyped about using this feature in coming months. Apple TV Amazon Prime Video is coming to Apple TV, and that’s about all Apple had to say about its streaming device. AR Kit Augmented reality is Silicon Valley’s buzzword du jour, dragged into the public eye by the insane popularity of Pokemon Go last year. If you’re not familiar, here’s the basic idea: you use your phone (or tablet) camera as an oracle to glimpse into a world where digital objects are laid over reality. A digital dog pees on your rug, but there is no stain afterwards. A cup of tea sits on your table but you cannot drink it. The idea is interesting, but in practice it feels silly to move around a tiny glass window in order to peek into a massive digital world that doesn’t do all that much. Following the trend— at Google’s I/O keynote the company also gave developers a group of augmented reality tools—Apple released AR Kit, tools for developers to build AR experiences for iOS devices. Where will iOS developers decide to put place digital teacups? That’s for us to find out, and personally we cannot wait.

Previously, the Air started with a 1.6 GHz processor. So it should be a little bit faster. Apple did not say the processor boost includes a jump to Intel's latest "Kaby Lake" generation of processors, however, as it did with the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook on Monday. Instead, the MacBook Air will stick with Intel's years-old "Broadwell" chips, which are well behind the latest generation in terms of overall performance and battery efficiency.  Beyond that, Apple did not announce any changes to the new MacBook Air’s display or general design, so the rest of the laptop is about the same. View photos macbook airMore (Flickr/Matthew Pearce) That's not ideal: While the Air’s keyboard, trackpad, battery life, and general build quality are still above-average, the display is less vivid and substantially less sharp than competing laptops these days. Other devices have also managed to pack more power in designs that are slimmer, have smaller borders around the display, and support the newer USB-C standard. At its core, the Air is still a laptop from 2015.  Nevertheless, compared to other Apple laptops, the MacBook Air remains the most affordable of the bunch. It still starts at $999 — which gets you the older Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage — and goes up to $1,549 as you max out the specs. But with the MacBook providing a more svelte design, and with Apple slashing the entry price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar) to $1,299 on Monday, it seems clearer that the company is ready to phase out its long-popular notebook — regardless of how popular it may continue to be.

There was a lot discussed on stage, far more than just six items, but they boil down to a few key topics. Here's what you might have missed if you didn't tune in. 1. watchOS 4 show chapters Apple unveils new operating system for the Apple Watch    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 4:14 PM ET | 03:45 Apple unveiled watchOS 4 on Monday, the newest version of the operating system for the Apple Watch. It features a couple of new watch faces, the most important of which puts Siri cards front and center. They can tell you things like when to leave for work, the music you're playing, how your workout is going and more. WatchOS 4 has a new workout UI, support for two-way data exchange with workout machines and more. 2. macOS High Sierra show chapters Apple announces new MacOS at Worldwide Developers Conference    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 1:28 PM ET | 05:10 macOS High Sierra is the successor to Sierra, announced last year. It supports virtual reality headsets, something Apple hasn't ever offered before, security improvements to Safari that help further protect your privacy, new photo search features and a new Apple File System by default, which should mean more secure storage. High Sierra will be available in the coming months. 3. New iMacs and MacBook Air / MacBook Pro refreshes show chapters Apple unveils revamped iMac Pro desktop computers at WWDC    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 3:57 PM ET | 05:26 Apple finally refreshed the iMac after more than 600 days without doing so, adding a sharper and brighter display and new Intel processors. It also brought those seventh-generation Intel processors over to the MacBook Pro, which is otherwise unchanged, and boosted the speed of the chip in the MacBook Air. The biggest announcement was the iMac Pro, however, which will start at $4,999 and includes beefy new processors, a 5K display and a sharp design. Apple said it's "the most powerful Mac we have ever made." 4. iOS 11 show chapters Apple details upgrades to iOS    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 4:20 PM ET | 06:00 Apple's iOS 11 will launch in September and includes new features for the iPhone and iPad. The big takeaway here is improvements to Siri, which Apple says will make it easier to synchronize your various iOS devices, like iPhones and iPads. It also said it'll keep messages in the cloud, helping to save valuable hard drive storage space. Another big change is peer-to-peer payments, which will allow Apple to compete with Paypal, Square Cash, Venmo and others by allowing iOS users to easily send money to one another. On the iPad, users will find drag and drop, more room for icons in the bottom dock of the screen and more. Oh, and we'll bundle this here since it was huge: Apple unveiled ARKit, which will allow developers to easily create augmented reality apps for iOS devices. 5. iPad Pro 10.5 show chapters Apple just announced a medium-sized iPad Pro    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 3:02 PM ET | 04:48 Apple showed a new iPad Pro 10.5 during the event. It features a brighter display with a faster refresh rate, which is important which watching things like movies or playing games. It also sports a new A10X processor that should improve gaming and overall app performance. That chip and the new screen were also added to Apple's iPad Pro 12.9. Apple did not refresh the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. 6. Apple HomePod speaker show chapters A first look at Apple's HomePod, an Amazon Echo competitor    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 6:09 PM ET | 00:56 The only brand new product announced was the HomePod speaker. It's a Siri-powered smart speaker that allows you to play music, check the traffic, control you smart lights, query sports scores and more. Sound familiar? That's because it's very much like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Apple says its product is better, though, thanks to advanced speakers that will fill your room with music. It'll cost $349 when it launches in December.

Menu Deadline TV Donald Trump Will Not Invoke Executive Privilege To Block James Comey … Home Film TV Awardsline Box Office Business INTL Video Jobs Got A Tip? Breaking News Fox Cancels '24: Legacy,' But Franchise Might Continue Top Stories Box Office Could ‘Mummy’ Be Cruise’s Best Global Bow At $177M? by by Lisa de Moraes Film Coogler & Jordan Reteam For New Movie ‘Wrong Answer’ by by Lisa de Moraes Business Hollywood Credit Unions Near Mega-Merger by by Lisa de Moraes Cosby Trial: Jury Hears Call; Accuser Wraps Testimony TV Donald Trump Will Not Invoke Executive Privilege To Block James Comey Testimony Says Sarah Huckabee Sanders by Lisa de Moraes June 5, 2017 12:12pm 13 TV Breaking News Controversial Politics Donald Trump House Intelligence Commitee James Comey UPDATED with more details from briefing: The White House will not attempt to block former FBI Director James Comey from testifying before the Senate Intel Committee on Thursday, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at Monday’s White House press briefing. Related Samantha Bee: 'Fox & Friends' Serves Trump Daily Breakfast of "Scrambled Islamophobia" Sanders made the major announcement when she got asked if President Donald Trump intended to invoke executive privilege to block Comey’s appearance before the committee. Comey is is expected to be asked about reports he wrote a memo saying Trump tried to pressure him into dropping the FBI’s probe of former NSA Mike Flynn and its Russia probe. “The president’s power to exert exec privilege is very well established,” Sanders began. “However, in order to facilitate a swift and thorough examination of the facts sought by the Senate Intelligence Committee, President Trump will not exert executive privilege regarding James Comey’s scheduled testimony.” In a raucous press briefing Sanders made another banner headline when she called Trump’s Twitter remarks “extremely important,” Sanders said. This, in marked contrast to POTUS surrogates’ talking points just a couple hours earlier. Twitter, Sanders said, “gives him the ability to speak directly to the people without the bias of the media filtering those types of communications. He has, at this point, over 100-plus million contacts through social media and those platforms,” she said, adding, “I think it’s a very important tool for him to be able to utilize.” Reporters in the briefing room seemed stunned by her response. That’s because, Team Trump, having failed entirely to control POTUS’s Twitter tirades, on Monday morning had unveiled a new campaign, in which they blast reporters for paying attention to tweets coming from the President of the United States. Kellyanne Conway, for instance, visited NBC’s Today show to excoriate the press for covering Trump’ explosive weekend and Monday morning tweets, mocking “this obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.” MSNBC anchor Craig Melvin, who was on Today, noted it is Trump’s “preferred method of communication with the American people.” “Not true,” Conway shot back, though Trump’s Twitter activity indicated otherwise. Joining Conway in launching this new campaign, Trump surrogate Sebastian Gorka scolded CNN’s Chris Cuomo for bringing up Trump’s recent tweetpocalypse. Gorka called it “really disappointing” Cuomo was bringing up Trump’s tweets, saying “let’s talk about policy.” “His tweets are the policy,” Cuomo noted. “It’s not policy. It’s social media,” Gorka responded dismissively. In case you missed it, Trump went after the mayor of London hours after seven were killed on the London Bridge and in a pub stabbing.  Trump misquoted London Mayor, who had told citizens not long after the attack that  they should not be alarmed if they saw an increased presence of armed police in the area. Trump misquoted the mayor thusly: At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017 Later, when the mayor addressed Trump’s mis-characterization of his remarks, Trump, in character, punched back: Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 Asked why Trump is “picking a fight with the mayor of London in the aftermath of the horrific attack, Sanders insisted, “I don’t see president picking a fight with the mayor of London at all. I think the president’s point  is something he said almost two year ago…about how we have to be more committed to national security.”   Trump also went after his own Department of Justice in his Twitter tirade, and unraveled their best effort to convince people to stop saying that what Trump is proposing is a “travel ban”: The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court – & seek much tougher version! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 “I don’t think the president cares what you call it,” Sanders spun. “He cares that you call it national security. ..The bottom line is he’s trying to protect citizens of this country.” Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 13 13 Comments Cancel reply Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Reply • on Jun 5, 2017 4:07 pm Please explain the logic in NOT invoking Executive Privilege? Reply • on Jun 5, 2017 8:44 pm It’s a no win for Trump. He can’t do it because Comey could still speak out in the public sphere. Reply kerzondax • on Jun 5, 2017 12:37 pm Because he can’t due to the fact he discussed it in a public forum. Stupid eventually catches up with you. Reply Stan Heck • on Jun 5, 2017 1:53 pm I am sure at the last minute he will change his mind Reply arial2 • on Jun 5, 2017 5:28 pm I wouldn’t be surprised if he “changed his mind” Wednesday night, just to slow the proceedings. Trump has already talked about his conversation with Comey in public, so his “executive privilege” likely will not stand in the way of the testimony, but he can drag things out this way. Never thought I’d ever say this, but longing for the days of the second George Bush. Reply Billy Bob Johnson • on Jun 6, 2017 6:06 am He can’t keep his big mouth shut or his fingers still on Twitter. The Supreme Court would strike down his executive privilege claim because he’s been so public about the matter.

The company also unveiled new iMac computers, MacBook laptops, new iPads, and updates to its MacOS, iOS, and WatchOS. By Tiernan Ray Updated June 5, 2017 3:41 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Apple unveiled is long-awaited competitor to Amazon's "Echo" home appliance, called "HomePod," which features newly engineered audio systems, such as an array of "directional" tweeters, and Apple's "A8" custom processor. Apple (AAPL) executives today hosted software developers in San Jose for the company’s annual conference, this time in San Jose, where it unveiled new iMac desktop computers, new MacBook Pro laptop computers, new iPads, and updates to its desktop and mobile operating systems, and new features for its Apple Watch wearable, including watch faces. Chief executive Tim Cook, adding “One last thing,” invited marketing veep Phil Schiller to the stage to unveil the long-awaited home appliance, under the banner of “reinventing music." Schiller teased a “breakthrough home speaker,” called “HomePod.” The mesh-covered canister has features such as 7-beam forming speakers and a 4-inch woofer. The device uses Apple’s own “A8” chip, which Schiller referred to as the “biggest brain ever in a speaker." Schiller said the HomePod will use spatial awareness to create a better sound depending on where the speaker is placed. The HomePod is plugged into the Apple Music service, to pull up one’s existing music catalog, he said. An array of six microphones will respond to the phrase “Hey, Siri." The speaker can also be a “great home assistant,” said Schiller, responding to requests for news and weather, information (“When do the Red Sox play next?) HomePod can also control “Smart Home” devices that utilize Apple’s “HomeKit” programming tools. HomePod ships in December for $349. The new Macs start at $1,099 for a 21.5-inch model, on up to $1,799 for a 27-inch display with “5K” display. The machines use Intel’s (INTC) “Kaby Lake” processors, and “Radeon” graphics chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Another model, iMac Pro, uses an 18-core Intel processor with up to 128 gigabytes of DRAM, for $4,999; that one is not expected to ship until December. Those graphics chips from AMD are also the first time the "500 series" graphics chips have been unveiled. AMD got a little bump from that today, its shares closing up 34 cents, or 3%, at $11.24. The new Intel processors are also coming to a new bunch of MacBook Pro laptops, starting with a 13-inch model at $1,299 with the “Touch Bar” slider strip in place of function keys, going up to the 15-inch model starting at $2,399. (The non-touch-bar model at 11 inches is also available at $1,299.) The company updated its iPad line, changing the 9.7-inch iPad into a 10.5-inch display, by incorporating thinner bezels, as expected. No word on the fate of the iPad Mini. In the coming update to iOS, one can now use drag-and-drop. “It’s a drag fest!” said Apple's head of software, Craig Federighi, demonstrating how one can drag a picture from a message in the iMessage app into the body of an email. Dragging supports multiple gestures at one time, so one can drag multiple items at a single pass. Apple added a function for access to files on the device that’s similar to the Macintosh Finder file browser, with nested folders, plug-ins for third-party file applications such as Dropbox, and other features. Enhancements to the iPad’s productivity features allow one to scan a document into the Notes application and add markup. The iPad camera takes a picture and then the image is corrected for perspective, etc., to make a proper-looking page. Notes using hand-written text, using the “Apple Pencil” stylus, can now allow you to search that text. Apple shares are down $1.66, or 1%, at $153.79.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Using Mindfulness to Create a Safe and Healthy Workplace SOURCE: National Association for Environmental Management (NAEM) DESCRIPTION: This article originally appeared on NAEM’s Green Tie blog.  By Kate Kerr If you’d walked into a corporation ten years ago to discuss the benefits of mindfulness and meditation for organizational effectiveness, leadership and bottom line results, security might have discreetly ushered you out of the building.  During my own 20-year corporate career, I certainly couldn’t have imagined taking a float plane to a hunting lodge in Northern Quebec to lead a mindfulness retreat for some of North America’s top Founders and CEOs. But this is the type of work we are constantly engaged in and hired to do now. Indeed, well-known organizations, such as General Mills, Aetna, Intel and Google, have long recognized the benefits of mindfulness meditation. Many have their own in-house meditation programs, and conduct in-house research to demonstrate it’s effectiveness. Google trains 2000 engineers each year in mindfulness and meditation, one of their most popular programs, ‚Search Inside Yourself’ has a wait list stretching 6 months. Intel started their ‚Awake@Intel’ mindfulness program in 2012 and at least 2000 employees have gone through training. Why are these household names investing in these types of programs?  In today’s 24/7 always-on work environment, many business leaders are dealing with increased levels of executive function burnout, leading to poor resiliency to work-related stress and shrinking attention spans. Among employees, workplace stress creates high turnover and retention issues. Mindfulness is a potential antidote.  While mindfulness has been around for thousands of years, its emergence as a practice in the West dates back to the 1979, when Jon Kabat-Zinn combined Buddhist teachings with scientific findings for the purposes of treating stress. His work at the helm of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School has helped demonstrate that what some might have once considered mystical „woo woo” is, in fact, a medically effective technique for managing stress, pain and illness.    At its core, mindfulness is a discipline that helps us retrain our attention and boost concentration power. This helps us focus on tasks requiring sustained attention and in stressful tasks performed under time constraints. The obvious benefit is increased productivity but this is only scratching the surface. Why mindfulness is relevant to EHS&S Where it gets interesting for EHS&S is the way it teaches us to control our attention, which increases focus and reduces mistakes caused by distraction. A 2010 study by the University of California Irvine, for example, revealed that a whopping 73 percent of trips and falls are caused by inattentiveness and distraction. It’s easy to see, therefore, how evidenced-based mindfulness training may be a highly-effective solution for high-risk work environments, as well as for helping EHS&S leaders remain focused. So what does a mindfulness practice look like?  The first thing you should know about mindfulness is that you don’t need a yoga mat, a candle or a darkened room to create a practice. Mindfulness can be done anytime and anyplace, and for any length of time. The beauty is that it’s highly adaptable to workplace environments and can be implemented in short bursts throughout your day. It’s not about to-dos. Next, it’s helpful to notice any resistance you might be feeling about it. It’s normal to feel that practicing mindfulness sounds adding yet another thing to your to-do list, but it’s not actually a task to be accomplished. You can practice mindfulness while you’re walking to a meeting, sitting down to do some work at your desk or listening to a colleague. What better time to take a conscious breath than during an intense discussion? It’s an invitation to let go of goals and achieve more. One of the paradoxes of mindfulness is that taking a few minutes or more to „pay attention on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally” as Kabat-Zinn puts it, may create a sense of spaciousness in our day, which can actually help us get more done on our to-do list. Another paradox? Mindfulness is an invitation to let go of any goals and lean into our moment-to-moment experiences. Over time our busy minds begin to settle, enabling us to be more present and see more clearly. So ultimately we’re more likely to achieve our goals. So why not take a moment right now to check in on yourself, listen to your thoughts, notice how you’re feeling and just breathe?

Mac users have had to make the switch if they wanted to access the metaverse through HTC Vive or Oculus Rift. But that’s changing now because Apple is expanding its VR efforts behind the iPhone and iOS. Mac is getting SteamVR, according to Apple at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference event in San Jose today. SteamVR is Valve’s open platform for enabling VR headsets to work with games on the Steam PC gaming store. With this software, the HTC Vive will work on Macs, but so should Oculus Rift, OSVR’s HDK 2.0, and most other PC-based VR headsets. This will also enable developers to port a huge number of VR experiences to the Mac when SteamVR launches on the platform at some undetermined point in the future. If you’re wondering how the hell you’re going to run VR games on your Mac computer, Apple made several other announcements that will make that easier for consumers and developers. Apple is adding support for external graphics cards. It introduced a unit with an AMD Radeon RX580 that plugs into a Mac’s Thurderbolt port to add enough extra power for VR. For now, the eGPU (external graphics processing unit) is only for developers, but Apple said it plans to make it available to all of its customers later this year. Apple is also rolling out support for Unity and Unreal, two important game-making tools, as part of its Metal graphics API (the Mac equivalent to DirectX), which will make it easier for developers to port their games to that platform. All of these announcements reveal an Apple that is potentially embracing video games like it never has before. Unreal and Unity are two of the most important game-development engines in the world. SteamVR is just as crucial to VR. Adding all of this functionality and official support to Mac probably won’t get enthusiasts to flip over to Apple’s ecosystem overnight, but it could at least provide some interesting competition to Windows.

 Apple is updating the MacBook Air for the first time in years, but it's a very minor boost Jeff Dunn Jun. 5, 2017, 2:46 PM 6,634 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Apple MacBook Air.Flickr/Tim Trueman Apple announced an updated version of its MacBook Air laptop on Monday, the first update to the popular-yet-aging device in more than 800 days.  However, the upgrade is extremely minor: Apple only says that the 13-inch MacBook Air now starts with a 1.8 GHz processor. Previously, the Air started with a 1.6 GHz processor. So it should be a little bit faster. Apple did not say the processor boost includes a jump to Intel's latest "Kaby Lake" generation of processors, however, as it did with the MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook on Monday. Instead, the MacBook Air will stick with Intel's years-old "Broadwell" chips, which are well behind the latest generation in terms of overall performance and battery efficiency.  Beyond that, Apple did not announce any changes to the new MacBook Air’s display or general design, so the rest of the laptop is about the same. Flickr/Matthew Pearce That's not ideal: While the Air’s keyboard, trackpad, battery life, and general build quality are still above-average, the display is less vivid and substantially less sharp than competing laptops these days. Other devices have also managed to pack more power in designs that are slimmer, have smaller borders around the display, and support the newer USB-C standard. At its core, the Air is still a laptop from 2015.  Nevertheless, compared to other Apple laptops, the MacBook Air remains the most affordable of the bunch. It still starts at $999 — which gets you the older Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage — and goes up to $1,549 as you max out the specs. But with the MacBook providing a more svelte design, and with Apple slashing the entry price of the 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans Touch Bar) to $1,299 on Monday, it seems clearer that the company is ready to phase out its long-popular notebook — regardless of how popular it may continue to be. The updated MacBook Air is available to order through Apple's online store now. Apple says retail availbility will begin on June 7.

All models receive upgrades to Intel’s 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors. They also get two Thunderbolt 3 controllers, brighter displays, much faster Radeon graphics, and USB-C ports for the first time. The new iMac displays feature 500 nits, are 43 percent brighter, and include 10-bit dithering (8-bit panels) and support for one billion colors. All 27-inch iMacs come with Fusion drives standard, and SSDs are of course optional; we would have preferred to see SSDs standard across the board, though we can see why some not-as-demanding customers would want more internal storage (up to 2TB) over sheer speed. Apple also said its SSDs are now 50 percent faster than before. Apple is framing its 27-inch iMacs with discrete graphics as a way to power the company’s first-ever push into VR experience. Also: not an Nvidia chip in sight. It’s AMD all the way. You can now get up to 32GB RAM on 21.5-inch models and 64GB on 27-inch models, though be prepared to pay through the nose for the experience. Pricing has come down a bit. The 21.5-inch model starts at $1,099, but you can get a 4K Retina model for $1,299 for the first time. The 5K Retina 27-inch iMac starts at $1,799. In a surprise move, Apple also took the wraps off what it’s calling the iMac Pro, the first-ever iMac to bear that moniker. The monster machine will have an eight-core Xeon processor, an AMD Radeon Vega GPU with 16GB RAM, 10-gigabit Ethernet, up to 128GB ECC memory and 4TB 3Gbps SSDs, and a 5K Retina Display, with options for 10- and 18-core (!) Xeon processors as well. Apple is pitching this machine for real-time 3D rendering and 4K video effects, immersive VR at high frame rates, machine learning development, and faster code compiling. The iMac Pro will be available this coming December starting at a whopping $4,999. In introducing the iMac Pro and with a straight face, Apple said the 27-inch iMac is currently its most popular desktop for its pro customers. It’s obvious by this point that few people have opted for the expensive, severely outdated Mac Pro when they could get a fully equipped, quad-core 27-inch iMac with a built-in 5K display for the same price. I’d say Apple announcing the iMac Pro is pretty much the nail in the coffin for the little black can design. On the developer front, Apple also unveiled a new Developer Kit that’s a Thunderbolt 3 enclosure with an AMD Radeon RX 580 and a USB-Hub, designed for use with the company’s MacBook Pros. The MacBook Pros all get minor speed bumps as well, thanks to Kaby Lake, with the base 13-inch MacBook Pro model falling to $1,299 (from $1,499). The company also announced macOS 10.13 High Sierra and iOS 11; we’ll have more on those shortly. Updated 3:51pm: All the new machines are now on Apple’s site and listed as in stock at the time of this writing. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, none have SSDs or even 16GB RAM standard, though almost all of them are now Retina-class and quad-core except for the least expensive model (often intended for education markets).

The 27-inch Retina 5K display iMac will also come with the new Radeon Pro Vega GPU, “the most advanced graphics ever in a Mac,” according to Apple. The iMac Pro will be available in December and will be priced at $4,999. New macOS Apple also introduced the new update to macOS Sierra: macOS High Sierra. The update for iMacs and MacBooks will come with an auto-play blocking feature on Safari. The browser will detect sites that auto play videos and will block the clips from automatically playing. macOS High Sierra will also get a boost in privacy by using machine learning to identify trackers. Apple is also adding updates for Mail, including a full screen split mail view and spotlight. macOS High Sierra is also boosting editing in Photos, including a sidebar for filtering by keywords, favorites and people. The update will also synchronize editing you have done on photos in other apps, like Adobe Photoshop. High Sierra will also come with the Apple File System as a default for Mac computers, and Metal 2, the graphics-rendering framework that follows Metal. Apple also announced virtual reality support to macOS computers.  The update will roll out this fall and is available as a developer beta now.

The new beefed-up iMac is intended to address the concerns of professional creatives, who until now have been limited to either the consumer 27in 5K iMac or the older Mac Pro, which hasn’t been updated since 2013. The new iMac Pro starts with an 8-core Intel Xeon processor, but can be configured with an 18-core processor variant, as well as up to 128GB of EEC RAM, 4TB of SSD storage and Radeon Vega discrete graphics cards with up to 16GB of memory. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple’s John Ternus speaks about the new iMac Pro. Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP The 27in machine has the 5K display from the existing 5K iMac, but has four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports and is capable of pushing up to 44m pixels across three screens. Apple will hope that the iMac Pro will address the concerns of video editors looking to work with 4K or 8K video that need workstation-level power – a market that the company has failed to serve for the last couple of years forcing once Apple-only outfits to switch to alternative operating systems and machines. The iMac Pro will start at $4,999 in the US and will be available in December. Apple also updated the standard iMac line with new 7th generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports, up to 64GB of RAM and Apple’s Fusion drives as standard. The 21.5in iMac will come in a standard and 4K screen variant, with Iris Plus 620 graphics and a choice of Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete GPUs. The 27in 5K variant will come with Radeon Pro 570, 575 or 580 graphics cards, and were demoed producing live VR content - a new area of exploration for Apple, which has joined with Valve to bring its Steam VR platform for the Mac as well as Unity and Unreal engines. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Apple’s new iMacs have improved screens. Photograph: Apple The 21.5in and the 5k iMac hadn’t been updated since late 2015 with the Skylake, 6th generation Intel processors – the same as those used in the MacBook Pro when it launched in 2016. Finally, Apple also updated its MacBook and MacBook Pro line with 7th generation Intel processors, and gave the MacBook Air a specification bump in response to its sustained popularity. When the redesigned MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was launched in October 2016, one of the criticisms of the design was that it used older 6th generation Intel Core i5 and i7 processors rather than the latest 7th generation versions, which were more powerful and more thermally efficient. By updating to the 7th generation “Kaby Lake” Core i5 and i7 processors, Apple has brought the MacBook Pro line up to pair with rivals from Dell, Razer and HP. But Apple will also hope that the more efficient, newer processors will help it live up to its promises of a 10-hour battery life, of which the 13in MacBook Pro fell well short.

Jon Brodkin - Jun 5, 2017 5:57 pm UTC Enlarge Apple reader comments 177 Share this story At its WWDC keynote today, Apple announced that it is updating the iMac line with Intel's Kaby Lake processors and will provide upgrades to displays, memory, storage, and I/O ports. The new displays are 43 percent brighter than previous ones, with 500 nits and 10-bit dithering and the capability to reproduce 1 billion colors. New iMacs will be upgradeable to 64GB of RAM on 27-inch configurations and 32GB RAM on the 21.5-inch models. Fusion drives—which include both SSD and spinning disk—will be standard on all new 27-inch configurations, and the SSD will be up to 50 percent faster, Apple said. The I/O upgrade involves two USB-C connectors that support Thunderbolt 3. The 21.5-inch model will have Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 for a graphics speed boost of up to 80 percent. The iMac Retina 4K 21.5-inch, meanwhile, will have a Radeon Pro 555 or 560 and up to 4GB VRAM. The iMac Retina 5K 27-inch will have a Radeon Pro 570, 575, or 580 and up to 8GB VRAM. Prices will start at $1,099 for the base 21.5-inch model, at $1,299 for the 4K 21.5-inch model, and at $1,799 for the iMac Retina 5K 27-inch model. iMac Pro sneak peek Apple today also gave a sneak peek of the upcoming iMac Pro, which will ship at the end of the year with an 8-core Intel Xeon processor, with options going up to 18 cores. It will have the same design as the current 27-inch model but with a new Space Gray finish. Apple said it had to rethink the thermal architecture in order to get the more powerful processors into the current body. The iMac Pro will have AMD Radeon Vega graphics with up to 16GB of VRAM. It will have SSDs with storage of 1TB to 4TB, four Thunderbolt 3 ports, and built-in 10 Gigabit Ethernet. This image shows some more of the iMac Pro specs: Apple also promised performance of up to 22 teraflops. The starting configuration for the iMac Pro will start at $4,999.

Swaraj Singh Dhanjal Eight firms have raised Rs6,335.83 crore through IPOs so far this year. Photo: Reuters Mumbai: At least four companies are ready to sell their shares to the public for the first time in June, aiming to raise a total of at least Rs 5,000 crore, four people familiar with the moves said. The firms are telecom equipment maker Tejas Networks Ltd, depository services firm Central Depository Services Ltd, pharma company Eris Lifesciences Ltd and small finance bank Au Small Finance Bank Ltd. Bengaluru-based Tejas Networks, which is backed by private equity investors such as Goldman Sachs, Intel Capital, Frontline Strategy and Mayfield, is looking to launch its approximately Rs800 crore initial public offering (IPO) in the third week of June, one of the persons cited above said. “Road shows were completed last month, a final assessment of the institutional demand has been done and the IPO is set for launch, which is targeted for the week of 12 June,” he said. The IPO will raise Rs450 crore in primary capital for capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Several shareholders—including Cascade Capital Management Mauritius, Intel Capital, Frontline and the company’s chief executive officer Sanjay Nayak—will also sell some of the shares they hold through an offer for sale. Au Small Finance Bank Ltd, one of the 10 entities who were granted a small finance bank licence in 2015 by the Reserve Bank of India, is planning to launch its almost Rs2,000 crore IPO, said another person cited above, also requesting anonymity. “The plan is to launch the IPO towards the end of the month. The company is currently on investor roadshows, which are expected to be concluded soon,” he said. Among small finance banks, it will be the third to be listed. Equitas Small Finance Bank got listed in April 2016 and in the next month, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank got listed too. Au’s IPO is a pure offer for sale. Existing investors partially selling their shares include International Finance Corporation (part of the World Bank Group), Warburg Pincus, ChrysCapital and Kedaara Capital. “As you are aware, Au Small Finance Bank Ltd had filed a draft red herring prospectus with capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for its IPO on 1st February 2017. The company received the SEBI comments in March 2017. The timing of opening the IPO will be decided in due course by company and selling shareholders in consultation with BRLMs (book running lead managers),” said a spokesperson for the company in an email. Last week, Mint reported that Ahmedabad-based pharmaceuticals company Eris Lifesciences Pvt. Ltd plans to launch a Rs2,000 crore IPO in June. The fourth company is depository services firm CDSL, which plans to raise Rs400 crore. According to the draft red herring prospectus filed by the company, the IPO will be a pure offer for sale by existing shareholders BSE Ltd, State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and The Calcutta Stock Exchange. BSE, SBI, Bank of Baroda and The Calcutta Stock Exchange together hold 65.65% stake in CDSL, with BSE alone holding 50%. Emails sent to Tejas Networks and CDSL on Thursday evening were not answered. So far this year, eight companies have raised Rs6,335.83 crore through IPOs, while last year 26 companies raised Rs26,493.84 crore through this route.

Credit: Intel Free Press A consortium of international chambers of commerce has advised the Vietnamese government that its draft solar PPA template is “non-bankable” and cannot attract financing for PV in Vietnam, particularly for medium and utility-scale projects, according to documents seen by PV Tech. Vietnam Business Forum (VBF), an umbrella group for all international Chambers of Commerce, which facilitates dialogue between the business community and the Vietnamese leadership, submitted its response on the draft solar PPA to Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) last week. The repsonse stated: “If the Draft Circular and the Draft PPA are not improved and the PPA template of the MOIT remains to be non-bankable, actual development and investment in solar power projects may be [more] limited than expected or planned under the amended Power Development Plan VII, even though Vietnam remains to have a high potential for solar power investment.” Back in April, Vietnam confirmed a long-awaited feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme for utility-scale solar projects, with a net metering scheme for rooftop PV, along with standardized PPAs. However, shortly afterwards multinational law firm Baker McKenzie said MOIT’s solar guidelines failed to address a range of issues that could impact large-scale project bankability, issuing a warning about the ‘non-negotiable’ template drafted for all grid-connected solar PPAs. No foreign bank will touch this PPA The VBF consortium, which includes Amcham (USA), Japan Banker's Association, Eurocham, Kocham, the Nordics and Vietnam Chamber of Commerce International (VCCI) among its members, has now added to the backlash. Following their response, a member of the finance industry, who preferred not to be named, also told PV Tech that “no foreign bank will touch this PPA”. VBF has now put forward various recommendations to MOIT including adopting an international standard bankable PPA template, localized under Vietnamese law. This is particularly important for large-scale projects but relevant to all segments. The Forum also said that if MOIT retains its PPA template then it “must be significantly improved” and the VBF response goes on to detail a lengthy number of issues with the current design. Echoing the issues raised by Baker McKenzie regarding monopoly utility EVN being the sole off-taker for all solar projects, VBF said that EVN’s payments obligations should be supported by a Government guarantee or another mechanism to resolve the related payment risks. VBF also found a lack of protection against retroactive changes in policy that could effect existing projects. The PPA was also found to lack clauses on project insurance, anti-corruption measures and a waiver of sovereign immunity. Meanwhile, no offshore dispute resolution in a neutral location is provided. VBF claimed: “This will be a serious concern to investors and creditors." Given that the FiT would be subject to fluctuations in the VND/USD exchange rate, VBF also warned: “No escalation clause is provided in the Draft PPA. The Draft PPA does not include any indexation of the FiT by way of escalation in accordance with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or any other provision to address inflation risks.” These were just a few of the major issues highlighted by the consortium. Ultimately, VBF said: “without a bankable PPA, it will be impossible or very difficult for developers/investors to be able to get or convince financing from international or foreign lenders on a 'project finance' basis.” The response will cause serious concern among players hoping to enter the Vietnamese market, especially given that the country appeared to have gained momentum in project announcements. On the other hand, EVN is set to go ahead with its own large-scale PV plans, with subsidiary Power Generation Corp 3 working on 350MW across two projects in Phuoc Minh Thuan Nam district.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why You Won't Be Able to Buy Intel Corporation's 18-Core Beast Right Away This Fool explores the technical and business reasons Intel's recently announced 18-core chip will be a little later than its less flashy counterparts. Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Jun 5, 2017 at 10:30AM On May 30, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced its new Core X-series of processors aimed at the enthusiast desktop personal computer market. These chips come in configurations with as few as four cores and scale to as many as 18 cores. This represents a significant improvement over the company's prior high-end desktop processors, which only came in six, eight, and 10-core variants. Per an Intel fact sheet, the Core X chips with between 4 and 10 cores "are available at launch via online retail and through channel partners in all geographies," while the 12-18-core models are simply "coming soon." Image source: Intel. Additionally, over on the ASUS Republic of Gamers forums (ASUS is a major vendor of computer motherboards and personal computers), the employee who goes by the handle "Raja@ASUS" said that the "18-core CPUs are not scheduled until later this year" and that (presumably gamers) "won't have them for a while." In this column, I'd like to explain why it'll be a while before the 18-core Core X chip (branded the Core i9-7980XE) is available. Getting this product right will be tough In a previous column, I went over what I'd like to see Intel do to make the 7980XE attractive to the enthusiast/gaming market. In my view, Intel needs to be sure it isn't just selling gamers and enthusiasts chips with a lot of cores on them (that's trivial -- Intel can rebrand datacenter-oriented chips and be done with it), but that it's selling chips with lots of cores on them that can also run at high speeds in workloads that can't use all of those cores. Intel processors have a feature that is known as Turbo Boost 2.0. The idea behind Turbo Boost -- a feature introduced years ago -- is that a chip with lots of cores on it shouldn't offer compromised performance to a chip with fewer cores on it in workloads that can only use a handful of cores. So, in those scenarios where only a few cores are used, the few cores that get used can run at much higher speeds than they can when more (or all) of the cores on the chip are being used. This is a good feature, but for Intel to advertise a given Turbo Boost 2.0 speed, the company needs to be sure that each core on the chip can run at that advertised speed since programs can conceivably be run on any subset of the cores on the chip. So, for the Core i9-7980XE to not be a "compromised" product relative to the $999 Core i9-7900X (which has just 10 cores on it), it should offer a Turbo Boost 2.0 speed of 4.3GHz -- quite a high frequency. I can't imagine that finding chips with this capability will be easy, so Intel may need some extra time to find, validate, and ship such parts. The Xeon factor It's also important to note that Intel's high-end desktop processors aren't based on chips that were purpose-built for the high-end desktop computer market. These are chips that were initially designed for the datacenter market that are tweaked and sold as ultra-high-end consumer products. The market for datacenter processors is much larger than the market for high-end desktop processors, and based on everything Intel has said, it views itself as a "datacenter first" company. This means Intel's priority will be to make sure that its datacenter customers get the chips they want, so the high-end desktop customers may have to wait a bit, especially since the 18-core high-end desktop chip will need to represent, arguably, the "best of the best" of the 18-core chips that Intel produces. Business impact? The reality is that the market for processors like Intel's 18-core Core i9-7980XE is rather minuscule, even within the hardcore enthusiast gamer/prosumer market (a relatively small but fast-growing portion of the overall personal computer market). There will certainly be buyers for this chip, and Intel is certain to make a nice chunk of profit per unit sold, but in the scheme of Intel's overall business performance, rolling out the 18-core Core i9-7980XE later than it will the lower core-count models isn't going to have much of an effect.

The X299GT9 is a monster motherboard that comes in the E-ATX form factor, which allows for a significantly wider PCB. The motherboard features multiple PCI-E x16 slots, two U.2 ports, an M.2 slot, many USB 3.0 internal headers, and a hefty VRM.     Hidden under a metal veil is an Intel 1Gbit NIC as well as an Intel 10Gbit NIC. Intel's X550AT is employed to drive the higher networking speeds. The PCI-E layout is x16/x16/x8/x4/x4/x4/x4 and there are four SATA6Gb/s ports on the right of the motherboard. The motherboard does support USB 3.1 and carries a 14-phase VRM. We don't know much more about the motherboard, but its size is impressive, and hopefully we will get one in for review. >> NEXT STORY: PlayStation VR tops 1 million sales << PREVIOUS STORY: ASUS's first motherboards with wireless AD tech Related Tags Computex 2017 Biostar Biostar X299GT9 Biostar motherboard Intel Got an opinion on this news?

The €69 (£60) computer can run Windows, Android or Ubuntu, making it much more flexible than the open source computer, although it's more than double the price compared to the $35 Pi 3 Model B. The UP Core does have an extremely top-end spec for such a tiny computer though, including an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 CPU with a 2MB Cache, up to 1.84 GHz, Intel HD 400 Graphics and either 2GB or 4GB RAM. It will be available in either the 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB versions, utilising eMMC as its preferred storage option. With one HDMI port, one full eDP, Audi via HDMI and Docking's i2S, it supports a decent range of video and audio formats, while a USB 3.0 host and two USB 2.0 pin headers ensure you can plug in enough peripheries for a keyboard, mouse and a camera, for example. Also packed inside include Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n to connect to the internet and Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) for other wireless networking needs. UP Core's makers claim it has attracted a selection of launch developers who are busy creating third party hardware and software for those who have bought a microcomputer. Although it won't have the same support as Raspberry Pi at launch - mostly because the open source microcomputer has more than five years on the UP Core, it's a positive step towards making microcomputers more accessible to a wider group of people. So far, UP has managed to treble its Kickstarter goal of €10,000 (£8,750), with almost a month still to run on its campaign. Those who opt to support the company can pick up a UP Core for the discounted price of €69 for the 1GB RAM/16GB eMMC version.

Traditional SIM Card Replacement Explained By Rishabh Jain On 06/05/17 AT 6:55 AM SIM cards are reflected on a monitor showing binary digits in this picture taken, Feb. 23, 2015. Photo: Reuters/Dado Ruvic SIM cards might be the biggest hangover from early smartphone days, which is still present in today’s most advanced phones.  We might have changed its size to MicroSIMs and NanoSIMs, but the basic technology and hardware structure remains the same. SIM cards however, might soon be history and get replaced by embedded SIMs or eSIMs, according to a report released Monday. So what are eSIMs? eSIMs are SIMs that would be woven into the silicon fabric of a device’s modem, and would be programmable to access different networks. Read: 750 Million Cell Phones At Risk Of Remote Hacking Due To SIM Card Security Flaw They are not a new thing — smartwatches such as the Samsung Gear S3 Frontier already use them for SIM connectivity. But, according to Engadget, eSIMs might soon become commonplace in smartphones. Chipmaker Intel is working on mobile modems compatible with eSIMs — the company has already successfully embedded an eSIM in one of its devices. While most Android devices use either Qualcomm or Mediatek processors, chances are Apple, which uses Intel processors for its devices, might feature an eSIM in its iPhone next year. An advantage that eSIMs might have over traditional mobile SIMs, would be that they would be able to support higher data speeds of more 1 GB per second over mobile data networks. According to research firm IHS Markit, eSIM shipments are expected to grow from 108.9 million shipments in 2016 to 986 million shipments by 2021. It might seem like a tall order, but chances are instead of just being fitted in wearables, eSIMs could be fitted in smartphones, PCs and even the larger internet-of-things (IoT) networks.  According to IHS Markit, smartphones would spur the growth of eSIMs. eSIMs could also lower the prices of devices since the embedded SIM slot would come pre-fitted into a device, meaning a device maker will not have to design one, which in turn would save valuable surface area on a smartphone along with designing costs.  Also, the SIM would be soldered into a device and programmed remotely which would mean less frequency loss, unlike plastic SIMs, which tend to lose signal very often. This will help create a better customer experience. It will also allow network providers to interface better with smartphone manufacturers. Additionally, more opportunities are expected for SIM providers, who will now be able to diversify into the IoT and connected cars market. Conversely, these technologies will also benefit, since they will no longer be dependent on Wi-Fi for data and will be able to integrate with other smart devices. The GSM Alliance (GSMA) has already backed eSIMs and the technology could become mainstream by next year. Read: Samsung Gear Solo: Smartwatch With SIM Card Could Make And Receive Calls According to IHS Markit, the technology is expected to be adopted by budget devices and trickle on to premium devices in 2019. Samsung and Huawei are expected to be the first smartphone makers to adopt the technology. While the decline of traditional SIMs might not be as fast as some hope, they are still believed to be steadily on their way out with an expected decline of 0.3 billion between 2016-2021.

It's been tearing its way through smartphones, looking to move itself from budget brand to a mainstream premium player with its P-series devices. And it's been doing a pretty good job, too. While Android phones are why Huawei is best known in the consumer sector, the company is a telecommunications powerhouse, underpinning the infrastructure of many 4G networks, as well as being a white label manufacturer for a lot of set-top boxes and connected dongles. With such expertise it's little surprise that the Huawei brand is expanding into laptops. While the company's first tablet, the MateBook, wasn't the best attempt, it's first Ultrabook, the MateBook X, is much better. Be warned Dell and Apple - because Huawei is coming for your customers with a MacBook beater of its own. Huawei Mate X review: Design 286 x 211 x 12.5mm; 1.05kg Premium metal designs in gold, rose gold, grey The MateBook X is all about portable, lightweight design. As Huawei boasts, the X is slimmer than the 12-inch MacBook and it adopts premium techniques that you'll find on Huawei's phones, like the diamond cut precise chamfer to the very edge of the display. It's not a total Apple-a-like, though, as this finish has a hint of Asus ZenBook 3 about it. Pocket-lint The MateBook X is a 13-inch device - although it doesn't look like it. With bezels around the display measuring a mere 4.2mm, there's only a hint at a black border, with the metal of the lid framing the edges neatly. What this means is a lot of display in not a lot of space: the MateBook X is light enough to tote around, without leaving you with a display that isn't really big enough to work on all day. The other big point of note is the MateBook X's fanless design - and we're talking fanless Intel Core i processor, not less-powerful Core m. Huawei announced this with some fanfare at the launch of this device, but as there's now a new fanless Surface Pro that offers similar hardware, it's not the unique proposition it once was and likely to be commonplace in the future.  This processor choice no doubt aids the skinny build, but also means the MateBook X is a quiet runner. However, as the design has cooling section in the chassis, used to trap heat and draw it away from hardware, the downside is that the base heats up when under load. When working in 26 degree ambient temperatures on a balmy day, you'll start to feel that heat in your lap. The MateBook X's parallels with the MacBook can't be ignored, from the styling of the rubber feet on the bottom to the look of the keyboard and the trackpad. Not that it's a negative, because the design is rather good. We've been carrying one around for a couple of weeks, and have found the size, lightness and the compact power pack all appeal. The footprint itself is smaller than a piece of A4 paper, so slipping it into any bag is a breeze. Pocket-lint For the most part the MateBook X feels solid too. We like the cool touch of the metal and the matching keyboard colour is nicely done, but there's a surprisingly spongey section of the speaker grille above the keyboard. The keyboard action doesn't seem to be affected, however, and we were happy to clatter out words, with good travel from those chiclet keys. This is a fast keyboard and despite some flex in the deck to the top, that doesn't affect the real-world usage. The keyboard is backlit and the illumination can be adjusted, but we've found it's not the best backlighting in a laptop: from a lap position we've found the illumination almost totally vanishes when looking from a given angle. This all depends on viewpoint, but we did find ourselves leaning in a little in darker conditions on occasion to ensure we were about to hit the right key. The touchpad is large and clicky and feels natural to use, but this is one area where the MacBook perhaps does a little better, as the Huawei isn't as smooth and precise as you'll get from Apple. It's still very usable and we like that it's free from the clutter of a fingerprint sensors (which is cleverly placed within the power button). When it comes to connectivity, the MateBook X also adopts some of Apple's approach, although there's two USB Type-C connections rather than just one, plus a 3.5mm headphone socket. The left-hand socket is for power and you're prompted to switch devices around if you plug them into the wrong place. Pocket-lint Such connectivity is a fusion of conventionality with the adoption of new standards, but there's also a dock/dongle that comes in the box. This will expand connections to USB, HDMI and VGA, so it's more of a desk dock than on-the-go connector for your other devices. The only thing we're left smarting about is the lack of an SD card slot. In regard to connections, therefore, the skinny MateBook X loses out to the Dell XPS 13 which is all the more conventional. Huawei MateBook X review: Hardware and display 13-inch IPS, 2160 x 1440 pixels, 200ppi, 350 nits Intel Core i5-7200U or Core i7-7500U; 4/8GB DDR3 RAM 256/512GB SSD Bluetooth 4.1, Wi-Fi 2x2 MiMo To the meat of the MateBook sandwich: its display is a 13-inch fully laminated touchless panel with a resolution of 2160 x 1440 pixels over its 3:2 aspect ratio. That results in a little more height than some rivals, meaning a little more working space on that document you might be tapping away on, but obviously it's less well suited to wider content like video. We've already mentioned that we love the narrow bezels, with Huawei taking a similar approach to the Dell XPS 13's infinity display. There's no touch, however, which is where Dell might be seen to offer a little more on its top-end models. Whether this is a problem or not depends on what you're using at the moment. If you've become a touch and type person, it's a bane, if you're moving from a MacBook, it's no problem at all. Pocket-lint There's ample brightness from the MateBook X's display, although the auto-brightness is a little odd, sometimes limiting the range it will offer based on the ambient conditions (a trait exhibited by Huawei's phones). To get access to the absolute brightest conditions you'll need to switch this off, rather than just using the keys to turn it all the way up. However, using the MateBook X out in sunny conditions and we've had no problems: it's bright enough to cut through the glare when working next to the window on the train and so on. On top of that, it's rich with colour and detail, so content looks good. Like many skinny ultra-portables there's the choice of i7-7500U or i5-7200U processors, with integrated Intel HD Graphics 620. We've been using the i7 version and have found it to be plenty powerful, but the load-out you choose will make quite a difference to the price. Our review unit is loaded with the high-end processor, 8GB RAM and 512GB storage - so it's very much the top of the range and rather pricey as a result. It matches the top tier Dell XPS 13 in this regard. At the moment Huawei hasn't confirmed what other/regional configurations will be available or how much more they will cost. For those watching the specs there's been no mention of 16GB RAM that the new Surface Pro will offer at the top end. Pocket-lint The MateBook X also houses a fingerprint scanner, placed within the power button, meaning you can trigger Windows Hello pretty much instantly. It's as good an implementation as we've seen from Huawei on its smartphones, meaning fast unlocking that feels natural to use. It's a really great fingerprint scanner that's been put in absolutely the right place. Huawei MateBook X review: Battery life 41.4Wh battery 8.5 hours of real world usage For portability purposes, battery life is key. It's also the downfall of some slimmer machines as the physical battery size is limited. Huawei claims 10 hours of video playback from the MateBook X, which we think is ambitious.  In real-world use, we've found the MateBook X averages around eight and a half hours of use, for average browser-based working on office tasks. We've seen it drop a little lower to under seven hours when this was slightly more intense - and that's a pretty good, showing that it's a laptop that can suit most use cases, rather than dying in minutes when the processor is called upon for beefier tasks. The upside is USB C charging, which takes about three hours to pump the MateBook X back up to full power. So while the MateBook X might not be the best battery performer - and, again, the MacBook or Dell XPS will deliver a more reliable 10 hours - we've seen worse and the MateBook X doesn't ring huge alarm bells. Huawei MateBook X review: Unique audio power Dolby Atmos Sound System One of the aces in Huawei's desk is its collaboration with Dolby. The MateBook X is the first laptop to come with a Dolby Atmos Sound System. In the increasingly muddied waters of what Dolby Atmos means (it's now in cinemas, home movie setups, smartphones, tablets and laptops), here it means that you're getting a greater separation and a degree of object placement compared to normal stereo, as long as you have the content to support it. We've experienced some demo clips and the effect is surprisingly good, so while the definition of what Dolby Atmos means might be changing, it's certainly a boost to the normal flat acoustics you might expect from a skinny laptop. Dolby says this is a result of working with Huawei from early on in the design process: Dolby wasn't handed a laptop carcass and told it make it sound good, the company was able to have an input on hardware and software design to make sure it could get the desired result. Pocket-lint However, the Atmos effect that the MateBook X speakers can create isn't universal and doesn't apply to all content, so you're not always getting the best in that regard, but there's still some impressive performance on offer. The system also offers a software controller with a number of different modes, so you can easily switch from music to movie, for example, and generally these do lead to optimised performance for different content types. For straight music, which is what we've used the audio for the most, the important thing is that you can get distortion-free music at high volumes from the MateBook X. It struggles with some heavier basslines, of course, but on the whole it's an audio big hitter. Verdict The real winner in the MateBook X is its design. This laptop fires itself right into the centre of the Ultrabook pack, likely to cause the go-to MacBook and Dell XPS some disruption thanks to its slim and light design, very usable keyboard and trackpad, plenty of power from Intel Core i processors and silent operation. There's also a great display as standard with minimal bezel that looks great. While Dell offers much the same - and arguably better battery life and a touchscreen in the XPS 13 - the MateBook X does have the X factor: it's a laptop we want to use.  The only hurdles are few and far between: photographers will be annoyed by the lack of SD card slot, and then there's the price, which is likely to be higher than its rivals. We're still waiting for confirmation of exactly how much this will cost in pounds and pence, though. Overall, the MateBook X is a compelling option and a wonderful debut from a company that you won't associate with laptops just yet - but will in the future, if this is anything to go by. Bravo Huawei, the MateBook X is great. Alternatives to consider Pocket-lint Apple MacBook from £1,049 The original ultra-slim and almost port-free laptop, if you're a Mac OS fan then it's the only option. But the MateBook X offers a compelling Windows rival with more power and features. Read the full article: Apple MacBook 2016 review Pocket-lint Dell XPS 13 from £1,049 If battery life and standard connectivity (like an SD slot) is a real clincher for you then the equally powerful Dell XPS 13 is the way to go.

Apple's first big event of the year, the World Wide Developer's Conference is upon us. Apple usually announces new software at WWDC and this year nothing has changed - a new version of iOS, a new edition of Mac OS and updates to Watch OS and TV OS are expected. However, there are rumours swirling around the internet that this year Apple will also announce new hardware at WWDC - new MacBook Pros with Intel's 7th generation 'Kaby Lake' Core processors, new iPads and even possibly a Siri Speaker to take on the likes of the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Many rumors point towards this year's WWDC being more consumer focused than before. There is some evidence to back this claim. Ahead of WWDC 2017, many Developer focused announcements have been pre-announced by Apple. For example, the company released a press release a few days ago which highlighted how Swift Playgrounds has been used by developers to work with Parrot drones and Lego Mindstorms as well as the fact that Apple has paid 70 billion dollars to developers. The event will be held in San Jose, California and will start at 10 AM Pacific Standard Time (10:30PM I.S.T). Apple will be livestreaming the event and you can watch it by heading onto Apple's official website. We are all excited to see what Apple has to offer at WWDC 2017 and here is what all to expect from Apple's big event: iOS 11The next version of iOS, which will be seen in the iPhone 7s, 7s Plus and the iPhone 8 this fall is expected to bring in quite a few updates and enhancements. On cards in a dark mode toggle in the UI aimed at improving battery life, new features, tweaks and enhancements for Siri, updates to iMessage and Facetime as well as updates to Apple's digital payment system Apple Pay. Apple is also expected to announce new content for Apple Music such as their new show CarPool Karaoke, better integration of the Apple Pencil throughout the OS and new multitasking features for the iPad. The introduction of the dark mode in iOS 11 is a response to the OLED screens expected in the next generation iPhones as the new display technology uses much less power to display black content than white. MacOS 10.13There is very little known about what Apple's next version of Mac OS will bring to the table. It is expected to be a very incremental update unless Apple surprises us all with a complete overhaul. The next version of MacOS is expected to come with  better Siri integration throughout the OS, internal updates to accommodate Intel's new 7th generation chips, better integration with the cloud and maybe third-party app support for Siri. Watch OS 4/TVOS 11Updates to both Watch OS - Apple's operating system for the Apple Watch and TV OS - the software that powers Apple's streaming box Apple TV are expected. Watch OS 4 is expected to feature an en even tighter focus on digital health with support for accessories such as external sleep trackers and glucose monitors. Apple might also finally introduce a store for watch faces and allow third-party developers to make watch faces for the Apple Watch. Some rumours suggest that with TVOS 11, Apple might open up their ecosystem to allow competitors like Amazon Prime Video. However, we are a little skeptical on this as Apple is notorious for not allowing competitors on their platforms. What is sure is that Apple will make TVOS ready for their new streaming shows such as Carpool Karaoke. New MacBooksThis is where things get really exciting for consumers as this looks to be the first WWDC in years with hardware announcements from Apple. Apple is widely expected to announce new MacBooks with Intel's 'Kaby Lake' 7th generation Core processors. Apple might also announce updates to the iMac line which has been languishing as of late and hasn't received any update since 2015. Apple did confirm earlier on in the year that new iMacs will be coming in 2017 and WWDC might be where. Many rumors point towards this year's WWDC being more consumer focused than before. Apple is expected to announce new MacBooks, a new iPad Pro and a Siri Speaker. Whether we will see updates to the Mac Mini and Macbook Air is an open question but it looks increasingly unlikely. Apple is also expected to announce a new wireless keyboard with a touch bar built in. A 10.5-inch iPad ProAn update to the iPad Pro is expected. Many rumours point to Apple releasing an all new model with a 10.5-inch screen with the same physical dimensions of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. That points to a device with much slimmer bezels and possibly an all new design. Siri SpeakerThe success of standalone devices with virtual assistants built-in such as the Amazon Alexa and Google Home has piqued Apple's interest and Apple is widely expected to announce a competitor in the form of the Siri Speaker. Some rumours suggest that the device is already in production and could go on sale by the end of the month. According to MacRumours, Apple analyst Mich-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has said, " We believe there is an over 50 [percent] chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June. He has stated that the Speaker will feature excellent sound and will be price higher than the competition. There is an outside chance that Apple might also introduce a new Apple TV with 4K support at the event.

We are live at the event and will bring you an extensive live coverage. Here is a list of things which Apple is expected to announce at the WWDC 2017. New MacBooks Apple might refresh its MacBook lineup by announcing an upgraded version Macbook Pro and the 12-inch Macbook with faster processors. The MacBook Pro will be powered by a faster Kaby Lake Intel processor while the upgraded 12-inch MacBook will also come with a faster Intel chip. A 13-inch MacBook Air is also tipped to get with a new processor. iPad Pro 10.5 Apple is expected to announce a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, with edge-to-edge display. It will have small bezels especially on the top and bottom. The tablet is said to replace the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Siri powered smart speaker In a bid to compete with Google Home and Amazon Echo, Apple is expected to announce a Siri-powered smart speaker but it will not ship the device until later in the year. The smart speaker is tipped to come without a touchscreen and will use Siri, the voice assistant software on the iPhone and Mac. It will come with Apple Music integration and function as a HomeKit hub. The smart speaker will have a superior sound quality due to a virtual surround sound technology. Mac Pro Apple is rumored to be working on a new Mac Pro desktop computer which has not received an update since 2013. The Mac Pro is expected to sport powerful specs and a modular design. It is said to come with a separate pro display however, the fully redesigned model is not expected to be released this year. Updates for iOS 11/macOS/watchOS/tvOS This year it is Apple’s 10th anniversary, Apple might offer a sneak peek at iOS 11 with improved Apple Music, Siri, Maps and other core apps. Meanwhile, macOS, watchOS and tvOS are expected to get big refreshes. Apple will offer live stream on Apple Developer website and on the WWDC app for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV starting from the keynote on June 5th and it would probably start at 10.00 AM PDT (10:30 PM IST).

An instant-on PC. The idea for such a thing has been around for quite a while; it was at least a decade ago, maybe more, when I first heard of the concept, which was always bandied about when some new experimental types of memory had been invented that were non-volatile (I recall something about phase change and plastics. Yeah, crazy experimental!). This means the system could shut down and power off but everything in memory remained and was instantly available at boot, allowing the system to effectively pick up where it left off without reloading everything from a mass storage device again. None of them appear to have made it out of the research labs though, until now. While we’re still not anywhere near the instant-on dream just yet, Intel and Micron are beginning to roll out a completely new type of memory (the first since about 1966) that will redefine the memory hierarchy in computer systems. Called 3D XPoint (pronounced ‘cross point’) this new type of memory behaves somewhere between DRAM (as in DDR4 etc) and NAND (as in SSDs). This is because 3D XPoint is almost as responsive as DRAM with low latencies, but is non-volatile like NAND - and has capacities near NAND too. This has led Intel to release 3D XPoint products under its new Optane brand name that are focused on caching and acting as an intermediary in the memory/storage hierarchy between your SSD/HDD and RAM to speed up read/write characteristics of those mass storage devices. In essence treating it like they did SSDs to HDDs when those were just coming to market back in the day, and weren’t yet capacious enough to be used as a storage device all by themselves. 3D Xpoint and Optane products may still yet get to SSD capacities, and if they do we’ll see another leap forward in mass storage bandwidth and latencies, just as SSDs have done over HDDs over the past decade. It is an order of magnitude faster. Intel has released a server-only Optane product that’s much like a PCIe card-based NVMe SSD, but powered by 3D XPoint. It’s already blowing away server metrics and benchmarks at low queue depths (where everyone, even servers, mostly operate at), something NAND isn’t as good at as it needs to exploit the parallelism of a high queue depth to reach the peaks quoted in spec sheets. Intel is even exploring putting 3D XPoint onto memory DIMMs for servers to use directly via their memory slots, enlarging memory capacities and adding the safety net of a non-volatile memory sub system. It will be a long time before Intel and Micron fully ramp up 3D XPoint production, but as they do it will be interesting to see how the PC landscape adapts to this new memory/storage tier. Will it replace SSDs or DRAM? Or simply become yet another tier of memory/storage and will become as common place in systems as DRAM and SSDs/HDDs? Only time will tell. I can’t wait! We hope to have a review of one of these new consumer-level Optane products soon. Stay tuned. Related Articles Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles, and the difference between conflict ...

Image Credit: IBM IBM Research and partners GlobalFoundries and Samsung have created transistors for a 5-nanometer semiconductor chip. It’s a remarkable technical achievement, though a commercial version of the chip may not be possible for a while. Still, it should enable chips with 30 billion transistors, the on-off switches of electronic devices, on a fingernail-sized chip. Researchers say this kind of achievement should enable the $330 billion chip industry to stay on the path of Moore’s Law, or the prediction made in 1965 by Intel chairman emeritus Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on a chip would double every couple of years. IBM is presenting details of its research on its “silicon nanosheet transistors” at the 2017 Symposia on VLSI Technology and Circuits conference in Kyoto, Japan. The development comes less than two years after IBM researchers made a 7-nanometer test node chip with 20 billion transistors. (A nanometer is a billionth of a meter, and a 5-nanometer device is just a few atoms thick.) Right now, the most advanced semiconductor chips use a FinFET process with circuitry that is 10 nanometers in width. Companies such as Intel can build chips with 10 or 15 billion transistors using that process. A 5-nanometer chip could perform about 40 percent faster than a 10-nanometer chip, given the same power settings, said Mukesh Khare, vice president of semiconductor technology research at IBM Research, in an interview with VentureBeat. Or a chip could be 75 percent more power efficient. “This is a major innovation for scaling beyond 7 nanometers,” Khare said. “It’s an innovation in design and how you pack more and more transistors together. This transistor structure will enable a path to true five nanometers.” Above: A close-up of IBM’s 5-nanometer transistors. The circuits are 5 billionths of a meter apart. Image Credit: IBM IBM said the resulting increase in performance will accelerate cognitive computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and other data-intensive applications delivered in the cloud. The power savings could also mean that the batteries in smartphones and other mobile products could last two to three times longer than today’s devices before needing to be charged. Scientists working as part of the IBM-led Research Alliance at the SUNY Polytechnic Institute Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering’s NanoTech Complex in Albany, N.Y. achieved the breakthrough by using stacks of silicon nanosheets for the transistor, instead of using the standard FinFET architecture, which is the blueprint for the semiconductor industry up through 7 nanometers. IBM also said the improvement provides a significant boost in terms of meeting the future demands of artificial intelligence (AI) systems and virtual reality and mobile devices. Nanosheets represent a new direction, but Khare said IBM Research has been exploring the technology for more than 10 years. This work is the first time that stacked nanosheet devices have shown advantages in electrical properties over the prevailing FinFET architecture. With this technology, Khare believes that the industry can stay on its path of progress every two or three years. Above: IBM’s 5-nanometer manufacturing equipment. Image Credit: IBM “The work is to continue to push and innovate so we can be on par or better than Moore’s Law,” said Khare. “This shows with the right investment one could continue to push semiconductor technology. This is how 5 nanometers can be put together.” The transistors are built with Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is used to stencil the circuit designs on chips. With EUV lithography, the width of the nanosheets can be adjusted continuously, all within a single manufacturing process or chip design. One of the achievements of the technology is that it can be built using the same manufacturing steps and processes used in 10-nanometer manufacturing. The flexibility of nanosheets permits the fine-tuning of performance and power for specific circuits — something not possible with today’s FinFET transistor architecture, which is limited by its current-carrying fin height. Therefore, while FinFET chips can scale to 5 nanometers, simply reducing the amount of space between fins does not provide increased current flow for additional performance. IBM said three years ago that it would invest $3 billion over five years in chip research and development, and this is one of the results of that commitment. IBM Research has more than 3,000 researchers in 12 labs. Above: IBM’s 5-nanometer production equipment.

The facilities will include a cafe, gym and pool as well as a rooftop track and ground-floor retail spaces, according to the company's application for permission to build. The campus has been designed by an all-star team that includes Thomas Heatherwick, the British designer behind London's 2012 Olympic cauldron, and Danish architect Bjarke Ingels' BIG firm. CNN After 0 successful submissions, Google quadruples top reward for hacking Android to $200,000 Google has paid security researchers millions of dollars since launching its bug bounty program in 2010. The company today expanded its Android Security Rewards program because “no researcher has claimed the top reward for an exploit chain in two years.” Right. Well, the program has only been around for two years — a Google spokesperson confirmed that nobody has ever claimed the top reward. Venture Beat Intel CEO sees VR sports as a billion dollar business Intel CEO Brian Krzanich told Axios on Thursday that he sees virtual reality not only changing the face of sports, but also potentially being a multi-billion-dollar business for the chip giant. "I think it can be a couple billion dollar business" he said in an interview after his appearance at Code Conference. "And the reason is this is a whole new feed... things like advertising, the ability to take that data and sell it... we're the only ones who we believe can produce this stuff." Axios Why we're suing the FBI for records about Best Buy Geek Squad informants Sending your computer to Best Buy for repairs shouldn’t require you to surrender your Fourth Amendment rights. But that’s apparently what’s been happening when customers send their computers to a Geek Squad repair facility in Kentucky. We think the FBI’s use of Best Buy Geek Squad employees to search people’s computers without a warrant threatens to circumvent people’s constitutional rights. EFF Walmart is turning its employees into delivery drivers to compete with Amazon Walmart, which is aggressively investing in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon, is unveiling a new strategy: turning its army of 1.5 million US employees into delivery drivers. The tactic is being tested at three stores in New Jersey and Arkansas, and designed to shave costs out of the “last mile” of distribution, the most expensive part of getting goods to customers. Quartz Exploring DynamIQ and ARM’s New CPUs: Cortex-A75, Cortex-A55 ARM moves at an aggressive pace, pushing out new processor IP on a yearly cadence. It needs to move fast partly because it has so many partners across so many industries to keep happy and partly because it needs to keep up with the technology its IP comes into contact with, everything from new process nodes to higher quality displays to artificial intelligence. To keep pace, ARM keeps multiple design teams in several different locations all working in parallel. AnandTech Is “I forget” a valid defense when court orders demand a smartphone password?

Phoronix Chrome bug allows sites to record audio and video without a visual indicator Ran Bar-Zik, a web developer at AOL, has discovered and reported a bug in Google Chrome that allows websites to record audio and video without showing a visual indicator. The bug is not as bad as it sounds, as the malicious website still needs to get the user's permission to access audio and video components, but there are various ways in which this issue could be weaponized to record audio or video without the user's knowledge. Bleeping Computer Does your video game have too many words? (Yeah, probably.) My whole career has been based on writing very story-heavy games, with lots of words. Our company, Spiderweb Software, is small. We can't afford fancy graphics, so we have to rely on words. Interesting, quality words. We're currently remastering the series with our most loved story and our bestest words. We also finished a new series, which had a lot of words which I suspect weren't as good because it didn't sell as well.

One of the most powerful video cards to date is on sale, but there is also a great combo offer to get you started on building a new system. A couple of high resolution displays can be had for a decent price, as well as some cheap storage. As always, feel free to share any sales you come across in the comments. Gigabyte GTX 1080 Ti Founders Edition – $659.99 Nvidia’s GTX 1080 Ti is a blazing-fast top-end graphics card, but remains quite pricey. This sale chops $40 off its MSRP, though you should note that this is a Founders Edition SKU of the 1080 Ti. It doesn’t have a robust cooling solution or crazy overclocks out of the box, but it still performs well above every graphics card out now (except the $1200 Titan Xp). Core i5-7600, ASRock H270M Pro4, 16GB Corsair RAM combo – $380.99 New system builders may want to look into this CPU, motherboard, and RAM combo. It’s made up of an Intel Core i5-7600, an ASRock H270 micro ATX motherboard, and 16GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR4 RAM at 2133MHz. Overall, you’ll save $40 for a strong foundation to build a new gaming computer. Microsoft Windows 10 64-bit Home Edition OEM – $79.99 Speaking of system builders, you can snag the Windows 10 64-bit Home Edition operating system from Fry’s Electronics for $79.99 if you sign up to receive promo codes. Technically, it isn’t hardware, but what’s a good system without the proper software? Western Digital 4TB External Hard Drive – $99.99 This external hard drive from Western Digital offers a ton of storage for the price. It connects through USB 3.0 and requires an external power source to use. The 8TB version is also on sale for $179.99. Eluktronics W650KK1 Laptop with GTX 1050 Ti – $699.97 If you’re looking for a cost-effective solution gaming laptop, you might not get more value than this one from Eluktronics. It comes with a desktop Intel Pentium G4560 dual-core CPU, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and a GTX 1050 Ti, which make for fine gaming performance at 1080p. It’s also equipped with an IPS panel and a 1TB 7200RPM hard drive. Acer 27-inch 1440p IPS Monitor – $249.99 (promo code: EMCRGRB35) If your system is powerful enough for 1440p resolution in modern games and you’re still using a 1080p display, you might want to consider this monitor from Acer. It brings 1440p into a 27 inch IPS display, which means you’ll get better color reproduction in addition to the higher resolution. Be sure to use the promo code to swoop it up for this price. Dell 27-inch 1440p 144Hz G-Sync Monitor – $414.95 (Open Box) This Dell monitor made it onto our list last week, but this time we found open boxes available for even cheaper. The S2716DGR not only packs in a high native resolution of 1440p but also has a 144Hz refresh rate and G-Sync to prevent screen tearing at variable frame rates. 16GB (2x8GB) Geil Evo Potenza DDR4 2400MHz – $93.99 (promo code: EMCRGRC29) Prices on system memory are still higher than they’ve been in the recent past, but if you’re need of 16GB of RAM, this is a cost-effective option. Take note that the heatsinks on these RAM sticks are a bit taller than most, so check twice to make sure you have enough clearance in your case. And don’t forget to use the promo code to get these sticks at this price. Corsair Scimitar Mouse – $49.99 We found the Corsair Scimitar to be one of the better mice that feature a plethora of programmable buttons. Its 12 side buttons have texturing that helps distinguish them from one another. The buttons are solid and tactile without being to soft to accidentally press when gripping the mouse. G.Skill Ripjaws MX780 Mouse – $29.99 The MX 780 mouse from G.Skill may be on the gaudy side in terms of design, but it performs well and has plenty of modular features. There are interchangeable grips and extra buttons on both sides of the mouse, and it comes with optional weights if you prefer a heavier mouse.

John Cornyn, a Republican member of the intelligence panel. “My hope is that sometime in the September timeframe we’ll have a chance to wrap up our investigation on the intelligence committee. These things do have a way of dragging on longer and longer, sometimes because they’re politically controversial as well,” Cornyn said in an interview with WFAA, a Dallas television station. “I think we ought to be able to wrap it up sometime this Fall,” he continued. Senate Intelligence Committee should complete its investigation of Russia and @realdonaldtrump by September, says Sen. @JohnCornyn. pic.twitter.com/LrIUUtscHe — Jason Whitely (@JasonWhitely) June 4, 2017 The committee is conducting a parallel investigation to the FBI’s probe of Russian meddling in the presidential campaign. The sprawling investigations focus on Russian cyber attacks as well as whether any members of the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to influence the outcome of the election. The Senate committee, as well as its counterpart in the House, are also investigating whether members of the Obama administration illegally leaked information about the federal investigation. So far there has been no direct evidence that Trump or anyone from his campaign cooperated with Russian agents to influence the election. Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday that he has not seen explicit evidence of collusion. “We have no smoking gun at this point. But there is a lot of smoke,” Warner said in an interview on CNN. There has been no indication of how long the FBI investigation of Trump-Russia collusion will last. The probe is being overseen by former FBI Director Robert Mueller. He was appointed special counsel last month by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Mueller appears to be conducting an expansive investigation, recent news reports indicate. On Friday it was reported that he is looking into former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s lobbying on behalf of the Turkish government. He is also investigating former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s business activities.

Intel vs. Radeon vs. NVIDIA OpenGL/Vulkan Linux Driver Performance Written by Michael Larabel in Linux Gaming on 4 June 2017. Page 1 of 4. 6 Comments As another interesting benchmark special for Phoronix's 13th birthday is a comparison of Intel Kabylake, NVIDIA, and Radeon Vulkan vs. OpenGL Linux driver performance. Not only are we looking at the raw OpenGL/Vulkan performance but also the relative performance between graphics APIs on each vendor. For this comparison I ran Dota 2, Mad Max, and Serious Sam Fusion 2017 on the three vendors' driver stacks. For testing on the Intel side was the HD Graphics 630 (Kabylake) of the Core i5 7600K system used for testing. On the Radeon side I was using the Radeon RX 480 and R9 Fury; see more AMD benchmarks in yesterday's 6-way GL/Vulkan Radeon comparison. The Radeon and Intel driver make-up was the Linux 4.12 Git kernel with Mesa 17.2-dev via the Padoka PPA on Ubuntu 17.04. On the NVIDIA side was the GeForce GTX 1060 and GTX 1080 paired with the 381.22 display driver. With the three games and five graphics processors, OpenGL and Vulkan were both tested for a side-by-side comparison via the Phoronix Test Suite.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Qualcomm spells out the hurdles to ‘extended reality’ glasses Dean Takahashi@deantak June 4, 2017 8:35 AM Above: Augmented reality and virtual reality will be useful beyond games. Image Credit: Qualcomm Qualcomm is eager for virtual reality and augmented reality to succeed, since it will supply the chips that power the hardware behind “extended reality,” delivered by ordinary-looking glasses that can be used for virtual reality or augmented reality applications. Tim Leland, vice president of product management at Qualcomm, gave a talk this week at Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara, Calif., where all the major tech companies — Google, Intel, Qualcomm, Microsoft — and many others had augmented reality technology on display. Leland explained that there are plenty of obstacles to extended reality at present and urged the industry to work collectively to bring the future into focus faster. He said that AR animations, overlaid on the real world, still look fake. For instance, if AR objects are inserted into the real world but don’t cast shadows, they clearly won’t fit seamlessly in the landscape. But enabling accurate lighting and shadows will require a lot more horsepower, and that will tax battery life. In his talk, Leland showed what kind of hardware the future will require and laid out all of the problems the technology is facing. We talked further about these challenges in an interview. Here’s an edited transcript of our conversation. Above: Tim Leland of Qualcomm talks about extended reality. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VB: What kind of outlook do you have for mixed reality, extended reality? Tim Leland: We’ve hit a milestone. We mentioned we were building Snapdragon 835 VR HMD dev kits with full tool support. We’re bringing those up right now. We’re still on schedule to ship out to developers. We’ll go wide with that program this summer. We’re still executing on our HMD accelerator program. We have all these reference designs available for OEMs if they want to build an HMD based on Snapdragon 835. As far as AR, we’re going full speed ahead. ODG has been a great partner to us. The first time we’d ever done an announcement of a new flagship product with a non-smartphone customer was ODG, here, at CES. That was a vote of confidence. We believe in their technology. We believe in AR. At this event I’m going to be presenting on what we’re calling “extended reality,” or “XR.” It’s an umbrella term to encapsulate VR, AR, and MR. It’s everything. Where we see things going in the future is a converged device that does all of it. It can do VR, with a display that goes completely opaque for that. It can do AR in the same mass-market consumer device. Six degrees of freedom. Inside out tracking for all the head movement. Support for more advanced use cases in eye tracking, and also hand tracking. Looking further down the road, we have this partnership with Leap Motion. Their technology makes VR much more fun and easy to use. We’ll continue to work with them, accelerating some of their algorithms in our heterogeneous compute units inside of Snapdragon to get even better performance. We’re still working with SMI on the eye tracking side. We have a lot of good partnerships on the algorithmic development of the computer vision aspects of AR and VR. We’ll keep pushing those, especially now that we have these dev kits. We’ll have a great platform to continue to refine some of these algorithms with partners. GamesBeat: Where are you making progress? Leland: I don’t know if you were at Google I/O, but there was the announcement there. We’ve been working with Google. There were multiple Daydream smartphone announcements, and two HMDs were announced. One was Lenovo and the other was HTC. I can’t go into too many details on what we’re doing with Google, but we’re very close partners on different form factors of VR devices. Also, we’re working with some unannounced partners on very influential HMD designs going forward. All of which we believe will ship at the end of the year or early next year, with new products on our side being announced toward the end of the year as well. We’ve been very busy on SDKs to make sure we have better development tools. We’ve been refining our six degrees of freedom head motion tracking algorithm, so it works with binocular cameras instead of just a mono camera. It’s even more accurate and uses lower power. For the rest of the presentation I’ll introduce a few problems that I think the ecosystem needs to solve together. There will be areas where all these companies compete, but there are common areas where we should be working to solve some difficult problems. One of those areas I have broken out into five pieces here. If you have a virtual object that you’re placing in the real world, you might draw it correctly. It might be anchored correctly. But if it’s not lit correctly, it’s still going to look fake. If you look at the top one here, that’s the same model as the bottom one, but the bottom is using the real light as the light source. That’s an area where we’ll be working on all aspects of foveation, whether it’s for standardizing and improving foveated graphics rendering to improve visual quality at lower power consumption, and also foveation of video, the view portal for adaptive streaming. When the upstream video service knows you’ve turned your head, it’ll then start refocusing the bitrate to that part of the environment map so you get the best visual quality with reductions in power consumption. It’s a lot of stuff. This is a brand new market and a huge amount of work. The smartphone could eventually become a large segment of the market in XR wearables. There will be no cables in this type of market. Any type of cable is just a non-starter. Fans will not exist. We think there might be a niche market for glasses that maybe stream to a PC, but that’s a small part of it. The big part is everything self-contained in a mobile device. All the visual processing systems are very close to the inertial sampling systems, so everything is very fast, very low motion to photon latency, or for AR, very low photon to photon latency. We’ll just have to solve some of the power problems together with the ecosystem. I list some of those in the presentation. Above: Qualcomm’s vision for the “extended reality” glasses of the future. Image Credit: Qualcomm GB: The lighting issue seems like a big problem, how to make things look real. But then you have to know where the lighting is in the real world. You have to sense that somehow. Leland: It’s a worthy problem for a company that spends a lot of time on visual processing like we do. We’ll be working with middleware companies. I’ve talked to a couple already, operating system guys. At events like this sometimes we just like to throw out one of the difficult problems that we think is worth solving. It gets the debate started. Those that are willing to jump in with us and do some joint R&D sometimes — that’s how we get things moving forward. GB: Are you guys making any predictions as far as how soon things will happen? Leland: I really do think the analogy to smartphones is a good one. Unfortunately, it’s been copied so much, but we came up with this first slide maybe two years ago. We’ve been updating it over time. If you think of this as a 30-year cycle, for phones this would have been about 1987. We’re somewhere in the ‘90s in this analogy. By 2020, somewhere in that time, we think we will enter this phase of the technology — rapid evolution, surging consumer adoption — as these devices become more socially acceptable. They’ll be smaller. They’ll work better. The content is coming. That’ll be the steep part of the hockey stick, where we keep marching along the next 15-20 years after that. There’s still money to be made along the way. There will be volumes in here. But out in this time frame we’re talking hundreds of millions of units per year. We think that’s possible. It’s especially possible if you bring different experiences to the same device, more value to the same device, which is sub-$1,000. It can do VR and AR. It doesn’t require a lot of setup. It just works. It’s awesome to see Facebook put a bunch of effort into what they’re building. Google is doing a great job of funding content for VR. They just acquired a company we invested in, Owlchemy. That was a good acquisition on their side. All arrows are pointing in the direction that mobile is the future and convergence is happening. That’s how we see the world right now. Above: All the sensors for extended reality glasses. Image Credit: Qualcomm GB: Do you have a splintering as well, when you get to other kinds of devices that could happen once the tech was better? Leland: Even within HMDs — there will be HMDs that are specific to different types of jobs or tasks. They could be purpose-built for a particular job. We go through an example in here about a first responder, a firefighter. It shows what that might look like. We had an early mockup of this for the New York event and we’ve been refining it. You wouldn’t imagine that you’d just wear these glasses around, but if it was a mission critical part of your job, something that made your job easier and safer, you might. But the mass market will be glasses that look more like what we wear around anyway. Maybe a bit bigger and heavier, but it can’t be too much. This is the kind of thing where people decide that they don’t need a smartphone. They can just get these glasses. Much like people started deciding they didn’t need a laptop when they could do everything on their phone. Not everybody did that, but a big swathe of consumers did. That may be the case as mobile evolves and changes form factor. Above: The can without a shadow doesn’t look real. Image Credit: Qualcomm GB: On the game side, are you envisioning anything in particular? Leland: It’ll be interesting to see where AR gaming goes. It’s been around a while. I got a Nintendo 3DS a while ago, and that was fun. As the ability to more appropriately place and draw and light virtual objects in real-world settings — it could be a lot of fun for kids too. You don’t have to get out all these different board games. Put on the glasses, load a program, there it is. The game is all set up right in front of you. You can movie pieces and draw cards. We might even see a revival of the old games we used to play as kids. Now it’s just an augmented version. For VR there’s going to be — all the PC and console games will probably be rejigged for VR. Part of the market will go crazy for that. We make an SDK. We have a team that supports game developers. We’re working with Tencent. We’re pretty active in the gaming space. There’s another big publisher over in China that we can’t talk about yet, but we’re working with them. We’re very closely partnered with Unity to make sure that engine — which is the foundation of almost every VR game in development, it feels like — is well-optimized for Snapdragon. Above: Augmented reality looks fake today. Image Credit: Qualcomm GB: In that 30-year cycle, where do you see something like 5G coming into it? It seems to make it much more useful. Leland: It sure does. Where that will come into play is most likely for video. If you look where we are today, 4K Ultra HD, 30fps, 360 degrees… We’re probably not completely there. It’s just starting to come online for broadcast video and streaming from other services. In the next decade, though, it’s going to go crazy. It’ll be 8K, up to 120fps, all high dynamic range. We’ll have the concept of the free viewpoint, where all the video has been captured from multiple angles, so it’s almost like computer graphics. You can walk around and interact with video. The major sports franchises are very interested in this part. This is going to require multiple gigabits per second. Importantly, because this is interactive, you want low latency. With 5G, we’re improving the latency, the responsiveness with other applications, by 10 times. It’s down to a millisecond. The other important thing is you don’t have to stand right next to the cell tower to get that. The 5G experience is much more uniform as you’re walking away from the cell tower. You don’t see the same kind of reduction in throughput and latency. Above: This is how real augmented reality should look. Image Credit: Qualcomm GB: It also seems to have the effect of lightening up the glasses, if you don’t need as much processing or hardware in them. Leland: For video, that’s more latency-tolerant. The video content will be from Netflix, YouTube, somebody else’s server connected to their drones, somebody else’s glasses. But for graphics, we believe most of that will be rendered on the device. Graphics is more latency-intolerant. Outside of the view frustum, nothing exists in graphics. You wouldn’t do that. You wouldn’t burn unnecessary power. But for video, you’re taking a scene and wrapping it around a sphere or a rectangular projection. The benefit of this interaction latency — even if you can’t interact with the video, if you have lower latency as you turn your head, you can alert the system that’s streaming to you. “Okay, focus the highest bitrate on this part of the video for the best visual quality.” That’s called viewport aware adaptive streaming. Google is investing big on that, and others as well. There’s going to be a mix of a lot of processing, particularly visual processing, in the HMD itself, but you want to have high connectivity over 5G to these internet services for the stuff that’s less latency-intolerant. It’s going to be killer. XR video is going to be the killer application for 5G. GB: What do you think is the answer once people get to a point where they can’t necessarily tell what’s real and what’s not? Leland: I do think it’s going to happen. “When?” is a good question. Part of that depends on the viewer. If you’re like me and you do this every day and you know what flaws to look for, we may be the guys who take longer. For the average consumer, though, when do they say it’s just like real life? I don’t know. It won’t be for a few more years. Sometime in the middle of the next decade, maybe, we could get to a point where quite a few applications are indistinguishable from reality. Above: Qualcomm believes extended reality will unfold over decades. Image Credit: Qualcomm GB: Tony Parisi of Unity was saying, “If you think we have a problem with fake news now, wait until you can actually fake what people see.” Leland: [laughs] We’re swimming in the same direction as Tony. We’re pretty closely partnered with those guys. We have a common view of the world. It’s moving toward mobile. The different markets that graphics could service within VR are pretty immense. I don’t think a week goes by that we’re not talking to Unity in some fashion. We’re pretty heavily engaged with them, just like Google and other similar companies. GB: Any other key conclusions in your talk? Leland: These problems we’re talking about, there is no one company that can solve them. There’s no half a dozen companies. They’re not even just hardware problems. Even on power consumption, there’s a software element. There are times when we’ll compete with different companies, but there’s a lot of room to come together. It’s time we start agreeing on some of the goalposts for these difficult problems. Like field of view – do we go after more than 190 degrees? Do we just stick with 190 degrees on the horizontal but optimize the heck out of everything in the middle? It’s time for the industry to start agreeing on the fundamentals as best we can. We can still compete in areas where we agree, but if we don’t start working together it’s going to stagnate the evolution of these high-volume devices that are waiting out there. Make products that consumers want to buy and they’ll want to buy them. Volumes will go up. If we just try to repurpose old PC-era antiquated architectures and create a market out of what we have, don’t be surprised when consumers don’t react and you have this gap of disappointment. We’re focused on trying to make products with our partners that consumers want to buy. We’re focusing on some of these problems and we’re eventually going to fix them. Above: The vision for extended reality. Image Credit: Qualcomm GB: I could see definite problems in the input systems. There’s going to be so many ways to do input. Whether or not you’ll have touch feedback or detect one finger or detect all 10 fingers– Leland: Our take on that — in the near term there are six degrees of freedom controllers that are ramping up at various stages. There’s some nice consortium activity going on in the open XR community at Khronos to standardize the APIs that those different controllers will work with, so there’s not this fragmentation problem for developers. But in the long term, as we’ve been saying, the best controller is no controller, using computer vision and machine learning technologies to predict and interpret gestures rapidly. For VR, using 3D reconstruction brings your own hands overlaying these models that are being used in VR, so it looks like — it’s even more immersive. GB: Does that then create a new problem, though, where you can’t feel it? Leland: There will probably be some accessories related to the tactile aspect. I’m hearing about people working on smells, as well. A lot of companies are working on sound-related technologies that you could relate to haptic feedback. A year ago, the ability to move and see your hands seemed impossible, but now that’s normal in the virtual environment. GB: Does anything seem like it’s going to be too difficult? I get that feeling about eye tracking, whether you can control things with your eyes. Leland: It feels like it’s more of a complementary technology. You’d have certain interfaces that would not completely rely on eye tracking to complete the entire interaction. It would be more assistive.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement MSI Cubi 3 is a fanless mini desktop PC with Intel Kaby Lake 06/03/2017 at 9:57 AM by Brad Linder 13 Comments MSI is showing off the latest member of its Cubi line of tiny desktop computers. The MSI Cubi 3 is a small desktop computer with an aluminum case and a fanless design for silent operation. While it’s not the first MSI Cubi computer to feature passive cooling, it is the first fanless model to feature a 15 watt Intel Kaby Lake-U series processor rather than a lower-power Braswell chip. According to Tek.No, which spotted the MSI Cubi 3 at Computex, the new computer is expected to ship this fall. The system has ventilation around the top of the computer to let hot air escape. Under the hood, it features two DDR4 SODIMM slots for up to 32GB of memory, a 2.5 inch drive bay, and an M.2 2280 slot for solid state storage. MSI notes that the computer is also compatible with Intel Optane memory. It’s a little larger than some MSI Cubi systems, in order to give the hardware room to breathe. But it’s still pretty compact for a desktop computer. The MSI Cubi 3 features DisplayPort and HDMI ports, six USB ports, two Ethernet jacks, and two COM ports (including one which is used for an Ethernet jack in the display model). Powered by a Kaby Lake-U chip with Intel HD graphics, MSI says the Cubi 3 should have no problem handling 4K displays. But keep in mind that the computer will ship with a laptop-class processor, so don’t expect bleeding edge desktop-class performance. Still, as someone who’s been using laptops with Intel Ivy Bridge and Kaby Lake processors as my primary work machines for the past few years, I don’t really consider the use of a 15 watt processor to be a down side (although I wouldn’t mind having something a little faster for rendering large, complicated audio projects). Pricing for the MSI Cubi 3 hasn’t been announced yet. via FanlessTech   Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply 13 Comments on "MSI Cubi 3 is a fanless mini desktop PC with Intel Kaby Lake" Login with Notify of new follow-up comments new replies to my comments Notify of new replies to this comment Notify of new replies to this comment Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member FanlessTech Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

For the record most of the 15W Kaby Lake chips are more powerful than the 65W desktop Sandy Bridge from few years ago. They are legit desktop replacement for basic tasks.

During the past 5 years I’ve noticed that once you go fanless at home, there’s no turning back. I’ll be replacing my skylake nuc with this because I can’t make it fanless. Dealing with some hub and adapter is not an issue. Vote Up3Vote Down  Reply 4 days 14 hours ago Member 'Ilvee Tidus' Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Am I the only one who can’t hear the fan from 13 feet away? Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 4 days 12 hours ago Guest riddick Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

My wife’s 17inch HP envy is dead silent 99% of the time… that’s a mobile skylake i7. I see fanless as a disadvantage, as it limits the heavy load performance. There are many SFF and laptops with very quiet active cooling solutions… Apple macs have fans and are very quiet.

The truth is that fanless deosn’t mean high temperature and throttling. A well designed passive cooling can outperform your average cooling fan.

And please don't worry, your report will be anonymous. You’re not alone. My PC has something like 9 fans in it, mostly 120mm, it’s noticeable when going full whack and pumping out some 600W of heat but becomes unnoticeably quiet at low load. Part of that’s having a case with noise-damping foam. Now, if you genuinely only need about 15W of electronics, then sure, your mobile phone’s computer enough and silent’s reasonable. You want a GPU or to do some video rendering? No way. Vote Up0Vote Down  Reply 3 days 18 hours ago Member FanlessTech Share On TwitterShare On Google Click to flag and open «Comment Reporting» form.

Industrial PCs are fanless because they can run 24/7 and require no maintenance.

The most wonderful time of the year isn’t Christmas; it’s the two weeks around the end of May when Apple holds its annual developer conference. In one speech, we normally get a mix of new hardware and software updates, and Apple lays out the direction it’s going to take for the next 12 months. This year, we’re expecting a big one when WWDC 2017 starts on Monday at 1:00PM Eastern. In this post, we’ll roundup all of the most notable WWDC 2017 rumors so you know what to expect during Apple’s big WWDC keynote next week. Don't Miss: It’ll be a long time until the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot are priced this low again New MacBooks Right now, the safest best for new hardware at WWDC 2017 is an update to the MacBook lineup. It might be a little odd, considering Apple just launched an all-new MacBook Pro back in November, but all the leaks, rumors and retail supply chain leaks have pointed towards some kind of new model. That’s the good news. The bad news is that we’re probably not going to see a new MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a few more ports. Instead, the smart money is on the current MacBook range getting a spec bump on the inside, most likely with Intel’s new Kaby Lake processor. Improvements have also been made to the graphics cards for portable machines, so you could also expect the MacBook Pro to get a graphics bump. Siri Speaker We’re also expecting to see a new Siri-powered home speaker to pop up looking a lot like the Amazon Echo. Smart speakers have emerged as the obvious portal for controlling the smart home, so Apple can’t let Amazon and Google run away with the prize. It’s challenging to innovate on the concept of “kitchen speaker with an AI and a microphone built in,” so Apple has two options here: launch a keep-up-with-the-Joneses product that demonstrates its commitment to the product and lays the groundwork for something revolutionary to come; or try the classic Apple move, and make a much more expensive version to capture the high end of the market. It’s unclear what a “high-end” home speaker would look like, but a focus on audio quality using Beats branding isn’t out of the question. New iMacs Just like the new MacBooks, it’s possible that we’ll see a spec bump for the iMac. Intel’s new processors sure would look good inside, and it would lessen some of the cries we’ve been hearing that Apple doesn’t produce ‘“pro” computers any more. New iPads Finally, there’s rumors going around that we’ll see a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro at WWDC. It likely won’t be a “new” form-factor, as there’s already a 9.7-inch iPad Pro on the market (and it recently went on sale!) Instead, look for much thinner bezels enabling a bigger screen in the existing body. Software iOS 11 Apple uses WWDC to show off the newest version of iOS every year like clockwork, and there’s zero reason to imagine that this year will be different. Bloomberg rumors suggest that iOS 11 will see a design overhaul, not as severe as the iOS 7 update that scrapped skeuomorphic design, but still significant. One of the biggest new features could be the introduction of a “dark” mode across the entire OS, something that jailbreakers have been doing for years. It’s a quick and easy way to save a little battery life and appease some of the more hardcore fans. We’re also expecting updates to apps, including a possible peer-to-peer payment function in Apple Pay, and more videos in Apple Music to tie in with Apple’s first original series launching soon. One thing we haven’t heard much about are updates to Siri. Google’s recent developer conference focused heavily on the Google Assistant, and how it’s finding its way across the entire platform. If Apple is expecting the Siri Speaker to do anything well, Siri’s going to need some major updates, and fast. One of the big interface differences between the Assistant and Siri is the ability to have written conversations and type queries; it’s quite possible that Apple builds that functionality right into iOS 11. macOS Of course, we’re expecting to see a new version of macOS, but it’s unlikely to be anything big. We said above that Siri needs to be a focus of WWDC overall this year, so that’s one obvious thing for Apple to focus on for the Macs. Siri found its way to the desktop at WWDC last year, so some new features could be in order. “Hey Siri” functionality could be expanded, and third-party features don’t currently work for Siri on MacOS. Read More What we won’t see Some bad news: we almost definitely won’t see a new iPhone. Although the iPhone SE is technically due an update, the timing would be terrible. Apple is expected to announce three new phones of some kind this fall; the last thing it needs is a new cheap iPhone undercutting the “super-cycle” of people upgrading to the iPhone 8. A new Mac Pro is also probably off the table. Although the timing for a preview announcement makes sense, Apple execs previously hinted that a new Mac Pro would come by the end of the year. That also gives Apple time to integrate Intel’s newly-announced Core i9 chips, which are an obvious thing for Apple to stick inside its premiere video-editing machine.

Intel's next-gen 18C/36T processor won't be released until next year By: Anthony Garreffa | CPU, APU & Chipsets News | Posted: 4 days, 13 hours ago Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Intel might have unveiled their new Core i9 range of processors at Computex 2017, led by the flagship Core i9-7980XE processor and its 18C/36T of power. Except, that monster will not see the light of day until 2018 according to an ASUS representative.     "Raja@ASUS" on the ASUS ROG forums replied to someone asking about the benefits of Intel's new 18-core CPU, to which he responded with: "The 18-core CPUs are not scheduled until later this year. Won't have them for a while. Either way, unless you're using the rig for rendering or encoding to make a living, no need".   I don't think we'll see the Core i9-7980XE until early 2018, which will let AMD have plenty of time to get ThreadRipper into the hands of consumers with the full 16C/32T of power and a full 64 PCIe 3.0 lanes compared to the 44 PCIe 3.0 lanes on X299 from Intel.

The iMac Pro takes Apple's 5K iMac chassis and crams it full of workstation-class hardware. CPU duties will be handled by what sounds like eight-core, 10-core, and even 18-core versions of Intel's presumably upcoming Skylake Xeons. Graphics power will come courtesy of AMD's Radeon Vega graphics chip with up to 16GB of VRAM on board. The truly insatiable will be able to add 128GB of ECC RAM and 4TB of PCIe SSD storage to their iMac Pros, as well. All that computing power needs copious interconnect bandwidth to communicate with the outside world, and Apple is delivering with four Thunderbolt 3 ports and a built-in 10Gb Ethernet NIC. The machine will be VESA-mountable, and its space gray finish won't stand out in the subdued lighting of directors' editing bays. Apple will be introducing the iMac Pro in December with an eight-core Xeon, unspecified Vega graphics hardware, 32GB of ECC RAM, and a 1TB SSD for $4999.

His name was never mentioned Monday. But his presence loomed inside the Naylor Stone media room at the Mal Moore Athletic Facility. That was especially true when Brad Bohannon, his successor as Alabama's baseball coach, delivered his opening comments at his introductory news conference. "My goal going forward is to make Alabama the absolute best place to play college baseball in the country, and we have everything we need in place to make that happen," Bohannon said Monday. "We're going to do that by being a players-first program." It was a telling comment sandwiched between a series of remarks that coalesced into a renunciation of Goff and his methods. In short order, Bohannon presented himself as the antithesis of Goff -- his predecessor who was fired May 24 following his inaugural season, in part, because of his heavy-handed approach and his intractability. As the Crimson Tide was sliding into the abyss on way to finishing dead last in the Southeastern Conference and posting the lowest win total at Alabama since 1980, Goff tried to impose his aggressive style on a team that was reluctant to embrace him while at the same time failing to curry favor with a fan base that always approached him with a measure of skepticism. Don't expect that to happen under Bohannon. "Early on, we're going to coach to our personnel," he said. "I think it's important initially for me and our coaching staff to adjust to our players. Over time we're going to strive to be balanced." Bohannon sold his vision to Greg Byrne last Monday at the Alabama athletic director's home. The former Wake Forest MBA student and senior financial analyst at Intel Corporation used a PowerPoint presentation to illustrate his plan for resuscitating a program that has fallen on hard times. In doing so, he clearly demonstrated he wasn't anything like Goff. "He hit it all: academic, compliance, coaching, recruiting, alums, community, everything," Byrne recalled. "All the bases. He hit a grand slam, to use a baseball analogy." Before bringing Bohannon aboard, Byrne did his own reconnaissance. He wanted to find out more about the longtime assistant who has spent 14 years in the Southeastern Conference -- having worked the first 12 at Kentucky and the last two at Auburn. So, Byrne resorted to a bit of guile, instructing Alabama's associate athletic director for compliance, Matt Self, to use a blocked number and call players whom Bohannon had previously coached. Byrne was eager to hear from a wide variety of Bohannon's pupils -- the stars, the reserves and even the guys who never saw any action. The wide array of perspectives would create an accurate summation of the man Byrne was looking to hire. Self immediately took on the roll of pollster and went to work on his survey -- asking the pool of subjects how Bohannon had treated them and whether they thought he played by the rules and supported their efforts in the classroom.  "On top of that, the last question...is: 'If you had to do it all over again, would you want to play for Coach Bohannon?'" Byrne said. "And without a doubt, 100 percent of the young men that he talked to said, 'I'd absolutely play for Coach Bohannon again.' "And I knew with that, that was the kind of coach we wanted here at the University of Alabama." Byrne viewed Bohannon's ability to build relationships with all kinds of people -- from high school prospects and alumni to his wife, Kim -- as a desirable quality. And for Bohannon, it may be his greatest asset, because in the college baseball world he is known as an ace recruiter -- having landed Top 25 classes the last nine seasons. "Good players make good coaches," Bohannon said. "Kids want to play for coaches that they think can help them develop as people and players, and people they have a connection with. And if you really want to connect with people, you have to communicate." It became clear that Goff struggled -- or was often unwilling -- to do just that. He wanted it his way, and in the most draconian sense, he demanded absolute fealty to his system. The more mild-mannered Bohannon is going to tackle the same job in a different way. "You have to care," he said. "I really do want to get to know the kids because this job is all about getting the right people on the front end." Seconds later, Bohannon's first news conference as Alabama's baseball coach ended. The page had officially been turned from the Goff Era. And it was welcomed. After all, Bohannon represents a clean break from a tumultuous period Byrne and Co. would just as soon forget.

The event started with Apple CEO welcoming the audience at the 15th WWDC in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley where Apple is building its new campus. Before making the announcements, Cook said that this year “it is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever.” Cook also praised the Apple developer community which has 16 million registered developers and added three million last year. He announced that Amazon’s video app will come to Apple’s TV streaming box later this year. The app will let users stream all the Amazon original hits. Soon after the announcement, Amazon tweeted, “You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year.” Apple also announced that watchOS 4, the next version of its smartwatch platform, will be arriving in September. It includes new features for watch faces, such as complications updating based on time of day or location and a new Siri-based watch face. The Siri watch face uses machine learning to determine what information is most useful to you at a given point in time. Other new watch faces include a kaleidoscope and new characters such as Woody, Jesse, and Buzz from the Toy Story movie franchise. WatchOS 4 will also bring updates to the watch’s fitness tracking, including a new user interface for the workout app and new integrations with gym equipment manufacturers. Apple said that watch wearers will be able to link their devices with the gym equipment through NFC. Next up in tech is Apple’s new version of macOS is called High Sierra which is launched with new Safari browser. Apple said that it is the fastest browser ever with features like autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention that uses machine learning to block irritating content. Apple also brought file system and virtual reality (VR) to High Sierra. The tech titan also announced updates to its entire MacBook line giving its laptops more powerful specifications in the form of the latest Intel chips. MacBook Pros will be shipped with Intel’s Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. The company also launched a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299. The newly updated MacBook laptops are now available. Apple also showed a sneak peek into a new all-in-one desktop called the iMac Pro. Called as “the most powerful Mac ever, the new product will be available from December starting at $4,999. The new machine will come with an 8-core Xeon processor, with configurations that scale up to an 18-core Xeon processor and an all-new AMD Radeon Vega graphics GPU, up to 16 GB of VRAM and up to 4 TB for SSD storage. Cook also launched iOS 11 with over 10 new features. He said that iOS 10 had nearly 96 per cent satisfaction with 86 per cent iPhone users installing the update as compared to only seven per cent Android users who installed Android Nougat – the latest version of Google’s operating system. The new iOS will now synchronise messages across iOS and macOS automatically. If a user erases a message on your iPhone or iPad, that will be reflected on the Mac as well. Apple also made improvements to Siri including making the assistant’s voice sound more natural when responding to users. Siri will now be able to perform translations in various languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Laptops by Lori Grunin 6 June 2017 5:50 am AEST @LoriGrunin Apple unveils iMac Pro at WWDC Apple reveals its new high-end iMac Pro workstation. The new machine will be $4,999 and available in December. 2:29 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF For WWDC 2017, Apple headed south to San Jose, dogged by damning comparisons with Google, Facebook and Microsoft over its lack of attention to mixed reality (VR and AR), Siri's absence from your smart home in comparison with smart home hubs like the Google Home  and Amazon Echo and other ways in which Apple seems to have fallen behind. Folks were eager to hear about Apple's plans to catch up in these leading-edge markets. 49 Apple's biggest WWDC announcements Even before the conference opening, we began to hear the numbers: iOS app developers earned $20 billion in 2016 (and given Apple's 30 percent cut, that means it made a not-so-paltry $6 billion) and downloads are growing at a nice pace. The company updated its Swift Playgrounds, a teach-kids-to-code-Swift (its proprietary programming language) app, to support control over robots and drones. The keynote began with a video showing how the world would fall apart if we didn't have our iOS apps and the safe and sane App Store. And in a random announcement, we see a small step for Amazon, a huge leap for Apple TV owners: you're getting an Amazon Video app.  And of course, all the inteligence is driven by enhanced Apple AI technology. Later in the conference, Michelle Obama will be talking empowerment. Apple's HomePod is a smart speaker for your home Apple wants the new Siri-powered device to be the center of your home. It will cost $349 and will be available starting in December. by Scott Stein 1:00 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF HomePod Interestingly, Apple positioned its new home speaker as a music experience rather than just the rumored a smart-home hub, ostensibly to "reinvent home music." You can't get it until later in 2017, though. Dubbed the HomePod, it has better audio specs than other hub speakers -- pretty good audio specs in general for its size -- and an A8 chip for processing (the same chip that's in the iPhone). It uses a wide-array mic that supposedly can hear you over the music, and naturally integrates with Apple Music and can control HomeKit devices. It will ship in December for $350.  16 Say hello to Apple's HomePod smart speaker iOS 11 and apps The latest update of Apple's mobile operating system, iOS 11, has some notable new features: Interface: A redesigned app drawer with horizontal scrolling as well as a redesigned control center with more 3D Touch operations. The lockscreen can show all notifications,  iMessages: Automatic message synchronization across devices via iCloud. Apple Pay: Now it supports person-to-person payments across all iOS devices and works with iMessages. Siri: She's got a more natural-sounding voice and can translate for you and suggest tasks. Plus there's a new more visual interface. And she knows you across your devices. But she'll respect your privacy. Camera: New H.265 video encoding for more efficient storage and a new High Efficiency Image Format based on H.265 to replace JPEG. Threre's a new depth API (needed for AR). It will enable the faux defocus mode for portraits, too. Photos: Welcome editable Live Photos with GIF-like tools like looping and reversing, and a long-exposure effect. Memories now recognizes pets and supports vertical video. Apple Maps: Now with floor plans of the mall! Also lane guidance and a do-not-disturb mode that senses when a car is moving. AirPlay 2: Control multiroom speakers (with supported speakers), and Apple TV. Apple Music will show you your friends's suggested picks. Redesigned App Store with a games tab. And more, of course. Though not a feature, Apple also launched an augmented-reality programming interface, ARKit, so that developers can incorporate AR into apps. It demoed a better-looking Pokemon Go built using it. 29 Here are the iOS 11 features Apple announced at WWDC 2017  MacBooks and iMacs The iMacs get better displays, better storage options, an improved display and 2 Thunderbolt/USB-C connectors. Also, an update to Intel 7th-generation and the new integrated graphics, plus the Retina 4K incorporates the discrete RX500 series and the 5K model gives you Radeon RX500 series options. That puts them on par with Windows 10 all-in-ones. The 21.5-inch starts at $1,100 and the 5K 27-inch starts at $1,800. A 4K 21.5 inch starts at $1,300. A new iMac Pro will ship by the end of the year, the company's most powerful Mac ever. It has better cooling than a typical iMac, it ships with up to an 18-core Xeon, Radeon Vega graphics, up to 128GB of ECC memory and up to 4TB of SSD storage.  And it will start at $5,000 when it ships in December. The MacBooks are refreshed with 7th-generation Intel chips and better graphics, and the 13-inch without Touchbar gets a price drop to $1,300. The Air gets a brush-up. 13 The new iMac Pro is truly a beast iPad and iPad Pro Apple adds an iPad Pro model with a 10.5-inch display in the 9.7-inch body, thanks to smaller bezels. Both iPad Pros will get new displays, with True Tone, DCI-P3 gamut, 600-nit brightness and ultralow reflectivity. A new feature, Pro Motion, bumps the refresh rate to 120Hz. Latency drops to 20ms with the Apple Pencil. They're also faster, thanks to the 12-core GPU and six-core CPU Fusion A10X chip. A better camera with 4K and wide-gamut capture is another hardware highlight, along with USB-C fast charging. They both come with 64GB memory and start at $650 for the smaller and $800 for the larger model. They'll be available next week. There are more iPad-specific features in iOS 11. Swipe up to bring up the dock to switch apps or bring one up and drag-and-drop anything. A new Files app brings a more desktoplike file system operation that supports third-party storage providers. There's a special markup mode for use with the Pencil and it does handwriting recognition in Notes. MacOS High Sierra The MacOS desktop operating system didn't get a major update, as you can tell from the name, just some refinements. But a lot of the High Sierra refinements are performance-focused, which is always welcome. The big enhancements: Safari: It "helps give you a serene browsing experience." Whut? But now it's faster, with autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention to filter cross-site scripting and so on. Mail: Split view for the compose window, smaller storage footprint. Photos: New organization and editing tools, filter by keywords and file types, better face recognition, synchronization across devices. The editing tools can now synchronize with other editing tools. And there are new photo book partnerships. The file system: This has needed an update for a long time, and now the much more modern APFS is the default. Video: Support for hardware acceleration and a software encoder for H.265 video. Graphics: An update to its acceleration architecture, Metal 2, with a lot of performance increases. It also supports a new external enclosure for MacBooks, with Thunderbolt 3 and A Radeon RX 580. Metal 2 also adds hooks for VR. Want MacOS High Sierra and iOS 11 sooner rather than later? Sign up for the public betas. 10 MacOS High Sierra has some really cool new features WatchOS 4 New to WatchOS, Apple's watch operating system: New faces: A new Siri watch face and a new complication for showing notifications, a Kaleidoscope face based on your image and faces with "Toy Story" characters. Fitness: Monthly challenges in the Activity tracker; a new interface and new high-intensity workout in the Workout app, two-way data exchange with gym equipment, and more. Music: It integrates better with Apple Music to feed your favorites to the watch. A vertically scrolling interface. Native Bluetooth to connect to sensors. 25 Apple WatchOS 4 preview in pics It was one of the most fast-moving, packed 2.5-hour WWDC keynotes I've seen in a while. I'm exhausted. See you in a year.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → In the Year of iPad, Mac Not Forgotten  June 5, 2017June 5, 2017 ⌘ Permalink This WWDC has two big winners: iPad software and Mac hardware. Yes, there’s that new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and yes, we’ll be running macOS High Sierra come this fall, but I think these two categories are the biggest stories to come out of the keynote. iOS 11 is finally giving iPad users the tools they need to get work done more efficiently and with more power. It all looks amazing, and I cannot wait to try it out. But I really want to talk about Mac hardware. Right off the bat, the entire notebook line got a bump. The MacBooks and MacBook Pros are now shipping with Kaby Lake Intel processors, but the latter is still capped at 16 GB of RAM. Everything got updated GPUs, and the entry-model MacBook Pro without Touch Bar now runs $1299. These moves signal that Apple is committed to the pro notebook, as the updates come just months after releasing these computers. I hope Apple keeps its foot on the gas here, and works to keep things updated more aggressively from here on out. The MacBook Air also got an update to the “newer processors,” but Apple didn’t even give the dead-man-walking notebook a “New” badge on its website. That’s just cold. Even colder? The Mac mini was not mentioned or upgraded. It is, however, still for sale. The iMac line got refreshed as well. Fusion Drives are now standard on all 27-inch configurations and the top-end 21.5-inch iMac. The updated, brighter displays are powered by new GPUs. All the systems — thanks with Kaby Lake processors — are noticeably faster than the ones they replace. Around back, the four USB A ports remain. The full IO list is now: Headphone SDXC card slot Four USB 3 (Type A) Two Thunderbolt 3 Gigabit Ethernet Then there’s the big story. The iMac Pro. Apple mentioned it was working on “pro configs” of the iMac, and when this think ships at the end of the year, I’d say they would have delivered. Donned in Space Gray, this iMac is just as thin as its Retina 5K sibling, but is all-new inside: 8, 10, or 18-Core Up to 128 GB EEC RAM Up to 4 TB SSD Radeon Pro Vega 56 GPU Four USB 3 (Type A) ports Four Thunderbolt 3 ports 10Gb Ethernet Even its periphals are in Space Gray. It looks dope: A post shared by Ren Caldwell (@settern) on Jun 5, 2017 at 1:20pm PDT All of this is made possible by an all-new cooling system that has added those intake slots along the bottom part of the back case. I hope Apple’s learned their Mac Pro-shaped lesson about that sort of thing and that this thermal arrangement will allow for component updates down the road. (I did notice the lack of a RAM door in Serenity’s photo. I’m hoping that it is there on the finished product, but I think I’m going to be sad.) Update: Apple says the RAM is not user-replaceable. Starting at $4,999 when it goes on sale later this year, the iMac Pro is pushing the sometime-after-2017 Mac Pro to the fringe. We don’t know anything about that machine yet, but assuming it has expansion slots, that, multiple processor support and a freedom of display choice may be its biggest selling points.1 The iMac Pro’s price point also says something about the upcoming Mac Pro. Ouch. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Sponsor: Working Copy Your sourcecode, websites, and images on your tablet and phone, even when offline.

Win! X-23's Sunglasses From 'Logan' (And Other Cool Stuff) Apple Refreshes The Entire MacBook Line Up, And I'm Pissed Alex Cranz Jun 6, 2017, 7:00am ⋅ Filed to:  kaby lake macbook wwdc wwdc 2017 Share Apple's big developer conference, WWDC, is usually not the place for hardware updates, but as Tim Cook said at the beginning of WWDC 2017, "This is the biggest WWDC ever." To that end, Apple announced upgrades to nearly every single product in its computer line up, and thoroughly screwed over every single person who bought a MacBook Pro back in November. Things started off nicely enough. Apple announced an update to the iMac, with discrete AMD graphics cards coming to every 4K iMac that are powerful enough to let you enjoy the HTC Vive VR headset. There were also additional Thunderbolt 3 ports and a processor improvement: The newest iMacs will run Kaby Lake. Intel's New Kaby Lake Processors: What You Need To Know Kaby Lake, Intel's latest processor family, wasn't supposed to exist. Earlier this year Intel announced the end of its well-known tick-tock release schedule, whereby it trots out a new processor every September. The tick is the shrinking and improvements of the current microarchitecture, while the tock is a whole new architecture. Instead last year's 'tock', Skylake, was going to hang around a while, with no new 'tick' in sight. Read more If you've heard Kaby Lake discussed in relation to Apple, it's because Apple has skipped Kaby Lake in the past. Notoriously when Apple refreshed its laptop line last year, for the first time in two years, it skipped out on Kaby Lake. Now it's updated every single laptop and desktop to Kaby Lake. This is a huge improvement for iMacs and the MacBook, but it's deeply deeply annoying for those of us who bought the newly redesigned MacBook Pro back in November. Particularly as these new Kaby Lake machines are cheaper as well. The only bright side, for early adopters, is that Kaby Lake mobile processors aren't always that much faster than Skylake processors — something Gizmodo learned when pitting the Skylake Macbook Pro against Kaby Lake machines from Razer and Dell. While these kind of processor refreshes are very common with other computer makers, Apple has always been very slow to embrace processor updates. In fact, it's long been part of the "Apple Tax" (alongside the higher price Apple computers demand). So, from an early adopter who hoped she had at least a year before you refreshed and made her device obsolete — goddammit! Sent from my 2016 MacBook Pro.

Reply 0 trembre @trembre Jun 6, 2017, 8:49am If you don't drink during the presentation then you won't get pissed. Reply 1 troels @troels Jun 6, 2017, 8:54am Seriously, it was pretty obvious at the launch of the last model that this was a likely scenario. You paid the early adopter tax. Also Kaby Lake is not a huge leap in performance but there are some other major benefits in power usage, native support for HEVC encoding and decoding for 4K videos and other graphics improvements. There will be less load on the CPU as a result. https://beebom.com/intel-kaby-lake-vs-skylake/ Plus of course you can finally now get 32GB of RAM. Welcome to 2016 Apple. Last edited June 6, 2017 8:56 am Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:15am Also, Kaby Lake wasn't fully available when the last MBP was launched, and everyone knew Kaby was coming, so if you bought then, and aren't a total, well, goose, then you would have known these were coming in the next year. Had they not been released with Kaby Lake at the conference, then the headlines would have been "Apple falls behind" or similar. The 32GB is welcome, and again, it was due to a lack of a suitable chipset in the previous model that they topped out at 16GB, everyone knew a 32GB model would be coming once Kaby Lake bumped in to a model refresh. I never understand people getting pissed off that they buy tech, and that 6 months later new tech comes out that is better. It is how it works. Reply 0 troels @troels Jun 6, 2017, 9:19am Actually its not clear now if there is a 32GB option on the new MBP. Different sites are reporting different things... Reply 0 yld_1 @yld_1 Jun 6, 2017, 2:25pm Love it when we DE-dramatise the writer i would be pissed if i got a 4k imac last month. Discrete graphics make a big difference Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 9:18am and thoroughly screwed over every single person who bought a MacBook Pro back in November November was 8 months ago, I don't see how releasing an update to a computer line 8 months later or even 6 months later is screwing anyone over. Reply 3 over30yearsofsharing @over30yearsofsharing Jun 6, 2017, 10:57am Please, its Apple 101 Reply 0 fenix @fenix Jun 6, 2017, 12:58pm You made my exact comment, yearly or every second yearly refreshes are common across the board now. We live in a time where you have to size up the market, and if the product you want is on the shelf or around the corner then buy it. Once you've made that purchase you can't whinge about the next model coming out in 6-8 months. Reply 2 okibi @okibi Jun 6, 2017, 9:41am Anyone want to buy a 2 month old MacBookPro? Last edited June 6, 2017 9:41 am Reply 0 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 10:03am Sure, the new upgrades aren't all that important for most work. Reply 1 Johnny F Guest Jun 6, 2017, 10:00am Get over it. How sad that just because YOU personally purchased a laptop in November you want to stop progress and everyone else from benefiting until YOU feel it is time. Stop being so damn selfish and whingy. Reply 3 targeting compoita @poita Jun 6, 2017, 10:04am I'm hopeful the article is at least a bit tongue in cheek. Tone is tricky in print. Reply 1 Almost Guest Jun 7, 2017, 9:28am Perhaps the author is suggesting that Apple should make the timetable for the release of new hardware explicit so that s/he (Alex is a unisex name) can make a better informed decision? Reply 0 loquaciousdandy @loquaciousdandy Jun 6, 2017, 1:17pm Firstly, your laptop isn't any slower or less capapable today then it was yesterday. Secondly, looking at the recent update history for the MacBook pro, ignoring the abnormal 527 day stretch for the 2015 model, the MacBook pro has been updated on average every 268 days, which is just short of 9 months. Even including the 2015 model only takes that average up to 10 months. There is little reason to expect the MacBook Pro line would go "at least a year" without a refresh. Thirdly, you're obviously aware that Intel has a CPU rollout timeline. There was certainly commentary at the time that Apple released the 2016 MacBook Pro that they had gone with the older Skylake chips instead of Kaby Lake - in fact, you personally wrote a post about it! https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2016/10/why-are-apple-and-microsoft-using-such-old-processors-in-their-new-computers/ - so if this had really mattered to you, you should have waited. Which raises the question, what would you prefer Apple had done? Ignore the increasing clamour that "they don't care about pro users anymore" and make those users, who had already waited 527 days for an updated MacBook Pro, wait another 8 months, just so the CPU inside it was absolutely brand-spanking new? Or should they have delayed the Kaby Lake refresh, just to make people who bought their 2016 MacBook Pros feel a little better about their purchases? Reply 3 fenix @fenix Jun 6, 2017, 2:26pm Sherlock laying the smackdown Reply 2 troels @troels Jun 6, 2017, 3:27pm Not sure why they couldn't have made the 2016 MBP include Kay-Lake. Dell et al were able to... Reply 0 loquaciousdandy @loquaciousdandy Jun 6, 2017, 6:36pm Although some of the Kaby Lake chips were released in 2016, most weren't released until later. Looking at the 15" MBP, it looks like it's using the i7-7820HQ, the i7-7920HQ, and the i7-7700HQ. The 13" Non-Touchbar MBP looks like it's using the i5-7360U, and the i7-7660U, and the 13" Touchbar MBP looks like it's using the i5-7267U, the i5-7287U, and the i7-7567U. All of those chips weren't launched until the 3rd of January this year. Presumably it took a while for production to ramp up, and there was no doubt a bunch of testing required as well before Apple could release new products based on them. Reply 0 nafoon @nafoon Jun 6, 2017, 1:35pm How dare apple update their line only 6 years after I purchased my 2011 macbook Reply 3 loquaciousdandy @loquaciousdandy Jun 6, 2017, 6:37pm As the owner of a 2012 MacBook Air, I feel your pain. Reply 0 novasensei @novasensei Jun 6, 2017, 1:36pm How is your device any more or less obsolete today than it was yesterday? In what way has its functionality changed? How can someone who writes for a tech blog not understand that product lines get updated and improved and that Apple has absolutely nothing to gain from giving you a six month advance warning of it? Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 Jun 6, 2017, 1:52pm I have some inside info - this new model will also be replaced within the next year. Shocking news!! Reply 0 bondles @bondles Jun 6, 2017, 3:15pm So the Kaby Lake processors aren't that much faster than Skylake, but what they do have is that hardware DRM handling for video playback. I wonder if there are any talks happening with Netflix to get their 4K video on Safari as well as Edge? It would be a good use for those nice new displays. Reply 0 ghostcorps Guest Jun 6, 2017, 4:05pm Suck it up buttercup. You bought a Mac, did you really expect your sub-par hardware would ever be competitive with the rest of the market on price/performance? Even if you did update to the new refresh like all the mac sheeple you will still be behind. If you don't know this then you should not be writing for a tech site. Reply 0 beatsbynelly @beatsbynelly Jun 6, 2017, 4:18pm I'm a little miffed that work placed an order on a Macbook Pro for me last week, and I doubt I'm getting one of these new ones.. but beyond that meh. I hope at least they get a discount if they're locked into the 'old' one. Reply 0 pformagg @pformagg Jun 6, 2017, 5:09pm iMac Pro ships with Bluetooth 4.2 and not 5.0. Why would they do that? Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 Jun 6, 2017, 6:35pm I'm curious what killer feature 5 brings you. I ask because most (all?) devices are currently BT 4. Reply 0 derpfactory @derpfactory Jun 6, 2017, 7:34pm BT 5 = quadruple the range I think it's more about being future proof. If you're paying these absurd amounts for a turd, then you'd at least expect current technology and support for common tech for at least 2 years. Reply 1 rubik @rubik Jun 7, 2017, 11:29am "Future proof" I either cringe or laugh at that phrase every time. Anything more complex than a wheelbarrow is not future proof. Reply 0 Zeugma Guest Jun 6, 2017, 8:11pm Seriously... Did you not stop and think that this would happen, bearing in mind that they were using a year out of date processor... They have a history of doing This. Not withstanding that, the first rule of buying apple products is...don't buy the 1st generation of a new hardware design. Ever! Reply 0 amfomy @amfomy Jun 6, 2017, 8:46pm "Notoriously when Apple refreshed its laptop line last year, for the first time in two years, it skipped out on Kaby Lake." Assuming you're talking about the quad core chips, didn't they skip out on Skylake? How could they skip on something they're using how? Reply 0 ducksonetime Guest Jun 6, 2017, 9:36pm How is you old macbook now obsolete? Did it stop working during the announcement? Does it somehow have reduced functionality now? I'm pretty sure you still have the exact same thing you paid for and have been using for the past year... Reply 0 elijaxon @elijaxon Jun 7, 2017, 12:43am I've had great experiences with my 2016 15". It's the nicest piece of hardware I've ever owned. It replaced my skylake XPS 13 and I haven't noticed any significant reduction in battery life. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: How does Microsoft’s Surface Pro stack up against the new iPad Pros? 0 by Michael Allison  @al_ikw Jun 5, 2017 at 21:18 GMT3 days ago Following Microsoft, Apple has announced two new iPads at its WWDC event today. Much like Microsoft’s Surface Pro, the iPad Pro is Apple’s take on a tablet designed for PC computing – and Apple’s iOS 11 software update makes that very clear. Much like the Surface Pro, Apple has doubled down on its strengths, improving the iPad’s performance with the powerful A10x processor which has been estimated to deliver desktop-class performance, rivalling Intel processors like the M-series and decimating Qualcomm’s efforts in the process. Of course, Microsoft’s Surface features an actual desktop processor, so the advantage of the iPad there is that it can somewhat match the base of the Surface, but gets left behind at the top end. The software is the important part of any modern PC, and both Apple and Microsoft offer ridiculous amounts of software for their respective devices. While some may be quick to disparage the iPads app ecosystem as being toys, or the Windows app ecosystem as being outdated and clunky, the truth is that both software experiences offer enough for the average user that it doesn’t really matter how many apps one has over the other at this stage. Microsoft and Apple likewise take different approaches to computing,with Microsoft taking an old wine into new skin approach and Apple extending its iOS to account for larger screens. Neither have been entirely successful, Microsoft’s Surface is still a better laptop than it is a tablet, and the iPad will remain a better tablet than laptop till iOS 11 ships and can be fully evaluated. With all that being said, both devices ship next week, in the meantime, here’s how they stack up on a pure hardware level.

Apple also rolled out an upgraded lineup of Mac computers and a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and made a host of software announcements on the first day of its Worldwide Developers Conference. The HomePod will be available in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia and cost $349. The Wi-Fi speaker will come in two colors: white and space gray. It had been rumored last week as a possible announcement for the opening keynote at the conference, which runs through Friday in San Jose, Calif. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the speaker has "amazing sound and incredible intelligence that will reinvent home music." Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said customers will want to buy two HomePod speakers per room because they automatically work together for great music playback. The HomePod comes with a built-in musicologist, or expert on music, Schiller said. With Siri voice controls, users can ask spoken questions about the songs and artists that are playing and suggest other music to enjoy. Apple's HomePod will compete with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo speakers and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home device. As with competing products, users can ask HomePod questions about news, weather, traffic and sports, and perform tasks such as setting a reminder or texting a contact. Amazon Deal, New Macs Also Monday, Apple announced that Amazon's Prime Video service will be coming to Apple TV devices later this year. Amazon had been a major holdout from the Apple TV platform. Apple didn't offer additional service launch details. Apple refreshed its Mac computers with the latest Kaby Lake processors from Intel (INTC), as well as faster graphics processors, and speedier and higher-capacity solid-state drives. It updated four MacBook Pro notebooks and three iMac desktop computers. It also previewed the iMac Pro, which boasts "workstation-class performance." It will ship in models with 8-core, 10-core or 18-core Intel Xeon processors. It will hit the market later this year. Apple also introduced a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro tablet. The previous iPad Pros had 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch displays. The new 10.5-inch model will replace the 9.7-inch version. The company is touting the 10.5-inch tablet as the perfect size for a full-size, on-screen keyboard and full-size attachable physical keyboard. Apple improved the display refresh rates for its iPads for more realistic and smooth video. And the tablets are getting faster processors, improved cameras and higher memory configurations.  New Software, Augmented Reality At the opening keynote of the conference, Apple detailed the latest developments with its four software operating systems: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. It touted its latest smartphone operating system, iOS 11; new smartwatch operating system, watchOS 4; and new Mac computer operating system, macOS High Sierra. With iOS 11, Apple made improvements to its Siri voice assistant, photo apps and notifications. It also redesigned the Control Center panel. Apple's updated Maps app will add navigation inside shopping malls and airports. And the company's revamped Apple Music app will feature a music-sharing function and playlists linked to other apps. Apple announced new augmented-reality technology for the iPhone. It introduced a kit for developers that takes advantage of the device's cameras, processors and motion sensors. Once rolled out, Apple claims it will have "the largest AR platform in the world." Apple also announced that it is redesigning its App Store. It will have a start page called Today for users to discover hot new apps. Games will have its own tab in the app store. Apps besides games will get a dedicated tab as well. The week of WWDC is usually a bad one for Apple stock. Over the last 16 years, during the week of WWDC, Apple stock has only risen once and that was likely because of a 7-for-1 stock split. On average, Apple shares have fallen 3.5% during WWDC week. Apple stock fell 1% to 153.93 on the stock market today.

Forums Join   Review of ASUS Chromebook Flip C213SA-YS02 by digitaldoc77 Monday Jun 05 2017 16:00 EDT While Chromebooks debuted as a curiosity half a decade ago, last year when they were outselling Macbooks folks began paying attention. After all, the allure of a stable platform free of malware, with a simple interface centered around the Google Chrome browser and other Google services, all at an affordable price is an easy proposition. While Chromebooks were originally thought of as niche devices, with the rise of personal cloud computing, there has been a more general acceptance of a Chromebook as a simplified PC (as an aside a friend of mine as a full time professional writer uses his Chromebook as his platform of choice to do his writing on). A popular Chromebook market is in education, specifically K-12. Combining the portability and long battery life of a tablet, with the productivity of a smaller notebook, and this is why these have become so popular with schools. A popular Chromebook last year was the ASUS C202SA, which was notable for being ruggedized, and spill resistant- enough to stand up to the “rug rats” of the local school. While the C202SA was more of a traditional Chromebook, this year’s followup to that model is the ASUS Chromebook Flip C213SA, which features a convertible design and hardware upgrades, while continuing the standout features of a spill resistant keyboard, rubber grip design, and drop test certified. Design This ASUS Chromebook C213SA-YS02 is designed to be a versatile 2-in-1 for the educational market. It features a 360 degree hinge that allows this device to perform duties as a laptop, a tablet, in tent mode for a self standing display, and to lay fully flat. It has ruggedness built into the design, with a reinforced rubber wrapped guard to mitigate damage from drops, and reportedly it meets the US Military Standard for drop testing. The whole design is textured, and hides fingerprints well. In addition, it has rubber grips on the bottom that make it comfortable and easy to hold. The overall size is 12.1” x 7.8” x 0.8,” and it weighs 2.6 lbs. This is 0.09” thinner than the C202SA, which did not have tablet functionality, making it even more portable. While this is a 2-in-1 convertible, this is first a Chromebook, and second a tablet. While the tablet mode takes a backseat, it is a nice feature for time when you want to flip through a PDF or use it as an ereader for a book. Display The display is an 11.6” HD screen. The resolution is 1366 x 768 (720P), which is fairly standard for this size of device. It is a TN panel, and also touch screen enabled. The screen has a matte coating, that functions well to repel fingerprints that smudge up these displays. Compared to an IPS display, I found the display of the C213SA to be a little dim, but this improved by pushing the backlight up to the max level. Colors and contrast were solid for this type of device, but nothing exceptional. There is a large bezel around the screen, that no doubt helps to make it more rugged, but goes against the current trend bezeless trend in smartphones and laptops. Our contact at Asus has indicated that a variant of the C213SA will debut later this summer with a glossy display. Audio The C213SA has two speakers, which is better than the mono audio solutions that some lower end devices go with in the compact category. The speakers fire out the bottom, and the audio sounds crisper when the device is on a solid surface such as a table, as opposed to being on carpeting or your lap. It also has a standard headphone jack, and a physical rocker switch to control the volume. No one really expects a compact chromebook to be an audio powerhouse. The volume maxes out at an acceptable level, but don’t expect this to provide the audio for your next rave without an additional amplifier and speakers. The audio was solid through the headphone jack. The midrange was decent, but the highs were weaker, and there was little bass. Performance The performance of the C213SA is driven by the Intel Celeron 3350 processor. This is an Apollo Lake dual core 14 nm part, with a clock speed of 1.1 to 2.4 GHz; it sips power at a mere 6W that allows for a fanless design. In use, the Chromebook got a little warm in one corner, but it was nothing too hot. The graphics are the Intel graphics that come with such a budget CPU, the HD500 solution. It is an integrated design that comes with 12 cores, and runs at 200 MHz. RAM is 4 GB of DDR4, which is fairly standard for a midrange Chromebook these days. Overall, this produces an Octane 2.0 score of 9027, which puts this solution ahead of the previous dual core Celeron parts used commonly in Chromebooks. With the Chrome OS, which runs comparatively light, this type of processor provides more than ample power, and at no point in testing did the device feel underpowered. Keyboard & Touchpad With many Chromebooks all having similar specs, the keyboard and touchpad is a significant point of differentiation. The C213SA makes a good showing in this area. Not only is the keyboard able to withstand liquid spills, but it also has 2 mm of key travel. Unlike some cheap notebooks, the keyboard feels solid, and not mushy. It also is close to full size, with excellent key spacing, comfortable 2mm key travel, and a large enough space bar. The C213SA keyboard is just large enough to avoid being cramped, and comfortable to type on all day. The touchpad was usable as well. It could be differentiated by touch, as well as visually, and was more than large enough, especially considering the overall size of the machine. As is the trend, there are no physical left and right click buttons, but they are integrated in, and did provide the physical feedback of the click, including the audio. Storage Chromebooks are made to be machines for cloud computing, and as such, have minimal storage requirements. While they are designed to interface with the web, there is still a need for local storage. This includes the Chrome OS that is installed locally. They also can cache and sync the documents from Google Drive locally so they work can be done when there is no internet connection available, such as on an airplane. A Chromebook is most at home when it is using its Chrome browser to access data on a user’s Google Drive account. With that in mind, realize that no Chromebook has much storage built into the device. The C213SA has a 32 GB eMMC for local storage duties. This is better than the 16 GB eMMC that budget devices ship with. Additional removable storage can be added via a microSD card slot. It supports the newer SDHC and SDXC formats for larger sized cards. Software The C213SA runs on the Chrome OS. It painlessly updates to the latest version with a short reboot. Software is added via the Android app store. Chrome runs quite light, with less system resources required than a traditional Windows notebook. As such, with a Celeron chip, and 4 GB of RAM, it runs quite smoothly. The downside of a Chromebook is that it can only run software that was designed for it. Historically, this has been a significant limiting factor for a Chromebook, but this is poised to change, as Chromebooks are going to be able to access to the Google Play Store, and run Android apps. A few Chromebooks currently support this, and as new ones roll out, including the C213SA, support is being added. While this is a transition time as these apps were really developed for smartphones with inherent screen resolution differences, and on the C213SA, the Google Play Store comes up as a beta, although we were able to use the store to install apps without any issues. With such a light OS, and it stored on flash memory, the boot times are super quick, and only a few seconds for startups and shutdowns. This is a standout feature that is firmly an advantage for the Chromebook camp. Battery The C213SA includes a non removable battery integrated into the device. The stated battery life is 12 hours, which is more than long enough to get through a school day for its intended educational audience. While of course when discussing battery life, YMMV depending on display brightness, workload and age of the battery. In our testing and use of the C213SA, we can confirm that the battery life exceeds 10 hours. Ports The C213SA has a decent assortment of ports for a machine of this size. These include two USB 3.1 ports, and two USB 3.0 ports.The 3.0 ports are the standard ones that you can plug a flash drive or mouse into. The newer 3.1 standard is used to charge the device, and through adapters can be connected to an HDMI display. The device is also well laid out with one port of each type on either side. This allows the device to be charged from either side, and the mouse can be plugged into either side, minimizing cable clutter from having to route cables to get to the port on the other side of the device. There is also a Kensington lock attachment. There is no optical drive, but these are not found in any recent Chromebook, although one can be added externally, realizing that it is limited to reading files, and cannot play music or DVD’s. There is also no Ethernet port, although there are reports of success using a USB to Ethernet adapter. Also understand that few, if any modern Chromebooks feature optical drives or Ethernet ports. Webcam The C213SA actually has two webcams. The first one is at the top of the display in the spot that many laptops have it. It is a 1 MP/720P camera, and is intended for video conferencing. The second webcam is at the top of the keyboard, and it is a 5 MP camera. It is designed to function as a camera when the C213SA is in tablet mode. Wireless With no Ethernet port, the wireless needs to be solid for a Chromebook. Thankfully it is as rather than using some “no name” wireless solution, the C213SA incorporates the Intel 7265 wireless solution. It features SU-MIMO, and works on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies, with the 5 GHz speed of up to 867 Mbps. It also has Bluetooth 4.0 support integrated in. In our use, the wireless of the C213SA functioned rock stable, and did not drop the connection to the router at any time. Ot is also an advantage that the wireless card can be accessed via removal of a single screw so it can be swapped in case it has an issue and needs replacement. Conclusion With the increase in popularity of Chromebooks, they are evolving into more capable, and powerful devices. The retail price of $349 puts the C213SA into midrange territory. The exterior is solid, and quite resilient, with an excellent keyboard, and a good assortment of external ports. With its combination of smooth performance, and stellar battery life, it should not only be ideal for the intended educational market, but users in other areas would do well to choose the C213SA to toss into their laptop bag. Feel free to discuss the Asus C213SA below, as well as Chromebooks and the paradigm of browser based cloud computing.This article was contributed by the DSLReports.com community.

He just does basic email and web browsing. He is the adamant type that insists things break on their own, he never goes to any bad websites or click next a bunch of times just to get installers to finish. One thing Chromebooks are subject to is browser hijacks, and obviously chrome specific ones through extensions. One nice thing is as long as you can get to chrome://settings, you can do a lesser system settings reset that keeps all your user info and passwords saved, but disables third party extensions and resets the homepage. Makes fixing it pretty easy, but it sadly is still subject to clueless users. · actions · 2017-Jun-5 4:54 pm · Sputnik1 join:2015-04-19 AL Sputnik1 Member 2017-Jun-5 11:22 pm It's ok but I'd take linux on an older laptop over this.

It is a wide cross-section of the US, all coming together to say Mr Trump’s decision is “out of step” with what is happening outside of Washington.  “The signers all understand that the Paris Agreement is a blueprint for job creation, stability and global prosperity...to create jobs, spur innovation, promote trade and ensure American competitiveness,” they said in a statement.  Mr Leonard said that though these cities would be able to combat climate change “faster and more fully” with the help of state and federal governments, the wide variety of partners in the initiative is important to note.  These new partners can “do something creative” to green their local economies, said Mr Leonard.  He explained that the reason the initiative is crucial is that decisions about transportation, ports - some large, international shipping hubs, urban planning, and land use are all made at the local government level.  These are the areas where changes need to be made to push the US to a “zero carbon future,” Mr Leonard said.  Some mayors and companies that signed on are in states that have not committed to fighting climate change. Only 13 Republican and Democratic governors have done so thus far.   Mr Leonard said though that may be an issue, policies about “sustainable agriculture, for instance, become less and less political at the local level.”  10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn't believe in climate change 10 show all 10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn't believe in climate change 1/10 A group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, Antarctica Kira Morris 2/10 Amid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

In many parts of the world, glaciers have been in retreat, creating dangerously large lakes that can cause devastating flooding when the banks break. Climate change can also increase rainfall in some areas, while bringing drought to others.

Crops are very difficult to grow.” Rizwan Dharejo 8/10 A shepherd moves his herd as he looks for green pasture near the village of Sirohi in Rajasthan, northern India.

The World Health Organisation has warned such pollution, much of which is from the fossil fuels that cause climate change, is a “public health emergency”. Leung Ka Wa 10/10 Water levels in reservoirs, like this one in Gers, France, have been getting perilously low in areas across the world affected by drought, forcing authorities to introduce water restrictions. Mahtuf Ikhsan For instance, he pointed to the number of mayors and actors representing the Mississippi River Valley, “the breadbasket” of America that runs through several Republican states, as evidence that local leaders understand climate change’s economic impact better than most.  In addition to this initiative, 211 mayors from around the country have signed a similar pledge to “create a clean energy economy,” according to a statement from Mayors National Climate Agenda.  Cities represented include San Diego, California and Miami Beach, Florida, both contending with rising sea levels and coastal erosion.  Mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan also signed despite his city’s reliance on the auto manufacturing industry. Detroit has been in an economic downturn for several years and Mr Duggan and others feel job re-training and clean energy programmes will play a role in an economic renaissance for the city.  During his address announcing the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, Mr Trump cited the decline in the coal industry - which has actually been in decline since before the 1970s.  The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Scott Pruitt said during a news conference that the goal of withdrawal was to export American “clean coal” and the “innovation and technology” used in the US natural gas energy to “teach” the world how the US does it better.  Mr Trump also said he was elected to represent the citizens of “Pittsburgh not Paris”.  Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto responded via Twitter that his city “will follow the guidelines of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy & future.”  While data on national carbon emissions and some large companies has been identified, local data is more scant. It is unclear at this point whether partners in these initiatives alone will be enough to meet the US targets of reducing carbon emissions 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by the year 2025.

By Rob Thubron on Jun 5, 2017, 11:45 AM TechSpot With so many firms pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into R&D, it’s hard to deny that self-driving vehicles are the future. The biggest question now, it seems, is at what point will they make up the majority of cars on the road? Intel, which is working with BMW and Mobileye (a company it recently acquired) on autonomous vehicle tech, believes the revolution won’t take as long to arrive as some people think. On Friday, the chip maker said self-driving cars would create a new economic sector, called “the Passenger Economy,” which will be worth $800 billion by 2035, rising to $7 trillion by 2050. Should predictions of the technology turning mainstream prove accurate, could it result in driving becoming a redundant skill? That’s the view of top UK insurance firm AXA’s boss, Amanda Blanc, who says that driving a vehicle is something today's babies may never have to do. "Babies born today may never have to take a driving test," she told The Telegraph. Not only does Blanc believe that self-driving cars will become the norm sooner than expected, but she also warns that insurance companies must prepare a framework for the time when accidents are the result of computer error, rather than a human’s fault. "Driverless cars will not be able to take to the roads [without that],” she added. The technology is expected to be "much safer and increase mobility for vulnerable members of society," though there’s still plenty of work to be done when it comes to the former, as Uber and Google will attest. Many people still view self-driving cars with a raised eyebrow, and there are those that do actually enjoy driving, but with so many governments, companies, and other entities seemingly certain of a future filled with autonomous vehicles, maybe driving really will become a dying art.

Both the 21.5‑inch iMac and the 27‑inch 5K model are getting Intel Kaby Lake 7th-gen CPUs that bring support for HEVC video encoding, one of the highlight features of the upcoming High Sierra macOS update. The all-in-ones can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM, Fusion drives are now standard (hybrid HDD/SSD solution) and faster SSDs are offered with up to 2TB capacity. Two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports have been added to the back of the machines. The 21.5‑inch iMac is getting faster Iris Plus 640 integrated graphics via the Kaby Lake upgrade, with a new option for discrete Radeon Pro 500 series graphics. Meanwhile, the 27-inch iMac gets upgraded to Radeon Pro 570/575/580 graphics, which are being touted as ideal for VR content creation. macOS Sierra is getting support for Valve VR and Unreal Engine's VR Editor. A neat Star Wars VR demo was shown running on the iMac at 60+ fps. Availability on the new iMacs is immediate, at $1,099, $1,299 and $1,799 for the 21.5-inch model, 4K 21.5-inch, and 27‑inch 5K base models, respectively. During the WWDC announcement it was briefly mentioned that MacBooks were also getting updated to Kaby Lake processors. This includes the 12" MacBook, and 13" and 15" MacBook Pros. The upgrade should come with a marginal increase in performance and battery life, however Apple didn't care to elaborate acknowledging the change is a small one, not to mention they didn't address other complaints about the latest MacBook Pros not getting enough RAM expansion or their lack of ports. The only other change mentioned is a reduction in price for the base 13" MacBook Pro with no Touch Bar which is down to $1,299. Apple also unveiled a new iMac Pro model coming this December, which undoubtedly was the most exciting hardware announcement made today. Using the same all-in-one design, Apple called it the "most powerful Mac" they've ever built. Set to take over the void left by the Mac Pro (trash can workstation), the iMac Pro will come in Apple's space gray, run a 5K display, and thanks to a reworked cooling solution, it will be able to house 8-core, 10-core and up to 18-core Xeon processors on the most expensive configurations. Discrete graphics are powered by AMD's upcoming Radeon Vega with up to 16GB of VRAM, offering 11 and 22 TeraFLOPS of single and half precision performance, the later which is often used for machine learning. Other top-end configuration specs include up to 128GB of ECC memory, up to 4TB SSD, four Thunderbolt ports, 10GbE networking. The base configuration is set for release this December starting at $5,000 (for specs that Apple claims would cost around $7,000 if you were to buy a similar workstation PC at present time).

Macs—like every other computer—get more powerful every year, but at its developers conference on Monday, Apple unveiled a new iMac Pro that it says is the fastest Mac ever built. The $4,999 iMac Pro will go on sale in December, and it's aimed at video editors combing through 4K footage and game developers working on their latest virtual reality title, among other creative professionals. While it's got the same form factor and 27-inch display as the current high-end iMac, the similarities pretty much end there. It's in slate gray, a color that hasn't been used before in the iMac lineup. Under the hood is an all-new centrifugal cooling system with two fans to draw heat away from the system's Xeon processor, which you can configure with eight, 10, or 18 cores. The dedicated graphics card is from AMD's new workstation-class Vega series, which will allow up to 22 teraflops of half-precision floating point performance. The iMac Pro also comes with up to 128GB of memory and 4GB of flash storage. I/O options include four Thunderbolt ports, which means you could power two external 5K displays and two RAID storage arrays at the same time, assuming you need that much storage and screen real estate. If you don't, Apple also refreshed the prices and specs of the regular 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMac models. They include new seventh-generation Intel "Kaby Lake" processors, and the 27-inch version also gets a raised memory ceiling of 64GB. Every new iMac will also have refreshed graphics, from a new version of the integrated Intel Iris graphics in the base model that is 80 percent faster than the previous version, to the Radeon Pro 500-series with up to 8GB of eDRAM for the high-end 27-inch iMac. Related Apple Touts Speed, Privacy Upgrades in macOS High Sierra Apple Touts Speed, Privacy Upgrades in macOS High Sierra The iMac Retina 4K 21.5-inch model also has a new lower price of $1,299, while the non-4K 21.5-inch starts at $1,099 and the 27-inch begins at $1,799. All of the new models are available now. Finally, Apple is offering a similar spec upgrade for its MacBook and MacBook Air notebooks. They get Kaby Lake processors, as well as a curious new pricing scheme that lowers the non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro 13-inch version to $1,299, the same price as the 12-inch MacBook. Touch Bar-equipped 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro models start at $1,799 and $2,399, respectively. All of the new notebooks can be ordered today. Also today, Apple unveiled iOS 11 and a new version of macOS known as High Sierra. It also showed off a new iPad Pro, and finally embraced augmented and virtual reality.

Share Comments Search CloseSearch What's Happening at the Han Solo Set in Fuerteventura? Kevin Burwick 06.05.2017 220shares Facebook Twitter Google+ Email Comment Security was light, so Star Wars fan Lawrence Thespian was able to snap some great pictures on the set of Han Solo: A Star Wars Story located in Fuerteventura. Shooting for the spin-off started February 20th, 2017 at Pinewood Studios in London, and is now currently shooting in the Canary Islands. Apparently cameras were banned in the natural park, which is a popular tourist destination, while filming was going on. Many fans speculated that Han Solo could be taking place in a tropical location like Rogue One when it was first revealed that filming would take place on Fuerteventura. But those theories have been debunked by a flurry of set leaks. These images are by far the most detailed and clear look at the goings-on to date. The Intel comes from StarWarsNewsNet via Mr. Thespian, and he reports that the set is less than 5 miles from the popular holiday resort in Costa Calma. Armed security and checkpoints have been utilized to keep people away from the private set. It is not clear how Thespian (can't be his real name, can it?) was able to get so close to the set or what he was even doing there in the first place, but his pictures are good and a great addition to photos of the Trooper Speeder that leaked over the weekend. According to StarWarsNewsNet Mr. Thespian "stumbled" upon the set... According to Thespian, the set contains "two large round pavilion" complexes that could be palaces that have recently come under attack. Moisture vaporaotrs can clearly be seen, much like Tatooine in A New Hope. Could this be Tatooine? It is still unclear, but it does seem to be highly probable. Elsewhere, there are shots of igloo-like structures that were previously rumored to have been constructed of leather, but are definitely constructed of metal in these photos. There even appears to be a shipwreck that looks an awful lot like a Sail Barge. Over the weekend more shots from the Han Solo set on Fuerteventura leaked. The one picture and video show a pod car and a stormtrooper on some kind of speeder. Speeder may not be the best term since it's moving very slowly... again, it's pretty amazing that these leaks keep happening since Thespian outlined the security information in such a detailed manner. Thespian reminds me of Frankie Sharp's security guard in Wayne's World portrayed by the late great Chris Farley. Disney and Lucasfilm keep the lid tight on their projects and Han Solo: A Star Wars Story is no exception. We may know what the set looks like and who stars in the movie, but that's about it. Thanks to Thespian we know a lot about the set and that there is a no fly zone while filming takes place and that he may even know the hotel in which the cast is residing, which is kind of too much information. But whatever, cheers to Mr. Thespian and his accidental "stumble" of a find in a heavily guarded fortress of mystery.

The new pilot program supplies three repair shops authorized by the company to completely handle repairs at their stores. This includes calibration of the smartphones, which was previously something only AAPL could do. This is possible because the shops now each have one of the tech company’s machines for calibration. The calibration process only takes about 15 minutes.

The announcement itself was a departure from the norm as well. Traditionally, Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), where the HomePod was unveiled, is where the iPhone maker gives updates on its software. As expected, there were updates on Monday at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center for Apple’s iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS for its mobile, computer, smartwatch and Apple TV devices respectively. But this year’s WWDC also had many hardware launches – refreshed versions of the iMac all-in-one desktops and MacBook Pros laptops, a new iMac Pro computer, a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and the show stealing HomePod smart speaker. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up HOMEPOD “(The) HomePod is going to re-invent music in our homes,” said Mr Phil Schiller, Apple’s marketing head, during the keynote address at WWDC. The new Apple HomePod is a Wi-Fi six-array speaker and has Siri, Apple’s virtual voice assistant, integrated, so users can ask for the weather or what songs to play from their Apple Music library of digital tunes. The HomePod can also link up with smart devices in the home, such as connected light bulbs, so that a user can control them with a voice command, like switching them on or off. Apple also highlighted the audio quality of the speaker and how the device can adjust its sound quality based on the room it is in. Apple's HomePod appears to rival Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home smart speakers, which also use voice assistants to act on spoken commands from users. Media surrounding the newly-announced Apple HomePod smart speakers at the hands-on area during WWDC 2017 in San Jose. ST PHOTO: TREVOR TAN Said Mr Frank Gillett, principal analyst at research firm Forrester Research: “Home speaker devices have become an important host for virtual assistants like Siri. If Apple had not done this, their customers would embrace Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.” Alexa and Assistant refer to the digital voice assistants for Amazon's and Google's smart speakers respectively. But Apple's speaker is a lot more expensive than either of these speakers. The Amazon Echo goes for US$179.99 (S$248.48) and the Google Home is even cheaper at US$109 (S$150.47) in the United States. But the HomePod’s American price of US$349 (S$481.79) is close to double that of the Echo and more than triple that of the Home speaker. WWDC 2017 While the HomePod’s price point, compared to the competition, is a “steep barrier”, Forrester’s Mr Gillett noted that Apple has put a much more robust processor in the HomePod. “They seem be using it to drive superior user experience, sound quality, and privacy,” he said. The HomePod will ship in the US, Britain and Australia in December, and the rest of the world next year.

Barton/Alabama athletics New Alabama coach Brad Bohannon talks to returning Crimson Tide baseball players. Tide introduces Bohannon as baseball coach: 'There’s some good pieces in place' By Chandler Rome, Star Sports Writer, crome@annistonstar.com Chandler Rome Jun 5, 2017 (…) Amelia B. Barton/Alabama athletics New Alabama coach Brad Bohannon talks to returning Crimson Tide baseball players. TUSCALOOSA — Twenty-four hours after he fired Greg Goff, Greg Byrne comprised an extensive list of candidates to replace him. Twenty-four hours later, it was narrowed to “five or six,” including Brad Bohannon. Insight from Dave Magadan, Jim Wells and Alan Dunn  — three men who’ve seen this once-proud program at its apex — was gleaned. “Brad checked all the boxes,” Byrne said. The first-year Crimson Tide athletics director invited the Auburn assistant coach to his Tuscaloosa home last Monday morning. Detailed on the day he fired Goff, Byrne employs a meticulous interviewing regimen. There is no interrupting when he speaks. Leaks to the press likely will disqualify a candidate. Byrne’s wife, Regina, is often an influential part of the discussions. The meeting was scheduled for one hour. Somewhat unexpectedly, Bohannon brought a PowerPoint presentation. Twelve or 14 pages of slides, as Byrne recalls, were “a grand slam.” There was an academic plan. One for compliance, alumni and community relations, too. And, obviously, a baseball strategy — all comprising Bohannon’s master plan to reconstruct the burning embers of a once-storied baseball program. “Three-and-a-half hours later, he walked out of my house,” Byrne said, “and I thought 'We can make this thing work if everything goes well.'" Bohannon was introduced as the Crimson Tide’s 32nd head coach Monday, capping a winding career journey that started as a finance analyst at Intel and reached its summit on this rainy morning in Tuscaloosa as he spoke in front of trustees, athletic administrators and at least 10 members of the team he now calls his. “When you get into college coaching, it's such a tough road,” Bohannon said. “It's so hard to get your first job. You move around like crazy, live week-to-week, you're working baseball camps for peanuts. When you're doing that, at times you question what you're doing and you also have these dreams to one day lead your own program and coach in this league. For that dream to come true for me today is just such a blessing.” A 14-year Southeastern Conference assistant who spent his last 20 months on Butch Thompson’s staff at Auburn, Bohannon was presented to the Alabama faithful merely 11 hours after the Tigers lost an extra-inning game in the Tallahassee Regional. It forced a winner-take-all regional title game at 6 p.m. today. Bohannon attended a reception following his introduction and was then scheduled to fly back to Tallahassee to coach Auburn, comprised mostly of players he lured to the Plains. A first-time head coach who’s worked under John Cohen and Gary Henderson, Bohannon stressed he and his staff — one he said will be assembled in the coming days — will coach to the returning personnel, many of whom he met with one hour before the news conference. Among the discussions: the Crimson Tide’s three-game sweep of Auburn in May that sent the then top-10 Tigers into a tailspin to end the regular season. “There’s some good pieces in place,” Bohannon said, “and I felt the kids competed pretty well. And I’m excited to build on that.” A gaggle of Crimson Tide returners — including All-Southeastern Conference power hitter Chandler Taylor and shortstop Chandler Avant — sat near the front of the Naylor Stone Media Room. They’re three weeks removed from the worst conference season in program history. Some endured Goff’s attempted revocation of their scholarships. Others will play for their third coach in three seasons, one that promised Monday to create a “players-first program” Byrne knows he can manifest. During the search, Byrne instructed associate athletics director for compliance Matt Self to call as many of Bohannon’s former players as feasible. Using a blocked phone number, Self dialed. “I wanted him to call players who played a lot. I wanted him to call players a little bit off and on, and I wanted him to call players who never got off the bench,” Byrne said. “The last question you ask is: ‘If you had to do it all over again, would you want to play for Coach Bohannon?’ And without a doubt, 100 percent of the young men that he talked to said, ‘I’d absolutely play for Coach Bohannon again.’” Now this Alabama group gets its opportunity. “There’s a lot of work to be done,” Bohannon said. “We know that, and there are no shortcuts. I don’t have any magic dust, but I can’t wait to roll the sleeves up and get to work.” There’s some good pieces in place Sports Writer Chandler Rome on Twitter: @chandler_rome.

The headline you see above is on its fourth iteration, because every time I go to write up what I’ve just heard, they go and announce something else. It’s very inconsiderate. See related  MacOS High Sierra: First look at Apple’s updated operating system Still, my discomfort is also good news for Apple fans, because there’s an awful lot to go through. Let’s go through this point by point. New iMacs for 2017 The iMacs get their first updates in nearly two years, and it's worth the wait. Not only do all the iMacs get 7th generation Kaby Lake Intel processors, but the big screen they’re known for is described as “the best Mac display ever” with a whopping 500 nits of brightness. Starting from £1,049 for the 21.5in iMac or £1,749 for the 27in 5K model, they’re now pretty damned powerful. The (comparatively) dinky Mac can have up to 32GB RAM, backed by the Radeon Pro 560 graphics card. The top of the range 27in version, on the other hand, can go all the way up to 64GB RAM paired with the Radeon Pro 580 - meaning Mac will support VR for the first time, with a little help from the latest version of macOS: High Sierra. Though it will set you back £2,249. But hey, if that leaves you feeling underwhelmed, and you have $4,999 burning a hole in your pocket then Apple would like that please. What will you get in return? The space grey iMac Pro, “the most powerful Mac ever.” You’ll have to wait until December for it, but if you do, you’ll be rewarded with an 8-core Xeon processor and the AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Oh, you didn’t think five grand was the top-of-the-range, did you? Oh you poor naive fool: you can scale this up to include an 18-core Xeon processor, but that price is only going in one direction. Better start saving. MacBooks get a Kaby Lake boost All the MacBook Pros and the MacBook are getting new Kaby Lake processors. On top of that, as a pleasingly refreshing chaser to the wallet busting iMac Pro, the entry-level MacBook Pro without touchbar now starts at £1,249 - the same price as the MacBook. Even the much-neglected MacBook Air range gets a modest speed boost with a faster Intel processor - though the company barely gave it a mention. Still: looks like it’s hanging around a little longer as an entry level product, even if Apple has decided not to give it a screen upgrade or any extra ports. Everything bar the iMac Pro is shipping from today, so fill your boots.

Video Apple's HomePod: Everything we know so far about this new smart Siri speaker We might not have gotten a look at the all-new customizable Mac Pro that Apple is working on, but that doesn’t mean that Tim Cook and friends didn’t deliver some serious upgrades to our desks during Apple’s Worldwide Developer’s Conference kickoff on Monday. And with the latest updates just unveiled for the iMac, there just might be a model to satisfy everyone. Apple While the new iMacs might look the same on the outside, they’re quite a bit different inside. It starts, of course, with the screen. Apple says the new models have the “best Mac displays ever,” upping the brightness to 500 nits to make them 43 percent brighter while bringing support for a billion colors. You’ll also get faster Intel Kaby Lake processors up to 4.2 GHz, higher memory capacity, super-fast storage, and next-generation graphics, as well as a pair of Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports (which aren’t even available on the Mac Pro yet). The entry-level 21.5-inch model features an Intel Iris Plus 640 GPU while the 4K model now supports discrete AMD Radeon Pro 550 graphics with up to 4GB of VRAM. It also comes with 32GB of RAM and an SSD drive that is up to 50 percent faster. The step-up 21.5-inch model, meanwhile, will feature Radeon Pro 555 or 560 graphics and standard fusion drives. The 27-inch 5K model offers up to 64GB of RAM, standard fusion drives, and a choice between the Radeon Pro 570, 565, or 580 cards with up to 8GB of VRAM for 5.5 teraflops of graphics power. And coupled with the new improvements in macOS High Sierra, these new machines will be at the forefront of VR content creation. Apple Additionally, the new machines bring a host of minor improvements, including an improved 1080 FaceTime camera, UHS-II SDXC card slot, and Bluetooth 4.2. The 21.5-inch model starts at $1,099, while the 4K version starts at $1,299. Additionally, the 27-inch model will cost you $1,799 for the base model and goes up from there. The new iMacs are available to order today on Apple’s website, and you can pick one up in stores this Wednesday, June 7.  To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The new iMac Pro, announced at WWDC alongside macOS High Sierra, takes the form of a 27-inch, Space Grey (that's a new colour!) iMac. And it's the computing version of the kitchen sink in terms of processing and graphics hardware. So what’s it packing? iMac Pro specs At its most basic, the iMac Pro is a high-end workstation. This means the lowest-cost model – a mere $4999 – gets one of Intel’s top-end Xeon CPUs with a minimum of eight CPU cores, all the way up to 18 cores. That’s a monstrous specification, but keep in mind that Xeon processors are more sedate than the rip-roaring 18-core Core i9 chips announced at Computex last week. Still, for multi-threaded tasks such as rendering and audio production, this thing is an absolute whizzkid. Related: Best desktop PC The graphics department is a real treat as well. In fact, the GPU tech is so cutting-edge that we don’t even know what the exact specification will be. That’s because it’s using AMD’s latest Vega graphics architecture, which isn’t even out yet. It’s toting 11 teraflops (trillion floating point operations per section) of GPU power, which is far and away the most powerful graphics chip ever seen in an all-in-one PC. You’ll get up to 16GB of high-bandwidth memory with your graphics chip, and up to 128GB of ultra-reliable error correcting code (ECC) memory. All this has been made possible by a new thermal design, which Apple says increases cooling capacity by 80% over the standard iMacs. SSDs are configurable up to 4TB, with a maximum read speed of 3GB/s. That’s even faster than the storage used on the latest MacBook Pros. On the back, Apple has added four ThunderBolt 3 connectors for ultra-high-end peripherals, and on the front is a 27-inch 5K display that ticks all the boxes when it comes to colour coverage, including the moviemaker-friendly DCI P3 colour gamut. There’s also 10Gbps Ethernet, a rare thing indeed on computers, and 10 times faster than your standard gigabit Ethernet found on most other PCs. In case you couldn’t keep track, Apple put together a handy graphic of all its favourite new features for this high-end device. It starts at $4999, like we said, but we can’t even fathom how much a top-end model will cost. The iMac Pro will launch in December. Keep checking back to this story for all the latest info.

The new iMacs have up to three times more powerful graphics abilities in comparison to previous generations, faster processors, Thunderbolt 3, and faster storage options. Apple said that the updates, along with refreshes of the MacBook, represent a lineup of Mac devices that are "stronger than ever." “With major updates to iMac, and a refresh of our MacBook and MacBook Pro lines, the Mac is stronger than ever,” said John Ternus, Apple’s vice president of Hardware Engineering. “Today iMac gets a huge graphics performance increase, faster CPU performance, Thunderbolt 3 and a brighter Retina display with support for 1 billion colors. We’re also increasing CPU and SSD speed on MacBook, adding faster processors and making faster graphics standard on our 15-inch MacBook Pro and introducing a new $1,299 (US) 13-inch MacBook Pro.” With the refresh, a Retina 4K display is also coming to the 21.5-inch iMac. Both the 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs feature faster Kaby Lake processors up to 4.2 GHz, with Turbo Boost speeds up to 4.5 GHz. The computers support twice the memory as the previous generation, and Fusion Drive will now be standard on all 27-inch iMac configurations, as well as on the top-end 21.5-inch iMac. SSD storage will become 50 percent faster on the refreshed iMacs, and graphics on the computers are more powerful thanks to new Radeon Pro 500-series cards with up to 8GB of vRAM. In terms of faster performance, the 21.5-inch model delivers up to three times faster speeds in comparison to the previous iMacs, while the 27-inch model is up to 50 percent faster. The models start at $1,099 for the 21.5-inch iMac, $1,299 for the 4K 21.5-inch iMac, and $1,799 for the 5K 27-inch iMac. Users can find more information on tech specs and pricing for each tier of the 21.5-inch model and 27-inch model on Apple's website, and both are available to purchase today.

Now people complain Apple updates Macs too often. :rolleyes: I guess I'm not furious, just disappointed. The timing between the 2016 release and this new update just feels too close, especially since I bought my MBP in January. Kaby Lake CPUs the MacBook Pro uses were not available until this year. I do think Apple wanted the tbMBP at last WDCC to allow Kaby Lake refresh at this WDCC, but couldn't get it ready in time so they had to push it to October.

I also have a late 2016 13" MBP and, while it would've been nice to have Kaby Lake when I bought it a few months ago, I'm glad I've been able to use it in the meantime rather than wait for this minor update. Rating: 11 Votes deadlystriker 3 days ago at 11:10 am Was hoping the MacBook get a thunderbolt 3 port Rating: 8 Votes gregnv 3 days ago at 03:14 pm Dear Apple, I am not sure you get the "Pro" thing. In general, consumer products are static in build at the time of purchase, while "pro" products allowed power users to adapt their hardware to changing needs and demands. By making the MBP a static product, you have made the MBP much less attractive to real pro users. In the past, an MBP would allow users to upgrade memory and storage to meet the demands of ever increasing file sizes and project sizes. This flexibility gave pro users confidence that the system they purchase today can, for a price, be adapted to the work that needs to be done next year of the year after. Today, because the MBP is a hardware static product upon purchase, there is no confidence that the machine you buy today will be able to keep up with your work demands even before AppleCare runs out. If you want to innovate, at least make the memory and SSD upgradable after purchase. If you want to lead, add in a way to upgrade the video card after purchase as well. You have sacrificed flexibility and power for being a bit lighter and thinner, which is fine for a consumer grade product, but it makes the purchase of a new MBP difficult to justify. - G Rating: 8 Votes [ Read All Comments ] Upcoming iPhone 8 Fall 2017 New design with full-front display and no Home button expected.

The event started with Apple CEO welcoming the audience at the 15th WWDC in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley where Apple is building its new campus. Before making the announcements, Cook said that this year "it is going to be the best and biggest WWDC ever." Cook also praised the Apple developer community which has 16 million registered developers and added three million last year. He announced that Amazon`s video app will come to Apple`s TV streaming box later this year. The app will let users stream all the Amazon original hits. Soon after the announcement Amazon tweeted, "You asked (a lot). We listened. Amazon Prime Video is coming to the TV App and all Apple TVs this year." Apple also announced that watchOS 4, the next version of its smartwatch platform, will be arriving in September. It includes new features for watchfaces, such as complications updating based on time of day or location and a new Siri-based watchface. The Siri watchface uses machine learning to determine what information is most useful to you at a given point in time. Other new watchfaces include a kaleidoscope and new characters such as Woody, Jesse, and Buzz from the Toy Story movie franchise. WatchOS 4 will also bring updates to the watch`s fitness tracking, including a new user interface for the workout app and new integrations with gym equipment manufacturers. Apple said that watch wearers will be able to link their devices with the gym equipment through NFC. Next up in tech is Apple`s new version of macOS is called High Sierra which is launched with new Safari browser. Apple said that it is the fastest browser ever with features like autoplay blocking, intelligent tracking prevention that uses machine learning to block irritating content. Apple also brought file system and virtual reality (VR) to High Sierra. The tech titan also announced updates to its entire MacBook line giving its laptops more powerful specifications in the form of the latest Intel chips. MacBook Pros will be shipped with Intel`s Kaby Lake processors and faster SSDs. The company also launched a new configuration of the 13-inch MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar that starts at a cheaper $1,299. The newly updated MacBook laptops are now available. Apple also showed a sneak peek into a new all-in-one desktop called the iMac Pro. Called as "the most powerful Mac ever, the new product will be available from December starting at $4,999. The new machine will come with an 8-core Xeon processor, with configurations that scale up to an 18-core Xeon processor and an all-new AMD Radeon Vega graphics GPU, up to 16GB of VRAM and up to 4TB for SSD storage. Cook also launched iOS 11 with over 10 new features. He said that iOS 10 had nearly 96 per cent satisfaction with 86 per cent iPhone users installing the update as compared to only seven per cent Android users who installed Android Nougat - the latest version of Google`s operating system. The new iOS will now synchronize messages across iOS and macOS automatically. If a user erases a message on your iPhone or iPad, that will be reflected on the Mac as well.

Siri will now be able to perform translations in various languages including English, Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Not only did Apple announce refreshes for its iMacs, but it also announced the iMac Pro for those who need a little more power. The company didn’t stop there, though, as it also revealed some updates to the MacBook and MacBook Pro. The biggest story of these updates is Kaby Lake. These new MacBooks will feature Intel’s latest Kaby Lake processors, much like the new line of iMacs that were announced today. These Kaby Lake processors should offer a fairly significant speed boost over the processors that came before them, so if you’ve been thinking about picking up a new MacBook, now might be the time to buy. We’ll also be able to look forward to faster SSDs in these new MacBooks, along with faster standard graphics in the 15-inch model. Even better is the fact that the base MacBook is getting something of a price cut, dropping to $1,299. Therefore, if you waited to pick up a MacBook until now, there might be some savings on the table. Apple didn’t just stop at MacBook Pros, also announcing that the MacBook Air is going to get a bit of a boost in clock speed. Strangely, Apple didn’t spend long on this topic, so we’re not quite sure if that means it’s going to have Kaby Lake processors or not, but at the very least, a faster MacBook Air will be great for people who love the platform (despite the fact that Apple maybe ignored it a little too much up until now). So, when do these bad boys launch? Today, alongside the new lineup of iMacs. Apple certainly is pulling out all the stops with launching these new Macs, holding only the new iMac Pro until later in the year. As you can see in the image above, prices for these new MacBooks range from $1,299 for the base MacBook all the way up to $2,399 for the 15-inch model with Touch Bar, so depending on which one you want, you could be plopping down a fair bit of cash. Be sure to have a look at all of our coverage from today’s WWDC 2017 keynote!

The new iMacs mostly just feature refreshed and improved hardware specs, bringing Intel's 7th generation 'Kaby Lake' processors and updated screen that offer 43% more brightness and up to one billion colours. The all-in-one devices will also feature up to 32GB and 64GB of RAM for the 21.5- and 27-inch devices, respectively, alongside up to 2TB of SSD storage that is 50% faster compared to the previous generation. On the I/O side, things mostly stay the same but Apple has increased the number of available Thunderbolt 3 ports to 2. Apple has also taken heed of users' repeated requests for increased graphical processing power with the inclusion of a range of options from Intel Iris Pro Graphics 640 with 64MB of eDRAM to a range of options from Radeon's dedicated GPUs between 555 to the 580 with 4-8GB of RAM depending on your chosen configuration. As a result of this increased graphical fidelity, the higher-end iMacs will also be able to support VR experiences. On the notebook side of things, things are a little less exciting as the Cupertino giant has simply refreshed its line of notebook to the current generation of Intel's Kaby Lake processors, while the MacBook Air gets a modest speed bump. The new iMacs will run you from anywhere between $1099 for the base configuration of the 21.5 inch model up to a starting price of $1799 for the 5K 27-inch iMac. The MacBooks retain their starting price compared to the last generation (starting at $1299), though the entry level Touch Mar MacBook get a slight price drop, starting at $1799.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Lifestyle / Mobile / Apple / Apple updates its iMac lineup at WWDC Apple updates its iMac lineup at WWDC Matthew Wilson 3 days ago Apple, Featured Tech News Apple’s annual Worldwide Developer Conference is officially under way and so far, there has been plenty of talk surrounding the Mac. We already knew that Apple was planning a Mac Pro redesign for 2018, which would be preceded by an iMac refresh this year. Now, the new series of iMacs is official, with improved displays, better CPUs and much better graphics performance. For starters, the new iMac displays are 500 nits brighter than the previous generation and can support up to 1 billion colours. Under the hood, Apple has made the jump to Intel’s 7th generation Kaby Lake processors and upped the memory capacity to 32GB of RAM for the 21.5-inch iMac and 64GB of RAM for the 27-inch version. The most important change to the iMac comes in the GPU department though. Going forward, all 4K 21.5-inch iMacs come with a discrete graphics chip, representing a huge 80 percent boost in graphics performance. The 27-inch 5K iMac will continue to come with discrete graphics, supplied by AMD. There are two Thunderbolt 3 ports included now to help users expand their system with different external devices. Interestingly enough, Apple also took the time to discuss virtual reality, pitching its new iMacs as great content creation tools for those looking to generate VR experiences and applications. The final thing worth noting is that macOS is also getting an update this year known as ‘High Sierra’, which will make various improvements to Safari and overall OS performance. KitGuru Says: There are still some more details to come but that is the general gist of Apple’s iMac presentation today. We will keep an eye on WWDC for any other major announcements. What do you guys think of the new iMacs? For me, it’s just nice to finally see Apple paying attention to the GPU. More often than not, graphics are overlooked in many of Apple’s machines.

These increasing sales figures were likely aided by the firm’s increasing presence in the media — especially announcements of big contracts with several major automakers, which are apparently eager to use its proprietary high-definition mapping tech for their own progress. Reuters provides more: “The Israeli-based company, which is in the process of being acquired by Intel Corp, said on Thursday it earned 25 cents per diluted share excluding one-time items in the first quarter, up from 15 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue rose 66% to $124.7 million. Mobileye was forecast to have earned 24 cents on revenue of $118.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “In March, Intel agreed to buy Mobileye, which develops camera-based systems to help drivers avoid collisions, for $15.3 billion in a deal that promises to escalate the arms race among the world’s carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. “In light of the pending transaction, Mobileye said it would not hold an earnings conference call and will not provide an outlook for its financial results for future period.” With regard to the comments earlier in the article about multiple major auto manufacturers signing up to share data obtained with Mobileye’s camera-equipped advanced driver assistance systems, in order to create unmatched HD maps for self-driving cars, it’s perhaps worth highlighting that these agreements cover the diverse giants Volkswagen Group, Nissan, and BMW.

Apple announces major MacOS Sierra update called...High Sierra Being a heavily display-focussed desktop computer, you want the display to be the best it can possibly be. Apple has now improved the brightness to 500 nits, making them 43 per cent brighter than previous generation. They also now use 10-bit dithering to deliver up to 1 billion colours, making them more accurate than ever before.  The processor have had a bit of a boost too. The iMacs will now be fitted with Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake processors and can be specced with more memory than ever before: up to 32GB on the 21.5-inch display models and up to 64GB of memory on the 27-inch models. Double the amount available on the previous generation. Apple's Fusion Drive storage system is now standard on all 27-inch iMacs and can be specced on the 21.5-inch models. The solid state storage drives (SSD) also now work up to 50% faster and can be specced up to 2TB. Graphics is an area that Apple has really stepped things up, though. The entry-level 21.5-inch iMac now has Intel Iris Plus graphics, which work 80 per cent faster than the previous generation. The 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display meanwhile will use discreet Radeon Pro 555 and 560 GPU processors, which are 3 times faster than the previous generation. The 27-inch iMac gets a serious boost indeed, and can now be specced with up to 8GB of VRAM, providing 5.5 teraflops of processing power, ideal for VR content creation. Connections-wise, the latest generation of iMacs will be gifted with two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3, ideal if you have any dongles and adapters from your new MacBook Pro.

Though many rumors ahead of this event told us to expect new iPads and MacBooks, the first refresh Apple announced today is coming to its 21.5-inch and 27-inch iMacs. That comes as something of a surprise, but we don’t think the iMac faithful will mind much. Kicking things off, Apple said that these new machines have the best Mac displays ever. Some features Apple touched on include support for 500 nits, making it them 43% brighter than previous displays, 10-bit dithering, and support for up to one billion colors. That’s pretty impressive all its own, but the displays aren’t the only aspect getting an update today. These new iMacs will feature seventh-gen Kaby Lake processors from Intel. On 21.5-inch models, those processors will be working in tandem with up to 32GB of RAM on 21.5-inch models and up to 64GB of RAM on 27-inch models. These new all-in-ones also offer up to 2TB of SSD storage, with Fusion Drives now standard on all 27-inch models. Finally, we can look forward to two new Thunderbolt 3 ports on the backside of the device. There are three new models of iMacs in all. The base 21.5-inch model will utilize Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, while the mid-range 21.5-inch model will feature a Retina 4K display and Radeon Pro 555 and 560 discrete graphics. Finally, we come to the top of the line iMac introduced today, the 27-inch model that comes with a Retina 5K display and your choice of a Radeon Pro 570, 575, or 580. Of course, these machines will support VR content and development, with Apple diving into a Star Wars-themed demo for us. It sounds like Apple has put together some fairly solid all-in-ones here, but the big question now is “how much will they cost?” The base 21.5-inch model will set you back $1,099, the 4K 21.5-inch model costs $1,499, and finally, the 5K 27-inch model will cost a hefty $1,799.

In addition to a bunch of refreshed software, powering the next generation of iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple Watches and Apple TV gear, today’s jam-packed keynote may introduce the world to some sizzling hot hardware. A “narrow-bezel” iPad, Siri smart speaker, perhaps even a top-end family of 2017 MacBook Pros with Intel Kaby Lake inside. If that sounds like something you want to witness in real time, you obviously can, from the comfort of your own home, without having to cough up $1,599. Just head over to this link on iPhones, iPads or the iPod touch with Safari on iOS 7.0 or later, Macs with an OS X version newer than 10.8.5 and Safari 6.0.5 or up, or even on your Windows 10 PC running the Microsoft Edge browser. Second, third and fourth-gen Apple TVs can access the live stream directly from the Apple Events channel, while everyone else needs to wait for VLC workaround instructions. The shindig kicks off at 10 am PDT, which is 1 pm EDT, 6 pm BST, 7 pm CEST, 10:30 pm IST, 1 am CST (June 6), and 3 am AEST (also June 6). Join us in a few hours for all the coverage that matters.

In a reply brief picked up by CNET, executive vice president and general counsel for Qualcomm Don Rosenberg went after the FTC’s motion and several amici briefs from conglomerates and individual players like Samsung and Intel: [The] FTC cannot and has not adequately defended its defective complaint. The complaint lacks necessary facts and fails to plead a coherent theory of competitive harm. Improperly adding alleged ‘facts’ supplied by competitors’ briefs cannot prop up a deficient complaint. The San Diego-based chipmaker is vigorously defending itself from allegations of anti-competitive behavior — racking complicated royalty contracts with device manufacturers and stacking terms to prevent them from using competing products.

IBM, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung said Monday that they have found a way to make thinner transistors, which should enable them to pack 30 billion switches onto a microprocessor chip the size of a fingernail. The tech industry has been fueled for decades by the ability of chipmakers to shoehorn ever smaller, faster transistors into the chips that power laptops, servers, and mobile devices. But industry watchers have worried lately that technology was pushing the limits of Moore's Law -- a prediction made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that computing power would double every two years as chips got more densely packed. From a report: Today's chips are built with transistors whose dimensions measure 10 nanometers, which means about 1,000 fit end-to-end across the diameter of a human hair. The next generation will shrink that dimension to 7nm, and the IBM-Samsung development goes one generation beyond that to 5nm. That means transistors can be packed four times as densely on a chip compared with today's technology. "A nanosheet-based 5nm chip will deliver performance and power, together with density," said Huiming Bu, IBM's director of silicon integration and device research. Take all those numbers with a nanograin of salt, though, because chipmakers no longer agree on what exactly they're measuring about transistors. And there's also a long road between this research announcement and actual commercial manufacturing. IBM believes this new process won't cost any more than chips with today's transistor designs, but its approach requires an expensive shift that chipmakers have put off for years: the use of extreme ultraviolet light to etch chip features onto silicon wafers. samsung technology ibm ← You may like to read: → Silicon Valley Is Too Focused On Taking the Easy Path in Health Care Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Twitter Suspends American Far-Right Activists' Accounts Former Engineer Says Uber Is a Nightmare of Sexism; CEO Orders Urgent Investigation When Their Shifts End, Uber Drivers Set Up Camp in Parking Lots Across the US Harvard Pulls Student Offers Over Online Comments IBM Research Alliance Has Figured Out How To Make 5nm Chips More | Reply Login IBM Research Alliance Has Figured Out How To Make 5nm Chips Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Considering Silicon can't scale past ~5 GHz, whereas GaAs can scale to 500+ GHz I see this as a stop-gap solution. Sure, 5 nm will allow for more cores on a die, but single-threaded performance is STILL a bottleneck.

Oliver pointed out that the major goal of the Paris Agreement is to keep CO2 below what is known as the world's "carbon budget" because if we fail to limit the temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius, studies show that things get potentially irreversible — leading to longer droughts and more intense heat waves that would affect the world food supply. And then there are the jobs that have been created due to the world's attention to the climate. Before Trump made the decision to leave the Paris accord last Thursday, 25 companies — including Microsoft and Intel — took out a full-page ad in The New York Times urging Trump to stay in the agreement because it "generates jobs and economic growth." "Well, c'mon, he was clearly never going to be convinced by an ad in The New York Times. How was he going to see it?" Oliver said. "If those companies really wanted to get his attention, they needed to talk KFC into giving out a full-bucket ad, which he would read on the toilet while eating chicken, because that — at its core — is who our president is." Oliver also touched on what the agreement required — in that there were no requirements. Though Trump stated last Thursday that the agreement would affect the country's coal business, the Paris accord had no restrictions on coal. "It doesn't even contain the word 'coal' in the agreement," Oliver said. And perhaps what's most misunderstood about the accord is that goals set by the countries are completely voluntary and there are no penalties if they aren't met. "The only penalty was shame, and unfortunately this president is completely immune to the very concept of that," Oliver said.

Best overall Dell XPS 13 See at Dell The XPS 13 is a premium laptop offered by Dell, and it is a superb match for students. Sporting the latest generation of Intel processors, even in the base model configuration, the slim and powerful notebook will be more than a match for both studies and downtime. Bottom line: Great overall product with enough punch for demanding tasks. One more thing: It has a backlit keyboard for those late-evening sessions. Why the XPS 13 is the best laptop for students The XPS 13 by Dell is the entry product in the XPS line of premium laptops, but it is an ideal match for students looking to take advantage of capable hardware to help with their studies. The beauty of the XPS 13 is you're able to configure it exactly how you wish. Need more than 128GB of SSD storage? Simply add a 256GB drive when ordering or install one after the laptop gets delivered, if you can save money through Amazon or another online retailer. Then you have a Full HD display with barely any bezel, which can be bumped to QHD with touch-screen support. Speaking of specifications, the XPS 13 was recently refreshed by Dell to include Intel's seventh-gen Kaby Lake processors. These components are matched with at least 4GB of RAM and Killer 1535 wireless connectivity. The latter improvement with the XPS 13 is a major benefit for students here, thanks to its excellent wireless range and reliability. The laptop can also be personalized with a choice of color: silver or rose gold. The keyboard is likely what will be used the most, and this is probably the laptop's weak spot. It's not the worst keyboard on a laptop by any means, but it's also not considered by many to be among the best. With only 1.3mm of key travel (how far the key can be pressed down), it can feel somewhat "mushy" to those who are used to desktop mechanical keyboards or other portable PCs with enhanced means of input. There's also an issue with oil stains after considerable amounts of use. Overlooking the keyboard, you have a super-portable laptop with a gorgeous display and excellent performance. Couple all that with improved battery life (thanks to expanded capacity and the newest processors) and you've got one fantastic device for any student to rely on. See our review of the XPS 13 Practical HP Notebook 15-ay011nr See at Amazon Powered by an Intel i5 processor alongside 8GB of RAM, this capable HP laptop is ready to go with up to seven hours of use. Take advantage of the 15-inch display for maximum productivity. Bottom line: It's a good, portable notebook that won't break the bank. One more thing: It comes with 1TB of internal storage. Premium ASUS ZenBook UX330UA-AH54 See at Amazon This laptop is made out of aluminum, sports an Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and has a great keyboard for those intense Word document sessions. Being rather thin and light also makes this ASUS notebook incredibly portable. Bottom line: This is the best looking laptop in our roundup. One more thing: There's a built-in fingerprint sensor. Affordable HP X360 See at Amazon This is by no means the most powerful PC on our list, only featuring a Celeron processor and not even 1080p display resolution, but this is an affordable laptop and one that's also a 2-in-1. Bottom line: It's an affordable package that doesn't feature top-end hardware but does have a few tricks up its sleeve. One more thing: The display can flip around and be used like a tablet. Professional Microsoft Surface Pro 4 See at Amazon The Surface Pro 4 is Microsoft's main tablet-come-laptop combo, and it starts at $799. Depending on your desired configuration, the Surface tablet can be as powerful as your needs require it to be, with the option of an Intel Core i7 processor. Bottom line: The Surface Pro brings a whole new level of productivity to the portable-PC table. One more thing: It's an excellent investment for any student who can take advantage of the pen functionality. Conclusion There are a great number of affordable, yet powerful laptops available for students. It's important to invest in a unit that offers sound battery life, ample amounts of power, as well as a striking design for anyone who is looking to dive deep into books. There are some excellent examples of this in our guide here, but overall we'd recommend the Dell XPS 13, if the price tag doesn't put you off. Best overall Dell XPS 13 See at Dell The XPS 13 is a premium laptop offered by Dell, and it is a superb match for students. Sporting the latest generation of Intel processors, even in the base model configuration, the slim and powerful notebook will be more than a match for both studies and downtime. Bottom line: Great overall product with enough punch for demanding tasks. One more thing: It has a backlit keyboard for those late-evening sessions. 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Computex 2017 also hosted a live PC case modding challenge so, as well as some truly innovative designs sponsored by the likes of InWin and displayed on their dedicated stands, there were plenty of additional wacky mods floating around. There were some rather unusual sleep aids on offer too, some bonkers smart, connected devices and we got a sneak peek at Intel’s as yet unreleased Skylake X. Best of Computex 2017: The top 5 tech products on show Computex 2017: All the announcements that matter Computex Modding Challenge PC case modders from around the world had just 24 hours to complete their builds. Here are some of the best we found: Mod Case Alien Pocket-lint Team China’s entry into the World Modding Comp was particularly impressive. It feature a moving, expanding chest and more neon piping than you can shake a stick at. Team Aus Pocket-lint We kind of liked the dystopian feel of Team Australia’s entry in the World Modding Comp. ASRock Pocket-lint We spotted this rather special boat-shaped case on the ASRock stand. Donkey Kong Cabinet Pocket-lint ThermalMike for Team USA made this retro gaming case, which was thoroughly admired by the crowds at the ThermalTake stand. Cooler Master Wheel Pocket-lint The Wheel of Star is a mod by Modder Crow from Thailand and was on the Cooler Master stand. AeroCool gaming beanbags Pocket-lint AeroCool reckons it has created the world’s first gaming beanbags. We tried them all out and we think the one on the left is the best. Sadly, they’re still just concept pieces but hopefully AeroCool will decide to bring them to market because they are pretty damn comfy. Livewire WBPA shaking bed Pocket-lint Ever wished you could burn calories while lounging in bed? The Liveware WBPA adjustable bed has you covered, from a gentle rocking motion right up to the tumultuous seventh speed which could help you slim while simply lying down. Bonkers. Smart Temphawk wine cooler Pocket-lint There’s nothing like using a super sophisticated temperature control system for a menial task. This smart, connected Temphawk device will keep your wine right at the correct temperature, but is generally used to monitor food temps during deliveries. The customer can check that, for example, their sashimi has been kept cool for the whole journey during delivery by simply checking on their phone for details. Phone-controlled automatic shoe laces Pocket-lint Because some days lacing up your shoes just seems like too much of a faff. By controlling them through your phone, it goes one step further even than Back to the Future II. Gigabyte PC case mods Pocket-lint As always, Gigabyte had some cool mods in its private showroom. This one by Maciel Baretto (Brazil), based on an Auorus Gaming 9 system, was particularly eye catching. Asus ROG Macial Pocket-lint Another classic PC mod from Brazil’s Maciel Barretto was based on an Asus ROG. We particularly liked the Van de Graaf machine. InWin Spherical case mod Pocket-lint This is the only spherical case we saw at this year's event and we have to say we were quite taken with Wei Zheng (Ai Mask)’s creation. WeeView 3D video livestreaming Pocket-lint Last year, WeeView brought us a 3D camera attachment for mobile phones. This year the company unveiled devices to livestream your 3D videos. Jumpy kids phone watch Pocket-lint The Jumpy is a mini mobile phone to strap on your kid’s wrist. It’s designed to take some knocks, can send and receive voice and messages and can even control this little toy car made out of Lego-style bricks. Next Drive Spectra DAC headphones amplifier Pocket-lint DAC headphone amplifiers are nothing new but we particularly liked the discrete slimline design of the Spectra from Next Drive. The company claims it is the world’s smallest in fact. We had a listen to the output with and without the Spectra from a standard laptop on the stand and the version without sounded so dull that we had to switch it off. It retails for around £115 plus VAT from the company's website: www.nextdrive-spectra.io. PhotoFast Flash Drive Pocket-lint PhotoFast generally specialises in iPhone solutions and it was showing off this multipurpose flash drive at the show. We thought the way the Micro USB was embedded into the USB connection was pretty nifty. PhotoFast in-call recorder Pocket-lint PhotoFast was also showing off this in-call recorder that is attached through the Lightning connection on the iPhone. The company suggested it was useful for scenarios such as complex technical calls on the go so that notes or reference could be made at a later date. Smart "caught-cheating" undies Pocket-lint We were incredibly confused by the "Men’s Sexual Data" feature on this smart underwear. The sales reps sombrely informed us that it allows a partner to track how long their husband’s underpants have been removed for, using a sensor on their phone. The male rep chipped-in with a rather outrageous (and wholly untrue) comment: "Because only men cheat!". Don’t worry, there’s also a sedentary measurement too - presumably so the wearer can also be caught out slumming around and doing nothing all day too. Smart sheet Pocket-lint If the smart undies are to designed to catch cheating spouses, God only knows what this smart sheet from the same company is supposed to achieve. Makeblock robot building kits Pocket-lint If you think that Lego kits have taken all the skill and creativity out of building things for kids you’ll probably love these Meccano-reminiscent robot building kits from Makeblock. There is a full-on 17 parts box kit designed for schools too. It’s not cheap though. The mini kits start at $100 and the full range is a cool $7,000: www.makeblock.com. Makeblock modular drone Pocket-lint This foam modular drone is also from Makeblock and we reckon it would make any kid's Christmas to wake up to one of these in his or her stocking. Santa could use one to deliver it too. It will set you back $180 mind you: www.makeblock.com. Intel Skylake X chip Pocket-lint We were lucky enough to get a sneak peak at Intel’s as yet unreleased Skylake X processing chip. Overclocking meister HWbot ran the sister chip, the Kabylake X, down to -269-dgrees Celsius (just 3-degrees above max zero O-degree Kevalan) at its pre-Computex overclocking event on Monday night in Taipei. Asus ROG curve Pocket-lint This massive, 35-inch curved monitor from Asus' ROG brand has UWQHD resolution. We wondered aloud if it would be possible to set three up together and were assured technically it was, but it would have to be a very serious system indeed. Corsair Concept Zeus Qi charging mouse pad Pocket-lint One can always count on Corsair to come up with some nifty peripheral at Computex. This year it was its Concept Zeus Qi-enabled charging mouse pad. Drop your wireless mouse on the spot when you’re done or use it to charge your phone wirelessly. Corsair K68 water resistant keyboard Pocket-lint Although it was hard to get a decent photo of this, you’re looking at the spill and dust resistant K68 mechanical keyboard from Cosair being continually drenched with water. Corsair Concept Curve PC Pocket-lint Corsair also likes to show off awesome concept PCs. This year it came up with the Concept Curve. The company removed the side panels/top and replaced them with curved tempered glass and finished the whole thing off with $10,000-worth of hand-laid carbon fibre. Cheapskates. Corsair Concept Slate PC Pocket-lint We rather thought that Corsair’s Concept Slate could have used a few more fans. 32 simply isn’t enough you know. There are, after all, two PCs in there. Full-colour 3D printer Pocket-lint The 3D printer that made these full-colour figurines won a Best in Show award from the organisers at Computex this year. Unfortunately, we didn't find out its actual name. Chess-playing robot Pocket-lint We would have challenged this robot to a game, but we did pretty badly playing ping pong against a robot at CEATEC Tokyo last September and our egos felt a little too fragile that morning. Plus, we saw it raised its arms in triumph when it beat this lady and we didn’t want to encourage it any further.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC Press Release Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC 05 Jun 2017 FRAMINGHAM, Mass., June 5, 2017 – The worldwide wearables market maintained its upward trajectory during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with Xiaomi and Apple leading all companies and multiple products experiencing double- and triple-digit growth. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, companies shipped a total of 24.7 million wearable devices during 1Q17, up 17.9% from the 20.9 million units shipped in 1Q16. “Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products,” noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC’s Wearables team. “This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide. Now that Xiaomi and Apple have supplanted Fitbit, the next question is whether they will be able to maintain their position. “However, by no means should Fitbit be removed from the wearables conversation,” continued Llamas. “With a user base of 50 million, a strong presence within corporate wellness, and assets that keep it top of mind for digital health, Fitbit is well positioned to move into new segments and markets.” “The market is arguably still in the first phase of development, where companies are focused on seeding wearables into the market,” said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. “It’s all about getting people accustomed to the idea of wearing a device. And the opportunity remains very enticing for traditional and fashion watch brands as the scale of the consumer electronics market far surpasses their world. “The second phase of development will be all about putting user data to good use,” continued Ubrani. “This is when step counts translate into healthier hearts and minds. And it’s also when we will start to see devices that actually augment our abilities and make our lives easier or more productive rather than just being another screen we keep an eye on.” Company Highlights Xiaomi started 2017 as the co-leader of the worldwide wearables market alongside Apple, having spent several years as the number two or three company. More than 96% of its shipment volume – primarily fitness tracking wristbands – remained within China, and many were shipped as part of smartphone bundles to consumers. The company is branching out from wristwear, having announced its “90 Minutes Ultra Smart Sportswear” shoes powered by Intel’s Curie. Apple saw sustained demand for its Watches nearly two quarters after the Series 1 and Series 2 versions launched to the market, and recorded the second highest year-over-year growth among the leading companies. The Series 1 and 2 have been a welcome change from the higher priced and undifferentiated experience found on the original Apple Watch from a year ago, attracting both first-time users and those seeking to replace their previous Watches. Having led the wearables market for several years, Fitbit finds itself in third place to start off 2017. Still, the company believes that there is market need for fitness trackers with the launch of its Alta HR and continued popularity of its Charge 2 wristband and Blaze watch. Moreover, its recent acquisitions of Coin, Pebble, and Vector are expected to translate into the company’s first smartwatch. Samsung led all companies in year-over-year growth, nearly doubling its wearables volumes from a year ago. Driving volumes higher were its Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which in many markets had their first full quarter of availability, as well as its IconX headphones and Gear Fit 2 fitness band. Altogether, the diversification of products is several steps ahead of Samsung’s smartwatch-only emphasis from a year ago. Garmin‘s shift from basic wearables to smart wearables continued in earnest during 1Q17, with total volumes for each nearly equaling each other. Key to this was the addition of Vivo- and Fenix-branded smartwatches that address citizen athletes and outdoors enthusiasts with third party applications beyond health and fitness. The introduction of the Fenix 5 also boded well for the company as the smaller size made the watch accessible to a wider audience.

Apple's big developer conference, WWDC 2017, has begun and its opening keynote has just finished. Amongst other things, we've had several new announcements including a MacBook Pro refresh. Here's what we know so far: MacBook Pro 2017 – What's changed The big change here is the addition of Kaby Lake processors. That's Intel's 7th generation chipset and means the entire MacBook Pro line has received a significant bump in processing power, with new processor models from the more efficient generation of chips. There’s also a new 13-inch MacBook Pro configuration, that comes sans Touch Bar but starts at the lower price of £1249/$1299. A lower-price MacBook Pro was something many people had been clamouring for, although it appears the only change that's been made to make this possible is halving the base model of storage to 128GB. Our tables below show you what's new, with each model compared with its 2016 equivalent. Model 2016 CPU 2017 CPU 13 non-touch 2-3.1GHz Core i5 2.3-3.6GHz Core i5 13 non-touch 2.4-3.4GHz Core i7 2.5-4GHz Core i5 13 Touch 2.9-3.3GHz Core i5 3.1-3.5GHz Core i5 13 Touch 3.1-3.5GHz Core i5 3.3-3.7GHz Core i5 13 Touch 3.3-3.6GHz Core i7 3.5-4GHz Core i7 15 Touch 2.6-3.5GHz quad-core Core i7 2.8-3.8GHz quad-core Core i7 15 Touch 2.7-3.6GHz quad-core Core i7 2.9-3.9GHz quad-core Core i7 15 Touch 2.9-3.8GHz quad-core Core i7 3.1-4.1Ghz quad-core Core i7 Model 2016 GPU 2017 GPU 13 non-touch Intel Iris 540 Intel Iris Plus 640 13 Touch Intel Iris 550 Intel Iris Plus 650 15 Touch Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 Radeon Pro 555 or 560 Model 2016 memory 2017 memory 13 non-touch 8-16GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 8-16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 13 touch 8-16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 8-16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 15 touch 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 16GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 Related: iOS 11 There doesn't appear to have been a bump in memory, which initial reports suggested, and we're stuck on a maximum of 16GB for all the devices. But the base model now gets 2133MHz memory, where before it was limited to 1866MHz. Other than that, not much has changed. Previous reports suggested we'd see a new in-house chip that would improve low-power performance when the device is sleeping, but Apple mentioned no such thing during the WWDC Keynote. That means the new MacBook Pro 2017 comes with all the same specs as existing models, from the Retina displays, Touch Bars on more expensive models and plenty of Thunderbolt 3 support. We'll add more as we learn more. New MacBook Pro 2017 Price and Release Date As mentioned, the new MacBook Pros are available right now and the prices have changed. The 13-inch model is starting at £1249/$1,299 and the 15-inch starting at £2349/$2399. Stay tuned for all the latest from WWDC as TrustedReviews will be providing updates throughout the night. Let us know what you want to see from the new MacBook Pros in the comments. 0 shares Read Comments SoCal482 June 5, 2017, 6:39 pm I'm pretty sure Apple users have been asking for more RAM for MBPs longer than 'since last year' - try 'forever'. zofrex June 5, 2017, 7:40 pm Are you sure about that RAM bump for the Macbook Pro? :P danwat1234 June 5, 2017, 8:10 pm Wow ... . still only 16GB of RAM. Come on now.. Minor CPU speed bump as expected with Kaby Lake. Steven L. VanAllen June 5, 2017, 8:12 pm I heard it's going to be 32GB RAM. Tim Edmonds June 5, 2017, 8:13 pm Still 16 gb RAM, Bye Bye Macbook Pro, Hello Dell XPS 15 and Linux. They should rename it the Macboob Amateur. Lucius June 5, 2017, 8:15 pm There better be a darn good reason why they can't include an option for 32GB of RAM. Michael Passingham June 5, 2017, 8:32 pm Indeed, slight error as wires were crossed over the upgraded iMacs. Corrected now, and thanks! jms June 5, 2017, 10:01 pm 16gb in 2017... so much for being long on AAPL.. GORDON RAMSAY June 5, 2017, 10:53 pm Got my order in for my new 15" MBP, whee! A speed bump, but I'm upgrading from a mid-2015. Can't wait to get it. GORDON RAMSAY June 5, 2017, 10:54 pm Ha ha, you have stock to sell? I'll take it! ;') Oleg Lustenko June 6, 2017, 12:08 pm because that Kaby Lake processor isn't energy efficient enough to add more RAM. With 32GB RAM laptop will spend much more energy and uptime will fall dramatically. Intel will update processors in autumn, interest what Apple will doing with these Ciprian Alexandru June 6, 2017, 1:13 pm I own a one month old MBP that was taken out of the box and activated exactly two weeks ago. Apple knew that they would give MBP a refresh with the Kaby Lake CPU and it would had been moral to make that clear to the public. Instead Apple for the reason of not loosing any sells on the new MBP decided to stay quiet like this is not even an issue. Remember this is not an usual upgrade cycle for MBP and I am sure that some buyers would have had waited for the new release if they knew their machine would become "previous model" a few months after purchase. As a result of this the value of your machine would go down at least a couple hundred dollars if you decide to sell; if you look at your MBP as an asset, and why not, you have incurred a loss. The bottom line is that this was a profitable strategic move for Apple @ the cost of its early adopters and I think they should do something about it. Lucius June 6, 2017, 3:50 pm Would Apple come out with another model so soon after this latest one? Or more like 2018? Luke Fisher June 6, 2017, 5:20 pm Think I'll wait for 2018 upgrade to 32GB RAM.. if it does happen. Drew June 6, 2017, 6:16 pm Apple might have known, but it’s often not up to Apple when it comes to chipsets. Often, one manufacturer will buy exclusive access to have a chip release first for several months before all other competitors, and it turns into a bidding war to the highest bidder. With every chip release, just because it’s “out” doesn’t mean every hardware manufacturer is licensed to use it. Or it would be too expensive to purchase licensing straight away. Blame the chip companies, not the hardware manufacturers. That said, Apple still knows when they’re getting access to the new line, and could have disclosed that. No arguments there. Lucius June 7, 2017, 3:16 pm Personally, the difference between 16 and 32GB is not enough for me to change "ecosystem". For my purposes 16 GB will suffice though 32 would be nice for "future proofing" and super intense multitasking. At the end of the day, I do photography editing, vector graphics, light 3D work, 1080p video editing, multimedia powepoint/keynote, with some gaming like F1 2016. Not to mention word processing, multi document editing and note taking for graduate school, which makes the size and weight of the 15" ideal. For those purposes 16GB works just fine. If I were doing hardcore 4K video/sound editing, multiple 50 megapixel image manipulation in photoshop, 3D animation and internet...at the same time...then yeah, 32 might be needed. Or maybe if I needed three Virtual Machines running at the same time for developing. Then again, if I WERE doing all that and really needed 32 GB RAM I'm pretty sure I'd be using a desktop and maybe going for 64GB RAM at that point with a 6 or 8GB GPU. Obviously the MBP isn't for everyone, but I believe it strikes a good balance for me. Lucius June 7, 2017, 6:07 pm It's all about the niche they're made for. At this point most people don't need 32GB of RAM on a laptop; if you do, congratulations, go buy a Lenovo workhorse, I hear they're awesome. And the argument that "professionals" MUST have at least 32GB of RAM or they don't qualify as professional is plain absurd. There's a lot of types of professionals out there. 16GB of RAM on a laptop with that footprint, weight, portability, SSD speed, USB-C transfer speeds, GPU (which is not terrible by any means unless you're just out for hyperbole), that can be used with an external GPU via USB-C and 5K displays...is nothing to sneeze at. Now if you wanna have a d*** measuring contest, that's another story. jms June 7, 2017, 6:17 pm Stop. Whatever you do for a living, it clearly doesnt require multiple VMs and Java apps running at the same time. So have a great time browsing IG with vim running in a console, god bless you and your life, but every systems / security admin I know is running multiple VMs and Java apps at the same time and for the better part of 2 years, we've been migrating to more robust hardware because of it. And that's a huge problem for those of us who wish to remain on OSX. Lucius June 7, 2017, 6:59 pm No I get why it's a huge problem for you, but clearly Apple must have had a reason for not including 32GB of RAM as an option for their hardware and I bet those reasons had very much to do with profit and the limitations of the technology they're currently using. Do you really think that Apple is going to suffer financially because they're not addressing people's need for 32GB of RAM? jms June 7, 2017, 7:08 pm I think that if Apple wasnt going to follow through on its numerous public commitments to upgrade RAM, thats news a lot of us could have used earlier. I also think turning what was once the best-in-slot laptop into a disposable and underpowered gimmick shows exactly how badly Apple has misjudged the roots of consumer faith in what was once both an expensive and totally essential tool. I'm now hearing rumors that they are going to come out with a 32gb model in 3 months, btw, but at this point I think they would say anything to keep their cult of core evangelists faithful. Lucius June 7, 2017, 7:43 pm Power and "professional" users (whatever that means) made the Mac trendy and fashionable and now Apple is milking that brand loyalty and appeal for all its worth by addressing a different user niche. Is it a sustainable practice? Not really, but in the short run it's very profitable and I'm sure they've got themselves covered in other ways for the future. Honestly though, "disposable and underpowered gimmick" is a bit dramatic. It's non-upgradable for a reason (whether that reason is worth it to you or not is subjective), it's plenty powerful enough for many users and the reason why you think its disposable and underpowered is because it wasn't made with *your* specific needs in mind. I'm sorry that you're not one of those users but for many, the balance they achieved in power, portability, functionality and style makes it a very solid computer. I doubt you're gonna just up and stop using Apple products altogether anyways (or maybe you will). You'll just start using something else for the things that need it, like you said. Where have you heard rumors of a 32GB model coming in three months? And when did Apple make public commitments to specifically upgrade RAM? jms June 7, 2017, 8:21 pm Go to bed Tim Cook, you're drunk. jms June 7, 2017, 8:41 pm The only thing more offensive than the RAM issue are the Fedora flavored fan boys defending it. Lucius June 7, 2017, 9:01 pm Dog-nabbit! You found me out! Sorry friend, I don't have time to get drunk; I'm too busy making millions. Also, it's only 2 PM in California. jms June 7, 2017, 9:02 pm It's wine oclock somewhere... I hope...

Get Flash to see this player. Reckons price-to-performance ratio makes it great for high-end NAS. High-end NAS units tend to have powerful CPUs at their helm, helping buffer operations when eight to 16 drives are in a box. Historically, these have been powered by Intel processors, typically the Core series or, looking to the extreme end of the market, Xeons. However, the recent release of AMD Ryzen 7 processors have brought high-end performance down to a more agreeable price point. This is why Qnap, a leading NAS provider is the first to use Ryzen 7 chips in its six, eight, and 12-bay NAS boxes known as TS-x77. Watch the video to hear Banson Chang, general manager, talk through the benefits and opportunities that running Ryzen 7 brings to QNAP.

Posted by qasdfdsaq - Wed 07 Jun 2017 00:21 While Ryzen isn't much interest to me in a desktop CPU atm, I'm definitely attracted to the idea of a cheap, ECC-capable 6-8 core CPU in my NAS box. My existing 26-drive NAS uses a quad-core E3 Xeon only because an E5 would have cost ridiculous amounts. Ryzen is presenting an incredibly good perf per pound/dollar proposition for 8-core ECC systems. A R7 1700 doubles the core count of my E3-1230v3 while matching the clockspeed and reducing the power consumption all for barely 10% higher cost.

If you prefer to hide a PC behind a monitor, you can't go far wrong with one of the Gigabyte BRIX mini PCs. They've been available for a few generations of Intel chips now, offering a mix of Celeron, Pentium, and Core i3, i5, and i7 options. But more recently Gigabyte expanded the range and the size of the case to allow for performance for gaming. With that in mind, Gigabyte just launched the BRIX Gaming VR mini PC. It's a tiny tower PC that manages to cram in a 7th generation Kaby Lake Core i7-7700HQ processor and a GeForce GTX 1060 GPU complete with 6GB GDDR5 RAM. Even though the case only measures 220-by-110-by-110mm, there's room to fit two M.2 SSDs, a 2.5-inch HDD or SSD, and two SO-DIMM slots for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM. Gigabyte is also generous with ports. There's HDMI (x2), Mini DisplayPort (x2), USB 3.0 (x3), and two USB 3.1 ports with one of those being USB Type C. Display resolution support includes 4096-by-2160 over HDMI and 3840-by-2160 over Mini DisplayPort, with this BRIX capable of running quad displays. There's also Gigabit LAN, Dual Band Wireless-AC, and Bluetooth 4.2. Related Gigabyte's Latest BRIX PC Is for IoT Gigabyte's Latest BRIX PC Is for IoT You'd expect the combination of a Core i7 and GTX 1060 GPU in such a small package to generate a lot of heat and therefore cooling fan noise. But that's apparently not the case according to Gigabyte. The Gaming VR produces 20dB when idle, increasing to just 35dB under full load. If that's the case, noise will not be an issue. The BRIX Gaming VR was originally unveiled during CES in January and finally saw a launch during Computex last week. We still don't know pricing, but expect this tiny desktop PC to appear for sale very soon.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC FRAMINGHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The worldwide wearables market maintained its upward trajectory during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with Xiaomi and Apple leading all companies and multiple products experiencing double- and triple-digit growth. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, companies shipped a total of 24.7 million wearable devices during 1Q17, up 17.9% from the 20.9 million units shipped in 1Q16. „Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products,” noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC’s Wearables team. „This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide. Now that Xiaomi and Apple have supplanted Fitbit, the next question is whether they will be able to maintain their position. „However, by no means should Fitbit be removed from the wearables conversation,” continued Llamas. „With a user base of 50 million, a strong presence within corporate wellness, and assets that keep it top of mind for digital health, Fitbit is well positioned to move into new segments and markets.” „The market is arguably still in the first phase of development, where companies are focused on seeding wearables into the market,” said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. „It’s all about getting people accustomed to the idea of wearing a device. And the opportunity remains very enticing for traditional and fashion watch brands as the scale of the consumer electronics market far surpasses their world. „The second phase of development will be all about putting user data to good use,” continued Ubrani. „This is when step counts translate into healthier hearts and minds. And it’s also when we will start to see devices that actually augment our abilities and make our lives easier or more productive rather than just being another screen we keep an eye on.” Company Highlights Xiaomi started 2017 as the co-leader of the worldwide wearables market alongside Apple, having spent several years as the number two or three company. More than 96% of its shipment volume – primarily fitness tracking wristbands – remained within China, and many were shipped as part of smartphone bundles to consumers. The company is branching out from wristwear, having announced its „90 Minutes Ultra Smart Sportswear” shoes powered by Intel’s Curie. Apple saw sustained demand for its Watches nearly two quarters after the Series 1 and Series 2 versions launched to the market, and recorded the second highest year-over-year growth among the leading companies. The Series 1 and 2 have been a welcome change from the higher priced and undifferentiated experience found on the original Apple Watch from a year ago, attracting both first-time users and those seeking to replace their previous Watches. Having led the wearables market for several years, Fitbit finds itself in third place to start off 2017. Still, the company believes that there is market need for fitness trackers with the launch of its Alta HR and continued popularity of its Charge 2 wristband and Blaze watch. Moreover, its recent acquisitions of Coin, Pebble, and Vector are expected to translate into the company’s first smartwatch. Samsung led all companies in year-over-year growth, nearly doubling its wearables volumes from a year ago. Driving volumes higher were its Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which in many markets had their first full quarter of availability, as well as its IconX headphones and Gear Fit 2 fitness band. Altogether, the diversification of products is several steps ahead of Samsung’s smartwatch-only emphasis from a year ago. Garmin‚s shift from basic wearables to smart wearables continued in earnest during 1Q17, with total volumes for each nearly equaling each other. Key to this was the addition of Vivo- and Fenix-branded smartwatches that address citizen athletes and outdoors enthusiasts with third party applications beyond health and fitness. The introduction of the Fenix 5 also boded well for the company as the smaller size made the watch accessible to a wider audience.   Top 5 Worldwide Wearable Device Companies, Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, Q1 2017 (shipments in millions) Company       1Q17 Shipment Volumes     1Q17 Market Share     1Q16 Shipment Volumes     1Q16 Market Share     Year Over Year Change 1.

More than 96% of its shipment volume – primarily fitness tracking wristbands – remained within China, and many were shipped as part of smartphone bundles to consumers. The company is branching out from wristwear, having announced its „90 Minutes Ultra Smart Sportswear” shoes powered by Intel’s Curie. Apple saw sustained demand for its Watches nearly two quarters after the Series 1 and Series 2 versions launched to the market, and recorded the second highest year-over-year growth among the leading companies. The Series 1 and 2 have been a welcome change from the higher priced and undifferentiated experience found on the original Apple Watch from a year ago, attracting both first-time users and those seeking to replace their previous Watches. Having led the wearables market for several years, Fitbit finds itself in third place to start off 2017. Still, the company believes that there is market need for fitness trackers with the launch of its Alta HR and continued popularity of its Charge 2 wristband and Blaze watch. Moreover, its recent acquisitions of Coin, Pebble, and Vector are expected to translate into the company’s first smartwatch. Samsung led all companies in year-over-year growth, nearly doubling its wearables volumes from a year ago. Driving volumes higher were its Gear S3 Frontier and Classic smartwatches, which in many markets had their first full quarter of availability, as well as its IconX headphones and Gear Fit 2 fitness band. Altogether, the diversification of products is several steps ahead of Samsung’s smartwatch-only emphasis from a year ago. Garmin‚s shift from basic wearables to smart wearables continued in earnest during 1Q17, with total volumes for each nearly equaling each other. Key to this was the addition of Vivo- and Fenix-branded smartwatches that address citizen athletes and outdoors enthusiasts with third party applications beyond health and fitness. The introduction of the Fenix 5 also boded well for the company as the smaller size made the watch accessible to a wider audience.   Top 5 Worldwide Wearable Device Companies, Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, Q1 2017 (shipments in millions) Company       1Q17 Shipment Volumes     1Q17 Market Share     1Q16 Shipment Volumes     1Q16 Market Share     Year Over Year Change 1.

Expansion Through Acquisition Posted on 5 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Xiaomi and Apple Tie for the Top Position as the Wearables Market Swells 17.9% During the First Quarter, According to IDC FRAMINGHAM, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–The worldwide wearables market maintained its upward trajectory during the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) with Xiaomi and Apple leading all companies and multiple products experiencing double- and triple-digit growth. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Wearable Device Tracker, companies shipped a total of 24.7 million wearable devices during 1Q17, up 17.9% from the 20.9 million units shipped in 1Q16. „Fitbit finds itself in the midst of a transformation as user tastes evolve from fitness bands to watches and other products,” noted Ramon Llamas, research manager for IDC’s Wearables team. „This allowed Xiaomi to throttle up on its inexpensive devices within the China market and for Apple to leverage its position as the leading smartwatch provider worldwide. Now that Xiaomi and Apple have supplanted Fitbit, the next question is whether they will be able to maintain their position. „However, by no means should Fitbit be removed from the wearables conversation,” continued Llamas. „With a user base of 50 million, a strong presence within corporate wellness, and assets that keep it top of mind for digital health, Fitbit is well positioned to move into new segments and markets.” „The market is arguably still in the first phase of development, where companies are focused on seeding wearables into the market,” said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. „It’s all about getting people accustomed to the idea of wearing a device. And the opportunity remains very enticing for traditional and fashion watch brands as the scale of the consumer electronics market far surpasses their world. „The second phase of development will be all about putting user data to good use,” continued Ubrani. „This is when step counts translate into healthier hearts and minds.

Tech Search Search On LeadingThis Is How Occidental Petroleum’s CEO Led Through a Crisis Donald TrumpPresident Trump’s Aides Are Urging Him Not to Fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions Comey testimonyWhat to Expect From James Comey’s Testimony UberUber’s Biggest Rival in India Says the Company Is ‘Despicable’ PointCloud IBM Says This Breakthrough Will Breathe New Life Into Moore’s Law Barb Darrow Jun 05, 2017 IBM, GlobalFoundries, and Samsung said Monday that they have found a way to make thinner transistors, which should enable them to pack 30 billion switches onto a microprocessor chip the size of a fingernail. The tech industry has been fueled for decades by the ability of chipmakers to shoehorn ever smaller, faster transistors into the chips that power laptops, servers, and mobile devices. But industry watchers have worried lately that technology was pushing the limits of Moore's Law—a prediction made by Intel (intc) co-founder Gordon Moore in 1965 that chips could double in power every two years or less. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s daily tech newsletter. Monday's news means they could enable the production of smaller, 5-nanometer processors within a few years. Most of today's high-end chips sport 10 nanometer transistors. IBM said chips using this transistor technology will be 40% faster and use 75% less power than the current 10-nanometer chips. Smaller faster chips would suit artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and other compute-intensive uses, IBM said. "This is a big change in transistor design," Jim McGregor, founder and principal analyst of Tirias Research, tells Fortune. The goal there is to keep shrinking the transistors while also improving performance, he adds. Related: IBM Still Awaits Payoffs on Big Bets This work, which the three companies will discuss at a tech conference in Japan this week, should show up in working chips around 2020 or beyond. "Right now we're moving from 10 nanometer to 7 nanometer, with 5-nanometer to follow," McGregor says. Related: IBM Dumps Chip Division, Books Steep Charge IBM sold its chip-making capabilities to GlobalFoundries three years ago, but continues to work on server chip design. So while IBM (ibm) is no longer a chipmaker, it works closely with chip fabrication partners and still has key talent doing transistor and processor technology research, McGregor notes.

She suggests that, with the strong possibility that driverless cars could hit the roads within 15 years, it's possible that driving could become an obsolete skill. "Babies born today may never have to take a driving test," Axa UK chief executive Amanda Blanc told The Telegraph . The insurance chief also warned that the car insurance industry will need to prepare for future accidents where the car's software may be controlling the driving rather than the human passenger. Read More Driverless shuttle bus to be tested by British public for the first time in East London trial Various reports have suggested that autonomous cars could reduce the number of traffic accidents. In future, roads would be "much safer and increase mobility for vulnerable members of society," Ms Blanc told The Telegraph. Car insurance rates are predicted to drop as a result of the decrease in the number of accidents. Intel believes that the adoption of self-driving cars will take slightly longer, suggesting that uptake will increase from 2035 onwards. The tech giant believes that self-driving vehicles will free up more than 250 million hours of consumers’ commuting time per year in the world's busiest cities. Read More Uber takes self-driving cars off the road after accident leaves one on its side Intel calls this the 'Passenger Economy' and claims that it will generate a whopping $7 trillion by 2050. “Autonomous technology will drive change across a range of industries and define a new landscape," said Strategy Analytics president Harvey Cohen, co-author of Intel's Passenger Economy report . However, driverless cars are still somewhat controversial and have been involved in a number of accidents. In March, Uber was forced to take its self-driving cars off the roads after an accident left one of its vehicles on its side. At the time of the crash, an engineer was sitting in the driver’s seat but the vehicle was in self-driving mode. Police said the Uber was not at fault for the accident and the driver of another vehicle had failed to give way.

Bengaluru-based Tejas Networks, a telecom equipment manufacturer with investments from private equity players Goldman Sachs, and Intel Capital, among others, is said to be planning to raise Rs 800 crore in the week starting June 12, sources told the Mint today. Sanjay Nayak, Chief Executive Officer of Tejas Networks’, is expected to offload some of his holding in the company through the issue along with a few other existing shareholders like Cascade Capital Management Mauritius, Intel Capital, and Frontline. Au Small Finance Bank is expected to raise Rs 2,000 crore via IPO. The bank, which figured as one of the 10 entities to be granted the small finance bank licence in 2015, plans to launch the IPO toward the month-end. It will be a pure offer for sale through which existing investors International Finance Corp., Warburg Pincus and Chryscapital will partially exit. Another Rs 2,000-crore IPO in June is being planned by Ahmedabad-based pharma company Eris Lifesciences. CDSL, which plans Rs 400-crore IPO, will see an offer for sale from investors BSE, which holds 50 percent stake, and others like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and The Calcutta Stock Exchange which together hold 65.65 percent stake in CDSL.So far this year, eight companies raised nearly Rs 6,336 crore via initial public offerings. This compares to Rs 26,494 crore raised by 26 companies last year. tags #IPO - News Related news Business ICICI Lombard gets ICICI Bank board approval for IPO BY M Saraswathy Jun 05, 2017 04:09 PM Business India Grid Trust to list on bourses on June 6 Jun 02, 2017 02:50 PM Business GTPL Hathway gets Rs 600-crore IPO from SEBI in June May 31, 2017 09:45 PM Business RInfra InvIT Fund receives final nod from SEBI May 24, 2017 08:42 PM Business Financial sector readies for IPO rush worth over Rs 20,000 cr May 24, 2017 03:32 PM Business Bengaluru’s Sutures India plans Rs. 1,500-cr IPO to help PEs monetise stakes May 17, 2017 02:58 PM Business India Grid Trust InvIT IPO to open from Wednesday May 15, 2017 09:17 PM Business SBI Life set to hire eight banks for up to $1 billion IPO May 12, 2017 09:55 AM Business SBI plans to come up with SBI Life IPO by first half of FY18: MD Dinesh Khara May 12, 2017 09:26 AM Cricket Match 8 | 08 Jun, 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, 2017 IND 321/6 (50.0 ov) Innings Break SL (YET TO BAT) live News Most Popular Top News This auto spare company is shifting gears towards growth.

The courts are slow and political!" These statements were issued on Twitter from @realDonaldTrump Story Continued Below -- BY THE WAY... These tweets appear to be a direct response to the conversation on "Morning Joe" this morning. Joe and Mika thanked the president for watching. ... FOR THE RECORD: In criticizing the Justice Department, the president is criticizing his own administration. Good Monday morning. TWO INTERESTING SCOOPS to start your week. -- THE HOTTEST TICKET: Fired FBI director James Comey’s public testimony at Thursday’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing is attracting “Monica Lewinsky-esque” levels of interest from the media wanting to cover his appearance, multiple sources confirm. Senate Daily Press Gallery Director Laura Lytle, who started working in the gallery during the Clinton impeachment trial, said the “interest level is very similar” to those hearings. “That’s the busiest I’ve ever seen it … The difference is the news industry has changed. The demand for information needs to be faster and quicker.” Another source involved in the hearings said “the buzz is like the ‘90s” in terms of excitement and seriousness. Top gallery staff are scheduled to meet Monday with aides on the Intel panel to discuss the specifics of how many reporters will be allowed into Hart 216 Thursday. Usually about 120 reporters, not including photographers, are allowed to sit in the press section of the hearing room. -- TRUMP’S CAPITOL HILL DINNER: President Donald Trump is hosting a half dozen members of Congress for dinner at the White House Tuesday night, continuing one of the strongest aspects of his presidency: his outreach to Capitol Hill Republicans. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.), and Reps. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) and Francis Rooney (R-Fla.) will all dine with the president. Rooney is a newly elected lawmaker who was a mega fundraiser for Republicans like George W. Bush and Mitt Romney. He was also ambassador to the Holy See in the Bush administration. **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh OVERHEARD AT TRUMP NATIONAL: Trump discussing his decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement over lunch after playing a round of golf Sunday. Trump’s post-Paris analysis: they can’t even get the weather report right, so how come they think they can get that right? PALACE INTRIGUE -- JOSH DAWSEY AND BEN WHITE: “How Reince Priebus hangs on”: “As White House officials scrambled to put together a Rose Garden ceremony with a military band last week, conservative blogger Erick Erickson blared this headline: ‘Reince Priebus’s Departure is Imminent.’ Priebus, seemingly embattled since day one as President Donald Trump’s chief of staff, shrugged the story off, as usual. He spent much of the day with Trump, organizing the Paris accord event, finalizing the list of attendees and the president’s talking points. And he was back at the White House Friday. “It is the fundamental dichotomy Priebus confronts these days. He is a dead man walking, according to senior White House officials, advisers and others close to the president. Aides have begun speculating about his next job. The Washington Post reported he might be ambassador to Greece. Trump adviser Roger Stone later posted a picture of the country online and labeled it as Priebus’s next destination. Yet he continues to show up for work every day as the chief of staff, even as headlines say he will be fired—if not today, then tomorrow or next week. “And yet, he remains in place. His greatest job security: There are few takers for what might be an unworkable gig. He stays in the office until late at night and often toils away on the weekend with little control of what ultimately happens.” http://politi.co/2rBC4GJ LAST NIGHT AT FORD’S THEATRE … TRUMP ON THE LONDON ATTACKS -- “We renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war on innocent life,” Trump said while attending the Ford’s Theatre Annual Gala, according to a pool report. “And it has gone on too long. This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end. As president, I will do what is necessary is to prevent this threat from spreading to our shores.” Trump said he had spoken with Prime Minister Theresa May. -- “In shadow of deadly attacks, British election campaign resumes,” by Reuters’ Andy Bruce and Kate Holton in London: “After the third militant attack in Britain in less than three months, [Theresa] May said Thursday's election would go ahead but said Britain had been far too tolerant of extremism. ‘Violence can never be allowed to disrupt the democratic process,’ May, who served as interior minister from 2010 to 2016, said outside her Downing Street office. … “While British pollsters all predict May will win the most seats in Thursday's election, they have given an array of different numbers for how big her win will be, ranging from a landslide victory to a much more slender win without a majority. Some polls indicate the election could be close, possibly throwing Britain into political deadlock just days before formal Brexit talks with the European Union are due to begin on June 19.” http://reut.rs/2s8YPnV IMPORTANT TEST FOR TILLERSON -- NYT: “4 Arab States Break Ties With Qatar, Complicating U.S. Coalition-Building,” by Gardiner Harris and Michael Gordon in Sydney, Australia: “Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson offered on Monday to help resolve an intensifying dispute between Qatar and four Arab countries that threatens to complicate the Trump administration’s effort to mobilize coalitions against Iran and terrorist groups in the Middle East. ‘We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences,’ Mr. Tillerson said, adding a reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council, a group of Persian Gulf countries. ‘If there’s any role that we can play in terms of helping them address those, we think it is important that the G.C.C. remain unified.’ “Mr. Tillerson’s remarks came on the heels of dramatic announcements by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that they are suspending diplomatic ties, as well as air and sea travel to and from Qatar, potentially choking off access to a crucial United States ally. In its statement, Saudi Arabia urged ‘all brotherly countries and companies’ to do the same. … Indeed, Mr. Trump became so enamored of the Saudis that he cast them as the centerpiece of a possible peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. But such a deal relied in part on the Arab world uniting behind the Saudis as an interlocutor, a prospect made far less likely by Monday’s events.” http://nyti.ms/2qSsrGo -- AP: “Dubai’s budget carrier FlyDubai says it has canceled its flights to Qatar amid a diplomatic dispute between it and other Arab countries. The carrier said Monday that all flights starting Tuesday would be suspended. It offered no other details. FlyDubai’s decision follows that of Emirates and Etihad in canceling flights to Doha.” http://apne.ws/2rsjvX1 ****** A message from Samsung: Samsung has announced more than $10 Billion in US Growth since 2016, including our March 2017 acquisition of HARMAN International, a commitment of $1.2 Billion in U.S.-based IoT Investment and R&D, and a $1B expansion of our Austin, TX Semiconductor Manufacturing Facility. Visit Samsung.com/VisionForTomorrow for more. ****** THE NEW NARRATIVE -- “GOP running out of time for legislative achievements,” by AP’s Erica Werner: “President Donald Trump and his GOP allies on Capitol Hill have made it through nearly half their first year in power without a single major legislative achievement. If that’s going to change, it will have to start soon, a reality that Republican lawmakers will confront when they return to the Capitol on Monday from a weeklong break. ‘We just need to work harder,’ the second-ranking Republican senator, John Cornyn of Texas, said in an interview with KFYO radio in Lubbock, Texas, over the recess. “For now, the party’s marquee agenda items remain undone, their fate uncertain. The long-promised effort to overturn former President Barack Obama’s health law hangs in limbo in the Senate after barely passing the House. A tax overhaul that’s a top Trump priority is unwritten and in dispute, despite his recent claim on Twitter that it’s ahead of schedule…. “Lawmakers will deal with those issues and more as Congress comes back into session, and realistically the window for action is closing fast. Seven legislative weeks are left before Congress scatters for a five-week August recess, a period when lawmakers are likely to lose momentum if they have failed to act on health care or taxes, and face GOP voters frustrated that they haven’t delivered.” http://apne.ws/2suWTDy -- “Trump is finding it easier to tear down old policies than to build his own,” by WaPo’s Jenna Johnson, Juliet Eilperin and Ed O’Keefe: “Voters are still waiting for progress on the $1 trillion package of infrastructure projects Trump promised, the wall along the Southern border he insisted could be quickly constructed and the massive tax cuts he touted during the campaign. Even debate over health-care reform is largely focused on eliminating key parts of the Affordable Care Act and allowing states to craft policies in their place. After being the ‘party of no’ during the Obama years, Republicans are trying to figure out what they want to achieve in this unexpected Trump era — beyond just rolling back what Obama did.” http://wapo.st/2rVzazl COMING ATTRACTIONS -- “Senate Republicans fear ‘train wreck’ in September,” by Burgess Everett and Seung Min Kim: “Concerns are rising in Washington that Congress may be headed toward the economic and political disaster of a debt default and a government shutdown later this year. And the chamber most likely to get Congress out of the jam - the Senate - is failing to live up to its moniker as the world's greatest deliberative body. “Rather than a honeymoon with a new presidency and Republicans firmly in the majority, the Senate has become a grinding churn of nomination votes constantly delayed by Democrats, and partisan warfare with little bipartisan cooperation other than averting an April government shutdown. There’s no budget, no funding levels for the fall and little talk between the two parties on how to avoid a shutdown and debt default in late summer or early fall, worrying senators in both parties.” http://politi.co/2rBlS8n THE JUICE … -- HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI will appear this morning on ABC’s “The View” at 11:20 a.m. to talk about the London terrorist attacks, infrastructure, healthcare and Trump’s ties to Russia. -- THE FIRST FAMILY BEAT -- “Dressed to the nines!

They were wrong”: “When President Donald Trump addressed NATO leaders during his debut overseas trip little more than a week ago, he surprised and disappointed European allies who hoped -- and expected -- he would use his speech to explicitly reaffirm America’s commitment to mutual defense of the alliance’s members, a one-for-all, all-for-one provision that looks increasingly urgent as Eastern European members worry about the threat from a resurgent Russia on their borders. “That part of the Trump visit is known. What’s not is that the president also disappointed – and surprised – his own top national security officials by failing to include the language reaffirming the so-called Article 5 provision in his speech. National security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson all supported Trump doing so and had worked in the weeks leading up to the trip to make sure it was included in the speech, according to five sources familiar with the episode. They thought it was, and a McMaster aide even briefed reporters from the New York Times the day before that the line was definitely included. “It was not until the next day … when Trump started talking at an opening ceremony for NATO’s new Brussels headquarters, that the president’s national security team realized their boss had made a decision with major consequences – without consulting or even informing them in advance of the change. ‘They had the right speech and it was cleared through McMaster,’ said a source briefed by National Security Council officials in the immediate aftermath of the NATO meeting. ‘As late as that same morning, it was the right one.’” http://politi.co/2rsh8DJ … Transcript of Susan’s new podcast with Strobe Talbott http://politi.co/2rJTBhM … Subscribe http://apple.co/2kJ9q1U DANIEL BENJAMIN, former State Department coordinator for counterterrorism, in POLITICO Magazine, “Is Trump Fighting Terrorism? Or is he just tweeting about it, while making it worse?”: “Trump’s steps so far seem to be designed to exacerbate the danger and lengthen the life expectancy of jihadism. ... Unfortunately, every piece of evidence from the past 20 years of fighting terrorism shows that the population of jihadis can grow dynamically depending on events. With the paralysis of the Trump/Tillerson State Department, where there are almost no Senate-confirmed officeholders at the assistant secretary level or higher and the plan is to gut the State Department/USAID budget by close to a third, it is hard to envision any kind of future for the sort of diplomacy and development we need to diminish the jihadi threat. Trump unwittingly is setting the stage for major growth in the population of people who would like to kill us.” http://politi.co/2rJuKuN -- “Trump’s sluggish hiring could hamper anti-terror plans,” by Andrew Restuccia: “[T]he president’s counter-terrorism strategy could be hindered by dozens of vacancies across the government, not least a permanent FBI director. Top ranks at the State Department remain largely unfilled, as are some key ambassadorships. Trump has not named anyone to lead [TSA], which screens people at airports, or to run the Homeland Security office charged with protecting the country’s physical and cyber infrastructure. His choice to lead [FEMA] is awaiting Senate confirmation, but Trump has not named a deputy. At the Justice Department, Trump has not nominated an assistant attorney general for the national security division. And he has not nominated a deputy at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence or a director of the office’s National Counterterrorism Center. And, perhaps most crucially, Trump has not yet named a permanent leader of the FBI, which plays a central role in combating domestic terrorism.” http://politi.co/2suXnd3 MEGYN KELLY’S NBC DEBUT WITH PUTIN -- “Putin denies having compromising information on Trump,” by Rebecca Morin: “Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday denied having compromising information on President Donald Trump, calling it ‘nonsense.’ During an interview on NBC News’ ‘Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly,’ host Megyn Kelly asked Putin if he has ‘something damaging on our president.’ Putin rebuffed the accusation. … ‘Well, this is just another load of nonsense. Where would we get this information from? Why, did we have some special relationship with him? We didn’t have any relationship at all,’ the Russian president said. “Putin said he never met with Trump during the latter's visits to Moscow, adding that a lot of Americans and companies come to Russia and saying the country doesn't gather information on them. ‘Right now, I think we have representatives from a hundred American companies that have come to Russia. Do you think we're gathering compromising information on all of them right now or something? Are you all, have you all lost your senses over there?’ Putin, a former KGB spy, said.” http://politi.co/2suIHuv ****** A message from Samsung: Samsung’s footprint in the U.S. has been growing for nearly 40 years, and we announced more than $10 Billion in US Growth since 2016.

Eighty-six percent of Baltimore voters backed her over Trump, and organizers said the sold-out fundraiser will raise some $200,000. Clinton will address a group [the Elijah Cummings Youth Program] founded to build ties between the African-American and Jewish communities at a time when both have had a complicated relationship with Trump.” http://bsun.md/2qSq8Dk BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Dueling Portland rallies end without major violence, but police intervene,” by The Oregonian’s Brad Schmidt: “Dueling rallies engulfed five blocks of downtown Portland on Sunday as hundreds of Trump supporters and counter-demonstrators hurled insults but largely avoided physical confrontation during a tense standoff just days after police arrested a known extremist in the grisly killing of two good Samaritans. Officers in riot gear prevented a full-scale clash between protest blocs by restricting access to Terry Schrunk Plaza, where Trump backers and free-speech advocates rallied for hours in a self-contained bubble within this liberal city. “Three distinct groups of counter-demonstrators overtook the surrounding blocks, forming a perimeter along streets and sidewalks while chanting anti-hate messages and sometimes taunting Trump supporters under the watchful eye of police. Officers deployed explosives and pepper balls to scatter the antifascist crowd gathered in Chapman and Lownsdale squares just north of the pro-Trump rally. By 6 p.m., each demonstration had subsided without any significant violence and police had arrested 14.” http://bit.ly/2qSkfGk ... Protest pics http://bit.ly/2rJc8eh THE NATION OF CALIFORNIA -- “[Jerry] Brown’s first stops in China are in cities that look a lot like California,” by the L.A. Times’ Jessica Meyers in Chengdu, China: “Brown’s meetings began Sunday in the Sichuan provincial capital of Chengdu, part of a weeklong trip hinged on his mantra of climate change collaboration. Sichuan’s rivers and steep terrain have helped make it a hub for hydropower. Nanjing’s Jiangsu province, which he will visit on Monday, aims to position itself as a leader on renewable energy. These local stops take on greater significance amid President Trump’s decision Thursday to pull the U.S. from a historic Paris climate accord led by China and the Obama administration. Officials are reinforcing regional partnerships -- with the economic links they provide -- in a quiet effort to ensure continued ties.” http://lat.ms/2qSlcyo PLAYBOOK METRO SECTION -- “Kalorama’s parking crisis deepens with Obamas and Ivanka Trump as neighbors,” by WaPo’s Luz Lazo. http://wapo.st/2qWz1Xu MEDIAWATCH -- “Of course Washington is plagued by leaks. That’s a good thing,” by WaPo’s Margaret Sullivan: “Ever since taking office, President Trump has been condemning leaks, leakers and the journalists they leak to. ... Paul Steiger stakes out the opposite position. The revered former managing editor of the Wall Street Journal (and founder of ProPublica, the investigative nonprofit) put it this way: ‘It is not the publishing of these secrets that threatens national security. Publishing these secrets threatens the secret-keepers. It protects the public interest by letting us know what powerful people are doing when they think no one is looking.’ Accepting a journalism award, Steiger summed it up: ‘We need more journalists revealing more secrets, not fewer.’” http://wapo.st/2qSeVCx --“Breitbart employees infuriated by colleagues’ ‘appalling’ comments after London terror attack,” by CNN’s Oliver Darcy: “Breitbart employees expressed strong displeasure on Sunday with two of their colleagues for inflammatory comments posted to Twitter in the aftermath of the London terror attack. ‘I find it appalling,’ one Breitbart employee told CNN. ‘It’s a terrible comment,’ another Breitbart employee told CNN, saying it was wrong to make a blanket statement about an entire religious group. ... A third Breitbart employee described the comments as ‘dumb.’ Following the attack in London ...

Follow us: Release dates: every game confirmed for 2017 E3 2017 schedule: conference times for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, Bethesda, EA and Ubisoft, plus other streams Pre-order Agents of Mayhem and you’ll get to play as Saints Row mainstay Johnny Gat PC PS4 Xbox One Destiny GTA 5 Battlefield Pokemon Overwatch Guides Ticker E3 2017 schedule: conference times for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, Bethesda, EA and Ubisoft, plus other streams By Alex Donaldson, Monday, 5 June 2017 11:01 GMT Share on: Facebook Twitter Reddit Google+ Use our cheat sheet and make sure you don’t miss a thing. Ready or not, E3 is a-comin’. We’re a matter of days away from the biggest event in the gaming calendar! Though E3 has changed quite a lot over the last few years and had a lot said about its continuing significance, this year spells a big change: the show is open to the public. Before the show doors are flung open for public and industry alike, we have the traditional gauntlet of E3 conferences to get through. That means you lot staying up late or otherwise making the time to follow the news if you’re so inclined, and for us that means running around like our hair is on fire in an attempt to report all the news and get it all under control and report you the latest news. Which we will. We’re cool like that. If you need to plan out your E3 week or if you’re just looking to get the dates down in order to contain your hype appropriately, we’ve got you covered. Here’s the E3 2017 conference schedule as it currently stands. Saturday, June 10 – E3 conferences and live streams E3 kicks off one day earlier than usual thanks to EA stepping back from the show proper. EA Play – 12pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern, 8pm BST, 9pm CEST EA kicks off E3 with the grand opening of its EA Play event. The event will be open to the public, but before that happens they’ll hold a press conference to talk about the playable games there (including your usual smattering of sports stuff and Star Wars Battlefront 2) plus make new announcements. Rumours suggest we’ll see a new IP from Bioware at the conference – and we’ve gathered that plus other predictions and thoughts on EA at E3 separately if you want the scoop on what to expect. Sunday, June 11 – E3 conferences and live streams Microsoft shift their conference back a day to get slot that isn’t at the crack of dawn. Xbox / Microsoft – 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern, 10pm BST, 11pm CEST Microsoft are the first of the ‘big three’ hardware makers to let rip with their conference, though it’s moved forward a day from its typical slot. Expect all the details on the Xbox Scorpio, updates on previously-announced games like Crackdown and Sea of Thieves plus no doubt more Windows 10 gaming stuff and hopefully some new game announcements to boot. We’re a little worried about Microsoft – Scorpio alone isn’t going to be enough. Crucially, the company needs games – and we wrote about that at length. Fingers crossed we get an impressive showing from Scorpio and more on the new games front than just a new Forza entry. Bethesda – 7pm Pacific, 10pm Eastern, 3am BST, 4am CEST Bethesda has released an E3 invite that seems to tease that its E3 showcase will feature at least two new games. With Prey and Dishonored out, the company surely must be gearing up to show off some new things. Could it finally be time for Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, the game teased in last year’s conference intro? In any case, we’ve rounded up everything you can expect from Bethesda at E3 2017. According to the latest information on Bethesda’s E3 2017 showcase hub, the conference livestream will kick off two hours after the announced start time – so tune in from 9pm Pacific, midnight Eastern, 5am BST and 6am CEST, but expect news to roar out before then. Monday, June 12 – E3 conferences and live streams Sony and Ubisoft round out the on-the-ground conference events at E3 2017. The PC Gaming Show – 10am Pacific, 1pm Eastern, 7pm BST, 8pm CEST The PC Gaming Show returns at E3 – with Intel partnering up with the magazine PC Gamer to put in a show for PC gamers specifically. This show is never one for really big news, but often some good titbits can be found here for PC-specific fans – it’s well worth a look. It’ll be hosted by Sean ‘Day9# Plott and boasts Intel as its main sponsor. Confirmed atendees include Xbox, Bohemia Interactive, Sega and others. Expect PC darling PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds to make an appearance. Ubisoft – 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern, 9pm BST, 10pm CEST They were late to announce compared to the other companies, but Ubisoft will still have a major presence at the show, as confirmed with the official announcement of their press conference. Assassin’s Creed Empire is one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, and Ubisoft has now come right out and said it outright: a new Assassin’s Creed, The Crew 2, Far Cry 5 and South Park will all launch this fiscal year. As a result, we fully expect them at E3. What else Ubi might show is a mystery, but South Park is still missing in action and rumours point to a cross-over game with Nintendo. PlayStation / Sony – 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern, 2am BST, 3am CEST Sony keep their traditional Monday evening E3 slot. After getting the PS4 Pro out of the way late last year, Sony has a bit of a clean slate here – and they have the Xbox Scorpio to respond to. We’re sure to see more of God of War, Days Gone, Detroit: Become Human and Spider-Man, but other questions remain… will we see The Last of Us Part 2? What will there be that’s all new? We’ve got a list of our predictions and wishes for Sony at E3 2017 – give it a read. Tuesday, June 13 – E3 conferences and live streams E3 kicks off proper with the show doors opening, but before they do Nintendo steps in… Nintendo Spotlight: E3 2017 – 9am Pacific, 12pm Eastern, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST Nintendo got out ahead of most other companies and said right off the bat that they wouldn’t be having a traditional conference during an investor call. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, as they haven’t held one for years – but they will still put on a unique show with “Nintendo Spotlight: E3 2017”, a special pre-recorded E3 event that’ll stream live much like Nintendo Direct and last year’s E3 Nintendo ‘Digital Event’. Nintendo has already confirmed Super Mario Odyssey will be shown at the event, plus teased other announcements for both 3DS and Switch. We’ve got a full page of our hopes and predictions for Nintendo at E3, so go give that a read. E3 Show Floor Streams: Youtube Live at E3 YouTube of course has a massive presence at E3, and it’ll be inviting developers onto its live stream as well as rehosting all the major conference live streams listed above. Youtube Live at E3 – June 11 1pm Pacific (4pm Eastern, 9pm BST, 10pm CEST) until 10pm Pacific: Xbox Conference, Bethesda Conference & YouTube Live at E3 shows Youtube Live at E3 – June 12 12pm Pacific until 9pm Pacific: Ubisoft Conference, PlayStation Conference & YouTube Live at E3 shows Youtube Live at E3 – June 14 2pm Pacific: E3 Coliseum – Call of Duty WW2 panel with Sledgehammer Games 2pm Pacific: E3 Coliseum – ‘Stories Across Screens’ panel E3 Show Floor Streams: Nintendo Treehouse Live Once their conference is done and dusted, Nintendo aren’t quite finished – they have lots more to do at E3, includiong a live stream throughout the show. This stream will run alongside the show every day, but there are some set events. Nintendo Treehouse Live – June 13 2:30pm Pacific (5:30pm Eastern, 10:30pm BST, 11:30pm CEST): 2017 Splatoon 2 World Inkling Invitational Nintendo Treehouse Live – June 14 3:30pm Pacific: 2017 ARMS Open Invitational E3 Show Floor Streams: Twitch The folks at Twitch TV will be streaming throughout E3, and as well as streaming some of the press conferences complete with some exclusive pre and post-show content, the video giant will also be present on the E3 show floor itself streaming.

Apple puts on a mostly-annual developers conference in California to showcase new software, software updates, and - sometimes - technologies that developers can leverage in order to make their apps more innovative and up to date. Apple calls this conference the Worldwide Developers Conference, and although it's geared toward developers, consumers are invited to watch. There's usually a healthy dose of consumer excitement in the keynote. This year, for instance, Apple introduced a Siri-powered speaker called HomePod, a new iPad Pro with a 10.5-inch screen, watchOS 4 for Apple Watch, MacOS High Sierra for Macs, iOS 11 for iPhones and iPads, and more. In fact, here's a round-up of all the announcements. Pocket-lint When is WWDC 2017? Apple's WWDC 2017 conference takes places in San Jose, CA - rather than the usual city of San Francisco, CA - from 5 June to 9 June at the McEnery Convention Center. It means, for the first time, it is on the doorstep of Apple's new Cupertino complex. Where can you watch WWDC 2017? Apple held its keynote address at 10am PST (6pm BST). It was available to watch online through the dedicated Apple website or the WWDC app on iPhone, iPad or Apple TV. It's a two-hour event. We will embed the video here when it becomes available. What happened at WWDC 2017? iOS 11 Apple iOS 11 has a raft of new features, Siri gets new voice and more Apple has announced the new version of iOS, expected for release in September. iOS 11 comes with a raft of new features. For instance, iMessages are now stored as part of iCloud, so they sync across all your devices. All your messages are stored in the cloud, but are still end-to-end encrypted for security. There are also new changes to Apple Pay, including the addition of person-to-person payments. It works as an in-app add-on for iMessage so you can easily send payments to friends and families. Siri has a new, more natural voice and can translate from English to Chinese, French, German, Italian, etc. The Camera app improves in iOS 11, using HIEF compression for photos. They will look as good as normal JPEGs but at half the file size. Photos also now has a range of new options. You have the ability to edit live images across the different frames, for instance. And finally, Control Center now packs all the features on one page, with sliders for volume and brightness. Then 3D touch will access individual controls, to tweak different aspects with more depth. Apple is yet to reveal the exact release date of iOS 11, but it should appear alongside the new iPhones later this "fall". WatchOS 4 Apple Apple unveils watchOS 4, new Toy Story faces and much more Apple has revealed some of the new features coming to Apple Watch when watchOS 4 is released later this year. The company explained that there will be new watch faces, including a Siri Watch face to see relevant content, including diary notifications, and news stories. The Music app is also improved. It has been redesigned, can automatically sync music and show cover art on the screen, and more. Apple also showed a demo of the new dock. It will show recently used apps, so you can scroll through more easily than before. New fitness features are coming too, with playlists in Music starting when a workout begins. There are many other new features too, which we'll detail further soon. It is thought that watchOS 4 will be released in "the fall" - so a few months away yet. MacOS High Sierra Apple Apple announces major MacOS Sierra update called... High Sierra Instead of announcing an all-new system with an all-new name, Apple announced MacOS High Sierra. It's a major update to Sierra, which Apple announced and rolled out last year. And Apple executive Craig Federighi wasted no time telling developers that High Sierra is "fully baked". The new macOS is about deep technology but also added some refinements, Federighi explained. Safari is now the "world's fastest desktop browser" with High Sierra and is going after Chrome and its upcoming ad-blocking features. Safari now offers AutoPlay blocking and no longer has intelligence tracking prevention. But one of the biggest area of refinement in High Sierra is in Photos. There's now a persistent sidebar and a view that has all of your imports in chronological order. Another big update announced is the new Apple File System. It's 64-bit, from top to bottom. Other new High Sierra features involve video and graphics; for instance, it now supports the H.256 standard for video. Apple also introduced Metal 2 and Metal VR. Remember, VR and AR apps need heavy GPU power, so we're not surprised to hear Apple announce is doubling down. Steam VR SDK, Unity and Unreal engines are coming to the Mac as well. Refreshed iMacs Apple Apple iMac gets serious spec boost for 2017 Apple's iMac lineup has received an almighty boost. They now have improved brightness of 500 nits and use 10-bit dithering.The processor have had a bit of a boost too. The iMacs will now be fitted with Intel's 7th-gen Kaby Lake processors. They be specced with more memory than ever before: up to 32GB on the 21.5-inch display models and up to 64GB of memory on the 27-inch models. Apple's Fusion Drive storage system is now standard on all 27-inch iMacs and can be specced on the 21.5-inch models. The solid state storage drives (SSD) also now work up to 50-per cent faster and can be specced up to 2TB. Also, the entry-level 21.5-inch iMac now has Intel Iris Plus graphics, while the 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display uses discreet Radeon Pro 555 and 560 GPU processors. The 27-inch iMac can now be specced up, too. You can get up to 8GB of VRAM, providing 5.5 teraflops of processing power, ideal for VR creation. Connections-wise, these iMacs will be gifted with two USB-C ports that support Thunderbolt 3. They are now available. The 21.5-inch iMac will start at $1,099, while the 21.5-inch with 4K display is $1,299, and the 27-inch with 4K display starts at $1,799. iMac Pro Apple Apple reveals the iMac Pro, its most powerful Mac ever Not content with updating the regular line of iMac all-in-one computers, Apple's also super-charging the iMac for professionals. The iMac Pro takes things to the next level with a huge amount of power. It comes in Space Grey and is based on the 27-inch 5K iMac design. The starting configuration equips you with an 8-core Xeon, but there will be options for 10-core or 18-core versions too. It's not just the CPU that's ramped up, but it will be equipped with the new Radeon Vega GPUs, offering up to 16GB of vRAM. Apple said this is the most powerful Mac that it's ever made. Of course this $4,999 machine isn't pitched at the average consumer, it's for those who want develop in the VR environment for that new VR support. Apple said it will be available from December 2017. HTC Vive Apple HTC Vive coming to Apple Mac, VR-friendly at last HTC has confirmed that its virtual reality headset, the HTC Vive, will soon be compatible with Mac. Apple revealed that it is adding Steam VR support to High Sierra, its new version of MacOS to be released this coming "fall", and that means it will be possible to use a Mac to control virtual reality experiences. It has been a PC exclusive so far. Demos of HTC Vive support were shown during WWDC. iPad Pro 10.5-inch Apple Apple introduces a new iPad Pro with a larger 10.5-inch screen This iPad follows another new iPad from earlier this year. Called iPad, that device is 9.7 inches. It replaced the iPad Air 2 and starts at $329. Apple said it "take everything you love about the 9.7 inch and give you a whole lot more to love". It looks like an iPad Pro, but with a larger 10.5-inch Retina display and reduced bezels. It weighs 1 pound, but it's 20-per cent larger. It allows for a full-size onscreen keyboard, and a full-sized physical keyboard you can attach. It also comes with a feature called ProMotion, which doubles the refresh rate to 120Hz and supports HDR Video. And its True Tone technology is 50-per cent brighter, Apple said. The new iPad Pro is powered by the A10X six-core CPU, too, with a 12-core GPU included. Cameras have also been upgraded . It has a 12-megapixel camera on the back and a front-facing 7-megapixel FaceTime camera. It also has an embedded Touch ID sensor, LTE model option, 64GB of standard memory, an improved four-speaker sound system, and support for the Smart Connector and Apple Pencil. Oh, and the new iPad Pro uses Lightning, not USB-C. It is available for preorder now with a starting price of $649.99. HomePod Apple's HomePod Siri-enabled speaker is real Apple has announced its own music system in the form of the HomePod speaker. It will be released later this year, but the company revealed a sneak peek during its keynote. The HomePod is designed to take on the Amazon Echo in smart functionality, but it also systems like Sonos in audio quality. It has a seven-beam forming tweeter array to fill a room multi-directionally, plus a 4-inch woofer. The speaker is controlled by Apple's A8 processor. This enables many features, such as multi-channel echo cancellation and separation. However, its the smart functionality, combined with Siri voice control ("Hey Siri") and Apple Music, which, using six microphones around the circumference, streams tracks using plenty of contextual phrases. It can also, set reminders and timers and find out news, etc. Apple's HomePod will come in white and black, and as it comes with HomeKit built into the device, it works to control smart appliances around your home even when you just interact with your iPhone from another location. It'll cost $349 and will ship in the US, UK, and Australia from December. App Store Apple Apple App Store completely redesigned with new daily recommendations Apple has announced that it is redesigning the App Store as part of iOS 11, to be released later this year. It has a cleaner, simpler look on phone with separate Music app-style tabs separating content. There is an all-new Today tab, which shows new games and apps recommended for that day only. You can also see other days' content just by scrolling down. There are also new tabs for Games. The App Store will showcase a selection of the latest games, present gameplay videos and tips, and list popular games and in-app purchases. Apps also gets its own tab and is like Games. Every app and every game gets a new product page on the store with all new features and a friendly design. Apple also announced at WWDC 2017 that Monument Valley 2 is now available on the App Store. Amazon Video Apple Amazon and Apple finally playing nicely, Amazon Video coming to Apple TV After several rumours suggesting it was happening, Apple has confirmed that itself and Amazon have finally settled some differences, as Amazon's Video app will make its way to Apple TV later this year. Amazon Video is the last major video app missing from Apple TV, not including All 4 and ITV Hub, and its addition would make the Apple TV a more attractive option as a set-top box. Want to know more?

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UWQjco Tata Elxsi Showcases Advanced Automotive Technology Solutions at CES 2017, Las Vegas ALSO READ Tata Elxsi surges on heavy volumes Toyota wants to ship left-hand drive cars from India Statspeak: Self-driving fears Tata Motors to tie up with Microsoft to drive into the future Indian engineering design firm Tata Elxsi has licensed its software platform to one of the top five carmakers globally that will help hasten the development of their own driverless car. Tata Elxsi's middleware platform AUTONOMAI will act as an interface between the hardware such as stereoscopic cameras, radars and lidars and the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms that will be trained to react to complex driving scenarios. The firm, which is part of the Tata Group, is already a Tier-1 supplier of software-based driving aids and assistance systems to some of the world's largest automakers.  With the licensing deal, it is penetrating deeper into the upcoming autonomous vehicle sector that technology giant Intel expects to grow to $7 trillion by 2050. "We are delighted with this latest win for AUTONOMAI by one of the world's top 5 car OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)", said Nitin Pai, senior vice-president in marketing, Tata Elxsi. "Carmakers will need to ensure that self-driving cars are able to communicate with each other through technologies such as V2X, adapt to different driving conditions, receive real-time maps and over-the-air software updates." This also would help the company to increasingly generate revenue through the internet protocol (IP) than merely providing engineering services.  While Tata Elxsi did not name the customer, the top five carmakers globally are Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Daimler. Tata Elxsi stock spiked by 4 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange after the firm announced the development. As self-driving cars start appearing outside of closed test tracks and the roads of Silicon Valley, they will need to be trained to adapt to local terrain and driving conditions.  AUTONOMAI promises to speed up this for automakers with its rapid region-specific adaptation capabilities by using AI and machine learning. Business Standard first reported in January that Tata Elxsi was planning to test its autonomous car on the roads of Bengaluru to build visibility for its self-driving car related products. The Indian firm has built two of its own self-driving cars to simulate and fine tune its middleware components such as AUTONOMAI. All large global auto manufacturers and even technology companies such as Google, Uber, Intel and NVIDIA are working on building autonomous vehicles.  Tata Elxsi says it isn't going to compete with them but rather work with companies to speed up development of their own self-driving cars, trucks or any other type of vehicle. "What we're developing will be useful in many ways for OEMs and suppliers of parts. It will provide them with a platform to get more research and development faster than ever," Pai told Business Standard in an earlier interaction. This is right up the alley of the Indian company, which today does complete functionality testing of critical automotive systems such as anti-locking braking system (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), the traction control system (TCS), hill ascent control (HSC), and hill descent control (HDC) for various automakers. While Tata Elxsi will steer clear of building hardware sensors used in autonomous driving, the company is also working with large Tier-1 suppliers to co-develop sensors that will be work with its underlying software.  The company is also looking to cross sell its other software-based safety solutions through such deals.

The firm, which is part of the Tata Group, is already a Tier-1 supplier of software-based driving aids and assistance systems to some of the world's largest automakers.  With the licensing deal, it is penetrating deeper into the upcoming autonomous vehicle sector that technology giant Intel expects to grow to $7 trillion by 2050. "We are delighted with this latest win for AUTONOMAI by one of the world's top 5 car OEMs (original equipment manufacturers)", said Nitin Pai, senior vice-president in marketing, Tata Elxsi. "Carmakers will need to ensure that self-driving cars are able to communicate with each other through technologies such as V2X, adapt to different driving conditions, receive real-time maps and over-the-air software updates." This also would help the company to increasingly generate revenue through the internet protocol (IP) than merely providing engineering services.  While Tata Elxsi did not name the customer, the top five carmakers globally are Volkswagen, General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Daimler. Tata Elxsi stock spiked by 4 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange after the firm announced the development. As self-driving cars start appearing outside of closed test tracks and the roads of Silicon Valley, they will need to be trained to adapt to local terrain and driving conditions.  AUTONOMAI promises to speed up this for automakers with its rapid region-specific adaptation capabilities by using AI and machine learning. Business Standard first reported in January that Tata Elxsi was planning to test its autonomous car on the roads of Bengaluru to build visibility for its self-driving car related products. The Indian firm has built two of its own self-driving cars to simulate and fine tune its middleware components such as AUTONOMAI. All large global auto manufacturers and even technology companies such as Google, Uber, Intel and NVIDIA are working on building autonomous vehicles.  Tata Elxsi says it isn't going to compete with them but rather work with companies to speed up development of their own self-driving cars, trucks or any other type of vehicle. "What we're developing will be useful in many ways for OEMs and suppliers of parts. It will provide them with a platform to get more research and development faster than ever," Pai told Business Standard in an earlier interaction. This is right up the alley of the Indian company, which today does complete functionality testing of critical automotive systems such as anti-locking braking system (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), the traction control system (TCS), hill ascent control (HSC), and hill descent control (HDC) for various automakers. While Tata Elxsi will steer clear of building hardware sensors used in autonomous driving, the company is also working with large Tier-1 suppliers to co-develop sensors that will be work with its underlying software.  The company is also looking to cross sell its other software-based safety solutions through such deals.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Computers IBM's new 5nm architecture crams 30 billion transistors onto fingernail-sized chip Michael Irving June 4, 2017 Wafers of the new 5 nm chips are tested in pods in a New York facility (Credit: Connie Zhou) View gallery - 3 images The smallest and most advanced chips currently commercially available are made up of transistors with gates about 10 nm long, but IBM has now unveiled plans to cut them in half. To create 5 nm chips, the company is ditching the standard FinFET architecture in favor of a new structure built with a stack of four nanosheets, allowing some 30 billion transistors to be packed onto a chip the size of a fingernail and promising significant gains in power and efficiency. First coined in the 1970s, Moore's Law was the observation that the number of transistors on a single chip would double every two years. The trend has held up pretty well ever since, but the time frame of the doubling has slowed down a little in recent years. In consumer electronics, 14 nm chips are still stock-standard, but advances from the likes of Intel and Samsung mean that 10 nm versions have started hitting the high-end market. NEW ATLAS NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT Upgrade to a Plus subscription today, and read the site without ads. It's just US$19 a year.UPGRADE NOW But the march of technology never stops, and in 2015 IBM unveiled a 7 nm test chip, developed in conjunction with GlobalFoundries and Samsung. This prototype crammed some 20 billion transistors onto a fingernail-sized chip, thanks to some new manufacturing tricks and materials, and they're expected to be rolled out on a commercial scale in about 2019. Now, the same group of companies has unveiled the next step beyond that. With individual switches just 5 nm in diameter, an extra 10 billion of them can be squeezed onto a chip the same size. While current manufacturing techniques could potentially shrink down to the 5 nm scale, the team instead developed a brand new architecture. Semiconductors have been made using the FinFET architecture since about 2011. As its name suggests, these transistors are fin-shaped, with three current-carrying channels surrounded by an insulating layer. But, as often happens with technology, this structure is starting to bump up against the limits of how small it can be scaled, and the IBM team says shrinking the fins any further won't do much to improve their performance. Instead, the 5 nm chips are made using stacked silicon nanosheets, which can send signals through four gates at once, instead of FinFET's three. They're created using Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, a process that writes patterns on a silicon wafer using a much higher energy wavelength of light than the current technique. That means finer details can be created on the chip, and unlike existing lithography processes, the chips' power and performance can be adjusted continuously during manufacturing. Compared to the current 10 nm chips, the 5 nm prototypes are capable of improving performance by 40 percent at fixed power, or provide a power saving of 75 percent at matched performance. The development could lead to smaller, more powerful and more efficient devices – but with 10 nm chips only just hitting the market, and 7 nm due for commercial release in 2019, these 5 nm chips are probably still about four years away.

Connie Zhou The limits of silicon have not been reached quite yet. Today, an IBM-led group of researchers have detailed a breakthrough transistor design, one that will enable processors to continue their Moore’s Law march toward smaller, more affordable iterations. Better still? They achieved it not with carbon nanotubes or some other theoretical solution, but with an inventive new process that actually works, and should scale up to the demands of mass manufacturing within several years. That should also, conveniently enough, be just in time to power the self-driving cars, on-board artificial intelligence, and 5G sensors that comprise the ambitions of nearly every major tech player today—which was no sure thing. 5nm Or Bust For decades, the semiconductor industry has obsessed over smallness, and for good reason. The more transistors you can squeeze into a chip, the more speed and power efficiency gains you reap, at lower cost. The famed Moore’s Law is simply the observation made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, in 1965, that the number of transistors had doubled every year. In 1975, Moore revised that estimate to every two years. While the industry has fallen off of that pace, it still regularly finds ways to shrink. Doing so has required no shortage of inventiveness. The last major breakthrough came in 2009, when researchers detailed a new type of transistor design called FinFET. The first manufacturing of a FinFET transistor design in 2012 gave the industry a much-needed boost, enabling processors made on a 22-nanometer process. FinFET was a revolutionary step in its own right, and the first major shift in transistor structure in decades. Its key insight was to use a 3-D structure to control electric current, rather than the 2-D “planar” system of years past. ”Fundamentally, FinFET structure is a single rectangle, with the three sides of the structure covered in gates,” says Mukesh Khare, vice president of semiconductor research for IBM Research. Think of the transistor as a switch; applying different voltages to the gate turns the transistor “on” or “off.” Having three sides surrounded by gates maximizes the amount of current flowing in the “on” state, for performance gains, and minimizes the amount of leakage in the “off” state, which improves efficiency.

While FinFET underpins today’s bleeding-edge 10nm process chips, and should be sufficient for 7nm as well, the fun stops there. “Around 5nm, in order to keep the scaling and transistor working, we need to move to a different structure,” Hutcheson says. Enter IBM. Rather than FinFET’s vertical fin structure, the company—along with research partners GlobalFoundries and Samsung—has gone horizontal, layering silicon nanosheets in a way that effectively results in a fourth gate. A scan of IBM Research Alliance’s 5nm transistor, built using an industry-first process to stack silicon nanosheets as the device structure. IBM “You can imagine that FinFET is now turned sideways, and stacked on top of each other,” says Khare. For a sense of scale, in this architecture electrical signals pass through a switch that’s the width of two or three strands of DNA. “It’s a big development,” says Hutcheson. “If I can make the transistor smaller, I get more transistors in the same area, which means I get more compute power in the same area.” In this case, that number leaps from 20 billion transistors in a 7nm process to 30 billion on a 5nm process, fingernail-sized chip. IBM pegs the gains at either 40 percent better performance at the same power, or 75 percent reduction in power at the same efficiency. Just in Time The timing couldn’t be better. Actual processors built off of this new structure aren’t expected to hit the market until 2019 at the earliest. But that roughly lines up with industry estimates for broader adoption of everything from self-driving cars to 5G, innovations that can’t scale without a functional 5nm process in place. IBM Research scientist Nicolas Loubet holds a wafer of chips with 5nm silicon nanosheet transistors manufactured using an industry-first process that can deliver 40 percent performance enhancement at fixed power, or 75 percent power savings at matched performance. Connie Zhou “The world’s sitting on this stuff, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars. They’re all highly dependent on more efficient computing power. That only comes from this type of technology,” says Hutcheson. “Without this, we stop.” Take self-driving cars as a specific example. They may work well enough today, but they also require tens of thousands of dollars worth of chips to function, an impractical added cost for a mainstream product. A 5nm process drives those expenses way down. Think, too, of always-on IoT sensors that will collect constant streams of data in a 5G world. Or more practically, think of smartphones that can last two or three days on a charge rather than one, with roughly the same-sized battery. And that’s before you hit the categories that no one’s even thought of yet. “The economic value that Moore’s Law generates is unquestionable. That’s where innovations such as this one come into play, to extend scaling not by traditional ways but coming up with innovative structures,” says Khare. Widespread adoption of many of those technologies is still years away. And success in all of them will require a confluence of both technological and regulatory progress. At least when they get there, though, the tiny chips that make it all work will be right there waiting for them. #chips #IBM #processors #transistors Most Popular TV Westworld's Creators Know Why Sci-Fi Is So DystopianAuthor: Maria LokkeMaria Lokke Architecture Apple's Architect Says the Future of Offices Must Be FlexibleAuthor: Elizabeth StinsonElizabeth Stinson Internet of Things Andy Rubin Has a Plan to Smarten Up the Connected HomeAuthor: David PierceDavid PierceMore Stories View Comments Sponsored StoriesPowered By Outbrain Zachary Karabell A Laptop Ban Leaves Everyone Scared and No One Safer Nitasha Tiku Digital Privacy Is Making Antitrust Exciting Again Nitasha Tiku The Gospel of Hard Work, According to Silicon Valley Cade Metz Google Is Already Late to China's AI Revolution Klint Finley Diversity in Open Source Is Even Worse Than in Tech Overall Issie Lapowsky Even Without Paris, Business Will Leave Trump Behind on Climate Change More business Genetics Crispr May Cure All Genetic Disease—One DayAuthor: Megan MolteniMegan Molteni Healthcare Google’s AI Eye Doctor Gets Ready to Go to Work in IndiaAuthor: Tom SimoniteTom Simonite money The Day Will Come When Your Credit Card Will DisappearAuthor: Klint FinleyKlint Finley WIRED Business Conference How Google Copes When Even It Can't Afford Enough GearAuthor: Klint FinleyKlint Finley Security Hacking Online Hate Means Talking to the Humans Behind ItAuthor: Emily DreyfussEmily Dreyfuss Education In a Fake Fact Era, Schools Teach the ABCs of News LiteracyAuthor: Issie LapowskyIssie Lapowsky We RecommendPowered By Outbrain Klint Finley The New Chrome and Safari Will Reshape the Web Kayla LaCour Women Engineers On the Rampant Sexism of Silicon Valley Issie Lapowsky Trump's Twitter Blocking May Violate First Amendment Klint Finley The End of Net Neutrality Could Shackle the Internet of Things Tom Simonite Apple Just Joined Tech's Great Race to Democratize AI Get Our Newsletter WIRED's biggest stories, delivered to your inbox. submit Login Subscribe Advertise Site Map Press Center FAQ Customer Care Contact Us Securedrop T-Shirt Collection Newsletter Wired Staff Jobs RSS CNMN Collection Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our user agreement (effective 3/21/12) and privacy policy (effective 3/21/12).
