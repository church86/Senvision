By Liam Tung | September 15, 2016 -- 11:32 GMT (04:32 PDT) | Topic: Hardware As well as a gold finish option, the XPS 13 comes with either a QHD touch display with a Core i7 or the FHD display with Core i5. Image: Dell Dell has refreshed its popular XPS 13 laptop with Intel's seventh-generation Core processors. The update brings a longer battery life, among other improvements, and a new rose-gold option for those who want a change from the usual silver. The move brings Dell's XPS 13 in line with other hardware carrying Intel's new chips, such as the recently-released Lenovo Yoga 910. Tech Pro Research System Monitoring Policy Going old school with tape backup Leaders share software-defined networking's benefits, obstacles, favored vendors TechRepublic's Depreciation Calculator Shipping with Windows 10, the XPS 13 will be available with either a QHD+ touch display with the latest Core i7 processor or the FHD display with a new Core i5 processor. Dell says the QHD+ model's battery will last up to 13 hours, while the FHD model will last up to 22 hours, thanks to a larger 60Wh battery. They also feature Dell's super-thin bezels, which it calls the InfinityEdge Display. Dell is touting two configurations, the FHD model with 8GB RAM, 256GB solid-state storage, and Intel's seventh generation i5 Core processors, as well as the QHD+ model with the same RAM and storage configurations but with Intel's latest Core i7 processor. Dell is also releasing an updated Developer Edition of the XPS 13 that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Its predecessor, the 2016 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, is Linux creator Linus Torvalds' preferred laptop for programming and rated by ZDNet's open-source expert Steven J Vaughan-Nichols as the best laptop for serious programmers. ZDNet has contacted Dell's Europe office for more details and pricing. However, according to The Verge, the updated XPS 13 will also be available with Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 options, as well as 4G, 8GB, and 16GB memory options. Buyers will also be able choose 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB SSD. According to Dell, the XPS 13 and XPS 13 Developer Edition will be available from October 4, starting at $799 and $949 respectively. However, buyers who want gold will pay gold prices. Those starting prices only apply to the standard silver option, while the new rose-gold models start at $1,149.

By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: September 16, 2016 at 2:53 pm | UPDATED: September 16, 2016 at 2:55 pm Top Of The Order: Oracle’s Balancing Act: As far as Oracle is concerned, “TGIF” should be re-christened as “TGIFO,” as in “Thank Goodness It’s Finally Over.” At least when it comes to the Oracle’s feelings about how investors reacted on Friday to the software giant’s latest earnings report. Oracle shares fell almost 5 percent to end the day at $38.92. It was the lowest closing point for Oracle’s stock in almost three months. There was really no surprise about why Oracle’s stock took such a hit. Investors didn’t like what they saw in the company’s fiscal first-quarter results, which came out late Thursday. For the quarter ended in August, Oracle earned $1.83 billion, or 43 cents a share, on revenue of $8.6 billion. During the same period a year ago, Oracle earned $1.75 billion, or 40 cents a share, on $8.45 billion. However, excluding one-time items, Oracle earned 55 cents a share, which fell short of the estimates of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who forecast Oracle to earn 58 cents a share on $8.7 billion in sales. Oracle has been putting more of its emphasis on cloud-based software and services so it can compete better with the likes of Salesforce.com and Workday. Oracle founder, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison also used a conference call late Thursday to say that Oracle’s “new data centers give us a significant cost and performance advantage over Amazon” and its web services business. But that didn’t matter for much in the minds of investors. Revenue from cloud computing climbed 59 percent from a year, but hardware sales fell 12 percent, new software license revenue was down 11 percent and total software sales were flat with the same period a year ago. “Attaining the balance (with cloud and other sales) continues to be tricky,” said UBS analyst Brent Thill in a research note about Oracle’s results. “Progress (in its cloud business) is clear, encouraging, and largely incremental. (But) this continues to come with an inferior (profit) margin profile,” with regards to its traditional software business. Thill also questioned if the “real compression” on Oracle’s earnings is yet to come. A few more quarterly reports like Thursday’s will give some more evidence about Oracle’s earnings. At least on Friday, Oracle’s shareholders showed how compressed their sentiment about the company had become. Middle Innings:  Meanwhile, With Intel…: While Oracle let out a figurative sigh when the stock market closed Friday, Intel probably would have been happy if trading could go on all weekend. That’s because on Friday, before the stock market opened, Intel raised its business outlook for its fiscal third quarter. Intel said that it now expects sales in the three-month period to be between $15.3 billion and $15.9 billion, which is higher than the company’s earlier forecast for revenue between $14.4 billion and $15.4 billion. Intel said it raised its sales outlook primarily because of “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory,” and “the company is also seeing some signs of improving PC demand.” And demand for Intel’s stock was strong all day Friday. Early in the day, Intel’s shares touched $38.05, their highest point in 15 years. By the time the stock market closed, Intel’s shares had risen 3 percent to end the week at $37.67. What a concept. Good, old-fashioned PC sales getting better? Somebody must be doing some early Christmas shopping. Bottom Of The Lineup:  Here’s a look at how some other leading Silicon Valley stocks did Friday… Movin’ On Up: Gains came from Depomed, QuinStreet, GoPro, Aviat Networks and Twitter, which saw its shares climb more than 4 percent following its first live-stream of an NFL game on Thursday night. In The Red: Decliners included Synaptics, Extreme Networks, Nimble Storage, Ultra Tech and Super Micro Computer. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index shed 0.1 percent to close at 5,244.57. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0.5 percent to finish the week at 18,123.80. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to fall to 2,139.16.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Dell updates its popular XPS 13 notebook with Kaby Lake CPUs by Wayne Manion  3:01 PM on September 16, 2016 Dell has refreshed its competitor to Apple's Macbook (Air), the XPS 13 notebook. The updated model utilizes Intel's latest Kaby Lake silicon in place of Skylake chips. The existing XPS 13 can be optioned with Core i3, i5, and i7 CPUs. Core i3-7100U, i5-7200U, and i7-7500U Kaby Lake chips will be available when the updated XPS 13 begins shipping in the first week of October. All available CPUs in the existing and new models are dual-core, four-thread parts. Battery capacity increases from 56 watt-hours to 60 watt-hours, and CPU power consumption is reduced in Intel's latest and greatest laptop chips, leading to  an estimated 22-hour battery life. Both the old and the new XPS 13s are available with Dell's "InfinityEdge" narrow-bezel displays in standard 1080p or optional 3200x1800 resolutions. Don't plan on around-the-clock battery life with the upgraded panel, though. Unplugged runtime with the 1800p screen drops to a more pedestrian 13 hours. Dell did not describe the test methology used to obtain those figures. Wi-Fi snobs may lament a shift away from Intel Wi-Fi controllers towards solutions from Killer Networking. The Wi-Fi solution offers support for 802.11ac 2x2 MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1. Existing and new models include a single USB 3.1 Type-C Thunderbolt 3 port, PCIe solid state storage with up to 1TB capacity, and as much as 16GB of system memory. The memory type for the new model has not yet been specified, but Skylake models use DDR3 RAM. If the laptop's diminutive dimensions didn't tell you the machine is intended to lead Dell's charge against the Apple's Macbook, perhaps the silver, gold, and new rose gold chassis color options make it more obvious. The new machine will start at $799 when it ships on October 4. Expect prices of the upgraded i5 and i7 models to mirror their counterparts in the current generation: current i5 models start at $899, and high-end i7 models with the QHD+ display will require forking over just short of $2000. While nearly all XPS 13 machines will likely ship with some variation of Windows 10, a Developer Edition with Ubuntu 16.04 preinstalled will also be available.  Tags: Mobile computing Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

News & Analysis iPhone 7 Sports Intel, TSMC Rick Merritt 9/16/2016 02:20 PM EDT 4 comments NO RATINGS 2 saves Login to Rate Tweet SAN JOSE, Calif. — A teardown posted today confirmed Apple put Intel inside at least some of its iPhone 7 handsets, using the x86 giants baseband processors acquired from Infineon. The report said Apple used TSMC to make at least some of its A10 Fusion SoCs, probably using its InFO packaging process as well. Both Intel and TSMC were expected to win the sockets in the latest iPhones announced earlier this month. The teardowns confirm earlier reports of deals that represent millions of dollars of business to both companies, probably making Intel the third largest supplier of cellular baseband chips behind Qualcomm and Mediatek. iPhone 7 plus and 7, as seen on Apple.com. The first joint teardown from Chipworks and TechInsights found an Intel PMB9943 baseband processor believed to be the Intel XMM7360 modem inside an iPhone 7 Model A1778. It also found two Intel PMB5750s SMARTI 5 RF transceivers and an Intel PMB6826, otherwise called X-PMU 736. Interestingly, separate teardowns by iFixit of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models both found them using Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE Cat. 12 modems. The iFixit analysts use Chipworks to help ID chips they find. Chipworks speculated Apple might use Qualcomm chips in its iPhone 7 CDMA A1660. Qualcomm invented the technology behind the CDMA standard which Intels former Infineon group apparently does not support.

A look at the iPhone 7's innards confirms an intriguing rumor about the cellular modems powering Apple's latest handset: at least some of the modems are made by Intel, not Qualcomm. Chipworks added images of its iPhone 7 teardown to its blog this week, which show RF transceivers and a cellular transmitter made by Intel. More specifically, the Chipworks teardown appears to reveal an Intel XMM7360 modem, which would make the iPhone 7 capable of the 450Mbps LTE download speeds that Apple has promised. While Chipworks picked apart the iPhone 7 on sale in the US and Europe, rival teardown gurus at iFixit used a Japanese version, which has a Qualcomm modem instead. That modem is a category 12, which means it's theoretically capable of up to 600Mpbs LTE download speeds. Apple never reveals specifics about the guts of its iPhones, and keeps its modem technology especially secret. But these teardowns and others of previous iPhones make that an open secret; modems in recent iPhone models have mostly been sourced from Qualcomm. The fact that Apple is adding an Intel modem to the mix this time for phones sold in the US means that not all iPhone 7s will work with all American carriers. Apple's official spec sheet for the iPhone 7 lists two sets of units sold in the US. Models A1660 (iPhone 7) and A1661 (iPhone 7 Plus) work on all four major US networks and virtual networks like Ting, Ultra Mobile, and Consumer Cellular. Models A1778 (iPhone 7) and A1784 (iPhone 7 Plus) do not have CDMA modems and thus don't work on Verizon, Sprint, or any smaller carrier that uses those networks. //Related Articles If You Want to Switch Carriers, Buy Verizon's iPhone 7 In its teardown, iFixit also found that Apple applied lots of adhesive to the iPhone 7's edges, a lot more than in previous models. That likely helps the phone's water resistance: the iPhone 7 is the first Apple handset to be able to survive complete immersion in water. It is rated IP67, which means it should withstand immersion in three feet of water for up to 30 minutes without damage. Finally, the lack of the headphone jack makes room for hardware that powers the new "taptic" feedback home button, iFixit found. It uses haptic feedback to simulate a push, though the button itself is stationary. Back to top Previous : LG, Mediatek Break Qualcomm's Hold on Sprint With LG X Power...

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/FilesMore By Narottam Medhora REUTERS - Intel Corp raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period.

Brian Barrett Gear Date of Publication: 09.16.16. 09.16.16 Time of Publication: 2:23 pm. 2:23 pm Intel’s Chips Finally Find Their Way Into the iPhone Apple's Phil Schiller unveils the new iPhone 7 during an event in San Francisco, on September 7, 2016.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images The smartphone years have not been kind to Intel. The company ignored the transition to mobile early on, allowing ARM-based processors to take an early, decisive lead. Intel’s presence in pocket computers hasn’t just been minimal, it’s been practically nonexistent. That is, until the iPhone 7. Bloomberg first reported that Intel had worked out a deal with Apple in June, but now that the iPhone 7 has shipped, we have actual confirmation, thanks to a teardown from Chipworks. Apple may make its own processors now, but Intel’s providing an entire mobile cellular platform to the Cupertino company, the transceivers and modem that help put the “phone” in smartphone. For the first time, a flagship mobile device has Intel inside. Better late than never. Fashionably Late Intel’s made it into a handful of smartphones before, but this really is the first component placement at anything that could be considered serious scale. “Intel has been working eight, nine years for something like this to happen,” says Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy. “You have the premiere smartphone brand in Apple, who has incredibly high quality and experience metrics.” Being in the iPhone, in other words, isn’t important simply for sales. It gives Intel components Apple’s imprimatur, a potential signal to other companies that it’s ready to play in the big leagues. Inclusion in the iPhone 7 also, counterintuitively, highlights some of Intel’s drawbacks. Intel components won’t be in every model, in large part because they don’t support the CDMA networks deployed by Verizon and Sprint. Moorhead notes that they’re also not as future-proof as Qualcomm’s high-end equivalents: Intel’s guts don’t play nice with brand-new tech that will allow for faster download speeds, whenever carriers get around to leveling up. Since people are holding onto their devices longer than ever now, some iPhone 7 owners could potentially end up feeling left out. And however many iPhones Intel ends up in, it’s unlikely to impact the company’s bottom line much. That’s partly, Moorhead says, because Intel likely had to set a very competitive price to win Apple’s business. Mostly, though, it’s just a function of the company’s evolving business model. “Intel’s such a big company, with such high margins, particularly on the data center but also on the PC side, that I don’t see this making a material financial impact,” says Moorhead. Intel is, after all, a cloud company. It may have missed mobile, but it dominates in servers. That doesn’t mean that its iPhone win is just a moral victory. Its real importance? Setting Intel up for the next mobile revolution. Everybody 5G When Intel’s Aicha Evans took the stage at this year’s Mobile World Congress in February, she spent an hour focused not on current smartphone ambitions, but about a future cellular network standard: 5G. We could spend a few thousand words outlining 5G in detail, but the short version should work for now. Remember the transition from 3G to 4G, how the Internet on your phone was suddenly much, much faster? It was the difference between clacking up a roller coaster’s first incline and barreling down the other side. That’s what 5G will feel like next to 4G, with some smart home and wearables support thrown in as a bonus. Qualcomm won 4G, no question. It wasn’t even close. We’re still far enough from 5G cohering as an actual thing, though, that any of a handful of companies could position themselves as the dominant force of the next generation of mobile. One of those companies (surprise!) is Intel. “the big prize here is 5G,” says Moorhead. “But if you’re not successful in 4G, there’s no way for you to be successful in 5G.” Intel can talk all it wants about its prominent role in the future of mobile, but it’ll have a lot harder time actualizing that if it can’t prove it can handle the present. If someone can’t make a layup, you wouldn’t bet on them to dunk. Intel declined to comment on its role in the new iPhone. Because of course it did. If you want everyone to think you’re a winner, you act like you’ve been there before. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. 5G Intel iPhone Mobile smartphones Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News.

The Apple-designed A10 Fusion chip is “incredibly thin,” Chipworks has discovered, thanks to TSMC’s InFO packaging technique resulting in a thinner package. Perhaps more interesting than that, the AT&T and T-Mobile edition of the handset indeed comes with Intel’s LTE modem inside versus Qualcomm’s that powers cellular connectivity in other hardware versions of the device. What that means is that, because iPhone 7 models “A1778” and “A1784“ have an Intel modem inside which doesn’t support CDMA networks, these handsets cannot be used on Verizon and Sprint networks. Specifically, Intel supplied a pair of RF transceivers (SMARTI 5 built on TSMC’S 28-nanometer process), the baseband modem and the power management circuitry (the X-PMU 736, part of Intel’s XMM 7360 platform). “We see Intel’s baseband modem PMB9943 and suspect this is the rumored Intel XMM7360 modem,” says Chipworks. That’s in stark contrast to the iPhone 6s, which has a universal modem that supports most cellular networks. Qualcomm’s MDM9645M LTE Cat. 12 modem is present in all of the other carrier models of the iPhone 7 instead of Intel’s. As for the battery, the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 that Chipworks and TechInsights pried open has a 1,960 mAh, 3.8 V (7.45 Wh) battery that gives it two additional hours of performance compared with the iPhone 6 battery rated at 1,810 mAh, 6.9 Wh. In comparison, the exploding batteries in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 are 15.4 Wh, twice the size. The iPhone 7 Plus has a 2,900 mAh battery that lasts an hour longer than that in the iPhone 6s Plus, a slight upgrade over the 2,750 mAh cell in the iPhone 6s Plus and a step down from a 2,915 mAh (11.1 Wh) one in the iPhone 6 Plus. The firms have also confirmed that Apple’s A10 Fusion chip (part number APL1W24) in their unit was built by TSMC, confirming rumors that it’s being single-sourced from TSMC. MegaChips (formerly SiTime) supplied one of their MEMS clock circuitry commonly used in wearables and some game controllers. A10 Fusion in X-ray vision. The A10 Fusion package has a die size is of about 125 square millimeter and is “incredibly thin”, giving credibility to the reports that TSMC’s InFO packaging technique is being used. Similar to the low-power mobile DRAM in the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 uses package-on-package assembly which puts the A10 chip below 2GB of Samsung-built LPDDR4 RAM (the iPhone 7 Plus has 3 GB of RAM). “Looking at the X-rays we see the four dies are not stacked, but are spread out across the package,” which helps keep the overall package height to a minimum. The combination of package-on-package assembly and TSMC’s InFO packaging technique helps reduce total chip height significantly. They also found 128 GB of NAND flash (a 16-die stack of 128-Gb parts) with EMI shielding, fabricated in 15-nanometer process technology. Both SK Hynix and Toshiba have been identified as NAND flash suppliers for the new iPhones. A10 Fusion die shot. A Broadcom-provided GPS module (BCM47734) possibly contains Sensor Hub functionality that combines the GPS and sensors such as gyroscopes, barometers, accelerometers and others. Apple did confirm that the A10 Fusion has its own sensor hub. That said, if the Broadcom part used in the device does have a sensor hub “it may not be utilized here in the iPhone 7,” cautions Chipworks. There are also three audio amplifiers (two in the iPhone 6s): two to drive each of the two speakers while the third could be for the headphone via the Lightning port. On a somewhat related note, Tech Insights, Inc. and Chipworks have now combined their respective businesses to become a global leader in advanced semiconductor technology intelligence, analysis and reverse engineering.

Javiers Verizon service will always be better regardless of the phone. Alan Aurmont Not talking about service quality here, rather the versatility of Verizon iPhone. kinny james Yes, the Verizon phone is the way to go if you’ll want to use it on non-GSM networks. The Verizon model will work on both network types. The Att/T-mobile will only work on GSM out of the box. I’m not sure about getting it unlocked though. BTW T-mobile service is far superior than Verizon in NYC, so it’s all a matter of location and use. I get speeds that are way faster than Verizon. Leviscus Tempris Of the hardware does not physically support another network then I am afraid that the answer is that it would not be able to be unlocked:( n0ahcruz3 Nope because GSM>CDMA. And most countries uses GSM technology. Alan Aurmont Most Asia is CDMA. So, your “most countries” claim is inaccurate. n0ahcruz3 Name these “most Asia”. I know SK and japan uses CDMa. Im asian, do more research there’s google. Alan Aurmont How about the largest country in Asia called China? n0ahcruz3 GSm lol Agneev Mukherjee Reliance was the last CDMA operator in India; two months back, they started upgrading CDMA customers to 4G compulsorily… I had one of em’ CDMA phones with an integrated SIM card, which couldn’t be removed. Jose Rivera The Verizon variant has always been my favorite because they’re all factory unlocked and support both network types… A huge plus for them… Fede777 What’s the reason they went with 2 different modems, instead of a universal one? Christian Zibreg Well, for starters, they gain advantage in supply chain negotiations by having multiple suppliers for a component. I’d say that’s part of a broader move to Intel LTE modems across all iPhone models in the future. The ultimate goal, I suspect: eventually embed the baseband modem itself with any supporting logic into the A-series chips to save space and optimize power consumption Fede777 I get that, but when the 6 launched they were all about “world phone”, well not anymore. Christian Zibreg That’s the limitation of the Intel chip. My guess is that Apple would have surely used a universal Intel modem if they provided it. Rowan09 But CDMA is not really a world standard GSM is, so I don’t believe this will be an issue. Christian Zibreg Actually, these are world phones. From the FAQ section on Apple’s Buy iPhone 7 webpage: Can I use an iPhone when traveling internationally? All iPhone models are world phones, so you can use them almost anywhere. Whether you are a GSM or CDMA network customer, you can roam internationally on GSM networks in over 200 countries around the world. Availability of LTE data varies in some countries and depends on carrier support for certain LTE radio frequencies. Contact your wireless carrier for more information regarding international roaming policies and rates. Imad Ghandour The battery capacity you listed for the for the iPhone 6s is wrong it belongs to the iPhone 6 Christian Zibreg fixed, thanks Imad Ghandour Anytime Dao Sasone My question is when will the unlocked version comes to market Christian Zibreg Usually takes a few weeks or months… Shinonuke Aww too bad – From 6s T mobile   Search Connect with iDownloadBlog Facebook Become a fan RSS Get the latest news YouTube Watch Us Twitter Stay up to date Newsletter News delivered to you Google+ Add us to your circle   The most recent headlines Early MacBook Pro adopters confused by misidentified graphics in System Profiler Twitter for iPhone and iPad gains support for rich notifications on iOS 10 Teardown confirms both 13″ and 15″ Touch Bar MacBook Pros have non-removable SSDs Google revamps Play Newsstand, adds For You recommendations, rich media, web app & more Apple launches worldwide “Touch Disease” repair program for iPhone 6 Plus   The latest jailbreak news Jailbreak tweaks of the week: EmojiSuggest, PasswordRecovery, & more… EmojiSuggest brings iOS 10-like emoji suggestions to the predictive keyboard WiJoin lets you know what Wi-Fi network you’re connected to PasswordRecovery stores passwords and recovers them when you forget them NCTextColor lets you add vibrancy to Notification Center iDownloadBlog           iDownloadblog.com About About Advertise Contact Keep in Touch Twitter Facebook RSS Feed Newsletter Push Notifications Podcasts Let's Talk iOS Let's Talk Jailbreak Site Stuff Disclosure Privacy Policy   Copyright iDownloadBlog 2016.

Source: stargazer2020 via Flickr This is not something anyone holding INTC is used to. After all, the chipmaker hasn’t hiked a quarterly forecasts in more than two years. The reasons for the improved outlook were also a nice break from the norm. PC sales were not as bad as INTC expected. A 15-year high for Intel stock is kind of remarkable considering how much trouble it faces, at least on a strategic basis. It was already stressed by a world that’s ditching PCs for mobile devices. That there’s no question that desktop computers are in secular decline should have been enough. Now it has to compete in the cloud business as well. INTC is making every effort to pivot away from the PC supply chain toward more relevant markets. But it’s like turning a cruise liner in choppy seas. As a result, the market’s faith in Intel stock ebbs and flows. It’s been essentially range-bound for two years. The Top 10 S&P 500 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now Perhaps this latest bit of good news can serve as the catalyst that fuels a breakout. As under-confident as the market may be on Intel stock, shares are now up 9% after Friday’s pop. That beats the S&P 500 — which it has trailed all year long — by about 5 percentage points. INTC’s Revised Outlook Is Not a Complete Surprise That’s not bad at all as long as the market doesn’t get carried away with this change in guidance. Intel said at the end of the second quarter that it saw improvement in the PC business. Market researchers also seeing better-than-expected shipments of PCs in Q2. Theoretically, at least, some of today’s move should have already been priced into Intel stock. Still, there’s nothing quite like putting it on the board. The company now sees Q3 revenue in a range of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion. The prior forecast stood at $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion. Analysts on average were looking for the top line to hit $14.9 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. It looks like Intel dispensed with any downside risk to sales when it reports next month. That’s worth something but be careful of getting too high on the news. Intel said its improved prospects are partially due to the need to replenish inventory in the PC supply chain. That’s a cyclical phenomenon. As much as INTC wants to become less reliant on PCs, it still still derives the majority of its revenue from that business. Intel stock certainly deserves a higher premium from higher guidance, but the mid-day gain of 2.5% may be all it warrants. It’s also important to keep in mind that Intel didn’t touch its earnings forecast despite the improved outlook for revenue. INTC is a blue-chip stock with a decent dividend when investors are strapped for yield. It isn’t particularly expensive either. However, today’s move is probably sufficient to price in the update. It will have to follow up today’s news with something even better when it drops quarterly earnings in October. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Hardware  ⋮  Leak Intel 2016-2018 Roadmap Reveals 14nm Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake Processors By Hassan Mujtaba Posted 2 months ago 80Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel's 14nm+ is the most advanced process architecture available in the industry. Intel’s latest 2016-2018 roadmap detailing the next generation processors for mobility platform has been leaked out. Slides pertaining the Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and Cannonlake processors were leaked out by the community forums at Anandtech. A lot of juicy details and specific time points for theses processors have been detailed in the roadmap. Intel 2016-2018 Roadmap Leaks Out – Details Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and Cannonlake Processors We have already learnt that Intel has faced delays with their process node roadmap which led them to delay specific lineups. Intel has also upgraded their Tick Tock strategy to PAO (Process-Architecture-Optimization) leading to a three year cadence. This allows Intel’s to implement further optimizations and architectural improvements to their existing process nodes rather than moving to a new process every two years. Intel is offering consumers three four different product lines based on 14nm. These include Broadwell, Skylake, the upcoming Kaby Lake and 2017’s Coffee Lake. Intel’s 14nm Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake and 10nm Cannonlake CPU roadmap leaks out. (Image Credits: Anandtech Forums) All four processor lines are based on the 14nm process which has been updated significantly to offer technical edge over competitors. With Skylake launched, eyes are now on Kaby Lake which was recently introduced on mobility platforms. Kaby Lake-Y and Kaby Lake-U series has already been launched. So let’s take a detailed look. Kaby Lake 2016-2017 Roadmap Intel Kaby Lake processors are based on 14nm process node. These processors feature a refined architecture that has received much of of its DNA base from Skylake. The Kaby Lake-Y (Core M) series is offered in 4.5W SOC designs with GT2 level graphics chips The Kaby Lake-U series have also been introduced and come in 15W and 28W design with the latter available with GT3e graphics chips. The “e” denoting the embedded DRAM cache. Kaby Lake-H is designed for high-performance notebooks and comes in 45W package. These aren’t full SOC designs and don’t do anything beyond GT2 graphics but are Quad core designs with good performance at hand. Cannonlake 2017-2018 Roadmap The Cannonlake processors would be Intel’s first architecture designed on the 10nm node. Available in Q4 2017, these chips will first be aimed at ultra low-TDP and ultra-low power platforms. The Cannonlake-Y series would feature 5.2W TDP, a slight increase over current 14nm processors. The Cannonlake-U series will also hit market during the same time and feature 15W SKUs. Both series will come in BGA package with the PCH embedded on the die itself, fulfilling the SOC standards. The chips will also include GT2 graphics. The architecture would be updated and 10nm would allow for faster clocks to be set on these chips for increased graphics performance. Advertisement Coffee Lake 2018 Roadmap Coffee Lake is an intermediate solution that’s designed to compensate the yields of Intel’s 10nm process for the mission-crucial market. Coffee Lake will be offered only on H and U series chips.. The Coffee Lake U-Series will be available in Q2 2018 in quad core designs with GT3e graphics chips. The Coffee Lake-H series are the true performance parts featuring up to 6 cores. A range of new and modern devices will feature Intel’s latest 14nm and 10nm processors. (Image Credits: Anandtech Forums) This will be the first time Intel would up the core count of their mainstream mobility processors. Available only in hexa-core models, the Coffee Lake-H series will feature 45W TDP along with GT2 graphics chips. It is expected that Intel would also launch desktop series based on the Coffee Lake architecture for their mainstream family, bringing the same high-core variants to gaming PCs. The Desktop Kaby Lake Family Detailed – Announcement Expected at CES 2017 On the desktop front, Intel has plans to announce their Kaby Lake desktop family at CES 2017. Benchlife posted a slide detailing the launch schedule of 200-series chipset which falls in Q4 2016 but mentions that Intel plans to push it back to CES 2017. The launch will include several desktop SKUs along with Z270, H270 and H110 chip sets. Board partners of Intel will be showcasing and promoting a range of new products before and during CES. 7th Gen Core processors are manufactured on silicon wafers at Intel production facilities. New 7th Gen Core processors deliver richer experiences, incredible performance and responsiveness, and true ultra HD 4K entertainment in stunning new devices. The Kaby Lake processors in general would be getting increased core performance (expect the usual 5-10% improvement) unless Intel plans to do something very different with Kaby Lake which seems highly unlikely. The processors will retain the basic features such for enthusiasts such as enhanced full range BCLK overclocking and 95W “Unlocked” options to choose from. Intel 200-series chipset roadmap leaks out at Benchlife. The 200-Series PCH is a crucial update for the upcoming family of processors as it will allow support for them. The Intel 200-series PCH will include several SKUs such as Z270, H270, Q270, Q250 and B250. While the new chipset doesn’t include any major changes over the Skylake PCH, it does include support for Intel Optane technology which utilizes Intel’s 3D XPoint memory to deliver high-performance SSDs and memory solutions. The KBL-PCH will be able to support Mansion Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4), Brighton Beach (Optane SSD PCIe/NVMe Gen3 x4) and Stony Beach (Optane Memory PCIe/NVMe Gen 3 x2 (m.2)) solutions.

Some models of the new phone have Intel inside. (AP photo) Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 16, 2016 at 7:20 AM, updated September 22, 2016 at 6:51 AM comments Intel is back in the iPhone. The iPhone 7 went on sale Friday and tech whizzes immediately went to work dissecting it to see what's inside. And, as widely expected, some models of the new phone include modems from Intel. That's a big win for the world's largest chipmaker, which has been shut out of the iPhone and most other smartphones after famously arriving late to the mobile computing market. The Canadian engineering firm Chipworks took apart an iPhone 7 and found an Intel modem, a power management chip and two transceivers. Apple's new iPhone comes in two flavors, one for AT&T and T-Mobile and another for other wireless carriers that use the CDMA wireless standard. Intel's technology is apparently only inside the first category of iPhone; a teardown of another iPhone by the repair company iFixit found Qualcomm modems. Early models of the iPhone included modems from the wireless division of German chipmaker Infineon, but Apple switched to Qualcomm soon after Intel bought that business in 2010. Adding Intel to the mix gives Apple a second supplier for key components in its phones, providing Apple pricing leverage and a backup in case one of the suppliers is unwilling or unable to meet demand. Intel boosts sales forecast The modem is just a component, not the microprocessor at the heart of the iPhone 7. Apple designs those itself, using templates licensed from Intel rival ARM Holdings. But Intel has worked for years to get a foothold in the world's most popular smartphone, so its presence in the iPhone 7 marks a milestone and a potential opening to do more. Wireless chipmaker Qorvo also has two chips inside the new iPhone, components manufactured in Hillsboro. The company and its predecessor, TriQuint Semiconductor, have contributed to each of the last several generations of iPhone. Apple keeps its list of suppliers to itself and generally prohibits them from discussing their work with Apple. So investors, rivals and others have to wait until Apple actually releases its new device to determine exactly what components will be in each. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway Inside Silicon Forest About Mike Rogoway Email Mike Rogoway Follow @rogoway Most Read Active Discussions About Us About OregonLive.com Advertise with us Contact the newsroom Frequently Asked Questions Join our team Our Journalists Contact Subscriber Services Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Travel Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Clark County Gresham Portland Washington County More Local News Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Forums Videos Photos Interact with us Weather Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sitemap & search Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 Oregon Live LLC.

Both the Chipworks/TechInsights team and iFixit have completed their respective initial teardowns of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, tearing part some of the first phones to go on sale. These teardowns are preliminary – there’s a lot of work left to do in deciphering the many cryptic identification numbers of the various components – but right off the bat it confirms a few things about each of the phones. We’ll start off with the Chipworks teardown of an iPhone 7, which they have already earnestly begun identifying chips on. One of their immediate findings is that for the first time in a while, Apple is using a non-Qualcomm modem. On Chipworks’ GSM phone, they have found an Intel baseband processor with the model number PMB9943. They believe this to be part of Intel’s XMM 7360 modem, which was announced back in 2015. The XMM 7360 is a high-end LTE Advanced modem design that offers up to Category 10 performance (450 Mbps down). This is achieved in part through the use of 3x carrier aggregation, which allows the modem to use up to 60Mhz of wireless spectrum. The modem does not support CDMA, and as the iFixit team has turned up a Qualcomm Snapdragon X12 (Cat 12) modem in their unit, Apple is clearly using modems from multiple vendors. It’s not clear how this breakdown works – if Apple is using the Qualcomm modem in some GSM phones as well – but at a minimum the Qualcomm modem will have to be in all of the CDMA-capable models. Meanwhile for Intel’s modem group, this is a significant win, as the company has not seen too many high-profile device wins in recent years. Though historically speaking, this is actually something of a return to form. The original iPhone used a modem from the group’s predecessor, Infineon’s wireless unit, whom Intel purchased in 2010. Moving on, we have of course the A10 Fusion SoC. Chipworks has yet to get a die shot in, but they have already confirmed that the SoC is produced by TSMC. This is presumably another 16nm FinFET SoC, but the Chipworks team will be working to confirm that. So far there is no evidence to indicate that Apple is dual-sourcing SoCs on the iPhone 7 like they did the iPhone 6s, but this is again preliminary information. Given that Apple doesn’t get a major new manufacturing process to use this generation, I had been wondering if and how Apple would instead compromise on die size, and we now have a rough answer. Chipworks estimates the A10 die to be roughly 125mm2 in size. This is 20.5mm2 (~20%) larger than the A9 TSMC die. The good news for Apple is that yields should be much better in 2016 than they were in 2015, so chip manufacturing costs should be down, helping to offset the higher costs of the larger chip. And while there are ways to improve performance without increasing the die size, any kind of significant improvement would have to entail a larger die, which is exactly what we’re seeing here. If nothing else, Apple would need more room for the new high-efficiency CPU cores the chip packs in. Speaking of packing, Chipworks’ teardown also hints that the A10 may have been packaged using TSMC’s new Integrated Fan Out (InFO) technique, which is meant to allow for thinner chip packages. InFO saves space, in part, by eliminating the organic substrate that logic dies have traditionally been mounted on. Lastly with the A10, Chipworks’ teardown of their iPhone 7 confirms that it has 2GB of RAM, specifically Samsung LPDDR4. Besides confirming that the memory capacity on the iPhone 7 hasn’t increased versus the iPhone 6s, this is notable because iFixit has found something different with their iPhone 7 Plus. In the case of the larger phone, there is 3GB of RAM. Apple has never before equipped the Plus with more memory than the base model, so this is a first. And while there has always been some performance stratification between the two phones due to the Plus model’s larger size – allowing better heat dissipation, and therefore slightly better performance – I wonder if this means we’re going to see an increase in the stratification between the two phone models. If nothing else, I suspect this comes as a consequence of the Plus’s higher resolution screen: all other factors being held equal, the Plus needs a bit more RAM for its larger GPU frame buffers. Update: The Chipworks crew has their die shot and floor plan back, so let's take a look. As Apple already disclosed the number of GPU clusters, there's not a whole lot left to doubt in terms of basic construction.The GPU cores, SRAM caches, and the performance CPU cores are all easy enough to find, with the latter block now about 16mm2, versus 13mm2 in the A9. The big question here is where the two smaller, high-efficiency cores are. Chipworks postulates three thories: 1) They're in the same block as the high performance cores (and hence labeled as a quad core CPU), they're to the left of the die, or they're to the bottom left of the die. It is likely - but not guaranteed - that they're close to the high-performance cores. However both alternative locations do have pairs of identical blocks, which is what you'd be looking for in a secondary set of CPU cores. So although those options are less likely, without additional information it's difficult to rule out those options entirely. Finally, one interesting aspect of the Chipworks report is that they unexpectedly found a third audio amplifier. Chipworks was expecting to find two – one for each of the speakers – but came up with a third. The firm believes that the third amp may be for headphones, which in turn would mean that Apple has significantly revised the Lightning port specification for the iPhone 7. Previously Lightning has only carried digital audio, which doesn’t require an amp in the phone itself. In the initial iPhone 7 announcement I had speculated that Apple put the DAC (and amp) inside their 3.5mm adapter – which would be consistent with how Lightning has worked over the last 4 years – but this casts doubt on that idea. If Apple has revised the specification to allow analog audio over the port, then this greatly simplifies how headphones and adapters will work. But it also would raise a number of questions about peripheral compatibility, especially what happens if you plug something like the Lightning EarPods into an older device like the iPhone 5s. On that note, the Chipworks and iFixit teardowns also show us what’s gone in the place of the now-absent headphone jack: Apple has placed a taptic engine (linear actuator) for the solid state home button, and an unusual plastic bumper. Wrapping things up, Chipworks’ reports that they already have the A10 SoC in their lab for further work, including confirming the manufacturing process and, of course, a die shot. The latter should prove to be very interesting, as it will be the first look we get at Apple’s new high-efficiency CPU cores. And in the meantime on our end we also have our iPhone samples in-house, so we’re diligently working on putting together a review for later this month. So be sure to stay tuned for that.

POST A COMMENT 96 Comments View All Comments Synomenon - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Interested to see whether the 7 and 7 Plus have the same camera sensor for the main camera. There were people posting before that the 7 had a slightly larger sensor for its camera than the 7 Plus. Reply Samus - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Also interesting about the DAC for the lightning port. Makes me feel a little different about the whole 3.5mm jack being removed, but still kind of turned off none the less. I use square to take credit cards for my business, a digital 3.5mm thermometer when I travel, and occasionally a micro boom 3.5mm microphone when recording video of my daughter playing hockey, etc. I guess the revised lightning port to emulate a 3.5mm jack explains why all these accessories, at least according to square and some other manufactures, continue to work even with the adapter, because the adapter isn't really emulating anything it's just bringing the signal down from the port... Reply thope - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link looks like lightning port was highly programmable. just tried with 5C and audio dongle. On IOS 9 i get and error saying accessory not supported and in iOS 10 it works. I have compared the sound and it seems identical on both the jack and the adapter. Reply Constructor - Saturday, September 17, 2016 - link And that is why it needs to contain a DAC in the adapter. It could not work with the old devices otherwise, which have always required peripheral DACs for Lightning audio. And, wouldn't you know, Cirrus has just the exactly matching special chip for precisely this purpose, namely interfacing with Lightning on one side and headphones on the other (it's also almost certainly built into the Lightning earbuds): http://www.cirrus.com/en/applications/app/detail/A... Reply Constructor - Saturday, September 17, 2016 - link So when will anybody finally crack their Lightning adapter open to check? iFixit hasn't bothered, which is a severe omission. Reply londedoganet - Tuesday, September 20, 2016 - link Good news: A Vietnamese site known for its iPhone leaks has torn one apart. Spoiler: There's a DAC from Cirrus Logic inside the adapter, exactly as you said, because of course there was, and everyone else theorizing about secret changes to the Lightning specification was just being silly. Link: http://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/20/lightning-earp... Reply Constructor - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link Well, at least very speculative... But it was an interesting theory nevertheless! Reply thope - Monday, September 19, 2016 - link You are forgetting that lightning headphones always worked with iPhone 5/5c. If the adapter had a dac it would not matter if the software was iOS 9/10. I am convinced that lightning port always had the capability to send analog audio. I am sure the cable has apples authentication chip to inform the phone of what accessory is connected. Also, Given the size of the adapter it is highly unlikely that there is a dac in there. Also, there is still a cirrus headphone amp/dac present onboard. I have the audeze sine cipher cable and it has an active dac. The remote part itself is much bigger that the dongle. Reply Constructor - Wednesday, September 21, 2016 - link It just has to be a new kind of device with special driver needs even while it's similar to existing ones in order to require an iOS upgrade, and it looks as if it's just that. Reply HunterKlynn - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Phil Schiller explicitly said they're identical, so I'd be surprised if they're not.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | September 16, 2016 -- 13:54 GMT (06:54 PDT) | Topic: PCs Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, California. iStock Demand for PCs has been stagnant at best, but Intel thinks a turnaround is on the horizon. What's Hot on ZDNet Nothing good is free: How Linux and open source companies make money Could Trump be the catalyst for an all-American iPhone? Women's share of Microsoft jobs falls again, so it's tying top pay to diversity Britain has passed the 'most extreme surveillance law ever passed in a democracy' The chipmaker on Friday raised its third quarter revenue outlook, saying the increase was "primarily driven by replenishment of PC supply chain inventory." Intel says it's also seeing "some signs of improving PC demand." Intel now expects Q3 revenue of $15.6 billion, up from the previously guided $14.9 billion. Expenses from research and development and mergers and acquisitions are projected to be $5.2 billion, an increase of $100 million from the prior expectation. Intel also shifted its gains and losses, saying it now expects a Q3 net loss of approximately $125 million, up from the previous forecast of $75 million. Despite its newfound PC optimism, most of Intel's investments as of late have been focused on enterprise infrastructure. Earlier this year the tech giant announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs -- or nearly 11 percent of its workforce -- as part of a major restructure prompted by the decline in PC sales and other hardware. At the time, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said he believed Intel could transform from a PC company to "a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices" by focusing on technology for connected things, memory, connectivity, Moore's Law, and cloud. Last quarter, however, revenue across Intel's key business units was relatively weak, including in its data center group and Internet of Things (IoT) group. The data center group had revenue of $4 billion, up 1 percent sequentially and up 5 percent year-over-year. Intel's IoT group posted revenue of $572 million, down 12 percent sequentially and up just 2 percent year-over-year.

In this piece Ken Stewart, Chief Wireless Technologist, Mobile Communications Group, Intel Fellow at Intel Corporation makes the case for NB-IoT. The 5G era is upon us. An era where every person, thing, and use case will be enabled with both seamless connectivity and massive computing power for the very first time, transforming the way we interact with our world. In her recent blog titled “The 5G Era: The Machines are Coming,” VP of Intel’s Communication and Devices Group, Aicha Evans, noted that “Today’s mobile world was built for smartphones with voice and data in mind. In tomorrow’s world, nothing is mobile because everything is mobile.” Likewise, in tomorrow’s world, a device will no longer be just a device, but rather one of billions of nodes, communicating via an intelligent network that surrounds us. Any “thing” connected will be a gateway to a virtually unlimited range of new capabilities and experiences, powered by rapid and ubiquitous access to the cloud. From self-driving cars, drones and robots, to wearable devices, to sensors embedded in virtually everything—by 2020 more than 50 billion connected devices will be in use, making our homes, our cities, and our lives richer and smarter. As we speed toward 2020, we must start to connect “things” now, allowing them to become greater than the sum of their parts. Narrowband IoT (NB-IOT) is the the pacesetting radio technology standardised by the 3GPP standards body, which delivers Low Power Wide Area access (LPWA) to a new generation of connected things in the race to 5G. With NB-IOT, the future starts now. Leading operators and equipment manufacturers are already showcasing real world demonstration of the technology. NB-IOT offers important technical benefits that will accelerate 5G innovation. It is a core technology necessary to meet the cost, battery life, and wide area coverage required of massive IoT. With spectrum in limited supply, 5G mobile networks must become more agile—delivering the right amount of data, at the right rate, over the right air interface, within the right area, to the right device, in the most efficient way possible. Supporting the aggressive goals of 5G will require tapping into new licensed bands and exploring new ways to use new and existing unlicensed spectrum bands to meet data demands. NB-IOT allows small form factor devices and sensors to connect efficiently to licensed spectrum of narrow bandwidth (180 kHz), mitigating growing network load in the valuable and scarce cellular bands, while also improving network capacity and spectrum efficiency. It also allows manufacturers and carriers to substantially reuse existing network and device technologies—deploying within a legacy LTE carrier, in the guard band, or stand-alone. Another advantage of NB-IOT is that it also supports deep indoor and wide area coverage (with a coverage extension of 10-20dB over existing technologies), with low device complexity and power consumption. These are important factors to consider when planning for rural as well as urban sensor-based applications. Smart devices accessing the network via NB-IOT are expected to launch in late 2016/2017 with a battery life of more than 10 years. Why does all of this matter? NB-IOT eases entry for a variety of new products and use cases. Mobile operators can embrace emerging devices and technologies, creating new lines of revenue without stressing their network resources to the point of degrading the quality of traditional services. Manufacturers can develop solutions at massive scale for consumer, agricultural, industrial, metropolitan and governmental applications at affordable price points, speeding adoption. Equally importantly, NB-IOT provides insight on what the “things of the future” will be, what they will do, and how they will shape our lives—while also helping us chart the path forward. And it gives the industry the time it needs to figure out the standards and technologies that will comprise the multi-faceted 5G “network of all networks.” Tags: featured, Intel, IOT, NB IoT Mobile Networks / IoT and M2M Smart IoT Internet of Things World Leave a comment Cancel reply Connect with: -or- Log in with your Telecoms.com account Alternatively, post a comment by completing the form below: Your email address will not be published.

At present, however, Intel still gets the largest share of its revenue from PC chips. Last quarter, its revenue from the "client" device business that includes PCs declined 3% from the year-earlier period.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, Intel has slashed head count to adjust to weaker sales growth and free up cash to invest in newer businesses.  Intel is set to report earnings for the September quarter on Oct. 18.  Write to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period.

As The Matrix’s Agent Smith put it to an overweening police lieutenant, "your men are already dead." We may be experiencing such a moment in the tech industry today, thanks to Apple’s exceptional new A10 Fusion chip, which threatens to devour a big chunk of Intel’s heretofore imperious silicon army. Now, before you accuse me of being high on my own metaphorical supply, I’m not saying that Intel will be crippled or surpassed anytime soon. But I am arguing that the chip giant is under a substantial threat, the likes of which it hasn’t faced for a long time, maybe ever. A quick look at the Geekbench scores attained by the iPhone 7 quantifies a staggering achievement: the single-core performance of Apple’s latest generation of smartphone processors has basically caught up with Intel’s laptops CPUs. The A10 chip inside the iPhone 7 comfortably outpaces its predecessors and Android rivals, and even outdoes a wide catalog of relatively recent Mac computers (including the not-so-recent Mac Pro). The iPhone’s notoriously hard to benchmark against anything else and this is just one metric, but it’s illustrative of Apple’s accelerating momentum and mobile focus. @gruber Grain of salt and all, but Geekbench has the iPhone 7 beating the $6500 12-core Mac Pro in single-thread. pic.twitter.com/DFQoULZ15G — Matt Mariska (@MattMariska) September 15, 2016 Intel has for many years been the undisputed champion of desktop and laptop processors running the x86 instruction set. Its sole competitor, AMD, hasn’t actually been competitive since around the turn of the century, and we have the Wintel portmanteau reminding us of the enduring dominance of Intel’s chips and Microsoft’s Windows OS in the years since. But many things have changed since the days of comparing AMD’s Thunderbird against Intel’s Pentium. The first thing — the one we’re all aware of, but never really adequately conscious of — is that the whole world is moving to mobile computing. This isn’t some slow transition off on the distant horizon like AI, it’s a thing happening right now. Advertisers are shifting their spending from desktop to mobile faster than they are pulling it out of print media, and people are buying smartphones at five times the rate that they’re acquiring new PCs. IDC’s 2015 figures show 1.43 billion smartphones shipped versus 276 million PCs. Apple by itself shipped more iPhones (74.8 million) in the last quarter of last year than the entire PC industry (71.9 million) managed to ship PCs. The predominant form of computing is already mobile It’s already the case, by sheer force of numbers, that Apple’s A series of mobile processors are at least as important and market-leading as Intel’s vast portfolio of x86 chips. But the present pseudo-equilibrium between them is being drastically upset by Apple’s leap in performance with the new A10 Fusion. By straying into the performance waters previously reserved for Intel’s laptop CPUs, Apple is teasing us with the question of why not inject the A10 (or its successors) into actual laptops? Why shouldn’t the next MacBook run on the same chip as the current iPhone? Granted, the MacBook’s macOS is based on x86 whereas the A chips all use the ARM architecture, but then an equally interesting question might be whether Apple shouldn’t just bite the bullet and make iOS its universal operating system. I think we’re past the point where ARM chips in Apple consumer desktops make sense. The only Q now is OS to run on it - shouldn’t be macOS — Steve T-S (@stroughtonsmith) September 16, 2016 It sounds wild, but the A10 looks to have the power and efficiency to handle the workload of a full PC. This coalescence of mobile and desktop PCs is driven by forces on both sides: mobile chips are getting more potent at the same time as our power needs are shrinking and our tasks become more mobile. If you think your workplace isn’t changing much because there are a bunch of weathered Dell workstations sitting next to frumpy HP printers, consider just how much more work every one of your officemates is doing outside the office, on their phone. And all those grand and power-hungry x86 applications that might have kept people running macOS — Adobe’s Photoshop and Lightroom being two key examples — well, they’re being ported to iOS in almost their full functionality, having been incentivized by the existence of Apple’s iPad Pro line, last year’s harbinger for this year’s performance jump. Unlike Windows, whose x86 reliance is tied to its dominance of the lucrative PC gaming market, Apple really has very few anchors locking it down to macOS. The Cupertino company has been investing the vast majority of its development time into the mobile iOS for years now, and that shows in the different rates of progress between its two pieces of software. macOS is, in many ways, legacy software just waiting for the right moment to be deprecated. It’s getting a fresh lick of paint now and then, but most of its novelties now relate to how it links back to Apple’s core iOS and iPhone business. Intel will continue to dominate the high end, but that market is small and shrinking It’s difficult for those of my generation — people who grew up with the beige PC box as a cultish object of desire and the symbol of cutting-edge computing — to understand just how divorced the modern world and population have become from the desktop PC. The desktop today is akin to what mainframes were in the past: an imposing, burring, gargantuan construction that you only resort to when you really need to get some heavy work done. There will always be room for Intel’s dominance to persist. As workloads increase in size and complexity, the opportunities to turn them into parallel tasks improve, and that’s where machines like the 12-core Mac Pro will handily outdo the iPhone 7. Of course. You can also strap massive graphics cards and massive amounts of RAM onto a tower PC, and you won’t have to worry about limitations of storage either. But the market for such high-end power is small and shrinking. Our video production needs today are better characterized by Snapchat Live Stories than Adobe Premiere Pro. It is simply a matter of time Intel already let Apple down once with the original MacBook’s underpowered Core M processor, and the absence of an Intel Skylake upgrade for either the MacBook Pro or Air this year also seems to have been caused by Apple’s dissatisfaction with Intel’s CPUs. There is nothing that Apple would like to do more than rid itself of its reliance on Intel, which would eliminate such unforeseen hiccups in the future. Apple is famous for its vertical integration, owning and controlling every possible aspect of its supply and production chain, and switching to its own processor chips across all devices would be the next logical improvement in that integration. If you want to develop the next great processor, you’d better be going mobile first and building from there. Intel’s decades of futile attempts to shrink desktop chips into mobile devices have shown how not to do things. Now Apple’s persistent and apparently accelerating performance improvement with the A series suggests it might have found the right path through. It’s fitting that this new chip is called A10 Fusion, because the path it’s leading us on will eventually lead to the merging of what we now consider two distinct classes of mobile and desktop PCs.

ARB_ES3_2_compatibility Turned On For Intel Broadwell And Newer Written by Michael Larabel in Intel on 16 September 2016 at 07:01 AM EDT. 7 Comments The Intel Mesa OpenGL driver now exposes the ARB_ES3_2_compatibility extension. The Intel i965 Mesa DRI driver has already supported the necessary extensions for OpenGL ES 3.2 support while this ARB_ES3_2_compatibility extension signifies that features found in GLES 3.2 but missing from OpenGL 4.5 are present in the desktop GL driver. This extension makes it easier for bringing mobile OpenGL ES programs to the desktop. So with a straight-forward commit, the extension is now flipped on for Intel hardware of the Broadwell "Gen 8" era and newer. The Intel OpenGL driver still isn't officially exposing OpenGL 4.5 support (although the necessary extensions are complete) until some final test-cases are resolved. The Nouveau NVC0 and RadeonSI Gallium3D drivers remain a few extensions short of GL 4.4 and GL 4.5. These Gallium3D drivers also are several extensions out from OpenGL ES 3.2 compliance. 7 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus teardown confirms bigger battery, Intel LTE modem in some models and more Apple iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones went on sale today in over 25 countries. As usual, folks at iFixit have already managed to grab a iPhone 7 Plus from Japan and have given at a teardown treatment. Even though they are yet to teardown the iPhone 7, teardown by research firm Chipworks reveals all the internals that Apple doesn’t mention in the spec sheet. The main thing these teardowns confirm is the presence of Intel’s LTE modem in some units. iFixit’s iPhone 7 Plus unit from Japan has the model number A1785 and supports CDMA networks. It has Qualcomm MDM9645M LTE Cat. 12 Modem that offers download speed of up to 450 Mbps, compared to Qualcomm MDM9635M LTE Cat. 6 modem in the iPhone 6 and 6s Plus phones. The iPhone 7 Plus from Chipworks is U.S. unit with the model number A1778 and support for GSM networks. This has PMB9943 modem, two PMB5750 transceivers and the PMB6826 power management IC, so this could have Intel XMM7360 modem, as rumored. Apple already confirmed through the official site that models A1778 and A1784 do not support CDMA networks used by Verizon and Sprint. It is not still not clear if all the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus CDMA models will use Qualcomm chips and others without CDMA support will use Intel chip. We will find out if someone does a teardown of A1660 and A1661 models of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, respectively. Both the phones have Apple A10 Fusion (APL1W24) SoC and the space below the display that had 3.5mm audio jack is now replaced by Taptic Engine for the new pressure-sensitive Home button. The iPhone 7 has Samsung 2GB LPDDR4 RAM (K3RG1G10CM) memory and Toshiba 128 GB NAND Flash (THGBX6T0T8LLFXE) storage. It has 1960 mAh battery, compared to 1715mAh battery in the iPhone 6s and 1810mAh  battery in the iPhone 6. The iPhone 7 Plus has Samsung 3GB LPDDR4 RAM (K3RG4G40MM-YGCH) and Toshiba 128 GB NAND Flash (THGBX6T0T8LLFXF). It has 2,900 mAh battery, compared to 2,750 mAh battery in the iPhone 6s Plus and it is slightly smaller than the 2915mAh battery in the iPhone 6 Plus. These phones have IP67 ratings for water resistance, so these have strong adhesive to offer better water resistance, including rubber gasket for lightning port, capable of holding back a 50 meter column of water.

The new notebooks keep the chassis and display panel options, but sport faster CPUs, speedier memory, a Killer 1535 802.11ac WiFi card, as well as a higher-capacity battery. Dell plans to offer new XPS 13 notebooks in rose gold, gold and silver colors starting from October 4, 2016. Since Intel’s 7th generation Core i-series Kaby Lake-U processors are drop-in compatible with platforms supporting the Skylake-U chips, the new Dell XPS 13 uses exactly the same chassis as the Dell XPS 13 introduced a year ago and based on the previous-gen CPUs. That means, we are talking about systems made of machined aluminum and carbon fiber, which are 9 – 15 mm thick and weigh 1.2 – 1.29 kilograms. Display panels of the XPS 13 also remained the same: users can choose between a QHD+ (3200×1800) panel and an FHD (1920×1080) panel with or without touch support. Meanwhile, the new 7th generation Intel Core CPUs run at higher frequencies s compared to their predecessors, feature considerably improved video encoding/decoding engine, refined graphics as well as Speed Shift v2 technology. As a result, the upgraded XPS 13 will deliver higher performance and better responsiveness at the same power than the predecessors. Otherwise, as with the past generation of systems, Dell is offering from 4GB to 16GB of LPDDR3-1866 memory. Yet another improvement of the upgraded Dell XPS 13 is Rivet Networks' Killer 1535 802.11 2×2 Wi-Fi + BT 4.1 controller that promises to add some useful features with the help of refined software. Finally, the 2016 XPS 13 also comes with a 60 Wh battery, up from 56 Wh battery on the previous-generation model. Dell claims that thanks to the new battery and power optimizations of the platform, the FHD version of the XPS 13 will work for up to 22 hours and the QHD+ machine will run for up to 13 hours on one charge.

Dell will begin to sell its XPS 13 in silver, gold and rose gold colors on October 4 starting at $799. Traditionally, the company will also offer XPS 13 Developer Edition based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS starting at $949.  Gallery: Dell Updates XPS 13: Intel’s Kaby Lake CPUs, DDR4-2133, Killer 802.11ac, New Battery Source: Dell Tweet PRINT THIS ARTICLE Post Your Comment Please log in or sign up to comment. POST A COMMENT 66 Comments View All Comments Senti - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link WHY would you replace Intel NIC with Killer?? How you even dare to call it "improvement"? Reply Byte - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link hurray for pegged CPU usage and memory leaks! Make use of that kaby lake power! Reply Brett Howse - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link They used a Broadcom one before. Reply Gray05 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Intel NICs were only in the Developer Editions. Reply ik9000 - Thursday, September 22, 2016 - link Not true, I got an XPS13 9350 with Intel 8260 wireless AC in a win10pro model. It also has an i7-6560U which has been omitted from the list above in the 2015 specs. It has IRIS 540 graphics and 48EU. Odd they don't mention it. Reply Flunk - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Funny story, a lot of people with the previous version replaced the stock Dell (broadcom really) Wi-Fi cards with Killer Wi-Fi cards. So I guess Dell has just decided to give people what they want. Reply KPOM - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link And here I thought "killer" was an adjective, as in "kick-ass." Reply TheinsanegamerN - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link So it's got a slightly larger battery and replaced there good wifi with sub par killer wifi. And again no iris graphics. Reply Cliff34 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link You will noticed that no ultra portable laptops ever comes w Iris Pro graphics. I do wish they do. Reply spikebike - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link The current skylake xps 13 has a Iris 540 option.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | September 15, 2016 -- 21:00 GMT (14:00 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Israeli pharmaceutical firm Teva is partnering with US chipmaker Intel to develop wearables and a machine-learning platform that can be used in the treatment of Huntington's Disease. What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows Huntington's is a genetic and typically fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes nerve cells in the brain to deteriorate. This leads to a host of behavioral and psychological problems, including involuntary writhing movements called chorea. Patients generally succumb to the disease within 15 to 25 years of the diagnosis. There is no cure for Huntington's, but Teva and Intel hope to spur the development of next-generation treatment options by better understanding the progression of the disease and how current treatments impact a patients' quality of life. The companies plan to accomplish this by combining Intel's capabilities in analytics and algorithms with Teva's work around Huntington's treatment and research. Specifically, patients will wear a smartwatch outfitted with sensors that will continuously measure their general functioning and movement. The data will feed into a cloud-based, machine-learning platform developed by Intel for analysis. The platform was first developed two years ago as part of a multi-phase partnership between Intel and The Michael J. Fox Foundation for use in Parkinson's disease research. In both cases, the aim is to detect patterns in participant data collected from wearables intended to monitor symptoms. "Patients generate data based on their day-to-day experiences that can help in improving disease management -- even something as simple as wearing a smart watch can add useful insight," said Jason Waxman, VP and GM of Intel's the Datacenter Solutions Group. "The complexity of analyzing these data streams requires a platform for machine learning, to help drive the pharmaceutical industry towards faster, better clinical trials, potentially leading to new treatments for patients." The study will start toward the end of the year and will take place in centers in the US and Canada.

By: Hana Levi Julian Published: September 15th, 2016 Facebook Twitter Telegram Google Reddit LinkedIn Printer-Ready Page Layout The Teva building in Jerusalem. Photo Credit: Yonatan Sindel / Flash 90 Teva Pharmaceuticals is teaming up with Intel to develop a wearable device that will monitor and analyze the symptoms of patients with Huntingdon’s disease. The joint project is, at this point, a Phase 2 study that is set to launch towards the end of this year at centers in the United States and Canada. It’s intended to better understand the progression of the illness and its impact on patients who suffer with Huntingdon’s, a fatal neurodegenerative disease. The new technology platform developed by Teva and Intel will involve use of a smartphone and a smartwatch with sensing technology that patients will wear to constantly measure their general function and movement. The information will be streamed to a cloud-based platform to then analyze the data. Huntington’s disease is characterized by uncoordinated and uncontrollable movements, and deterioration in one’s ability to think. It also causes behavioral and psychological problems, along with a gradual decline in motor control and mental stability. General life expectancy for a patient with Huntingdon’s disease is shorter than that of others, because of other life-threatening complications related to the disease, according to the Huntington’s Outreach Project for Education website at Stanford University. The disease is genetically passed from parent to child.

Dell's new XPS 13 now comes in a rose gold color. If you're concerned that your laptop isn't as small, thin, and stylish as your Apple iPhone, Dell is working to change that. The company announced today the latest iteration of its XPS 13 laptop, which retains the lean and mean profile of previous versions, but now uses Intel's new 7th Generation Core ("Kaby Lake") processors and comes in a new color: rose gold. If you're not a fan of the floral-metallic aesthetic, you can still opt for traditional silver, too. In either case, Dell claims that the all-aluminum XPS 13 is the "smallest 13-inch laptop on the planet," and boasts about it being 17 percent smaller than the 13-inch Apple MacBook Air. Dell gives the XPS 13's dimensions as 11.98 wide (making it a "13-inch laptop in an 11-inch form," per the company), 7.88 inches deep, and between 0.6 (closed) and 0.33 inches high (closed). It weighs between 2.7 and 2.9 pounds, depending on whether it's equipped with touch. A number of display options are available for the 13.3-inch In-Plane Switching (IPS) screen, all the way up to 3,200-by-1,800 resolution on the highest-end model. Touch displays are clad in Corning Gorilla Glass, and all have what Dell calls an "InfinityEdge" display that has only a 5.2mm bezel on the top, left, and right sides. //Related Articles The Best Laptops of 2016 Ports on the XPS 13 include USB-C with Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0 (with and without PowerShare), and headset, plus there's an SD card slot. The laptop can be configured with up to 16GB of memory and up to 1TB in solid-state storage, and it offers wireless connectivity through Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi via a Killer 1535 card that supports Multi-User Multi-Input Multi-Output (MU-MIMO) technology. Although there is no discrete video card option, the integrated HD Graphics 620 represents the state of the Intel art. Want even more flair? The chiclet-style keyboard is backlit. As for battery life, Dell says that the XPS 13's will be the longest of any laptop, at more than 22 hours, or 13 hours if all you're doing is streaming video from Netflix or browsing the Web with Microsoft Edge. That might seem hard to believe; in our tests, no system has come close to besting the 13-inch MacBook Air, which could hang on for 17 hours, 36 minutes, in our rundown test. But when you combine its svelte construction with the many power-saving features in Intel's Kaby Lake chips, it's a distinct possibility. Stay tuned for a full review. The silver version of the laptop will start at $799, and the rose gold version at $1,149. Feeling especially adventurous? A special Developer Edition loaded with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS starts at $949.

Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Sep 15, 2016 at 1:21PM Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) has rallied more than 20% this year on the belief that tighter DRAM and NAND (flash memory) supplies could boost memory prices across the market. But despite those positive catalysts, Micron sales and earnings growth remain weak. Revenue fell 25% year over year last quarter, compared to a 30% decline in the previous quarter and a 3% decline in the prior-year quarter. Image source: Micron. In the NAND market, Micron faces tough competition from larger rivals like Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) SanDisk. In the mobile DRAM market, it lags behind Samsung and SK Hynix. Analysts expect Micron's sales to fall 24% sales this year, compared to a 1% decline last year. Micron posted a non-GAAP net loss of $0.08 per share last quarter, compared to a loss of $0.05 in the previous quarter and a profit of $0.54 a year earlier. In addition to tough competition, Micron's bottom line has been dragged down by market oversupply, pricing pressures, and challenges from integrating the manufacturing processes of its combined Elpida and Micron fabs. Analysts expect Micron's annual earnings to merely break even at $0.00 this year, compared to a profit of $2.47 per share in 2015. Micron also isn't cheap at 49 times earnings, which is more than four times the average P/E of 11 for the memory chips industry. In my opinion, there are safer ways to play the rebound in memory prices than Micron. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Western Digital, for example, both offer better diversification with exposure to the same markets. Intel's a more diversified computing play Intel left the DRAM market in 1985 amid intense competition, but started jointly developing NAND chips with Micron in 2006. That partnership formed the foundation of Intel's non-volatile memory business, which generated 4% of its sales last quarter. Together, the two companies developed new memory technologies like 3D NAND and 3DXPoint, the latter of which could offer "1,000 times" the performance of current-gen NAND chips. A 3DXPoint wafer. Image source: Micron. Intel frequently highlights non-volatile memory alongside the Data Center, Internet of Things, and Programmable Solutions businesses as ways to diversify its top line beyond PCs. However, the ongoing decline in memory prices caused Intel's non-volatile memory chip revenue to fall 20% annually last quarter. The unit also posted an operating loss of $224 million, down from an operating profit of $92 million in the prior year quarter. Those gloomy figures mirror Micron's results, but Intel generates most of its revenue and operating income from its dominant Client Computing (PC and mobile solutions) and Data Center groups. The ongoing slowdown in PC sales caused Intel's Client Computing revenue to fall 3% annually last quarter, but that decline was partly offset by 5% growth in Data Center revenues. Rising memory prices won't boost Intel's sales as much as Micron's, but Intel offers investors more balanced growth than Micron. Analysts currently expect Intel's revenue to rise 4% this year while earnings are expected to improve 7%. Intel also trades at just 18 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies, and it pays a forward dividend yield of 2.9% -- while Micron has never paid a dividend. Western Digital's a more diversified NAND play Western Digital stock slid 14% this year due to sluggish sales of older HDDs (hard disk drives), which were being cannibalized by NAND-based SSDs (solid state drives). However, WD made a bold move and purchased SanDisk for $19 billion earlier this year. The purchase instantly made it the third largest NAND maker in the world with a 15% market share, according to DRAMeXchange's first quarter figures. Samsung leads the market with a 35% share, while Toshiba and Micron respectively control 22% and 13% of the market. While the massive acquisition will take time  to fully integrate, analysts expect the move to reduce WD's dependence on HDDs and get its sales growth back on track with 2% top line growth next year. SanDisk's Fusion ioMemory flash devices (L) and enterprise SSDs (R). Image source: SanDisk. WD's main HDD rival, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), hasn't made a meaningful purchase in the NAND space yet. Instead, it formed a multi-year strategic alliance with Micron to expand its presence in enterprise SSDs. That plan hasn't impressed analysts, who still expect Seagate's sales to slide 3% next year. To fund the SanDisk acquisition, WD suspended its buybacks, thus reducing its EPS growth. However, the company is still expected to post 44% earnings growth next year (as SanDisk becomes earnings accretive), which makes its forward P/E of 8 look very cheap. Moreover, WD pays a forward dividend yield of 3.9%, which is still easily supported by its FCF payout ratio of 33% over the past 12 months. Like Intel, WD is a cheap dividend play instead of an aggressive bet on memory prices rising, but its SanDisk unit will still benefit from that turnaround when it happens. The bottom line Micron would benefit much more than Intel or WD from rising memory prices, but it could also lose a lot more if that recovery is delayed. So with the market near all-time highs, I personally prefer buying cheap income-generating investments like Intel and WD over speculative turnaround plays like Micron.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) today announced a collaboration with Intel Corp. to develop a unique wearable device and machine learning platform for use in Huntington disease (HD). The platform will continuously monitor and analyze key symptoms that impact daily living, in an effort to better understand disease progression and improve treatment evaluation. Teva, working in collaboration with Intel, will deploy this novel technology platform for the first time in a sub-study within the ongoing Phase II Open-Pride HD Study. As part of this, patients will be asked to use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure their general functioning and movement. These data will be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform specifically developed by Intel to analyze data from wearable devices. Proprietary algorithms will then translate these data, in near real-time, into objective scores of motor symptom severity. The study will start towards the end of the year and will take place in centers in the US and Canada. This collaboration will leverage Intel's capabilities in analytics and algorithm development for movement detection, together with Teva's deep knowledge and experience in HD treatment and research. HD is a devastating illness that is desperate for treatment options, requiring innovative ways to continuously and remotely assess and quantify symptoms in a way that can provide meaningful and actionable feedback to doctors, patients and caregivers. Teva president Global R&D and CSO Dr. Michael Hayden said, "The aim of this important project is to provide continuous objective data on the impact of Huntington disease on the patient, and, by extension, a clear understanding of the impact of treatment on patients' quality of life. Current measurement of symptoms is largely based on observation when the patient sees the doctor. This technology now provides us with an opportunity to have continuous monitoring. This unique technology could complement future trials in HD." “Patients generate data based on their day-to-day experiences that can help in improving disease management even something as simple as wearing a smart watch can add useful insight,” said Jason Waxman, Corporate Vice President and General Manager of the Datacenter Solutions Group at Intel. “The complexity of analyzing these data streams requires a platform for machine learning, to help drive the pharmaceutical industry towards faster, better clinical trials, potentially leading to new treatments for patients.” This cloud-based solution for analyzing wearable device data is being developed using the open-source Intel Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP), a software platform optimized for performance and security to accelerate the creation of advanced analytics and machine learning solutions. Initial development was done in collaboration with The Michael J. Fox Foundation for use in Parkinson's disease research.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Computing Leaked roadmap claims Intel will bring six-core chips to mainstream PCs with upcoming Coffee Lake Leaked roadmap claims Intel will bring six-core chips to mainstream PCs with upcoming Coffee Lake By Joel Hruska on September 15, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment Ever since Intel launched the Core i7 back in 2008, it has pursued a fairly consistent core allocation and marketing system. Intel’s top-end mainstream parts are quad-cores with Hyper-Threading enabled, both on the desktop and the laptop. It’s been that way for nearly a decade, but if a leaked roadmap is accurate, that’s about to change. According to the roadmap, spotted by Overclock3D, Intel will introduce a new six-core processor as a top-end option in mobile when it refreshes its Cannon Lake 10nm chips with the second-generation Coffee Lake processors in 2018. The implication of this slide is that we won’t see Cannon Lake until about this time next year. Intel’s first generation 10nm process would continue to hold down the Y- and U-class product divisions, while Coffee Lake debuts in the 15-28W segment. It’s just the top-end chips that’ll get a six-core option, with TDPs from 35W-45W. There’s another slide from Overclock3D that claims to show things in a bit more detail. While we don’t have any details on the desktop side of things, Intel tends to keep its core counts fairly aligned between desktops and laptops. As we’ve discussed in our guide to Intel CPUs, desktop microprocessors have consistently followed the same pattern: Core i7 means quad-core + Hyper-Threading, Core i5’s are quad-core chips without HT, and Core i3 processors are dual-core with Hyper-Threading enabled. In mobile, the highest-end quad-cores also offer Hyper-Threading, but the lower-power Core i7 processors are all dual-core with HT enabled. Intel now offers a few Core i5’s without HT in mobile as well, but that’s a relatively recent development, and these are still 45W chips. What these slides imply is that Intel believes it can finally squeeze another two cores into its top-end 45W TDP bracket. These chips would target desktop replacements and mobile workstations, not conventional systems. And in all honesty, that’s probably where they should stay. The harsh truth is CPU performance simply isn’t improving very much or very quickly. DirectX 12 has proven to be a significant boost for AMD’s GPUs and CPUs in certain cases, but it hasn’t yet done much for Intel CPUs. The promise of DX12 is that it allows a CPU to take advantage of multi-threaded rendering much more efficiently — but if you stop and think about it, Intel CPUs have been the gold standard for conventional DirectX 11 workloads for a long time now. That means developers design scenes and games to be executed efficiently within the constraints DX11 put on Intel processors — and that, in turn, can limit the boost Intel chips see when using DirectX 12. Long term we expect to see better support for multi-threaded rendering and higher CPU core counts as developers begin using DirectX 12 more, but that may be a relatively slow transition. Major engines like Unreal will continue to support multiple APIs for some time into the future — DirectX 9’s feature set is still relevant to gaming today, and that API is nearly old enough to drive. Meanwhile, many consumer applications still top out, practically speaking, at just four threads. Some will see this roadmap as confirmation that Intel is reacting to AMD’s Zen, but we frankly doubt it. Zen is not expected to match Intel clock-for-clock and while we expect its power efficiency to be vastly better than anything AMD fielded with Bristol Ridge or Carrizo, it’s still going to take multiple product cycles to bring overall APU performance up to compete with Intel. While AMD intends to launch Zen APUs, it’s focusing on servers and the desktop market first — areas where it has much larger TDP ranges and can leverage core counts more effectively. Of course all of this is rumor at this point — take it all with a grain or ten of salt.

By Liam Tung | September 15, 2016 -- 11:32 GMT (04:32 PDT) | Topic: Hardware As well as a gold finish option, the XPS 13 comes with either a QHD touch display with a Core i7 or the FHD display with Core i5. Image: Dell Dell has refreshed its popular XPS 13 laptop with Intel's seventh-generation Core processors. The update brings a longer battery life, among other improvements, and a new rose-gold option for those who want a change from the usual silver. The move brings Dell's XPS 13 in line with other hardware carrying Intel's new chips, such as the recently-released Lenovo Yoga 910. Tech Pro Research System Monitoring Policy Going old school with tape backup Leaders share software-defined networking's benefits, obstacles, favored vendors TechRepublic's Depreciation Calculator Shipping with Windows 10, the XPS 13 will be available with either a QHD+ touch display with the latest Core i7 processor or the FHD display with a new Core i5 processor. Dell says the QHD+ model's battery will last up to 13 hours, while the FHD model will last up to 22 hours, thanks to a larger 60Wh battery. They also feature Dell's super-thin bezels, which it calls the InfinityEdge Display. Dell is touting two configurations, the FHD model with 8GB RAM, 256GB solid-state storage, and Intel's seventh generation i5 Core processors, as well as the QHD+ model with the same RAM and storage configurations but with Intel's latest Core i7 processor. Dell is also releasing an updated Developer Edition of the XPS 13 that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Its predecessor, the 2016 Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, is Linux creator Linus Torvalds' preferred laptop for programming and rated by ZDNet's open-source expert Steven J Vaughan-Nichols as the best laptop for serious programmers. ZDNet has contacted Dell's Europe office for more details and pricing. However, according to The Verge, the updated XPS 13 will also be available with Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 options, as well as 4G, 8GB, and 16GB memory options. Buyers will also be able choose 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB SSD. According to Dell, the XPS 13 and XPS 13 Developer Edition will be available from October 4, starting at $799 and $949 respectively. However, buyers who want gold will pay gold prices. Those starting prices only apply to the standard silver option, while the new rose-gold models start at $1,149.

Ashraf Eassa (TMFChipFool) Sep 14, 2016 at 6:25PM Image source: CEVA.  Once Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted key technical specs for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus on its website, it became clear that microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) was supplying a meaningful portion of the modems (with its XMM 7360 modem) that will go into these phones. Obviously, this is a win for Intel. Even if the revenue impact is limited, it serves as a validation of the company's significant multi-year investment in cellular modems. However, there is a company besides Intel that could enjoy a more substantial financial boost from this development: CEVA (NASDAQ:CEVA). What is CEVA, and how does it fit in here? CEVA designs digital signal processors that are used in a number of applications, including cellular modems. To be clear, CEVA is an intellectual property vendor, which means that it produces a design that another company takes and integrates into a chip. Companies like CEVA usually receive up-front licensing fees for their technology and subsequent royalty payments from sales of chips incorporating their technologies. With that in mind, it's important to note that cellular modems incorporate what are known as digital signal processors, or DSPs, to handle key processing tasks. Modems from Infineon Wireless (now Intel's wireless group) have historically used DSP cores from CEVA. In contrast, Qualcomm modems use in-house "Hexagon" DSP cores. When Infineon Wireless/Intel Mobile was kicked out of the iPhone several generations ago, CEVA lost a significant amount of smartphone DSP business. However, with Intel seemingly back in the iPhone in a significant way, royalties from CEVA's cellular baseband-related products should be poised to increase in the coming quarters. What kind of impact could CEVA enjoy? Last quarter, CEVA reported collecting royalties on 225 million units shipped by its partners, 191 million of which were related to cellular modems. The company's total royalty revenue during the quarter was $9.6 million. The average per-unit royalty, then, works out to $0.0427. If the upcoming iPhone product cycle see shipments of 120 million to 130 million units -- total unit volume is likely to be higher, but keep in mind that Apple is also selling the older iPhone 6s/6s Plus/SE which do not contain Intel modems and CEVA DSPs -- then CEVA could be looking at an additional $5.3 million in royalty revenue over that period. Considering that CEVA generated revenue of $59.5 million in its last fiscal year, the contribution to both the top and bottom lines should be significant. Furthermore, if Apple opts to use an Intel modem again in the successor to the iPhone 7 (something that seems likely but is hardly assured), and assuming that Intel continues to use CEVA DSPs (the successor to Intel's XMM 7360, the XMM 7480, indeed uses a CEVA DSP, according to CEVA itself), then CEVA could benefit not only from shipments of the next generation device but continued iPhone 7 volume once it becomes Apple's mid-range offering. A nice win for CEVA At the end of the day, Intel's success at Apple bodes well for CEVA's results in the near to medium term. If Intel proves that it can continue to win a place inside the iPhone year in and year out, and the company continues to employ CEVA technology, the longer term boost for CEVA could be significant as well.

Shares of the world’s largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 per cent to a more than 15-year high of US$38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company’s PC business declined 3 per cent to US$7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. Related ‘More pain to come’: As technology shifts, additional layoffs loom at tech companies Intel Corp scores major mobile win after securing chip deal for Apple Inc’s new iPhone: sources However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc, which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 per cent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were “not as dead as people were thinking.” Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. “We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors,” Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to US$42 from US$40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be US$15.6 billion, plus or minus US$300 million, compared with its prior forecast of US$14.9 billion, plus or minus US$500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting US$14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by US$2 to US$38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc were up about 1 per cent, while those of Micron Technology Inc and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 per cent at US$37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday’s close, the stock had risen 6.1 per cent this year, underperforming the 20.8 per cent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index during the period. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

Changes throughout) * Deutsche fine risk weighs on bank stocks * Oracle drops, Intel rises on contrasting forecasts * Quadruple witching day likely to lead to volatility * Indexes down: Dow 0.40 pct, S&P 0.47 pct, Nasdaq 0.27 pct By Yashaswini Swamynathan Sept 16 Wall Street was near session lows late on Friday morning as Oracle led a decline in tech stocks and financials came under pressure on the possibility that Deutsche Bank could face a $14 billion fine. The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche's U.S.-listed shares were down 9.2 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell 1.2 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.98 percent, the steepest among the 10 major S&P sectors. The KBW Bank index fell 1.25 percent, putting it on track for its biggest weekly decline since the Brexit vote in late June. Traders have all but ruled out the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting that starts next Tuesday. But, investors will carefully parse the Fed's comments on the recent sluggish economic data and its impact on when the central bank will eventually pull the trigger. At 10:57 a.m. ET (1457 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 72.62 points, or 0.4 percent, at 18,139.86. The S&P 500 was down 10.01 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,137.25. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.19 points, or 0.27 percent, at 5,235.50. Oracle dropped 3.9 percent and pulled down other technology stocks after the company issued a disappointing quarterly profit. Also weighing was a 0.5 percent drop in Apple, that was set to snap a four-day winning streak, as Asia gave the iPhone 7 a subdued welcome. Helping limit losses was Intel's 2.5 percent gain after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. The CBOE Market Volatility index was up 0.61 percent. The index, commonly called Wall Street's "fear gauge", has fallen only twice this week. Volatility was likely rise as investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration - a process known as quadruple witching. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,033 to 809. On the Nasdaq, 1,531 issues fell and 1,121 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 49 new highs and 27 new lows.

The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche's U.S.-listed shares were down 9 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell 1 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 1.01 percent, the biggest among the 10 major S&P sectors. The energy index was a close second, declining 0.94 percent as oil prices fell 2.2 percent on worries of oversupply. At 9:39 a.m. ET (1339 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 90.12 points, or 0.49 percent, at 18,122.36. The S&P 500 was down 10.13 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,137.13. All the benchmark's major sectors were lower. The Nasdaq Composite was down 14.61 points, or 0.28 percent, at 5,235.08. Helping the tech-heavy index was Intel's 3.14 percent gain after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. However, Oracle was a drag, dropping 2.72 percent to $39.75 after it issued a disappointing quarterly profit. Investors also await the Federal Reserve's meeting starting next Tuesday. While traders have very low expectations of an interest rate hike, investors will be keen for commentary on how the central bank views on the recent sluggish economic data. The data and contrasting comments from Fed officials on rate hikes have caused the markets to oscillate and volatility to spike in the past few days. "Like it has been before, Mr. Market gets it right in the long term but tends to over react in the short term, and that's what we have seen all this week," said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Volatility may rise again on as Friday, which marks the quadruple witching day when investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,980 to 685. On the Nasdaq, 1,452 issues fell and 830 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 13 new lows.

The House report “is so artlessly distorted that it would be amusing if it weren't such a serious act of bad faith,” said a tweet posted by the fugitive former NSA contractor, who then proceeded to offer “examples.” @Snowden Their report is so artlessly distorted that it would be amusing if it weren't such a serious act of bad faith. Let's take examples:— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 Snowden, who has been at an undisclosed location in Russia for the past three years, took umbrage at perceived attacks on his personal integrity, such as the assertion that he “claimed to have left Army basic training because of broken legs when in fact he washed out because of shin splints.” “Army held me for weeks in a special unit for convalescence before separation. I left on crutches. They don't do that for ‘shin splints,’” wrote the 33-year-old, who volunteered in 2004, saying he wanted to fight in Iraq. Snowden described as “amazing” the accusation that he had “doctored his performance evaluations and obtained new positions at NSA by exaggerating his resume and stealing the answers to an employment test,” likely by searching through data on his colleagues’ hard drives. “I reported an XSS (hacking) vulnerability in CIA annual review system,” explains Snowden. The claim I "doctored performance evaluations?" This one is amazing: I reported an XSS (hacking) vulnerability in CIA annual review system.— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 The report also claims that Snowden shared over 1.5 million files, the “vast majority” of which “have nothing to do with programs impacting individual privacy interests – they instead pertain to military, defense and intelligence programs of great interest to America’s adversaries.” It also states that this began to happen eight months before the 2013 Senate testimony from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, which purportedly prompted Snowden to go rogue, in disgust at his boss’s prevarication. @Snowden The claim I exfiltrated data for journos 8 months prior to Clapper? False. That was HEARTBEAT (see film), an approved data handler.— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 @Snowden HEARTBEAT, which seems to be the source of their 1.5m number, was explicited authorized by two levels of my management. I built it.— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 The whistleblower explains that the number of files and the date pertain to HEARTBEAT, a program Snowden says he “built” to handle data, which “was explicitly authorized by two levels of my management.” Read more House urges Obama not to pardon Snowden, claims he is ‘not a whistleblower’ “The committee seems to intentionally conflate my authorized government work with my unauthorized whistleblowing. Diminishes them,” tweeted Snowden, who says he no longer has private access to any of the documents he leaked. Snowden also contests the claim that “the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense and security committee publicly conceded that ‘Snowden did share intelligence’ with his government.” Snowden says that the politician in question, Franz Klintsevich, prefaced the statement with “Ya dumayu” (“I think”) and was merely expressing an opinion, which the former NSA employee says is “speculation presented as fact.” Snowden says that he “could go on,” but instead condemns the report outright, and urges people to watch the Oliver Stone film about his final months at the NSA, and his leak, which comes out this week. “Bottom line: after ‘two years of investigation,’ the American people deserve better. This report diminishes the committee,” tweeted Snowden. The report also painted him as a “serial exaggerator and fabricator” who decided to lash out against his colleagues following a “workplace spat,” after he was reprimanded multiple times and failed to pass yearly NSA tests, which he claimed were “rigged.” Snowden said his legitimate complaints were punished by superiors. @Snowden Claim: I reported a critical problem (software updates taking field sites offline) to senior management, and was reprimanded. True!— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016 Snowden has publicly asked for a full presidential pardon, in the past week, citing concern for ordinary spied-on Americans as his motive, but according to the House, his actions made him a "traitor." “The US Government has spent hundreds of millions of dollars and will eventually spend billions, to attempt to mitigate the damage Snowden caused,” said the authors, who have published a three-page summary of the classified document, which runs to 36 pages.

(NASDAQ: INTC) shares saw a handy gain to close out the week after the company raised guidance for its third quarter. This increase is primarily driven by replenishment of personal computer (PC) supply chain inventory. Intel is also seeing some signs of improving PC demand. The company now expects third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, give or take $300 million, versus the previous estimate of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters are calling for $0.66 in earnings per share (EPS) on $14.9 billion in revenue for the current quarter. Intel also forecast the midpoint of the third-quarter gross margin range at roughly 63%, which is up 1% from the same period last year, driven mostly by higher PC unit volume. Third-quarter research and development plus marketing, general and administrative spending is expected to be approximately $5.2 billion, up from the prior expectation of approximately $5.1 billion. Third-quarter gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income are expected to be a net loss of roughly $125 million, as compared to the prior expectation of a net loss of approximately $75 million. Keep in mind that just a few days ago Standard & Poor’s noted that there was more upside likely for the semiconductor sales, despite the large sector gains that have been seen. The firm said: Semiconductors were a driving force in upward revisions to Q3 and Q4 technology earnings estimates and the semiconductor stocks were rewarded (+11.5% since the start of July). From a valuation perspective, the semiconductors trade at a 33% discount to its ten year average despite the recent price appreciation. At a 15.1x price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) on a next-twelve-month basis, it is trading at a more attractive valuation than the technology sector, which has a P/E of 17.1x. We believe that several opportunities remain within technology and specifically semiconductors. Demand for semiconductors is normally a sign of economic growth. As the economy and consumer continues to improve, so should the business prospects (and the stocks of) for companies comprising this sub-industry. Excluding Friday’s move, Intel had outperformed the broad markets, with the stock up nearly 9% year to date. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock is up 27%. Shares of Intel were last seen up more than 5% for the week to $37.35. The consensus analyst price target is $37.97, and the 52-week trading range is $27.68 to $38.05.

The Santa Clara-based company said it now expects third quarter revenue of $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million. That’s up from a prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. Intel noted the change is mostly due to “replenishment of PC supply chain inventory” amid “some signs of improving PC demand.” From the press release: The company is forecasting the mid-point of the third-quarter GAAP gross margin range at 62 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, up 2 points versus the prior third-quarter GAAP outlook gross margin midpoint of 60 percent, driven mostly by higher PC unit volume. The midpoint of the third-quarter non-GAAP gross margin range is now forecasted at 63 percent, plus or minus a couple of points, up 1 point versus the prior third-quarter non-GAAP outlook gross margin midpoint of 62 percent. All other expectations have been withdrawn and guidance will be updated with the company’s third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 18. The world’s largest chipmaker, Intel has expanded its offerings in recent years amid the explosion of mobile platforms and tepid PC sales growth. The company now derives nearly half its revenues from non-computer processor businesses like cloud computing, security, Internet of Things, and more. Intel shares rose $1.02 (+2.79%) to $37.58 in Friday morning trading. INTC has now gained 9.42% year-to-date, versus a 4.49% rise in the S&P 500 during the same period.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu By Narottam Medhora Intel Corp (INTC.O) raised its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than two years as suppliers of parts used in personal computers replenish their inventory amid improving PC demand. Shares of the world's largest chipmaker rose as much as 4.1 percent to a more than 15-year high of $38.05 on Friday. Intel, which helped found the personal computer industry, has been struggling as tech users shift away from PCs to mobile phones for their computing needs. Sales in the company's PC business declined 3 percent to $7.3 billion in the latest quarter. The unit includes sales of chips for mobile phones and tablets. However, there have been signs PC demand may be recovering. HP Inc (HPQ.N), which houses the hardware business of the former Hewlett-Packard Co, said last month that revenue in its computer business rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter from the second as sales of notebooks improved. FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said commentary from Intel and HP suggested that PCs were "not as dead as people were thinking." Research firm IDC said in July global PC shipments fell less than expected in the second quarter, helped by strength in the United States. "We expect PC units to decline less than the high-single-digit decline consensus in 2017, driven by continued Windows 10 upgrades and accelerating SSD adoption, along with new form factors," Baird Equity Research analyst Tristan Gerra wrote, raising his price target to $42 from $40. Intel said on Friday it expected third-quarter revenue to be $15.6 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with its prior forecast of $14.9 billion, plus or minus $500 million. That implies the highest-ever quarterly revenue for Intel, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average were expecting $14.90 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the pre-announcement was a good first step to the PC story stabilizing at Intel, and raised his price target by $2 to $38. Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) were up about 1 percent, while those of Micron Technology Inc (MU.O) and HP were marginally higher. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel were up 2.6 percent at $37.53 in afternoon trading. Up to Thursday's close, the stock had risen 6.1 percent this year, underperforming the 20.8 percent gain in the broader Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX during the period.

It packs a slick metal and carbon fiber chassis, a beautiful near-bezel-free display, and more than enough battery life for everyday usage. Today, Dell has updated the XPS 13 for 2016 with all the latest hardware. The biggest upgrade to the new XPS 13 is, as you might expect, Intel's Kaby Lake processors. The XPS 13 will come in three variants, packing either the Core i3-7100U, Core i5-7200U, or Core i7-7500U depending on the price point. All of these CPUs are 15W low-power parts with respectable performance and efficiency gains over Skylake. With the upgrade to Kaby Lake and a slightly larger 60 Wh battery, the 2016 XPS 13 boasts up to 22 hours of battery life if you opt for the 1080p panel. As with previous models, the QHD+ variant comes with a significant battery penalty: Dell only claims 13 hours of life for the high-resolution model. The only other notable change is the switch from Intel and Dell wireless controllers to a solution from Killer. This is possibly due to issues that Dell experienced with the wireless cards in previous models of the XPS 13, as the feature set of the Killer solution – Wi-Fi ac with 2x2 MIMO and Bluetooth 4.1 – is identical to past models. Other key specs have remained the same on the XPS 13, including a single Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C port, up to 1 TB PCIe solid state drives, and up to 16 GB of memory. The new laptops will be available on October 4th starting at $799, in silver, gold, and a new rose gold color.

By Angelica Mari for Brazil Tech | September 16, 2016 -- 11:28 GMT (04:28 PDT) | Topic: CXO Intel has appointed Mauricio Ruiz as the new head of its Brazil operations as part of a corporate reorganization process. Ruiz replaces Colombian executive David González -- who held the position for two years and is now moving on to a different leadership role in a new venture within the company, in the United States. Read this Intel invests $50m in quantum computing effort Intel is the latest technology giant to invest in quantum computing research. Quantum computing, years away from commercialization, is supposed to be a huge leap forward. Read More The new head will be continuing the work carried out by Gonzalez around areas such as the development of an innovation ecosystem and will also reinforce a new positioning of Intel as an innovation agent for the local market. "We will continue focusing on stimulating the local ecosystem, its manufacturers, channels, and partners, and to ensure that advanced technologies reach the Brazilian market as quickly as possible," said Ruiz. "Even though we are experiencing a scenario that is a bit more challenging, local organizations continue to demand technology, local consumers have a proven appetite for innovation and disruption and we cannot forget our role in the debate about how technology can help solve local infrastructure problems," he adds.

Wccftech News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Announcement  ⋮  Mobile Dell XPS 13 Gets Updated to Run Kaby Lake Processors and Comes in Everybody’s Favorite Color By Omar Sohail Posted 2 months ago 37Shares Share Tweet Submit Intel Kaby Lake processors have appeared inside Dell’s XPS 13 refresh and guess what? In addition to sporting a new processor lineup, the notebook family is also available to purchase in everybody’s favorite color to talk about. Can you guess that color? You Can Choose Between a 1080p or a 4K Display for the XPS 13 Series and It Comes in the Rose Gold Model Too Rose Gold models are becoming quite popular and for the new XPS 13 series, you can choose between a 1080p display or a 4K panel. However, the outcome when it comes to battery life is going to be miles apart. According to Dell, the 1080p display variant will be able to deliver up 22 hours of battery life, while the 4K version will be able to deliver up to 13 hours of battery life. As a personal opinion, I’d honestly go for something that would provide me with a longer battery, especially when I am gone for long journeys, making the 1080p version the perfect addition. What’s more is that this version is going to be cheaper than the 4K display one, so more power to those who agree with me on purchasing the model that resonates a lower resolution. Both models come with a 13.3-inch display, so you can wonder now why we’re recommending you to purchase that variant. Dell also states that it turned to machined aluminum and carbon fiber to make the laptops durable, and it used Gorilla Glass to protect the screen. Coming to the internals, the new models come with Intel’s new-generation Kaby Lake CPUs, i5 and i7, which are paired with 8GB of RAM memory in the default configuration, but it can be upgraded to sport 16GB and 1TB of storage. The graphics card is Intel’s HD Graphics 650, which will give you a nominal performance boost. Advertisement The price of the base model will start from $799 in the United States for the entry-level model and $1,499 for the Rose Gold configuration. While you will not be able to purchase it right now, sales will begin on October 4. What did you think of the upgraded lineup? Tell us your thoughts right away.

The inherited condition causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in a gradual decline in motor control, cognition and mental stability. There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington’s, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis. Teva, with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington’s study, the Israeli company said on Thursday. Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement. The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity. The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare. The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions. Businesses such as Apple, Samsung Electronics and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products. Earlier this month, Sanofi and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc, announced a joint venture combining devices with services to improve diabetes care. In August, GlaxoSmithKline and Verily created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes. Sanofi also has a diabetes deal with Alphabet, while Biogen is working with the tech giant to study the progression of multiple sclerosis. Teva, last year, announced it would partner with IBM’s Watson Health.

The platform will monitor and analyze key symptoms that impact daily living to better understand disease progression and improve treatment evaluation, Teva, the world’s largest generic drug maker, said. Huntington is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by uncoordinated and uncontrollable movements, cognitive deterioration and behavioral and/or psychological problems. As part of a joint study, patients will be asked to use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that continuously measures their functioning and movement. These data will be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform developed by Intel to analyze data from wearable devices. Proprietary algorithms will then translate these data, in near real-time, into objective scores of motor symptom severity. The study will start towards the end of the year and will take place in centers in the U.S. and Canada. “Current measurement of symptoms is largely based on observation when the patient sees the doctor,” said Michael Hayden, president of Teva Global R&D. “This technology now provides us with an opportunity to have continuous monitoring.” Want to enjoy 'Zen' reading - with no ads and just the article?

SCOUT Pat Kinnison Imade Intel: How Does A Team Rebound? Robert Allen 09/15/2016 How does Oklahoma State rebound following last week's loss to Central Michigan? Former Cowboy Deion Imade believes this team will bounce back Saturday against Pittsburgh. From time to time we've had former Oklahoma State safety/linebacker and special teams captain Deion Imade to appear on Go Pokes either with projections or analysis. Deion works for an energy company but also is a sideline reporter and color analyst on high school games on television and radio. He is also working with former Oklahoma State quarterback and teammate Clint Chelf on a segment in the pregame show on the Cowboy Network called "From All Sides." We will now give Deion a special assignments seeking his insight as a recent former Cowboys player. We call it Imade Intel. This week he addresses how does a team react following a tough loss and what emotions have to be present to allow them to move on. You've heard the old coach's line, down't let a loss beat you twice. The Cowboys have a very good Pitt team coming in and they can't let Central Michigan help out Pitt. Pitt doesn't need any help. Imade Intel Let me start by saying this for all those who say, "hey, the Cowboys should've been destroying those guys and they should've never let it come down to the final seconds of the game." If you look across that field, that's still a Division I football team with an NFL-caliber quarterback. I’m not here to make excuses, but I am here to try to express to you how hard this game is, especially on this level, so any win is a good win. I say win because that's what Oklahoma State did last weekend. They won that game but the referees took the victory away from them. You're only guaranteed 12 opportunities in Division I football but you work year-round for those 12, so it just pains me to see those Cowboys get punished for the mistake of others. With that being said, it is time to move on. We all have faced adversity before – every person, every family, every team. Some are just more devastating than others. Although we don’t all face adversity that you can see over and over again on SportsCenter top plays. After you they turn off the TV and get over that, the real question is how do you react after you are struck by that adversity? Do you wither away, do you crumble or do you answer back? Does it make you stronger and bring you closer together as a team? Well that's the question these Cowboys are going to have to answer, and they are going to have to do it Saturday. All of us Oklahoma State fans and alumni are not used to seeing our Cowboys lose this early in the season. I remember my senior year in 2013 when we went to Morgantown, West Virginia and lost to a team that we were not supposed to lose to. We have all been told this, if you've been around this game long enough, “you can't leave anything to chance and you can't leave the game in the hands of the referees.” Well, that was definitely true that day in West Virginia, as it was last Saturday as well. That adversity was hard for our team to overcome. We did, though, with great leadership and a coaching staff and team that bought in, we did. That year we used that loss to motivate our team, not wanting to experience that sour taste of defeat again anytime soon. The practices were more intense, we figured out what we were doing wrong and put the right players in place to solve those problems. Mike Tyson once said “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face." Well the Cowboys just got sucker punched in the gut, but I have faith that they will come out of their corner swinging.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Location, Location, Location.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About November 18, 2016 The Surprising Story Of The First Microprocessors 16 Comments by: Jenny List September 15, 2016 If you maintain an interest in vintage computers, you may well know something of the early history of the microprocessor, how Intel’s 4-bit 4004, intended for a desktop calculator, was the first to be developed, and the follow-up 8008 was the first 8-bit device. We tend to like simple stories when it comes to history, and inventions like this are always conveniently packaged for posterity as one-off events. In fact the story of the development of the first microprocessors is a much more convoluted one than it might appear, with several different companies concurrently at the forefront of developments. A fascinating recent IEEE Spectrum piece from [Ken Shirriff] investigates this period in microprocessor design, and presents the surprising conclusion that Texas Instruments may deserve the crown of having created the first 8-bit device, dislodging the 8008 from its pedestal. The piece looks at the development of MOS integrated circuits for general purpose computing in the late 1960s, and the progression through a series of military and avionic, then mini- computers with ever smaller chip counts. Long-forgotten companies like Viatron, whose claim to fame is coining the word “microprocessor”, and Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC), whose Datapoint 2200 intelligent terminal was the seed for Intel’s 8008 architecture make an appearance. It was the Datapoint 2200 that lay at the root of TI’s claim for the first 8-bit microprocessor, both TI and Intel worked separately on processors to replace the 2200’s discrete chip processor. TI’s offering, the TMX1795, was completed months before the 8008, but in the event CTC rejected both chips and continued with its discrete architecture. Intel successfully commercialised the 8008 while the TI chip failed to find any customers, and the rest, as they say, is history. The IEEE Spectrum piece investigates this period in extremely interesting detail, and is well worth a read. We’ve covered the early Intel processors a few times in the past. We had an investigation of the 4004 internals, a Retro Challenge entry of a 4004 ROM emulator, and someone made a clock based on an 8008. 4004 die image: Intel Free Press [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons.

In school for EE we didn’t have any micro classes so all I learned about micros was programming the chip and learning how to do it the hard way. BTW it was a dog of a chip with all the address and data lines going through the same 8 lines so you had to capture the high level address then the low level address then the data. That made it very slow. Even though the chip was small the supporting chips were large. Report comment Reply Michael Black says: September 15, 2016 at 4:31 pm Did you splurge on the hardware to add a stack? At least, I thought it was the 8008 that had no internal stack, an article in an early issue if Byte showed how to add a small stack. Michael Report comment Reply DougL says: September 16, 2016 at 3:42 pm Gosh it was so long ago, but it did have a internal stack, Online it said “Seven-level push-down address call stack. Eight registers are actually used, with the top-most register being the PC.” Report comment Reply RoGeorge says: September 15, 2016 at 4:09 pm This is my INS4004J waiting for a great project. It is already waiting for 29 years now… :o) [IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/14ce4c3.jpg[/IMG] Report comment Reply RoGeorge says: September 15, 2016 at 4:12 pm Report comment Reply RW says: September 15, 2016 at 5:10 pm Damn, didn’t realize they came in that package. There is a nonzero possibility that I have one sitting in a box of junk somewhere, thinking it was some old 4000 series CMOS that I’ve never been big into using. Report comment Reply x says: September 15, 2016 at 4:23 pm Ahh the 8008. I helped debug code on one of those back in the late 70’s (?). Our memory board (4k bytes) was the size of a modern day laptop and was kept powered on 24/7 while debugging because the only way to reload it was via paper tape / teletype. The final debugged program image was then sent out of house and burned into a prom. Good memories.

I was unaware that they ever made iNtel-designed parts. Report comment Reply Sweeney says: September 16, 2016 at 4:28 pm In the early days of silicon chips a fab could start producing 100% rejects for no apparent reason, so anyone who wanted chips in volume insisted that there be at least one second source. AMD got their licence for x86 from starting out as an official second source for example. Report comment Reply Jac Goudsmit (@JacGoudsmit) says: September 16, 2016 at 8:37 pm MOS licensed their 6502 chips to a number of other manufacturers, which gave control away but made the chip more interesting for buyers. Apple would still be waiting for their 6502’s if they would have ordered them from MOS in 1977: Commodore (who owned MOS) was a direct competitor. Report comment Reply Pete Willard says: September 15, 2016 at 9:06 pm National Semiconductor was the only second source company for the Intel 4004. The company announced second-sourcing of 4004 family at the beginning of 1975, started shipping samples in December 1974 – January 1975, and full production started in May – June 1975. Report comment Reply Law says: September 16, 2016 at 12:14 pm I built the Mark 8 computer which used an Intel 8008. Had a 5-bit baudot teletype, a TV typewriter, and Dr Suding’s cassette interface. These were a good introduction to digital electronics, machine programming, and the peripherals, including the ever popular programming of serial data (AKA bit-banging). Report comment Reply Ben Thar says: September 19, 2016 at 10:38 am I’m glad to see Ken Shirriff’s detailed article. The evolution of the microprocessor from it’s calculator and terminal roots is a complicated story. Only in Intel’s corporate, loud, and constant re-telling of the story is Intel protrayed as the sole inventor. Hoff and Mazor deserve plenty of credit, but in Intel’s version, Faggin is all but written out the of the story…along with anybody else…at any other company. “History is written by the victors.” as the saying goes. Report comment Reply Daniel Delaureal says: September 19, 2016 at 5:46 pm Lordy, lordy, lordy, I worked for Data Point back in the day. They had a networking protocol called ARCnet way before ethernet ever got off the ground. The tech people begged upper management to license it out and beat ethernet to the punch, but of course…..The company was finally destroyed by Asher Edelman who raided the employees retirement fund and broke up the company.

SCOUT Jacob Phillips (© Chad Simmons) Jacob Phillips still major OU priority Bob Przybylo 09/15/2016 Intel returns with an update on Jacob Phillips, following OU visit. It wasn’t a huge visit weekend for Oklahoma with just two official visitors. But no doubt Nashville (Tenn.) East Literature Magnet inside linebacker Jacob Phillips will be one to monitor going forward. Phillips, a Scout 300 prospect, was back in Norman for the first time since a trip in the spring, and it’s clear everything went as well as expected. http://www.scout.com/player/194194-jacob-phillips?s=73 His trips are not done as Phillips continues one of the most ambitious official visit schedules anyone has ever seen with five consecutive weekends of visits, but OU has made its impression. Phillips is definitely a top target for OU and looks to be the same for Alabama and Notre Dame. The Sooners seem to have Phillips and Anthony Hines’ names circled as to who will be that final inside linebacker for the class. Here are Phillips’ impressions following another trip to Norman and the first look at the renovated stadium. How different was this visit compared to the one you took to OU in the spring? A lot different on this visit. I had a lot of fun just being around everyone down there. On my first visit it was a lot of touring and stuff like that but the players were around this time so that made it better. Who was your host and what was your favorite part of the weekend? Tay Evans and again, just hanging out with the players coaches and commits. Seeing how into the game the fans were was pretty good also. You’ve been pretty clear about saying you wanted to take all five visits and decide. But was there ever a point where you thought about ending it and committing right then and there? No sir. My family and I decided a while ago we were going to wait to take all of my officials so that I would have no regrets. A lot of OU commits and targets picked the Ohio State weekend for their visit so how did ULM become yours? Was it special to be among the first visitors to see the renovated stadium? I wanted to take my first five official visits the first five weeks of the season so it just landed on that date because they had to all fit in a back-to-back schedule. And it was pretty cool seeing the renovated stadium. They looked nice. How was the Sunday morning brunch with Bob Stoops? What kind of experience was that? His house was huge (laughs). Going and looking inside just kind of gives you a hunch that this is where he wants to live for the rest of his life, which is what you want to give you a mental security of a stable coaching staff. We had good conversation and my family enjoyed it. Almost halfway there. Has this process been too overwhelming for you to make visits on five consecutive weekends? No, it's going great. The visits are so fun all throughout the week. I think about the game on Friday and then my visit that weekend.   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Sooner Intel: Justin Broiles Scout 2017 Rankings Directory Sooners surge in second half Charles Walker NOT returning to OU Setting the stage: OU at West Virginia Sooners Illustrated Top Stories Sooner Intel: Calling on Calvin Intel returns with a look at OU's defensive line targets. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:55 AM Sooner Intel: Kamren Curl Intel returns with an update OU's most recent offer, Kamren Curl. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:51 AM Setting the stage: OU at West VirginiaFinal breakdown of OU-West Virginia. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:38 AM Five questions: West Virginia Breaking down West Virginia with Kevin Kinder. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 10:50 AM OU's Baker Mayfield delivering on promiseOU quarterback Baker Mayfield has delivered on his promise after Ohio State game. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedWednesday at 9:07 AM OU's road to CFP playoff a daunting one OU's road to the college football playoff is not a smooth road but not impossible. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 7:15 PM Sooners No. 9 in CFP rankingsOU is in the top 10 of the college football playoff rankings for the first time, coming in at No. 9. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 6:38 PM Breaking News Charles Walker NOT returning to OUDefensive lineman Charles Walker is not going to return to OU and will focus on the NFL Draft. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedTuesday at 4:57 PM Przybylo: OU bred for 'Championship November'OU keeps slowly rising up the rankings because Sooners know what 'Championship November' is all about. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedMonday at 7:19 AM Sooner Intel: Justin Broiles Intel returns with an update on OU commit Justin Broiles. by Bob Przybylo Sooners Illustrated8:47 AM Scout 2017 Rankings DirectoryThe Scout positional, state, regional, national and team rankings for the Class of 2017... by Brandon Huffman Scout Football7:00 AM Sooners surge in second halfSenior Jordan Woodard spurred the Sooners' second half surge in an 89-70 win vs. Tulane. by Bob Przybylo Sooners IllustratedYesterday at 7:13 PMLoad More NCAA Teams Forums Basketball BB Recruiting Football FB Recruiting JC Football NFL Teams Forums Fantasy News Free Agents Draft MLB Teams Forums News Top Prospects Scouting Home Handy Cooking Gardening Tailgater More Hunting Fishing Warrior Golf NBA High School Other App Membership Tickets FOX Sports Sign In Sign Up Back To Top Twitter Facebook Instagram RSS Feed About Advertisers Press Help Contact Privacy Policy Terms of Service Jobs © 2016 Scout.com All rights reserved Javascript must be enabled to view this page.

Financial terms for the Czech Republic-based firm were not disclosed. MK.20 uses a design pattern employed by AWS, Google Compute Cloud and Microsoft Azure to maintain their clouds. It tackles the problem of deploying and managing upgrades when using OpenStack as a micro service via Google’s Kubernetes. Mirantis in August announced a partnership with Google and Intel to run OpenStack as containers, orchestrated using the Kubernetes orchestration tool. It was an inversion of a dominant idea of having containers work well on OpenStack. TCP Cloud’s software lets you manage integration points, the lifecycle of services, and managing infrastructure as code. It deals with version control, with all code managed centrally, via GitHub, acting as a single source of truth. Alex Freedland, Mirantis chief executive, reckoned the big advantage of MK.20 is it saves OpenStack users the job of building such tooling themselves. “The guys in TCP Cloud were thinking of industrial scale from day one,” he told The Reg. “Today nothing like this has been productized.” Through its acquisition, MK.20 will be integrated with Mirantis’ Fuel software to deploy and manage OpenStack clouds and resources. Founded in 2011, Mirantis is emerging as a strong independent name in OpenStack. The firm has not just survived a period of consolidation, but has attracted venture support – $200m in four rounds. Freedland claimed Mirantis now employs 900 people and has a business run rate of nearly $100m. ® Sponsored: 10 Reasons LinuxONE is the best choice for Linux workloads Tips and corrections Post a comment Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) said on Thursday it was collaborating with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to develop a wearable technology platform to track the progression of disease in patients with Huntington's, a fatal degenerative disorder. The inherited condition causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, resulting in a gradual decline in motor control, cognition and mental stability. There are no approved drugs to alter the course of Huntington's, although there are medicines that help with symptoms. Patients typically succumb to the disease within 15‐25 years of diagnosis. Teva (TEVA.N), with Intel, will deploy the technology as part of an ongoing mid-stage Huntington's study, the Israeli company said on Thursday. Patients will use a smartphone and wear a smartwatch equipped with sensing technology that will continuously measure functioning and movement. The data from the devices will then be wirelessly streamed to a cloud-based platform, developed by Intel, that will translate it, in near real-time, into scores to assess motor symptom severity. The line between pharmaceuticals and technology is blurring as companies join forces to tackle chronic diseases using high-tech devices that combine biology, software and hardware. Accurate monitoring using wearables is expected to dovetail with a drive to offer so-called value-based healthcare. The aim is to prove that medicines can keep large groups of patients healthy, thereby improving their appeal to cost-conscious insurers. That gives drugmakers a major incentive to offer services that go beyond routine drug prescriptions. Businesses such as Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Alphabet, are all trying to find health-related applications for a new wave of wearable products. Earlier this month, Sanofi (SASY.PA) and Verily, the life sciences unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), announced a joint venture combining devices with services to improve diabetes care. In August, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) and Verily created a new company focused on fighting diseases by targeting electrical signals in the body, a novel field of medicine called bioelectronics. Verily is also working on development of a smart contact lens in partnership with Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NOVN.S) that has an embedded glucose sensor to help monitor diabetes. Sanofi (SASY.PA) also has a diabetes deal with Alphabet, while Biogen (BIIB.O) is working with the tech giant to study the progression of multiple sclerosis. Teva, last year, announced it would partner with IBM's (IBM.N) Watson Health.

Click Here To Start Your Free Trial Today A few weeks before the much-awaited release of "Mafia III," its publisher studio, 2k Games, has revealed the PC system requirements of the latest "Mafia" installment. As reported by the Game Spot, 2K released the system requirements in an artistic and goofy fashion. The image resembles an old school magazine poster, where the system requirements are listed on it. As "Mafia III" is expected to be an action-packed video game, it is pretty obvious that the game would have huge requirements. Particularly, the recommended graphics card for those using Nvidia product is the GTX 1060. For AMD graphics cards, 2K recommends a Radeon R9 290X. The minimum software and hardware requirements of the game are Windows 7 64-bit OS, Intel I5-2500K for Intel CPUs, AMD FX-8120 for AMD CPUs, 6 GB RAM, Radeon HD7870 for AMD GPUs, GeForce GTX 660 for Nvidia GPUs, 2 GB video card memory, and 50 GB free space on internal hard drive. Meanwhile, 2K Games recommends a higher quality of graphics and processing chipsets to maximize the "Mafia III" experience. For Intel CPUs, the recommended processor is I7-3770, AMD FX 8359 4.0 Ghz with 8 GB RAM for AMD chipsets, Radeon R9 290X for AMD GPUs, GeForce GTX 780 or GeForce GTX 1060 for Nvidia graphics cards, and video memory of 4 GB. The latest "Mafia" installment will be introducing new contents that are new to the franchise, especially that in this sequel, the players are given more freedom to choose their character's line of work. There are different ways for the players to explore the underground world of criminals, and they can freely decide on which path to take. "'Mafia III' introduces a truly open world, rich with its own criminal ecosystems to the franchise, while still upholding the strong narrative storytelling and immersive setting that the previous 'Mafia' games are known for," said by Hanger 13 head and creative director, Haden Blackman via Games Beat.

The original company, Bigfoot Networks, launched on FPGAs over a decade ago, with super large heatsinks (that are now collectors’ items), and were eventually purchased by Qualcomm. The technology was updated into custom ASICs, but a lack of investment meant the technology meant that the brand stagnated a little. After discussing with QC, a number of the original Bigfoot team have spun the brand back out into a new company, Rivet Networks, while retaining a strong partnership with Qualcomm. We've kept tabs on the company, and their mantra is one of promotion and evolution: today is the launch of their new E2500 network controller, with a new UI.  Describing why users should buy Killer over other solutions (and solutions that users have experience or feel comfortable with) has been difficult because the technology behind Killer requires a lot of prior networking knowledge. Public demos showing the feature sets have been obscure at best, and overly technical at worst. Nonetheless, the E2400 previous generation product was widely used in MSI, GIGABYTE and ASRock motherboards, as well as a range of gaming focused laptops as both an extension of marketing towards gaming products as well as the promise of increased performance. The Killer E2500 The new Killer E2500 network controller is likely to make its way onto new motherboards and systems as they are released over the next few months. The E2500 is a newer ground-up design, which Rivet says offers better packet processing metrics than the E2400 and other competition based on a redesigned foundation for network application detection. Aside from automatic implementations purely in hardware, the software for Killer solutions is also important, and this is where a significant change occurs with the E2500. The E2500 uses ‘Advanced Stream Detect 2.0’, the marketing name, for network connection detection and the packet analysis implementation. Rivet has designed it to not only detect programs and apply a priority spectrum, but it also detects up to 500 whitelisted websites in a browser agnostic fashion. This allows users to prioritize, for example, a Youtube video in one browser window at a higher priority than another browser window all while downloading, as well as keeping any game at priority one (and windows updates at priority six). There are parallels with Intel’s processor line in this way of thinking. The latest Broadwell-E chipsets were marketed with a large spoonful of ‘mega-tasking’, for the user who wants to do it all and do it at once. This is the value add that the new Killer line is also going for – gamers who want to stream, or multifaceted users that do several tasks at once. So in order to play a game or a video, while also performing on-the-fly encode and upload, the downloads do not have to be switched off, for example. The idea of improved Quality of Service by prioritizing content isn’t new - we’ve had cFos as a software tool for years (even bundled with a number of motherboards), however Rivet has stated that their hardware solution aims to provide better performance (packet processing latency, dispatch latency and prioritization) for less CPU time than the competition as well as a simpler interface this time around. On the interface, the old version (as I reviewed many times) was a malady in terms of user experience. Rivet has been taking feedback (and reaching out personally to us at AnandTech among others) to figure out the best way to move forward. This is it. The hardware solution deals with six levels of priority, with priority one being ‘real time’ and guaranteeing a front-seat in processing and being placed in the next packet. Detected games (from an internal list) automatically get priority 1 or 2, with messaging programs at 3. Website traffic goes in at either 3/4/5, depending on how the website interacts – video and audio is given a 3, most traffic is a 4, excess traffic is a 5. That leaves priority 6 for updates and large time-insensitive downloads. Programs or websites that need to be adjusted frequently can be pinned to this list, especially specific websites that can be chosen (for example, Facebook/Youtube/Twitch). The major speedometer on this front screen shows real-time bandwidth use (highest value of download or upload), with the maximum value determined via a speed test in the Settings menu. The meat of the software is application management, which is the next tab down. Here we have all the applications listed, with buttons for direct blocking of access (if you see something consuming bandwidth and not sure what it is), as well as per-application bandwidth limiting via sliders for upload and download separately. Both this screen and the last screen work with DoubleShot Pro, Rivet’s name for when two Killer interfaces are being used simultaneously. They use the wired+wifi as an example (so E2500 + 802.11ac Killer 1535), whereby the user can have priority 1-3 going over the wired connection for the best latency, and 4-6 over the wifi as something less critical. The color on the left indicates which connection (currently green for primary, blue for secondary), and the download and upload bars adjust in color as well for parity. With two connections, the main overview interface will show two speedometers as a result. The software is continually a work in progress (Rivet Networks seems very happy to take on board any user comments) and is currently geared for release with E2500 equipped systems. When we spoke with Rivet, they stated that the new interface will work with the 1535 Wi-Fi module for the most part, but the E2400 and below will some features disabled due to the updated configuration on the new silicon. Ultimately the Killer solution is marketed to offer better packet processing and network stream detection for hardware-based prioritization over any competitor solution, and any OEM that goes for Killer will be able to use the software on their platforms. No doubt we will see Killer's SDK allowing for customized interfaces as well in due course. Identifying how the Killer solution affects the end-user is going to be tricky, as the multi-tasking benefits of stream prioritization are hard to accurately measure, or that packet processing is a badly understood and usually synthetic metric. Something such as video conferencing while downloading is perhaps an interesting future metric to monitor: similar to how testing SSDs has evolved, testing network solutions to accurately represent real-world situations has to evolve as well, and we’re aiming to adapt along those lines. It will be interesting to see how the new (and old) solutions from Rivet, Intel, Qualcomm and Realtek perform.

POST A COMMENT 49 Comments View All Comments The_Assimilator - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link If you want your machine's stability killed, buy this product. If you want a NIC that actually works, buy Intel. Reply nathanddrews - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link I'm a huge fan of Intel NICs, but you're going to have to explain your reasoning to us sheeple. Reply Shadow7037932 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Drivers can be unstable and sometimes causes "No Internet Access" issues despite being connected. Gotta disable then re enable to get it to work again. Reply Klimax - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Last I saw such thing was with older Atheros drivers as used on ASUS mainboards for Core 2. (P5KPL-E) Made transfers of large files impossible. Reply Stan11003 - Thursday, September 15, 2016 - link Ditto, I had nothing but problems on my MSI build until I disabled the bundled killer nic and went Intel. Reply wujj123456 - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link Exactly. I had E2201 on my Z87 G1 Sniper 5. With their driver is installed, it's giving me BSOD twice a day. After I uninstalled the driver and making it an "unrecognized device" in device manager, my system has never BSOD'ed once. I gave it another try when I upgraded to Windows 8 and it's same crap even after Windows 8 was released for at least a year. If my MB only had that single LAN port I would be doomed, but thankfully there is also an Intel I-217V. I am never going to buy a MB with only Killer Ethernet. I actually doubt if I would ever want to try again. What they are doing seems to be something should be done at router level. It won't solve any problem in a shared network, which is most network environment anyway. Reply Ian Cutress - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link E2201 is two/three generations old at this point, back when it was still a Qualcomm brand. Since then it's been redesigned and a new software team with user input. For sure I'm going to try it out my side as well when it gets here, but 'under new management' is a big banner they're putting on this generation. Reply wujj123456 - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link I certainly hope so, but definitely won't run the risk of buying a MB with only killer ports. I am not sure how much "brand" plays a role here. I remember QC acquired the brand along with its team back then. If it's really a mostly new team with new management, I can't help but wonder what happened before/after acquisition and what they were doing for all the years... Also Intel cards work out of box for Linux, and there were noLinux driver (open-source or proprietary) at all to make it work under Linux. (It's probably still the case?) Not really holding breath for Linux side of things though. Reply BrokenCrayons - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link It's pretty clear from comments here that opinions about Killer NICs are resoundingly negative. I've seen that evidence elsewhere as Killer NICs are regarded poorly in product reviews. Of the few benchmarks I've looked at, benefits (if they really existed at all in prior products) are close to or within a reasonable margin of error when compared to other competing network adapters. That stands to reason, of course, because the network adapter has no control over data packets once they're placed on the wire. After that point, latency, transmission priority, and so forth are controlled by other equipment that is outside of the end user's reach. In my opinion, the negative branding perception is caused by two factors. The first is the problem of the NIC's lack of reach into the network as explained above. The second is a perception of poor quality as articulated by people retelling problems they've had with drivers and software. Having changed hands multiple times (Bigfoot, Qualcomm, and now Rivet) doesn't exactly help that brand image because it makes the product look like an unwanted orphan with little market appeal -- something that's clearly and obviously true based on the response this article's gotten. Since Rivet Networks consists of leftovers from Bigfoot Networks, a company that already failed to build a successful product once before, those same people will need to have learned a lot from their prior mistakes if they intend to survive. People, right or wrong, have long memories over being burned by a particular brand in the past. Even with expert execution, I don't see how a premium network adapter brand will ultimately find success under the conditions Rivet is working with. Ultimately, Rivet is still _just_ a spinoff company of Qualcomm which makes one think the fruit of the new company hasn't fallen very far from the mother tree. Buying anything with a Killer NIC in it is a risky venture for the buyer since the new company is unproven which might leave someone stuck with an unsupported, non-functional adapter that's been abandoned by a now dead business entity. Having said all that, it's clear that you have reasons for coming to Rivet Networks' defence even if we're not privy to your motives (nor should it matter). I think the majority of us, in spite of our present opinions, are willing to entertain a product review. If the E2500 can demonstrate some measurable benefit, perhaps it has a chance. As most of us are skeptical of vendor claims, bitter and angry over the direction the industry has gone in the past few years, and just want a product that works, we'll have to see the usefulness of a Killer NIC played out in numbers before any of us are going to even consider one. Well, in my case, I'd have to see numbers AND Linux support or its a non-starter regardless. Reply Ian Cutress - Friday, September 16, 2016 - link I agree with you. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt, given the ups and downs over the past few years, and I'm waiting to put it through a set of relevant tests with the appropriate competition. I've met the engineers, and the VPs, since the spinout - and they understand a lot of user concerns. They're also clearly smart and passionate guys, so I'm not willing to write them off just yet until I get the product in my hands and it goes through the ringer.

CDW Rolls Out New Ads Featuring a Barista, a Class Clown and a Fanny-Pack Wearer Spots Are Latest Additions to 'IT Orchestration by CDW' Campaign By Kate Maddox. Published on September 15, 2016. Reprints Reprints Tech company CDW is rolling out new TV spots today in its "IT Orchestration by CDW" brand campaign, featuring a barista, a class clown and a fanny-pack wearer. CDW will introduce five new ads, created by Ogilvy & Mather Chicago, showcasing its partnerships with technology companies including Cisco, Dell, HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Intel. "Dell is a new partner since the March campaign," said Dean Lamb, director of brand and sponsorships at CDW. "This is the first time Dell has been in the campaign, and we are excited to have them with us." In March, CDW launched a new brand campaign to highlight how it partners with big IT companies to provide solutions for customes in retail, healthcare, education and other industries. "We did a lot of research going in and coming out of the March campaign," Mr. Lamb said. "What we're looking to do with this campaign is modify the purchase funnel to incorporate targeted reach as well as broad-reach activities." For example, CDW will use addressable TV buys and account-based marketing, in addition to the TV ads. It is also running radio and out-of-home in select markets, including Chicago, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit and Las Vegas. TV ads are running on cable networks including AMC, CNBC, ESPN and HGTV. One ad, called "CDW Orchestrates Working from Anywhere," shows a coffee shop where CDW is using Dell PowerEdge servers with Intel Xeon processors to let people work from anywhere. Instead of ordering coffee, customers have set up shop with their laptops and mobile devices. One woman approaches the barista and says, "Hey, could I get a couple of copies?" In another ad, called "CDW Orchestrates the Modern Classroom," the class clown is not happy about CDW's use of technology to improve education. "The cloud app ecosystem got everyone excited about learning again, instead of my hilarious pranks and shenanigans," says the class clown. "And the new wireless infrastructure lets Miss Smartypants access her data from anywhere." "We wanted to talk about our services capabilities and how we are helping the education market and helping teachers modernize the learning experience," said Mr. Lamb. Other ads showcase CDW's partnerships with tech providers including Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to modernize printing, retail and supply chain operations. The campaign budget was not disclosed.

Since then there's been a decent refresh to keep the laptop up to date, and now Dell is preparing to release the latest version of the XPS 13 – and it looks like it's going to be a good'un. First up, the laptop will be getting Intel's latest 7th generation Kaby Lake processors, which should ensure the device can compete with other laptops that have appeared in recent months. You'll have a choice between Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 configurations, with the option to add 4GB, 8GB, or 16GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of flash storage. Related: Best laptop There's also Intel's HD Graphics 650 handling the visuals and the Killer 1535 AC hardware should bring improved Wi-Fi to the range. What's more, the company has introduced a new Rose Gold colour option, which is fast becoming a standard offering on devices such as this. The laptop will also come with the same display options as previous iterations, with a choice between a Quad HD+ touchscreen or Full HD display. Dell claims the Full HD offering will allow the laptop to hit 22 hours of battery life, while the QHD+ version is apparently capable of lasting for 13 hours. That's thanks to a new larger 60WHr battery which should ensure improved performance, even if it's not quite up to Dell's claims. The refreshed XPS 13 is available in the UK today at £1,329.

The Envy x360 is HP’s newest revision to its Envy line of notebooks. It fuses solid metal construction with a touchscreen display that can be rotated through 360 degrees. It’s surprisingly cheap for an Envy-branded device, but that's because HP has made a few compromises when it comes to hardware. As a result, it isn't the most powerful convertible on the market and its size can be unwieldy. But even with these flaws, it's a decent machine overall. Related: Best laptops HP Envy x360 – Buying Information My review sample featured an AMD A9 9410 processor, a 256GB M.2 SSD and a 1080p IPS display: model number, 15-ar002na. There are other configurations available, inlcuding models with Intel Core i5 and i7 U-suffix processors, a higher capacity hard disk and Ultra HD screens. HP Envy x360 – Design and Build The Envy x360's design looks slightly above its price point, with a decent-looking brushed aluminium coating and angular features. The metal shell is free from flex, and the rubber pads on the base prevent the Envy from moving around when placed on a solid surface. It’s 1.9cm thick, which makes it easy to throw into a laptop bag; but it isn't the lightest laptop, weighing just over 2kg. In terms of connections, the Envy x360 houses one USB Type-C port, two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI connector, an SD card reader and a 3.5mm headset jack. The power button and volume rocker are located on the left of the device, making them easy to use in tablet mode. The touchscreen display is held in place with a pair of hinges that rotate nearly 360 degrees, which enable the x360 to be used as a tablet or hybrid laptop. The issue here is that the hinge can’t support the weight of that large 15.6-inch screen particularly well; the display can flop down into a lowered position when moved around. Related: Best Laptops For Students In addition, the screen tends to wobble when pressing on the touchscreen, which is a problem for a device that places the screen front and centre. The usefulness of the display’s bend-ability is most stark when you just want to kick back with some Netflix in bed and try to rest the laptop, in tablet mode, on your knees. Tent mode is great for compact spaces such as trains and planes. HP Envy x360 – Keyboard and touchpad The keyboard, on paper, should be decent, presenting large, chiclet-style keys that are easy to find. They’re backlit, too, which makes finding the key you're after much easier in low light. The travel distance on each key is satisfactory, but unfortunately, there isn't much tactile "feel" to them. I found myself missing a few more key presses than I'd like, which is slightly disappointing for a laptop that could otherwise be an effective work machine. The touchpad is also a mixed affair. The trackpad is large, with plenty of space to use the multitouch gestures. Tracking is pretty good for a laptop at this price, and while it isn't the worst I've tested, it doesn’t come close to laptops that get Microsoft-certified Precision touchpads. The issue comes when you want to start clicking: while left-clicks work without issue, I found that right-clicks were frequently missed, even when using the two-finger method – which is frustrating. HP Envy x360 – Audio The Envy x360 uses Bang & Olufsen-branded speakers, and on the whole they’re pretty decent performers. Mid-tones are delivered with suitable clarity, and the high-end doesn't sound sharp – even at high volume. The speakers do lack a bit of punch in the low-end, however, so for music you’ll be better off with headphones. For watching YouTube or Netflix, however, the Envy does a respectable job of delivering a solid audio experience. HP Envy x360 – Screen While its large form factor can hamper the user experience, the screen doesn't – for the most part. The Envy comes packing a Full HD IPS display on the baseline model, which is great for a laptop at this price. The 1080p resolution will be sharp enough for all but the most demanding users, although a 4K variant is also available. The display delivers decent contrast, but overall colour coverage is akin to a lower-end laptop. Still, contrast is king and I have no complaints there. It’s bright, too, although it won’t do enough to overcome the reflective touch coating outdoors on a sunny day. HP Envy x360 – Performance While the Envy x360 is available in a range of specifications, the baseline model comes equipped with an AMD A9 APU. This dual-core processor simply isn't the fastest out there by a large margin, and the resulting performance leaves the laptop lacking. It managed a score of 2,278 in the Geekbench 4 single-threaded tests and 3,485 in the multi-threaded tests, while in a PCMark run it achieved a score of 2,483. This makes it quite a lot slower than the significantly cheaper HP Pavilion x360 when multi-tasking; the Intel Core i3-6100U on board this significantly cheaper device has Intel Hyper-Threading, which speeds up multi-tasking performance. This makes choosing the AMD A9-powered edition of the Envy x360 a little puzzling. In everyday use you probably won’t notice the difference, but when rendering photos you might feel the pinch. What really helps every day snappiness is the high-speed M.2 SSD running in the device, which achieved a read speed of 810MB/sec in the AS SSD benchmark and 136MB/sec write speeds. The write speeds are much lower than I'd expect, but system feel is defined by read speeds, and these are sky-high. While real-world performance is more than sufficient for day-to-day use, gamers will want to look elsewhere – the Radeon graphics aren't up to the task of playing modern-day titles. In Minecraft, the frame rate displayed plenty of variance, jumping between 20 and 40 frames per second. Turn up the settings, and you really won't have a playable experience. Using the touchscreen is a pleasure, and the responsiveness is slick in both tablet and laptop modes, but there is an issue triggering tablet mode when converting from the standard laptop stance. While it does use Windows 10's Continuum feature to switch modes, it doesn't always recognise the switch, which can be frustrating. The x360's design also incorporates an active fan-based cooling system, which becomes audible at medium to high loads. HP Envy x360 – Battery Life The battery life is very respectable for a laptop of this size and price, and it shouldn't be an issue for all but the heaviest of users. In TrustedReviews’ PowerMark test – which involves 10 minutes of web browsing and 5 minutes of video – the laptop lasted 8hrs 13mins, with brightness set to 50% and key backlighting switched off. In a real-world scenario, the x360 managed around five hours of screen-on time, which is fine, if not spectacular. Should I buy the Envy x360? While it isn't the most powerful, nor the lightest convertible notebook on the market, the Envy x360 does just enough to differentiate itself from the Pavilion x360. This is largely down to the M.2 SSD, which helps pick up the performance shortfall caused by the processor. The cheaper Pavilion is still probably a better buy in terms of raw value for money, but the Envy’s lighter weight and better build are big plus points. Verdict It isn't without flaws, but the cheapest HP Envy x360 is an attractive convertible laptop.

Mirantis today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire TCP Cloud. Headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, TCP Cloud employs 30 people and specializes in managed services for OpenStack, OpenContrail and Kubernetes. The acquisition will support Mirantis’ initiative with Google and Intel to enable OpenStack on Kubernetes by equipping Mirantis to continuously deliver OpenStack to customer datacenters. The combined entity will solve the problem of upgrades, one of the primary burdens of on-premises infrastructure. "The model for delivering infrastructure employed by traditional vendors is fundamentally misaligned with modern software development patterns. Disruptors of the digital era push new code to production multiple times a day, while traditional enterprise vendors ship infrastructure as packaged software once every few years and require forklift upgrades,” said Alex Freedland, Mirantis CEO. “Mirantis empowers enterprises to embrace the new, continuously delivered infrastructure model on their terms. TCP Cloud’s technology and expertise helps us accelerate that vision." "The integration of OpenStack and Kubernetes simplifies deployment and expands enterprise cloud capability," said Jonathan Donaldson, vice president of Software Defined Infrastructure at Intel. "Mirantis’ acquisition of TCP Cloud provides a major step forward towards our joint goal of delivering this breakthrough open SDI stack to the market." Mirantis will integrate TCP Cloud’s technology, called MK.20, with Mirantis OpenStack to provide true public cloud experience on customer premises. The design pattern for managing computing infrastructure in MK.20, commonly referred to as managing infrastructure-as-code, is also used today by top public cloud vendors like AWS, Google Compute Cloud and Microsoft Azure to maintain their clouds. Beginning in the next version of Mirantis OpenStack, MK.20 will become part of Mirantis' Fuel software for deploying and managing OpenStack and related open source infrastructure software. “Mirantis and TCP Cloud share a vision of building open source software, and continuously delivering it to digital enterprises,” said Adam Scotnicky, TCP Cloud CEO. “By acquiring TCP Cloud, Mirantis will have increased influence in key open source communities and broader expertise in continuously delivered infrastructure. This powerful combination will help customers like AT&T and Volkswagen build software faster, and emerge as winners in the digital economy.” Mirantis is the top contributor to OpenStack open source project, with the most committers, core contributors, and lines of code contributed to the most recent release, Mitaka. Mirantis is also a top contributor to Ceph, and is quickly emerging as one of the most active contributors to Kubernetes. About Mirantis Mirantis helps top enterprises build and manage private cloud infrastructure using OpenStack and related open source technologies. The company is the top contributor of open source code to OpenStack project and follows a build-operate-transfer model to deliver its OpenStack distribution and cloud management services, empowering customers to take advantage of open source innovation with no vendor lock-in. To date Mirantis has helped over 200 enterprises build and operate some of the largest OpenStack clouds in the world. Its customers include iconic brands like AT&T, Comcast, Shenzhen Stock Exchange, eBay, Wells Fargo Bank and Volkswagen. Learn more at www.mirantis.com.

XDC2016 Will Be One Of The Largest X.Org Conferences In A Long Time Written by Michael Larabel in X.Org on 14 September 2016 at 08:02 PM EDT. 28 Comments Next week's XDC2016 conference in Finland will be one of the largest X.Org Developers' Conferences, if not the largest ever. Some years there has been just 30~50 attendees while usually it's less than 80, which is considered rather large for XDC that's focused upon X.Org / Mesa / DRM / Wayland / related open-source graphics projects. As of writing this evening, 102 individuals are registered to attend, albeit not everyone may actually show up. Of the 102 individuals registered, at least 30 are employees of Intel. (Intel has a large office in Helsinki where a number of open-source developers are working.) Interestingly, nine developers are registered from NVIDIA. This is rather a large amount when usually there are just 1~3 NVIDIA developers in attendance. This year at XDC2016, NVIDIA will be discussing their Wayland EGLStreams proposal and more. Sadly, just one AMD developer is registered: Harry Wentland, who will be discussing the DAL display abstract proposal for the AMDGPU kernel driver. No sign of John Bridgman or Alex Deucher or any of the other AMD Linux folks this year... Other attendees are there representing Canonical, Red Hat, SUSE, Igalia, Google, ARM, and even Broadcom and Imagination Tech. Consulting firm Collabora who invests a lot in the Mesa/Wayland stack will also have four contributors at the event. It should be a very interesting next week in Helsinki with many interesting talks. The current XDC2016 attendee list can be seen here. 28 Comments Tweet About The Author Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

Banks and energy producers carried some of the steepest losses, with crude oil sinking to a one-month low. Sentiment on lenders soured as Deutsche Bank AG sparked a selloff in European banks after it rebuffed a Department of Justice offer to settle a probe tied to mortgage-backed securities for US$14 billion (RM57.8 billion). Oracle Corp. declined 3.8 per cent after its quarterly revenue missed estimates. Intel Corp. climbed 2.5 per cent after raising its sales forecast. The S&P 500 Index fell 0.6 per cent to 2,134.37 at 11:03am in New York, after rising yesterday for the first time in three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 93.65 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 18,118.83. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4 per cent. Trading may be subject to unexpected swings in soaring volume Friday because of a quarterly event known as quadruple witching, when futures and options contracts on indexes and individual stocks expire. S&P Dow Jones Indices will also implement its quarterly index rebalancing after the close, including the first reboot of S&P 500 group weights in almost two decades. That will separate real estate investment trusts from the financial industry, creating 11 top-level groups. Trading in S&P 500 shares was 65 per cent higher than the 30-day average for this time of day. “Oil heading toward below the 40s is waking everyone up that it’s probably not going to recover fully,” Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Key Biscayne -based Frank Capital Partners LLC in Florida, said by phone. “You’ve got Deutsche Bank, which is scaring everybody. People are getting fed up with central banks. There’s a lot going on today.” After the European Central Bank and the Bank of England kept monetary policies unchanged, attention is turning to the Fed’s meeting next week. The chances of a September rate increase have fallen to 20 per cent from 30 per cent a week ago, with December the first month with more than even odds of a hike. A report today showed the cost of living in the US rose more than projected in August, indicating that inflation continues to move closer to the Fed’s goal. Separate data showed consumer confidence in September held at the lowest level since April, limited by a smaller share of Americans reporting gains in incomes. “We had a couple of weaker economic numbers yesterday, so that heightens concerns about the macro picture in the US,” said Patrick Spencer, the London-based vice chairman of equities at Robert W. Baird, which manages US$151 billion. “The indexes are trading near all-time highs so some pullback isn’t surprising, but the longer-term trends remain robust so any correction is expected to be limited.” The S&P 500 last struck an all-time high on August 15, following a 26-session run that brought 10 such records. The gauge has since lost 2.5 per cent. Equities whipsawed investors this week after a rout last Friday jolted markets out of their summer languor on concern that central banks are less willing to boost stimulus despite a persistently fragile global economy. A measure of stock volatility has surged toward its biggest monthly gain since August 2015. “The market is trading off of the Fed right now,” said Brent Schutte, who helps oversee US$90 billion as chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company. “When the Fed starts pulling liquidity back, that increases volatility which will be heightened in the next six to nine months.” On the heels of its worst week since February, the main US benchmark index is on track to post an advance for the latest five-day period, rising 0.4 per cent. Apple Inc.’s 12 per cent rally in four days has helped lift technology companies 2.9 per cent. The group, which has a 21 per cent weighting in the S&P 500, is poised for the best week since May. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Donald Trump takes credit for helping to save a Ford plant that wasn’t closing With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Wall Street flat at the open; Nasdaq hits record high S&P 500 rises to near record after Yellen as treasuries retreat (VIDEO) Wall St edges up, waiting for signs from Yellen Oil prices fall on US crude stock build, Opec remains in focus US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

By John Gruber Archive The Talk Show Projects Contact Colophon RSS Feed Twitter Sponsorship Why A-Series Benchmark Scores Matter Thursday, 15 September 2016 Thom Holwerda on Twitter, quoting a tweet of mine touting the iPhone 7’s astounding Geekbench scores: Funny how just like in the PPC days, benchmarks only start mattering when they favour [insert platform of choice]. https://twitter.com/gruber/status/776295771943600129 I like reading/following Holwerda, because he’s someone who I feel keeps me on my toes. But he’s off-base here. I’m certainly not saying that CPU or GPU performance is a primary reason why anyone should buy an iPhone instead of an Android phone. In fact, I’ll emphasize that if the tables were turned and it were Android phones that were registering Geekbench scores double those of the iPhone, I would still be using an iPhone. In the same way that I’ve been using Macs, non-stop, since I first purchased a computer in 1991. Most of the years from 1991 until the switch to Intel CPUs in 2007, the Mac was behind PCs in performance. I never argued then that performance didn’t matter — only that for me, personally, the other benefits of using a Mac (the UI design of the system, the quality of the third-party apps, the build quality of the hardware, etc.) outweighed the performance penalty Macs suffered. The same would be true today if Apple’s A-series chips were slower than Qualcomm’s CPUs for Android. But that would likely never happen. If Apple’s in-house chips were significantly slower than the commodity chips used by Android device makers, Apple would just use those commodity chips. The mobile situation would be just like the desktop situation, where Apple uses the same CPUs as everyone else. That’s what makes the A-series chips’ performance so interesting. If the commodity chips were fastest, everyone would use them. But if the A-series chips are the fastest (and have the best energy efficiency), only Apple gets to use them. The iPhone has all the benefits (in short: superior design) that would keep me, and I think most other iPhone users, on the platform even if it didn’t have a performance advantage. But it does have a significant performance advantage, and it is exclusive to Apple. This is an extraordinary situation, historically. And year-over-year, it looks like Apple’s lead is growing, not shrinking. It’s not a fluke, but a sustained advantage.

Fuller A notable milestone marked today’s first meeting in Washington of the FAA’s new Drone Advisory Committee (DAC): a representative of helicopter line pilots was at the table.  Commercial airline pilots have long been a fixture at FAA-industry deliberations on safety and policy decisions, in the form of an Air Line Pilots Assn. representative or two. ALPA was the only group that had two members on last year’s FAA task force on creating a small drone registry; an ALPA rep also sits on the new drone advisory committee. But so too does a representative of the Professional Helicopter Pilots Assn. (PHPA). That union’s president, Steven Rush was among the 35 members named last month by FAA Administrator Michael Huerta to the committee to advise the aviation agency on integrating drones into civil U.S. airspace. The only other rotorcraft representative on the panel is Helicopter Assn. International Presiden Matt Zuccaro. Nearly 400 individuals and organizations that expressed interest in serving on the committee, according to the FAA. It is chaired by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich. The inaugural meeting is at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It took a long time for the line pilots to get a voice at the table on committees such as this,” Rush told R&WI. “It’s been a long time coming but we’re there. And that’s been my goal for the last 15 years: to get our voice heard at this level.” PHPA is a council of the Office and Professional Employees International Union. It represents the interests of member air medical helicopter and fixed-wing pilots and assists in collective bargaining, among other duties. “Just over 1,500 of our members fly the air ambulance helicopters, and the drones operate pretty much in their environment,” said Rush. “So our major thrust will be to see how the integration into the airspace is going to affect [the pilots].” Rush joined the U.S. Army career in 1970 and, after receiving flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama, served in South Korea for a year before leaving active duty. He then went to Alaska to fly 135 ops on the Alaska pipeline. He ultimately returned to Fort Rucker as a civilian flight instructor. Rush served 16 yr in the Army Reserve. Rush has been active in PHPA since he helped establish it in 2002; he became president in 2012. Rush said he jumped at the chance to join the drone committee.  “I think everybody’s going to have their say, and I’m sure they’ll come to consensus on all the issues,” Rush said of the members. “These are industry leaders across the spectrum. … The manufacturers, the regulatory people, the airline pilots are there, the helicopter pilots are there, so it’s going to be very interesting.”   The creation of the DAC stems from the successful stakeholder-based Unmanned Aircraft Systems Registration Task Force and the MicroUAS Aviation Rulemaking Committee. While they were established for a single purpose with limited duration, the FAA created the new committee as a long-lasting panel under the RTCA, a federal advisory committee. The drone group will help identify and prioritize integration challenges and improvements, including development of future regulations and policies. Modeled after the FAA’s NextGen Advisory Committee, the drone group is to meet at least three times a year.  Related News   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertise with us Rotorcraft Jobs Search Jobs: Browse all jobs Post jobs Post Resume View Resumes Most Read Most Commented Webinar Focuses on Rotorcraft Boom, Near-Term Prospects 2008 Buyer’s Guide Directory Listings: Directory New Chicago Heliport Already Facing Noise Complaints Panel to Focus on Most Daunting Certification Challenges Sikorsky Seeks Innovative Kids GoPro Unveils Camera Drone In Bid to Save Stock Prices EASA Revision of SPI Regulation Continues How Operators Will Be Impacted by ICAO’s CORSIA Agreement Supersonic Avionics to Fly on ‘Baby Boom’ in 2017 New Report Outlines Avionics Equipage Issues for NextGen Do you receive The Rotorcraft Collective?

If your pockets aren't that deep then there's the GTX 1070, which comes in at a more palatable £380 – but it isn't as powerful. TrustedReviews put both of these GPUs through a comprehensive set of benchmarks to find out which is best – and I’ve taken a deep dive into board partner cards, prices and overclocking too. Of course, you know which is the more powerful of the two, but hopefully the comparisons outlined below will help you to decide which card is best for your needs. Let's get started. If you want to read our individual reviews, you can click here for the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 reviews. Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 review Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 vs 1080 – Specs and Technology The two GTX cards share the same architecture, but they’re designed for different scenarios. The range-topping GTX 1080 is built for 4K, multi-monitor and VR. The GTX 1070 has enough grunt to handle VR and 1440 playback, but it isn't quite good enough for smooth 4K gaming. Th Pascal architecture around which both cards are based is a remarkable bit of design. Nvidia has slimmed down its manufacturing process from 28nm to 16nm, a shrinkage that has allowed the firm to fit more transistors into smaller spaces – and to deploy them on fins, rather than on mere horizontal planes. The result is that Nvidia is achieving far more with much less: the firm’s new cards include millions more transistors than previous GPUs, and on significantly smaller bits of silicon. The smoother flow of electricity allows for better GPU performance alongside surprisingly low power consumption. The two new cards deploy 7.2 billion transistors on a 314mm2 die, with peak power consumption figures of 150W and 180W. Their predecessors used 5.2 billion transistors on a 398mm2 die and drew a peak of 145W and 165W from the mains. Related: The best gaming PC specs to build yourself from £500 The GTX 1080 tops the range with 2,560 CUDA cores, while the GTX 1070 arrives with 1,920. Both cards tower over their predecessors: the GTX 980 had 2,048, while the GTX 970 had 1,664. Video: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 review The clock speeds are given a huge boost, too. The GTX 1080 zips along at 1,607MHz and the GTX 1070 is just 101MHz slower – both figures are hundreds of megahertz ahead of last year’s cards. The shared architecture across the cards mean they share Nvidia’s new software features. One of the key inclusions is “pre-emption”, which allows Nvidia’s card to pick and choose between graphics and computing workloads simultaneously. Both cards also have Lens Matched Shading, which saves resources by not rendering pixels that won’t be seen by the user. There’s simultaneous multi-projection, which allows the GPU to render a scene in as many as 16 different viewpoints – a boon for VR. Many of these features won’t be used to their full potential right now, but future games development will no doubt take advantage, especially when APIs such as DirectX 12 and Vulkan are better supported. The two cards diverge in the memory department. The GTX 1080 has 8GB of GDDR5X memory, while the GTX 1070 has 8GB of bog-standard GDDR5 RAM. The former memory is faster, with a 10,000MHz clock compared to the 8,000MHz in the GTX 1070. The GDDR5X memory has a 320-bit bus – wider than the 256-bit included on the GTX 1070.

It features the following components: Motherboard: Asus Z170-Deluxe Processor: Intel Core i5-6600K (not overclocked) RAM: Corsair Vengeance 2666MHz, 16GB DDR4 Cooler: Corsair H60 liquid cooler PSU: Corsair CX750M SSD: Samsung 850 EVO OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit I’ve tested these powerful cards with five different games. Each title is run at its highest settings, and I’ve tested each game at 1,920 x 1,080, 2,560 x 1,440 and 3,840 x 2,160 – 4K. I’ve also used a selection of synthetic benchmarks, with 3DMark’s demanding Fire Strike test alongside benchmarks to measure power consumption and peak temperature. DiRT Rally Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 134.7 GTX 1080: 154.8 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 97.4 GTX 1080: 122.07 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 52.5 GTX 1080: 63.2 There’s no denying that the GTX 1080 is faster than the GTX 1070, but there’s also no denying that both cards have the power to play DiRT Rally at any resolution. That’s no surprise, though: this is the easiest benchmark in the slate of test games. It’s fully representative of gameplay, and tests a GPU with complex lighting and rapid texture movement. Both cards destroyed the 1080p benchmark with average frame rates of 134.7fps and 154.8fps, and the GTX 1080 continued to average a three-figure result at 1440p with 122.07fps. The GTX 1070 was no slouch, either – it hit 97.4fps in the same run. The two Nvidia cards handle 3,840 x 2,160 with aplomb. The GTX 1070’s average of 52.5fps is excellent, and the GTX 1080 was almost 11 frames faster. Crucially, the pricier card got beyond the 60fps barrier that heralds butter-smooth gameplay. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 131.3 GTX 1080: 160.3 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 89.8 GTX 1080: 112.3 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 46.7 GTX 1080: 54.9 This game is tougher thanks to a multitude of environmental effects including weather, explosions and fire. The more challenging game didn’t stop Nvidia’s latest cards blowing away my 1080p test. Both flew past 130fps averages in the 1080p benchmark, and the GTX 1080 continued its good form at 2,560 x 1,440, where it averaged 112.32fps. The cheaper GeForce card impressed, too, with an average of 89.8fps. The two cards continued to perform well at 4K. The GTX 1080’s 54.9fps average is almost 10 frames beyond its cheaper stablemate, but I’ve no qualms about the GTX 1070’s ability to run this game smoothly at 4K. Grand Theft Auto V Ultra at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 104.2 GTX 1080: 113.4 Ultra at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 74.9 GTX 1080: 89.3 Ultra at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 39.3 GTX 1080: 47.3 GTA V’s benchmark is a hugely demanding test, with numerous scenes that cover driving, flying and plenty of other scenarios. Graphically, it's a demanding game, and here I test with every option run at maximum. This is another game where both cards handled every resolution, but it is in this trickier title where one card slipped below a 40fps average. The GTX 1070 averaged 39.3fps in GTA V at 4K, which is almost 10 frames behind the GTX 1080 – a playable score, but still a significant gap between the cards. There wasn’t as much space between the GPUs at 1440p, where the GTX 1070 registered a sterling 74.9fps average and the GTX 1080 delivered an 89.3fps result. And at 1080p, both cards excelled with averages beyond 100fps. It’s worth looking beyond the frame rates to see how the GTX 1080 flexes its extra CUDA core muscles. The GTX 1070 is only 8.11% behind the GTX 1080 at 1080p, but that gap increases to 16.13% at 1440p – and 16.91% at 4K. Hitman Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080, average GTX 1070: 81.7 GTX 1080: 81.5 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 69.8 GTX 1080: 84 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 29.8 GTX 1080: 47.7 This benchmark stresses a PC’s processor and graphics card with a potent mix of objects, NPCs and lighting effects, and here it’s run at peak settings. I observed the GTX 1080’s widening lead across resolutions in GTA V, and that pattern is even more obvious in Hitman. There’s basically no difference between the two GPUs at 1080p, but the GTX 1080 is 16.93% faster at 1440p – and then 37.53% quicker at 3,840 x 2,160. This isn't the only bit of bad news for the GTX 1070. It rattled through Hitman’s 1080p and 1440p tests at good averages of 81.7fps and 69.8fps, but it faltered at 4K with an average of 29.8fps. That’s below the key 30fps figure, and its minimum frame rate will be even lower – which means that the game will stutter at this demanding resolution. The GTX 1080 had no such problems. It blitzed the 1080p and 1440p tests at 81.5fps and 84.03fps – its increase in speed a clear demonstration of the card flexing its muscles; and it handled 4K at 47.7fps. Rise of the Tomb Raider Max Settings at 1,920 x 1,080 average GTX 1070: 97.9 GTX 1080: 135.8 Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 65.6 GTX 1080: 92.5 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 34 GTX 1080: 48.3 The intensive weather and lighting effects in this benchmark will strain even the beefiest graphics core, and I’ve run the game with every option turned up to the maximum level. In these tests the GTX 1080 rose to the occasion, with a 4K average of 48.3fps – and it ran at nearly 100fps when I dropped the resolution to 2,560 x 1,440. The GTX 1070 performed well, too – and certainly improved on its Hitman frame rates. Its 4K average of 34fps is back on the right side of 30fps, and it breezed through 60fps at 1440p. It almost hit 100fps at 1080p, too. In addition, the GTX 1070 was consistently slower than the GTX 1080 in this test, but the gap between the two cards sat at just below 30% in every test. That’s a better bill of health than its scores in the previous two games, where the GTX 1080 deployed its better memory and larger complement or stream processors to open a larger gap with every resolution increase. Synthetic Benchmarks, Power and Heat 3D Mark Fire Strike Ultra GTX 1070: 3,953 GTX 1080: 4,884 Peak power: GTX 1070: 229W GTX 1080: 286W Peak temperature: GTX 1070: 74°C GTX 1080: 75°C The 3DMark: Fire Strike test demonstrates the gulf in power between these two excellent cards. The GTX 1070 scored 3,953, but the GTX 1080 managed 4,884. The extra stream processors, higher clock and better memory clearly work wonders. The Fire Strike test also provides a firm demonstration of just how much better the new Nvidia hardware is when compared to earlier cards. The GTX 970 scored just 2,767 in this test, while the GTX 980 could manage only 3,286. My test rig consumed 229W with the GTX 1070 installed and 286W with the GTX 1080 on-board. These are fantastic figures considering the power on offer from these cards: the GTX 1070’s power draw is actually lower than the 260W requirement of the GTX 970, and the GTX 1080 is only 16W ahead of my GTX 980 rig. These figures will be even better when compared to older GPUs, and there are several benefits to having a more efficient GPU installed: less electricity is consumed, less heat is generated, and your PC will be quieter. There’s little to choose between peak temperatures – no surprise, seeing as I tested Nvidia’s Founders Edition hardware, which is the same across both chips. The GTX 1080’s 75°C peak was one degree warmer than the GTX 1070. Performance Conclusions There’s no doubt about it: Nvidia’s latest two GPU releases secure its position at the top of the graphics market – at least until AMD unveils some more powerful cards based on its new Polaris architecture. The GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 are both hugely powerful. They both rattled through 1080p and 1440p benchmarks without breaking a sweat, and both have enough power to handle VR. Head towards the high-end, though, and the GTX 1080 starts to justify its higher price. The GTX 1070 dipped below 30fps in one 4K test, and its lower averages in some of those benchmarks mean its minimums will be slower – and that means juddering gameplay. The GTX 1080 had no such problems, with far smoother 4K performance. I also observed the GTX 1080 opening wider leads on its stablemate as resolutions became trickier. That’s testament to its superior specification, and it means the GTX 1080 is a better bet for 4K and multi-monitor setups – and for VR, where its extra power adds a layer of future-proofing. Both cards easily outpaced their predecessors and both did so with impressive noise and power consumption figures. Nvidia has done a sterling job with the Pascal architecture, and it means these two cards are both worth considering. The GTX 1070 is a superb choice for 1080p and 1440p gaming, while the GTX 1080 is fantastic for 4K, multi-monitor setups and smooth VR. Buy Now: GTX 1080 at Amazon.com from $599.99 Best Deals for Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Overclocking and SLI Nvidia reckons there’s ample headroom for overclocking on both cards thanks to GPU Boost 3.0, which provides more granular control over core and memory frequencies and voltages. It was possible to achieve decent gains from both cards. I added 220MHz and 260MHz to the GTX 1070’s core and memory clocks, which saw an average improvement of around 6fps in my games tests. The GTX 1080 saw its core and memory clocks rise by 200MHz and 189MHz, which delivered about five more frames in the test games. The situation surrounding SLI is a little trickier. Nvidia is allowing gamers to use two cards in SLI, but if you’d like to go further then you’ll have to register with Nvidia to receive an unlock code. This is a new approach, but I can’t see it hampering many gamers – the performance of these cards mean that there’s little need to go beyond two GPUs, and the driver issues and diminishing returns of three- and four-card SLI means I can’t wholeheartedly recommend that approach. Other Things to Consider Nvidia launched both of these GPUs with its Founders Edition hardware, which was far more expensive than board partner cards yet actually offered very little. That extra spend got you the kudos of being first in the queue alongside Nvidia’s admittedly excellent metallic card design, but nothing else. Thankfully, there’s now no need to spend all that extra cash on the Founders Edition cards – board partners have unleashed their own versions of the new GPUs. There’s already huge variety in the marketplace. Prices for air-cooled cards range from £380 to £500, and beyond that there are cards with waterblocks fitted for liquid cooling. Even the cheapest cards come with modest overclocks, and spending around £420 could net you a card with a GPU at 1,620MHz or 1,670MHz and memory overclocked to 8,500MHz. Many GTX 1070s use Nvidia’s sturdy reference design, but plenty more deploy a greater number of fans and different heatsinks. There’s even a tiny mini-ITX version, and a card with a pre-built water-cooling unit attached. Unlike the GTX 1070, the GTX 1080 doesn’t have smaller versions of the card available, but the market is well stocked with reference and third-party designs. Prices range between £590 and £750, and overclocked models are common. These tweaked cores often run at speeds beyond 1,700MHz, with memory tweaked to 10,500MHz. Verdict There’s plenty to like about both of these GPUs – and they’re both worth considering for different scenarios. The GTX 1070 is an exceptional card for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and it has ample power for VR. It does this while consuming less power than its predecessor, and I’ve seen that overclocking yields impressive results too.

The problem is they only offer the bare 1080. not a FTW version. I cant see myself upgrading and spending about 200 dollars more for a card that I feel only gives me a slight boost over the 1070 FTW card. Has anyone done comparisons to see how the FTW version stands up to the regular 1080 version? Hacker4748 October 28, 2016, 7:55 pm Quote from the article: --------------------------- Max Settings at 2,560 x 1,440, average GTX 1070: 69.8 GTX 1080: 84 Max Settings at 3,840 x 2,160, average GTX 1070: 29.8 GTX 1080: 47.7 [..] the GTX 1080 is 16.93% faster at 1440p – and then 37.53% quicker at 3,840 x 2,160. --------------------------- This is not how % calculations work. Example: 150 FPS is 50 % (not 33.33%) faster than 100 FPS. So at 1440p the 1080 is 20.34% faster and at 3,840 x 2,160 it is 60.07% faster.

Fun Friday For RadeonSI: Laying 64-Bit Integers, ARB_query_buffer_object Written by Michael Larabel in Mesa on 16 September 2016 at 10:25 AM EDT. Add A Comment For those looking to live on the edge of Mesa development, there are some new patch series out this morning, particularly of interest if you are using the AMD RadeonSI Gallium3D driver for GCN GPUs. First off AMD's Nicolai Hähnle sent out the patches laying the foundation for 64-bit integer support in Gallium3D. This work is based on the original work done by David Airlie. This work lays out the 64-bit integer support for TGSI (the Gallium3D IR) and the Gallium3D drivers. Beyond adding the new opcodes and types for 64-bit ints, support is wired up for Softpipe, LLVMpipe, and then the RadeonSI driver for 64-bit integers. However, this work ultimately won't be too beneficial until Intel's Ian Romanick lands his patches for exposing the GL_ARB_gpu_shader_int64 extension inside Mesa. But Nicolai is hoping to land these patches soon before that ARB_gpu_shader_int64 support even lands in Mesa. Nicolai followed that int64 patch series with ARB_query_buffer_object for RadeonSI. The ARB_query_buffer_object for RadeonSI depends upon having the 64-bit integer support as a prerequisite. ARB_query_buffer_object is one of the few extensions still blocking RadeonSI from having OpenGL 4.4 support. Plus there's been the usual slew of other Mesa-dev patches as well as AMDGPU DRM patches on amd-gfx to make it as an exciting time as ever for riding the bleeding-edge open-source graphics driver code.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. stocks fell on Friday as the possibility of a US$14 billion fine against Deutsche Bank weighed on big banks and investors wrestled with lingering uncertainty about when the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates. The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the U.S. Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed shares slumped 9.35 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell over 1 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.91 percent, dragging down the benchmark index the most. The KBW Bank index fell 1.11 percent and logged its second straight week of declines. Traders have all but ruled out the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting that starts next Tuesday. But residual doubts and questions about when the Fed may finally pull the trigger still hurt sentiment. "It's the uncertainty of next week, the complacency of investors trying to re-evaluate their portfolios as we prepare for an interest-rate hike," said Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.49 percent to finish at 18,123.80 points and the S&P 500 fell 0.38 percent to 2,139.16. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.1 percent to 5,244.57. With futures and options contracts expiring, about 9.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. For the week, the Dow edged up 0.2 percent, the S&P gained 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent. The technology index on Friday dropped 0.33 percent, pulled down by Apple's 0.56-percent decline and Oracle's 4.75-percent drop following weak quarterly profit. Helping limit losses was Intel's 3.04-percent gain to a 15-year high after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. The CBOE Market Volatility index , Wall Street's "fear gauge", declined 5.7 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 88 new highs and 50 new lows.

The recent trigger that has brought up rate hike worries all over again is the U.S. consumer price inflation report for August, which came in more than expected, signaling that there is some scope for upward maneuvering of rates. Commodities are all in the red, as the dollar is firming up. In the absence of any major catalysts, traders may prefer to be on the sidelines or lighten their holdings ahead of next week's two major central bank decisions. U.S. stocks advanced solidly on Thursday, with tempered rate hike fears serving as a spring board for the markets to rebound from recent weakness. The major averages opened higher, as traders digested a slew of soft domestic data, which allayed fears concerning a near-term interest rate hike. The averages rose steadily before ending notably higher. The Dow Industrials added 177.71 points or 0.99 percent before ending at 18,213, the S&P 500 Index closed 21.49 points or 1.01 percent higher at 2,147 and the Nasdaq Composite ended at 5,250, up 75.92 points or 1.47 percent. All thirty Dow components closed the session higher, with Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT), UnitedHealth (UNH), Caterpillar (CAT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Procter & Gamble (PG) leading the gains. Among the sectors, semiconductor, computer hardware, brokerage, energy and biotechnology stocks showed notable moves to the upside. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose to 260,000 in the week ended September 10th from 259,000 in the previous week. The four-week average eased to 260,750 from 261,250. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag were little changed at 2.143 million in the week ended September 3rd. The Commerce Department reported that retail sales slipped 0.3 percent month-over-month in August following a revised 0.1 percent gain in July. Excluding autos, retail sales declined a more modest 0.1 percent compared to the 0.4 percent decline in July. Auto sales fell 0.9 percent following July's 1.7 percent jump. The decline in building material and garden equipment store sales steepened to 1.4 percent from 0.7 percent. Miscellaneous store and non-store retail sales also saw notable decreases. However, the drop in furniture and home furnishing store sales slowed to 0.7 percent from 1.1 percent and electronic store sales rebounded by 0.1 percent. Food and beverage sales rebounded. Gasoline store sales fell at a slower pace of 0.8 percent. A separate Commerce Department report showed that business inventories remained virtually unchanged in July compared to the previous month. Annually, inventories climbed 0.5 percent. Business sales edged down 0.2 percent month-over-month and were 0.8 percent lower from last year. The business inventories/sales ratio rose to 1.39 in July from 1.37 in the year-ago period. The Labor Department report on producer prices showed tame inflationary pressure. The producer price index for final demand was unchanged in August compared to the previous month, while economists expected a 0.1 percent increase. The core producer price index for final demand rose at a faster 0.3 percent clip compared to a flat reading in June. The results of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business outlook survey showed that its diffusion index of business activity rose sharply to 12.8 in September from 2 in August. However, the inner details were mixed. The new orders index rose to 1.4 from -7.2, while the unfilled orders index was at an anemic -10.8. The shipments index and the employee index were also in negative territory. Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve's survey showed that manufacturing activity in the region continued to contract in September. The general business conditions index improved to -1.99 in September from -4.21 in August, while economists expected a reading of -1. The new orders and unfilled orders indexes were at -7.45 and -11.61, respectively. The employment index is deep in the red at -14.29. Industrial production fell 0.4 month-over-month in August, according to a report released by the Federal Reserve. Economists expect a 0.2 percent drop. Manufacturing output also declined 0.4 percent, reversing the 0.4 percent increase in July and steeper than the 0.3 percent drop expected by economists. Capacity utilization eased 0.4 percentage points to 75.5 percent. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures for October delivery are slipping $0.83 to $43.08 barrel after rising $0.33 to $43.91 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,312.80 an ounce, down $5 from the previous session's close of $1,318 an ounce, which represented a 2-week low. On Thursday, gold fell $8. 10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.01 yen compared to the 102.10 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1201 compared to yesterday's $1.1244. Asia Asian stocks rebounded from a six-week low, encouraged by Wall Street's rally overnight. The markets in China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Korea and Taiwan were closed for public holidays. The Japanese market rose as the yen remained subdued at the lower 102-levels. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and moved roughly sideways in a broad range in the morning before advancing in the afternoon. The index ended up 114.28 points or 0.70 percent at 16,519. The Australian market rose for a third straight day, as easing Fed rate hike worries helped lift stocks across the board. The All Ordinaries index closed up 59.60 points or 1.12 percent at 5,397. The market witnessed broad based strength, with utility, telecom, consumer discretionary and financial stocks making strong advances. Europe The European markets moved about in a lackluster manner in the morning after rebounding from a 5-session decline yesterday. The averages opened higher but saw a volatile bout in the morning. The averages are currently notably lower, as U.S. inflation data has served to intensify the weakness. In major corporate news, Deutsche Bank (DB) said it has no intent to pay the $14 billion sought by the U.S. Justice Department to settle potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited. U.S. Economic Reports Consumer prices in the U.S. increased by slightly more than expected in the month of August, according to a report released by the Labor Department. The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose by 0.2 percent in August after coming in unchanged in July. Economists had expected prices to inch up by 0.1 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core consumer prices climbed by 0.3 percent in August after edging up by 0.1 percent in July. Core prices had been expected to rise by 0.2 percent. The University of Michigan is scheduled to release its preliminary U.S. consumer sentiment index for September at 10 am ET. The index is expected to increase to 90.8 from 89.8.

It’s iPhone 7 upgrade day for Apple customers around the planet and we’re seeing the usual queues and swiftly sold out enthusiasm we’ve seen every year, with initial reports from carriers suggesting the company has a smash hit on its hands (again). Apple’s new iPhone 7 is waterproof, has a new camera, better screen and a better battery. So, as the first handsets reach real people’s hands, what else are we learning about the smartphone? The Taptic tease The annual iFixit iPhone teardown confirms that the removal of the headphone jack has provided the space Apple needed in order to place the Taptic Engine. The area also hosts a simple plastic bumper, which suggests another reason for the removal of that port was improvement in water resistance. The new model iPhones also open sideways, which the teardown specialists suggest may also help improve water resistance. Water resistance All the teardowns confirm Apple has paid a lot of attention to water resistance, but how resistant will it be? Find out from about 8.30am PDT when iFixit begins its live YouTube video cast of an iPhone submerged in an aquarium. That superb processor The latest Geekbench figures were reported earlier but they are so significant I thought I’d include them here: iPhone 7 has double the single-core performance of the fastest Android smartphones. When it comes to multicore performance they are similar to the 2013 MacBook Pro – in other words, these are proper computers in your pocket. In related news with its Note 7 debacle it looks like Samsung is (rightfully) limping into the history books, Apple has at last replaced it as processor manufacturer in the A10 Fusion chip, which is made by TSMC. The M10 motion coprocessor is embedded within the chip. (Samsung still gets to make some memory for the iPhone, 3GB in fact). More time than ever In comparison to the previous generation the new iPhones should deliver over an hour of additonal battery life. That’s because the battery is 1,960 mAh, 3.8 V and 7.45 watt hours in comparison to the iPhone 6S which hosted a 1,810 mAh, 6.9 Wh battery. (The 7 Plus features a 2,900mAh battery according to iFixit). Tougher than before The Apple smartphone has already been put through rigorous stress testing by one YouTuber, who managed to prove iPhone 7 is tough. It’s less likely to scratch than a Note, the Home button and camera lens are similarly tough. The iPhone also managed to completely recover from being exposed to flame, even though its pixels briefly went black, and while the phone may need a quick visit to a repair shop to fix broken adhesive it can take a good degree of bending too. (A little) Intel inside Chipworks got hold of an iPhone 7 and tore it apart to find the LTE modem inside the smartphone is made by Intel, though this may not be true in the case of every handset. This wasn’t all the Intel “stuff” inside of the phone, which also hosts two transceivers and a power management chip from the company. (Qualcomm also makes these components for Apple). The tear down shop took apart an iPhone aimed at the North American market. Anyone else inside? These are the names of all the companies with identified components inside the iPhone.

As filter feeders, oysters’ edibility depends highly on water quality, and when rain causes flooding into the estuaries where the molluscs are farmed, they may pick up contaminants that can pose a potential risk of food poisoning for consumers. As a result, when there is a perceived risk, regulations mean oyster farms must close for days or weeks until conditions improve, which can cause business owners to forego revenues of up to $120,000 for each day harvest is held back. Furthermore, the spread of the virus causing Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS) has devastated some oyster farming businesses. One such enterprise, Tasmania’s Barilla Bay Oysters – once one of the state’s largest oyster farmers – saw 70% of its harvest wiped out by POMS in February of this year. The Yield’s oyster farming application, which was developed in partnership with Bosch, sends data from in-estuary sensors via an Intel gateway to Bosch’s ProSyst software. From there it is then passed to Microsoft’s IoT hub in the Microsoft Azure cloud along with weather data. The environmental data and near real-time sensor data is combined and presented to oyster growers and regulators to enable faster decision-making based on local information. The app delivers informative dashboard visualisations for the previous week, the current day and for the following day. Microsoft Azure machine learning is also employed to drive The Yield’s predictive algorithms which underpin the Yield’s application, according to Microsoft. According to Lloyd Klump, General Manager of BioSecurity Tasmania, The Yield’s solution is important in ensuring food safety, as well as managing the response to POMS. “Even for a smaller grower a day’s closure in a busy season can be very significant. But there are indirect impacts also, Tasmania relies on these sorts of industries for local communities,” Klump said. The Tasmanian oyster industry is worth around $23 million a year, but due its associated community employment, oyster farming influences a larger share of the state’s economic infrastructure than that figure suggests. “Anything we can do to help the sustainability is important for Tasmanian communities and the economy,” said Klump. Ros Harvey, founder and CEO of The Yield explained that the underlying technologies could also have much broader implications for farming generally – for example allowing crop growers to know exactly when and how to irrigate. “We actually have a really clear purpose which is how we’re going to help feed the world without wrecking the planet,” she said.

Yes. It’s good to see it again. We were very taken indeed with the 2015 edition of this compact notebook, awarding it a full five stars in our review and heaping praise on its design – that near-borderless monitor really keeps the size down. And now it’s getting a 2016 update, complete with new seventh-generation Intel Core processors and a new colour option. Is it... rose gold?  Of course it’s bloody rose gold! The gadget gods have decreed that every product released in 2016 must come with a gold-but-also-a-wee-bit-pink finish, and the XPS 13 is no exception. OK, so there’s a new colour – but let’s get back to those specs. Indeed. Well, the new model comes with a choice of new i3, i5 and i7 Intel chips, and better battery life than its predecessor (Dell says 13 hours if you’re Netflix streaming or web browsing, 22 if you’re just using productivity apps), higher speed Wi-Fi and a Thunderbolt 3 port that’ll allow a single XPS 13 to power two external 4K displays, as well as single-cable docking. Anything else? Aside from the above, the specs are unchanged from last year’s edition. The base model features a 13.3in 1080p screen, Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of solid-state storage, and upgrades can take that to a 3200 x 1800 touchscreen, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Price and availability? There’s no sign of the new model on Dell’s UK site yet, but in the US the 2016 XPS 13 starts at US$799, although you’ll need to pay more (US$1149) for the rose gold model.

VirtualBox is a high-performance, cross-platform virtualization engine for use on computers running Windows, Linux distributions, and others. Designed for use on Intel and AMD x86 systems, VM VirtualBox can be deployed on desktop or server hardware. As a hosted hypervisor, it extends the existing operating system installed on the hardware rather than replacing it. VirtualBox includes a hypervisor for the host platform, an application programming interface (API) and software development kit (SDK) for managing guest virtual machines, a command-line tool for managing guests locally, a web service for remote management of guests, a wizard-style graphical tool to manage guests, a graphical console for displaying guest applications on the local host, and a built-in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server that provides complete access to a guest from a remote client. VirtualBox Architecture VirtualBox API = VBoxMananger = CLI VBoxMananger is the command line interface to VirtualBox. If you put a command from VBoxMananger into the console, is possible see all commands and how they interact with the VirtualBox API. The command to list all VMs is: $ VBoxManage list vms It is possible to create VMs with the command line, but is necessary to have ISO to the system operation that you want installed. Step 1: Step 2: VBoxMananger is the tool that Vagrant uses for samples to create environments. VirtualBox Network There are three types of networks: NAT with port forwarding. Bridged networking. Internal networking. Host-only networking. NAT Networking NAT = Networking Address Translation. Each VM has your own sub-network with your public IP. Share the same resources of that host. VMs cannot see each other. IP, Gateway, and DNS cannot be changed. Bridged Networking VMs and the host are in the same network. VMs have access to the physical network in the same way the host does. Can be found in the physical network. Internal Networking Isolated network. Only VMs are within a private network. Host can’t see the private network. Host-Only Networking Hybrid between bridge and internal networks. Private Network to the host and VMs. VMs can’t see external networks. Host has private IP to the internal network. Conclusion In this post, I focused on one difficult point people I know tend to bring up (VirtualBox API and VirtualBox Network). These solutions are what worked for me.

Join For Free Check out this 8-step guide to see how you can increase your productivity by skipping slow application redeploys and by implementing application profiling, as you code! Brought to you in partnership with ZeroTurnaround. The vmlens executor service is a high throughput executor service. It achieves three times higher throughput than the standard JDK executor service. The tradeoff is that the latency is much higher than that of the standard JDK executor service. Here are my benchmark results: The figure shows the throughput of the vmlens executor Service compared to the standard JDK executor service for different threads on JDK 8. The figure shows the latency of the vmlens executor Service compared to the standard JDK executor service for different threads on JDK 8. Both benchmarks were run with jmh on an Intel i5 4-core CPU. The source of the benchmark can be downloaded here. A Wait-Free Algorithm for Writing The basic Idea is that writing should be as fast as possible. The vmlens executor Service uses a thread local field to store its last written queue node. So writing consists of creating a new QueueNode, writing to a thread local field and writing to the volatile QueueNode next field. public class QueueManyWriters
private final ThreadLocal lastWrittenQueueNode
= new ThreadLocal();

public void accept(E element)
{

	if( dispatcherThread.stop )
	{
		throw new RejectedExecutionException();
	}

	QueueNode current = new QueueNode(element);

	if( lastWrittenQueueNode.get() == null )
	{
		writingThreads.append(current,Thread.currentThread().getId());
		lastWrittenQueueNode.set(new LastWrittenQueueNode(current));
	}
	else
	{

		lastWrittenQueueNode.get().last.next = current;
		lastWrittenQueueNode.get().last = current;

	}
}

...
}
public class QueueNode {

	final E element;
	volatile QueueNode next;

	public QueueNode(E element) 
    {
		super();
		this.element = element;
	}

} Reading is done by a single dispatcher Thread. The dispatcher collects the tasks and pushes them to one of the worker thread. For collecting the tasks the dispatcher thread uses a local list. The list contains the last read element for each writing thread. Conclusion The wait-free algorithm for writing leads to a three time higher throughput than the standard JDK executor service. The vmlens executor service is used in vmlens, a tool to test multithreaded application, for asynchronously writing events to disk. Whatever type of execution service you use you should test the multithreaded part of your application. Read more about testing multithreaded java code here.
