While the father’s genes are present within the children, they lie suppressed. Nonetheless, paternal genes do play a role in the intelligence of their children. When it comes to intelligence, children take after their mother, according to the researchers at the University of Washington. It is the woman who is more likely to transmit genes that shape the child’s intelligence. Researchers supported their findings by noting that genes influencing intelligence are carried on the X chromosome, and women have two of these. Men, or fathers, have only a single X chromosome. Lucky for my kids: Children inherit their intelligence from their mother https://t.co/Z2QcFBCzVm #marriedup — Ross Silverman (@phlu) October 6, 2016 Similar research conducted in the past has corroborated the findings. However, the recently concluded study by researchers in Glasgow, Scotland, adds that genes responsible for advanced cognitive functions are inherited from the father’s side as well. But they are either automatically deactivated or remain suppressed. Could children be made smarter, simply by activating these suppressed or deactivated genes? According to the scientists, a category of genes known as “conditioned genes” are thought to work only if they come from the mother in some cases, and the father in other cases, reported Stock News USA. However, intelligence is the one of the few conditioned genes that works only when it comes from the mother. In other words, even if the child does inherit the smartness genes from the father, they lie deactivated. What does a child inherit from the father? While testing their hypothesis on rats, scientists discovered cells with paternal genes accumulated in parts of the limbic system. This part of the brain deals with much more primal and instinctive functions like sex, food, and aggression. The paternal genes were noticeably absent in the cerebral cortex. This part of the brain deals with evolved and advanced cognitive functions like reasoning, thought, language, and planning. Children Inherit Intelligence From Mothers, Says Study: Mother's genes may determine how clever the children … https://t.co/jlbnyQD8vY — Joy Lobo (@In_gene_year) October 6, 2016 Essentially, genetically modified mice with an extra dose of maternal genes developed bigger brains and relatively smaller bodies. Meanwhile, the rats with an extra dose of paternal genes had small brains and larger bodies. This led scientists to conclude that brain development happens because of the mother’s genes, but how well a child’s body develops depends on the father’s genes. To further corroborate their hypothesis, researchers interviewed 12,686 young people between the ages of 14 and 22 every year for two decades. Despite factoring in environmental factors, including race and socio-economic status, researchers were convinced that the best predictor of intelligence in the child was the IQ of the mother and not the father. Incidentally, genetics are not the only determining factor in development of intelligence. According to previous research, only 40 to 60 percent of intelligence is hereditary, reported The Times of India. In other words, the environment in which the child grows up plays an equally important part in the development of advanced cognitive functions. According to researchers, intelligence depends on mother's X chromosome, where the intellence genes are located. https://t.co/MaKkHsKuPu — Int. Engineering (@IntEngineering) September 28, 2016 Though the surroundings may have a substantial impact on the child’s smartness, it is the deep emotional bond the child shares with his or her mother that largely influences the development of intelligence. The secure and intimate bond a child has with the mother is a large part of the “non-genetic” part of intelligence. While this might be common knowledge, researchers confirmed the theory scientifically by analyzing the way a group of mothers related to their children for seven years. Children who enjoyed a close bond with their mother had their intellectual needs fulfilled, and were supported emotionally, had a 10 percent larger hippocampus at the age of 13, as compared to those who had an emotionally distant mother. While a mother’s love is crucial for her child’s mental and emotional development, the father’s role can’t be undermined. Devoted fathers help develop other important traits in their children like intuition and emotions. These components inherited from the father are crucial for an all-round development of intelligence, concluded the researchers.

and Automated TAM Analysis - Leadspace is the first predictive analytics platform to provide predictive scores and intelligence inside a Salesforce panel - Site-Level Matching lets sales teams see instantly where a prospect fits into the company hierarchy, by location and company structure - Leadspace Total Addressable Market (TAM) Analysis uses the power of AI-driven predictive analytics to find and validate new markets News provided by Leadspace Oct 06, 2016, 11:19 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- While Dreamforce 2016 attendees await this afternoon's Salesforce Einstein keynote, Leadspace, the B2B predictive analytics and data management choice of seven of the 10 leading enterprise software companies, announced three new features to integrate the power of artificial intelligence into Salesforce for B2B marketers. Leadspace is the First Predictive Analytics Platform to Provide Predictive Scores and Intelligence Inside a Salesforce Panel For years, predictive vendors have appended numbers (scores) to lead, contact, and account records. But those scores are often meaningless to the sales reps using Salesforce to target and engage with customers. Today, Leadspace becomes the only vendor to add predictive scores and intelligence directly into a Salesforce panel, so sales reps can understand, use and trust the information. Salesforce CRM users will instantly see the predictive score of every lead, contact and account in their CRM, plus the predictive signals contributing to the score to help them understand the score's basis and value. And they will see enriched information about the person and company to help them connect and engage more effectively. For example, instead of seeing only that a prospect has a title related to human resources, and the name of the company they work for, a rep will see the prospect's specific job functions (like onboarding, recruiting, talent development or training), what technologies the person uses daily, complete firmographic information on the company and its corporate hierarchy and whether the prospect works at headquarters or a regional site. Plus, the record includes the prospect's picture and professional activity feed gathered from social media sites and the Web. All of this data and intelligence come together in one Salesforce panel, equipping sales reps to have better, more targeted, effective conversations. Plus, the new Leadspace panel is highly interactive, with direct links to lead and account social profiles, the ability to "click to copy" contact information, as well as update contact records directly in Salesforce when Leadspace finds the information has changed. Site-Level Matching Lets Sales Teams See Instantly Where a Prospect Fits into the Company Decision-Making Hierarchy, by Location and Company Structure Traditional CRM records make no distinction between an executive at an enterprise company headquarters, and a counterpart in a subsidiary division located in an office a thousand miles away. Sales reps frequently waste time trying to reach a prospect with the right title in the wrong office, only to learn that buying decisions are made at HQ. Leadspace Site-Level Matching uses the data in the Leadspace Virtual Data Management Platform with advanced AI-driven semantic understanding to give a clear view of who a prospect is, their job functions beyond just their title, and insight into where they sit in the company's decision-making hierarchy. Once again, all this information is available inside the Salesforce panel, preventing wasted time and effort by sales teams. Leadspace Total Addressable Market (TAM) Analysis Uses the Power of AI-Driven Predictive Analytics to Find and Validate New Markets Before any smart company starts a new product line or investigates a new sales territory, they perform a Total Addressable Market (TAM) analysis to forecast the potential ROI of that venture. Typically, TAM analyses have been performed with a hodgepodge of outdated research from directories, trade associations and government organizations. Leadspace brings the power of artificial intelligence to TAM analysis, valuing new markets with the same predictive methods used to find ideal prospects. Using a company's historical sales data, combined with firmographic, demographic and industry information from across the Web, aggregated by the Leadspace Virtual Data Management Platform, Leadspace's advanced AI-driven predictive algorithms identify potential new markets for products and services, and predict the total dollar value of those markets. Leadspace TAM Analysis gives companies the tools to find new markets and validate their potential for success before spending money, time and effort. "These new features bring the power of artificial intelligence to solving key issues faced by B2B sales and marketing teams," said Leadspace VP of Product Travis Kaufman. "Because they are integrated into Salesforce, marketers can collaborate with their sales counterparts, define the right target accounts and deliver qualified leads within those accounts in a way that aligns with how their sales teams work." About Leadspace Leadspace is the B2B predictive analytics and data management solution chosen by seven of the 10 largest enterprise software companies. Leadspace helps marketers increase lead conversion and boost pipeline with net-new lead discovery, on-demand database enrichment and predictive lead scoring, on both the company and individual employee level. Leadspace is trusted by more than 120 leading B2B brands including Oracle, Microsoft, Autodesk, RingCentral and BloomReach. Based in San Francisco and Tel Aviv, Leadspace is backed by Battery Ventures, JVP and Vertex. www.leadspace.com Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160815/398198LOGO   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/leadspace-announces-new-artificial-intelligence-features-for-salesforce-including-predictive-intelligence-and-scoring-and-site-level-matching-inside-the-salesforce-panel-and-automated-tam-analysis-300340637.html SOURCE Leadspace Related Links http://www.leadspace.com Oct 05, 2016, 10:18 ET Preview: Artificial Intelligence for B2B Marketing--Available Now from Leadspace My News Release contains wide tables.

Women are more likely to transmit intelligence genes to their children as they are carried on the X chromosome and women have two of these, while men only have one. Advanced cognitive functions which are inherited from the father may be automatically deactivated, according to the researchers at the University of Washington in the US. A category of genes known as "conditioned genes" are thought to work only if they come from the mother in some cases and the father in other cases. Intelligence is believed to be among the conditioned genes that have to come from the mother. Laboratory studies using genetically modified mice found that those with an extra dose of maternal genes developed bigger heads and brains, but had little bodies. Those with an extra dose of paternal genes had small brains and larger bodies, 'The Independent' reported. Researchers identified cells that contained only maternal or paternal genes in six different parts of the mouse brains which controlled different cognitive functions, from eating habits to memory. Cells with paternal genes accumulated in parts of the limbic system, which is involved in functions such as sex, food and aggression. However, researchers did not find any paternal cells in the cerebral cortex, which is where the most advanced cognitive functions take place, such as reasoning, thought, language and planning. Research makes it clear that genetics is not the only determinant of intelligence - only 40 to 60 per cent of intelligence is estimated to be hereditary, leaving a similar chunk dependent on the environment.

Rory Cellan-Jones Technology correspondent 6 October 2016 From the section Technology comments Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sundar Pichai says his goal is to use AI to build "a personal Google" for each of its users "We're moving from a mobile first to an AI-first world." That was how Google's boss, Sundar Pichai, began a presentation on Tuesday, at which his company unveiled a range of new hardware products. He believes that the key attraction of both the new Pixel smartphones and the Google Home smart speaker is the company's expertise in artificial intelligence as demonstrated by the Google Assistant. The search company believes that the vast amount of data it has collected over the years, coupled with its expertise in machine learning, will give it a head start in the coming AI battle. Image copyright Google Image caption Google Assistant can find information, carry out tasks and control other internet-connected kit The company hopes that Google Assistant, a conversational chatbot or virtual PA, will soon be a key feature on all sorts of Android devices, not just those it makes itself. If Mr Pichai has his way, we will soon be shouting: "OK Google," to get all sorts of information and services. But on Thursday came news that showed that the biggest player on Android may not be so keen on that idea. Samsung has announced that it is buying Viv, an artificial intelligence company started by the same people who created the virtual assistant Siri, and then sold it to Apple. Media captionViv, the voice-controlled virtual assistant, was demoed in May Viv, according to Samsung, is "a unique, open artificial intelligence platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned applications and services". That appears to be a pretty good description of what Google is doing with its AI. But it sounds as though Samsung may decide that Viv will be a key differentiator on its Galaxy phones - and vast range of household appliances - as it battles to retain its position at the top end of the Android market in competition with the Google Pixel. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Samsung has a wide range of electronics that could benefit from Viv, in addition to its handsets And other technology giants are flexing their own AI muscles. Apple of course has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana, and IBM's Watson has been around for a while and is beginning to make its presence felt in a number of commercial applications. We also learned on Thursday UK lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest would use chatbots based on Watson to answer simple customer queries. Image copyright RBS Image caption IBM Watson's virtual agent is able to understand and learn from human interactions Then there is Alexa, the AI at the heart of Amazon's voice-controlled Echo speaker. Amazon has opened up the Alexa platform to outside developers, and there are already a few Alexa-powered devices out there in the market. The Echo is in only a few million homes so far, but talking to her (it?) is already proving a compelling example of the promise - and current limitations - of an AI conversational program. Alexa is pretty good at understanding what you are saying, but not so smart at dealing with follow-up questions. Media captionAmazon says its Echo speakers were inspired by Star Trek And this is where Google believes its AI has an edge, saying its Assistant has contextual awareness that allows it to carry on a conversation beyond an initial question. The company gives as an example the query: "Who is the current British prime minister?" Try this out with Google, Alexa and Apple's Siri, and all three will produce the answer: "Theresa May". But follow up with: "How old is she?" and Siri says: "I'm afraid I couldn't find anything on 'How old is she?'" while Alexa tells you she does not understand the question. But the Google Assistant knows you are referring to Mrs May and comes back with: "Theresa May is 60 years old." Of course, we are at the very early stages of this revolution, and much may change as each AI learns by doing. What is more, none of them has yet convinced a significant number of people that conversing with a smart device is something really useful rather than a bit of fun, which you try and then forget. Both Amazon and Google are betting that this moment comes when we walk through the front door and say: "OK Google, turn on the lights," or: "Alexa, turn up the heat in the hallway." Now we know that Samsung and perhaps IBM's Watson may also be competing to give us similarly compelling AI experiences. Image copyright Apple Image caption Siri can be used on Apple's TV set-top box, but the company does not have a voice-activated speaker The mystery is what Apple is up to. Siri first came to the iPhone five years ago, providing the first experience of a virtual assistant for many. Since then, while the program has appeared on more Apple devices, and is now on its desktop Macs, it has failed to define this new category. Where is the Siri speaker or Siri car? You can be certain that hundreds, perhaps thousands of artificial intelligence experts are at work in Cupertino. But exactly what ambition Apple has to be a key player in the AI future remains unclear.

(Picture: Getty Images) If you’re really, really smart, then you should give your mum a call to say thanks. Apparently we inherit our cleverness (or lack of) from our mums, not our dads. Three 'dangerous' inmates on the run from prison Mothers are reportedly more likely to pass on intelligence genes to their kids than fathers because these are carried on the X chromosome. Women, of course, have two X chromosomes while men have just one X and one Y. But on top of this, scientists believe the intelligence genes that are inherited from the father are automatically deactivated. Yay (Picture: Getty Images) According to a Psychology Spot blog post from March, lab studies on genetically modified mice found that those with extra doses of maternal genes developed bigger heads and brains, while those with more paternal genes had smaller brains and heads (no Pinky and the Brain jokes).

But if you’re a bit dumb and your mum is super-smart, don’t be too surprised.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 6 October 2016 | MYT 4:58 PM Tech titans join to study artificial intelligence Staving off killer robots: The establishment of "Partnership on AI,” focused on helping the public understand the technology and practices in the field of artificial intelligence, comes amid concerns that new AI efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society. — AFP SAN FRANCISCO: Major technology firms have joined forces in a partnership on artificial intelligence, aiming to cooperate on “best practices” on using the technology “to benefit people and society.”  Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, IBM, and Google-owned British AI firm DeepMind announced a non-profit organisation called “Partnership on AI” focused on helping the public understand the technology and practices in the field.  The move comes amid concerns that new artificial intelligence efforts could spin out of control and end up being detrimental to society.  The companies “will conduct research, recommend best practices, and publish research under an open license in areas such as ethics, fairness, and inclusivity; transparency, privacy, and interoperability; collaboration between people and AI systems; and the trustworthiness, reliability, and robustness of the technology,” according to a statement.  Academics, non-profit groups, and specialists in policy and ethics will be invited to join the board of the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society (Partnership on AI).  Microsoft meanwhile took a further step on artificial intelligence, announcing a unit devoted to “democratising” the technology, with more than 5,000 computer scientists and engineers.  Microsoft expected its new AI and Research Group to speed up putting human-like thinking into virtual assistants, applications, services and computing infrastructures.  ”We are focused on empowering both people and organizations, by democratizing access to intelligence to help solve our most pressing challenges,” Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a release.  ”To do this, we are infusing AI into everything we deliver across our computing platforms and experiences.”  The new unit will include scientists from Microsoft Research, Bing and Cortana product groups, and its Ambient Computing and Robotics teams.  Late last year, SpaceX founder and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk took part in creating nonprofit research company OpenAI devoted to developing artificial intelligence that will help people and not hurt them.  Musk found himself in the middle of a technology world controversy by holding firm that AI could turn on humanity and be its ruin instead of a salvation.  Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are among technology giants that have been investing in making machines smarter, contending the goal is to improve lives.  ”If we create some digital super-intelligence that exceeds us in every way by a lot, it is very important that it be benign,” Musk said at a Code Conference in California in June.  A danger, he contended, was that highly advanced artificial intelligence would be left to its own devices, or in the hands of a few people, to the detriment of civilisation as a whole. — AFP You May Be Interested Alibaba posts record Singles' Day sales Bangladesh hopes to recover US$30mil more from cyber heist Progress, but uphill slog for women in tech Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Isis 'teaching Mosul's children how to kill and make bombs in school' Final polls show Hillary Clinton leading ahead of Donald Trump A mother's genetics determines how clever her children are, according to researchers, and the father makes no difference.  Women are more likely to transmit intelligence genes to their children because they are carried on the X chromosome and women have two of these, while men only have one. But in addition to this, scientists now believe genes for advanced cognitive functions which are inherited from the father may be automatically deactivated. Read more Poverty changes your brain to make you less intelligent, study suggests Research suggests being lazy is a sign of high intelligence Intelligent people tend to be messy, stay awake longer, and swear more  A category of genes known as “conditioned genes” are thought to work only if they come from the mother in some cases and the father in other cases. Intelligence is believed to be among the conditioned genes that have to come from the mother.  Laboratory studies using genetically modified mice found that those with an extra dose of maternal genes developed bigger heads and brains, but had little bodies. Those with an extra dose of paternal genes had small brains and larger bodies.  Researchers identified cells that contained only maternal or paternal genes in six different parts of the mouse brains which controlled different cognitive functions, from eating habits to memory. Cells with paternal genes accumulated in parts of the limbic system, which is involved in functions such as sex, food and aggression. But researchers did not find any paternal cells in the cerebral cortex, which is where the most advanced cognitive functions take place, such as reasoning, thought, language and planning. Chocolate is good for your brain Concerned that people might not be like mice, researchers in Glasgow took a more human approach to exploring intelligence. They found the theories extrapolated from mice studies bear out in reality when they interviewed 12,686 young people between the ages of 14 and 22 every year from 1994. Despite taking into account several factors, from the participants education to their race and socio-economic status, the team still found the best predictor of intelligence was the IQ of the mother. However, research also makes it clear that genetics are not the only determinant of intelligence - only 40 to 60 per cent of intelligence is estimated to be hereditary, leaving a similar chunk dependent on the environment.  Mothers meeting their newborn babies 8 show all Mothers meeting their newborn babies 1/8 Fermont Fotographie 2/8 Fermont Fotographie 3/8 Fermont Fotographie 4/8 Fermont Fotographie 5/8 Fermont Fotographie 6/8 Fermont Fotographie 7/8 Fermont Fotographie 8/8 But mothers have also been found to play an extremely significant role in this non-genetic part of intelligence, with some studies suggesting a secure bond between mother and child is intimately tied to intelligence. Researchers at the University of Washington found that a secure emotional bond between a mother and child is crucial for the growth of some parts of the brain. After analysing the way a group of mothers related to their children for seven years, the researchers found children who were supported emotionally and had their intellectual needs fulfilled had a 10 per cent larger hippocampus at 13 on average than children whose mothers were emotionally distant. The hippocampus is an area of the brain associated with memory, learning and stress response. Graphiq A strong bond with the mother is thought to give a child a sense of security which allows them to explore the world, and the confidence to solve problems. In addition, devoted, attentive mothers tend to help children solve problems, further helping them to reach their potential. Of course, there's no reason why fathers can't play as big a nurture role as mothers. And researchers point out that a whole array of other gene determined traits - like intuiton and emotions - which can be inherited from the father are also key to unlocking potential intelligence, so fathers - don't despair.  More about: Science Genetics Mothers IQ Intelligence Inheritance Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

It is a reminder that value placed on intellectual, spiritual, or emotional faculties is culturally constructed. If the ancient Greeks valued physical prowess, reason and virtue, the Romans privileged valour; Chinese culture, influenced by Confucianism, appreciated calligraphy, archery, drawing and poetry.Models of intelligence The Harvard cognitive scientist and educational thinker Howard Gardner points out that it is only in the last few centuries in the West that the category of the “intelligent person” has come to become a pervasive, if evolving ideal. In traditional schools, intelligence implied the ability to master classical languages and mathematics, whereas in business settings, it translated into the ability to balance commercial risks and opportunities, build an organisation and keep the books. During the heyday of colonialism, the intelligent person was one who could be sent to the farthest corners of the empire and who could execute orders competently. One of the predominant models of an intelligent person to emerge at the turn of the twentieth century, according to Dr. Gardner, is the “symbol analyst”, a person who can sit for hours interpreting complex systems made of numbers, languages, and other codes and making projections based on them; the other is the “master of change”, one capable of acquiring new information and solving problems, forming “weak ties” with mobile and highly dispersed people, and adapting smoothly to changing circumstances. A look at educational systems around the world tells us that Asian schools cultivate the intelligence of the symbol analyst with visible success. Journalist Fareed Zakaria points out that students from Shanghai schools emerged as the best performers in the Programme for International Student Assessment administered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, two years ahead of the best-performing U.S. schools in Massachusetts. One reason behind this, as the then U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan argued, is that Chinese students spend 25 to 30 per cent more time a year in school than their American counterparts. Even so, Mr. Zakaria warns the U.S. against emulating the Asian educational system, which, as he recounts from his own experience in India, still remains oriented around test-taking and memorisation. The reason why even the Indian university system is structured around a similar preoccupation with test-taking and memorisation is simple: it valorises the kind of “intelligence” that was held to be of high value by those who set it up. That would be the British, who, in 1857, established the first modern Indian universities in the three Presidencies: Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. The intelligence essential at that point in history was connected to the needs of imperial administration. The purpose of the university was to train and, more importantly, to validate the intelligence essential to the making of government servants in large numbers. Due to a range of social and political pressures, the fundamental character of Indian universities never really changed even decades after decolonisation.Nurturing multiple intelligences The West, in the meantime, has continued to debate and deconstruct its own theories of intelligence. The greatest uproar in recent decades was caused by the publication, in 1994, of The Bell Curve, by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, which argued that intelligence is best thought of as a single property distributed within the general population along a bell-shaped curve. The book ignited a range of debates over the racial and class implications of the theory of intelligence and their distribution in society, as well as the relative importance of nature versus nurture in the making of an “intelligent” person. The key point of contention underlying much of the rancour was in fact a perpetual puzzle plaguing intelligence theories: is intelligence singular or plural? Is it a monolithic quality, or are there multiple kinds of intelligences that defeat the purpose of IQ and standardised tests? Dr. Gardner, in fact, is the most powerful contemporary proponent of the theory of multiple intelligences. He goes on to list seven fundamental intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, interpersonal, and intrapersonal — a list to which he adds three more later: naturalist, spiritual and existential. He reminds us that educational systems, from the primary to the university, privilege the first two intelligences over all others. The mastery of various disciplines, as well as that of symbolic systems valorised in contemporary culture, essentially build on variations of these two kinds. The wide influence of multiple intelligence theory has encouraged schools worldwide to re-envision their pedagogy and curricula in order to nurture other kinds of intelligence not accommodated by the traditional methods. It is far from a coincidence that business and corporate employers, especially those embedded in the new economies powered by digital culture, have started describing their ideal employee as a T-shaped individual, where the vertical bar represents deep knowledge or expertise and the horizontal stroke implies the ability of work across a variety of complex, sometimes mutually disparate subject areas. The T-shaped individual replaces the older model of the I-shaped individual, with demonstrated and certified aptitude in a single subject, whatever that subject may be. For the vast majority of students preparing for today’s economy, a broad education in multiple, mutually incongruent fields based on a fragmented model of intelligence should ideally bolster a chosen field of expertise.

 Nick Bostrom: London's DeepMind is winning the global race to develop human-level artificial intelligence Sam Shead Oct. 5, 2016, 8:44 AM 6,076 facebook linkedin twitter email print Oxford University professor and AI expert Nick Bostrom at the IP Expo tech conference.Business Insider/Sam Shead Nick Bostrom, one of the leading voices on artificial intelligence, has singled out London research lab DeepMind as the company closest to developing a system that can mimic human-level artificial intelligence — a target widely shared by those at the forefront of the AI industry. When asked who was leading the global AI race, Bostrom immediately responded with DeepMind. "Right now, I think here in London we have the DeepMind group who are, I think, the biggest [group] specifically focused on solving general intelligence," Bostrom told Business Insider at a breakfast meeting aboard the Sunbourn Yacht Hotel in East London on Wednesday. DeepMind, which employs approximately 250 people in King's Cross, was acquired by Google in 2014 for a reported £400 million. The organisation is perhaps best known for developing an AI agent that defeated the world champion of the ancient Chinese board, Go. However, it's now looking at applying its AI to other areas, including healthcare and energy management. Bostrom, who heads up Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute, named a number of other companies that are also aiming to develop general artificial intelligence. "Facebook has an effort," he said. "Baidu has an effort. Then there are some others. There is also the OpenAI group, which is a non-profit funded by Elon Musk and others." Bostrom believes that machines will reach human levels of intelligence within the next few decades. When asked for a more precise date, he pointed to a survey carried out among AI experts recently that shows they think machines will be as intelligent as humans by the year 2040. The Swedish philosopher explained that he was full of "hopes and fears" when asked whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about the impact AI will have on humanity. He expects the technology will be used for "good and bad." Bostrom's comments were made ahead of a talk he gave on AI at the IP Expo conference. In a press conference after his talk, Bostrom once again called out DeepMind as the world leader when he was asked to pick just "one horse." Companies are using several different approaches on their mission to develop human-level intelligence but the jury is still out on which one will prove to be the most successful, said Bostrom. DeepMind, for example, is using AI techniques involving neural networks, deep learning and reinforcement learning. A brief overview of these techniques can be listened to in this public lecture from DeepMind cofounder and CEO Demis Hassabis.

That’s the terrifying warning from a top academic and noted doom-monger who said we may have just 50 years to avert disaster. 3 Killer computers could be the worst thing that’s ever happened to humanity Nick Bostrom, head of the University of Oxford’s Future Of Humanity Institute, gave a talk today to tech industry insiders today at a conference called IP Expo in which he said that one slip up in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) could spell curtains for humans. The philosopher is on a mission to distinguish between the “science fiction scenarios suitable for a Saturday night movie” and more realistic eventualities which could actually pose a threat to our species. Competition to build a machine that’s has clever as humans will be fierce in the coming years, with considerable financial rewards on offer for the firm which manages to pull off this historical feat of achieving “machine intelligence”. But the scrabble to create this silicon-powered mind could lead to mistakes with disastrous consequences. “There is a control problem,” he said. “If you have a very tight tech race to get there first, whoever invests in safety could lose the race. “This could exacerbate the risks from out of control AI.” 3 Professor Stephen Hawking has warned that “full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race” Once computers are as intelligent as a human, is is likely there will be an “intelligence explosion” which sees the machines reach super-intelligence in a scarily short space of time. This process could begin in the next 50 years and once it’s kicked off there may not be any way to stop it. “One has very little ability at the end to slow down or pause for a few months to put extra safety features in place before we turn [the artificial intelligence] onto full blast,” Bostrom continued. When firms or individuals build AI-powered computers, programmers are able to shape how it thinks about the world and install certain limitations which would prevent it from going rogue and killing us all. However, when an AI is actually much more intelligent than humans, it would be able to analyse the computer code used to define its “personality” and then scan for loopholes which would allow it to behave in ways its creator did not intend. Film Company 3 Super-intelligent computers will inevitably seek to use robots to achieve their goals “If it wants to hack its way out [of its programming] by finding a flaw, then it will find a hack and achieve its goal,” the expert said. To illustrate his point, Bostrom gave the chilling example of a machine that’s built to make paperclips. If this machine is super-intelligent, it may decide that humans are standing in the way of its paperclip-building drive and kill us all to enhance its own productivity. So how would it do this? The academic said it was a “conservative assumption” that super-smart computers would be able to control “actuators”, which means armies of robots which do its bidding.

This resort in Montana teaches super rich how to prepare for a zombie apocalypse Murder machines would also be able to outwit humans by lying about their intentions as they quietly plot our destruction. The only way to stop the coming apocalypse is to make sure artificially intelligent machines are built in a way which ensures they don’t hate humans and are therefore unlikely to bring about our demise. Dr Bostrom said one way to do this is to work collaboratively on AIR, rather than getting locked in an arms race. “Getting a commitment that AI should be to the benefit of all is very desirable,” he added. “Even if the other guy gets their first, if the AI is going to be used to benefit you then that would reduce incentive to throw caution to the wind just to try and beat them.” We pay for your stories!

The findings reveal the social insects have a high level of intelligence, despite their tiny brains.  A study has shown bees are able to demonstrates high levels of intelligence, despite their brain size. Researchers managed to teach bumblebees to pull strings to get to food (pictured), with the bees then passing on what they had learned to others in their colony The team at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) said the experiments, often used to test the intelligence of apes and birds, showed for the first time that some insects are up to the task, and can also pass skills on through several generations. The findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting the capacity for 'culture spread' - in other words the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills - may not be exclusive to humans, but may also be in most animals, including insects.

Share this article Share 239 shares 'Cultural transmission does not require the high cognitive sophistication specific to humans, nor is it a distinctive feature of humans,' said Clint Perry, who co-led the study. In the research, published this week in the journal PLOS Biology, the scientists were able to train 23 out of a group of 40 bees to pull strings with their legs and feet. Bees were trained to pull strings with their legs in order to reach an 'artificial flower' - a disc containing food at its centre SMART BEES SHOW 'CULTURAL TRANSMISSION' In the study, researchers showed the insects were able to show evidence of 'cultural transmission', passing on knowledge and skills to others.  After training bees to pull strings with their legs in order to reach an 'artificial flower' for food, the insects were placed back in the colony. Other bees in the colony were seen to watch the trained bees and learn the technique from them. The researchers say it is the first time that the cultural spread of such a technique from one individual 'in the know' has been described in an invertebrate.  The strings were attached to discs - or artificial 'flowers' - containing food at their centre but positioned under a transparent screen.  The bees, detecting the food beneath the screen, learned to pull the 'flowers' out by tugging on the string with their legs and feet to be able to get to it. From another group of bees given the chance to solve the task without any training, only two of 110 were successful. Another group of bees was then allowed to observe the trained bees pulling the strings - and 60 per cent of them successfully learned the skill.  Finally, trained bees were put in colonies and the scientists found the technique spread successfully to a majority of the colony's worker bees. Lars Chittka, who supervised the project, said the team is ultimately keen to decipher the brain processes behind the bees' learning and teaching skills. 'How can they do it with such small brains, and how can their miniature nervous systems manage such a diversity of behaviours and cognitive tasks?,' he said.   Read more: PLOS Biology: Associative Mechanisms Allow for Social Learning and Cultural Transmission of String Pulling in an Insect Share or comment on this article e-mail 239 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Malcolm Turnbull accuses Lisa Wilkinson of 'interrogating' him SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Recently, I picked up an old book from my modest collection and started reading it — Noam Chomsky’s Understanding Power — all over again and was struck by a solitary paragraph that got me thinking. “Well, in our society, we have things that you might use your intelligence on, like politics, but people really can’t get involved in them in a very serious way — so what they do is they put their minds into other things, such as sports. You’re trained to be obedient; you don’t have an interesting job; there’s no work around for you that’s creative; in the cultural environment you’re a passive observer of usually pretty tawdry stuff; political and social life are out of your range, they’re in the hands of the rich folk. So what’s left? Well, one thing that’s left is sports — so you put a lot of the intelligence and the thought and the self-confidence into that. And I suppose that’s also one of the basic functions it serves in the society in general — it occupies the population, and keeps them from trying to get involved with things that really matter. In fact, I presume that’s part of the reason why spectator sports are supported to the degree they are by the dominant institutions,” writes the great linguist and cognitive scientist. In the hectic, soul-numbing, nerve-shattering pace of post-modern life, when our very sanity is tested every single day, when we think that we have to or ought to have time for everything that we desire, or are forced to desire, what do we make of sport? How do sports — playing them for a few, and watching them for many — help make our lives more meaningful? How do they contribute to the quality of our lived experience and embellish it with many of our more desirable emotions? For some, sport is the very reason life is worth living. For others, sport may be one of the principal reasons why we are not quite as enlightened as our potential might suggest we ought to be. But there still may be a few of us who think that it is absurd to even raise the question of sport’s meaning in our lives when the emotions triggered by sport are clearly the reasons for spending time although there may be a few young men who do little to improve productivity and even less to help us gain intellectual esteem. These thoughts must occur to us from time to time; but few of us think that pausing to address the big question is anything other than downright stupid. After all, we never ask ourselves why we eat, or why we love our children, or even why we hate our enemies. Recently, when a very senior retired army officer asked me what I did “with the rest of your [my] working life,’’ I laughed. And this is perhaps a logical or typical reaction from someone who has made a living watching and writing on sports for four decades. But if sports and their commendable reasons for sitting in the stadiums day in and day out are the exceptions to the rule, then it would much more be an appropriate answer to the question than what the lay fan(atic) may come up with. Sport, after all, means many things to many people and it would be almost impossible to find 10 or 20 fans give you the same answers when we pose this question: Why the hell do we waste so much time on sport when there are so many more basic as well as life-changing issues to which we can devote our precious time to during our short stay on this planet? Fills a critical gap But it would be a fallacy to believe that millions and millions of sports fans are wasting their time. For sport fills a critical gap or two in our lives and the great Chomsky is far off the mark, although we must admit there is a wee bit of truth in some of what he has said. Yet, consider the other bunch of the intellectuals who are die-hard sports lovers, and you would immediately admit that Chomsky is part of a minority even among outstanding achievers in the academia or literature. “Everything I know about morality and the obligations of men, I owe it to football,” wrote the great French existentialist philosopher and novelist Albert Camus. Of course, if you are caught up in the middle of a few drunken football hooligans in Britain or elsewhere in Europe on a bad night with the crowd surrounding you, all you might want to do is to run away from the sport that you have worshipped for a long time. But to judge football’s — or any other major sports’ — from an evolutionary point of view, and capacity to teach us morality and our duties as civilised men from a single undesirable situation would be ridiculous. It is only when you learn to enjoy sport at the intellectual level that you can aspire for a tiny bit of nobility and erudition of a Camus. For sport serves many purposes — enjoyment through entertainment, soul-satisfaction, enlightenment, camaraderie, fighting spirit and, most of all, the ability to rise above the mediocre and ordinary — and helps us live a well-examined life that Socrates advanced to his own peril.

Evan Rachel Wood in Westworld Rebecca Hawkes 5 October 2016 • 7:00am Would you have sex with a robot? An impromptu poll of colleagues and friends drew answers ranging from “yes, but only if it was a fully sentient, consenting robot” to “yes, but only if it wasn’t a sentient robot” to “yes, if I could program it and specify exactly what I wanted…no unexpected exploratory penetration, please”. (We’ve paraphrased that last one a little.) The enduring concept of human-robot intercourse – a concept that automatically seems to provoke queasy soul-searching and uncomfortable reflection – has been touched upon by films and TV shows from Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (technically about replicants, but the human/non-human conundrum still holds), to Channel  4’s Humans, to Alex Garland’s dark 2015 drama Ex Machina. Gemma Chan as the robot Anita in Channel 4's Humans Credit: Gary Moyes/Kudos Now HBO’s new sci-fi series Westworld, set in a futuristic theme park (and inspired by Michael Crichton’s 1973 film), depicts human visitors having sex (not always consensual) with the attraction’s lifelike robot hosts. The bleak implication is that, given the opportunity to “rape” without consequences, humans would do just that. But is it really possible to rape a robot? And how soon will such technology exist outside the realm of sci-fi films and TV shows? Thandie Newton in Westworld Depressingly (or fascinatingly, depending on your viewpoint), one engineer and futurist believes that, by the year 2050, human-robot sex could be more common than the human-on-human variety. "A lot of people will still have reservations about sex with robots at first but gradually as they get used to them, as the AI and mechanical behaviour and their feel improves, and they start to become friends with strong emotional bonds,  that squeamishness will gradually evaporate” Dr Ian Pearson explained last year, after releasing a report in conjunction with sex toy manufacturers Bondara. "While some people will enthusiastically embrace relationship-free robot sex as soon as they can afford one, as early as 2025, it won’t have much chance of overtaking sex with humans overall until 2050." Harrison Ford and Sean Young in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner Elsewhere, a sex doll manufacturer is already exploring some of the ways in which AI technology could be used to enhance his product. Matt McMullen, whose US-based Real Doll company promises customers “the world’s finest love dolls” and specialises in custom-made companions (you can even order a doll with bespoke toes, according to a New York Times profile), believes that his Realbotix project could be on the market by 2017. As the NYT video above explains, the new dolls will feature “convincing artificial intelligence” and “a robotic head that can blink and open and close its mouth”, which will be attached to one of the company’s existing artificial bodies. In the future, McMullen hopes to create a fully animated, fully responsive body, connected to the “intelligent” head. 10 ways humans are still superior to robots It’s worth noting, however, that the Real Doll entrepreneur only wants to create a “convincing” impression of intelligence, rather than intelligence itself. The advanced sexbots he’s envisaging might be able to hold an X-rated Siri-style chat with their human masters, but they probably won’t plotting world domination anytime soon. And the question of whether or not they would actually want to have sex feels about as pressing as the question of whether or not a toaster wants to…well, toast. Likewise, in a 2015 piece for the Telegraph, Ex Machina consultant and geneticist Adam Rutherford suggested that truly intelligent, truly sentient robots are still a long way off. “Human-level consciousness is unlikely to be realised in the immediate future, largely because it isn’t the main aim of AI research,” he wrote. “The idea of the singularity, the point at which AI surpasses all levels of human consciousness, is generally an area for armchair speculation. Mostly scientists are building intelligent systems for specific functions. When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997, it was a landmark in machine intelligence. But Deep Blue couldn’t play a single round of noughts and crosses.” Alicia Vikander in Ex Machina Credit: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock Despite this, some experts believe that if we’re moving towards a world in which humans can have sex with non-sentient humanoid robots, introducing a consent element is crucial. In a discussion with Inverse, in a recent article about the future of robot-human relations, Dr Kate Darling, a scientist and expert on the way we interact with robots, explains that it isn’t so much the androids she’s worried about, as the knock-on effect on the people who use them. Would allowing people to “rape” robots encourage a taste for sexual violence in real life?  “[The] question is, if it does have an impact on people’s perceptions of consent and their behaviour toward humans, what’s the best way to go about preventing that?” she told the website, before suggesting that programming a sex robot to sometimes say no might be socially and emotionally beneficial for its human partner (or owner/ "user"). Of course, the ability to act out violent scenarios in a non-real world is arguably already open to us: many video games allow players to “fire” a gun and “kill” an animated opponent. Less commonly, and more controversially, there have also been video games that require the user to to take on the role of a rapist: a 2006 Japanese game called Rapelay, in which the aim is to stalk and attack female victims, made headlines in 2009 after it sparked complaints and was withdrawn from Amazon. Evan Rachel Wood and James Marsden in Westworld Credit: Pictorial Press Ltd / Alamy  But Patrick Lin, the director of the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic University, has emphasised the fact that, because interactive humanoid robot technology would be unlike anything we have previously experienced, we don’t know whether or not permitting "robot rape" scenarios would have an adverse moral effect on people. “The fear is that people will become less in the habit of seeking consent and more into imposing their will and desires on others,” he told Inverse. “I don’t think these fears have played out, but robots and virtual reality are much more immersive and visceral than previous technologies, so we don’t really know.” In other words, if we ever create a real-life Westworld, we may want to think about some built-in safeguards first.   Follow Telegraph Entertainment READ MORE ABOUT: Westworld Artificial Intelligence Sex Show more Editor's Choice Gallery 13 Nov 2016, 3:33pm Gallery: From Leon Russell to Prince: culture stars who died in 2016 12 Nov 2016, 10:52am Robert Vaughn was one of the greats and a superb interviewee: a personal tribute 11 Nov 2016, 6:49pm An Inspector Calls review: Stephen Daldry's classic production still speaks to the moment 4 11 Nov 2016, 5:41pm From School of Rock to Rod Stewart: what to see, do and hear this week (Nov 12-18)  01:06 11 Nov 2016, 10:20am Leonard Cohen, poet of sex and death, made music to nourish the soul Premium TV latest 14 Nov 2016, 7:07am I'm a Celebrity...

Humans come first. (Though there are days when we have to wonder.) After Homo sapiens, most people might answer chimpanzees, and then maybe dogs and dolphins. But what of birds? The science writer Jennifer Ackerman offers a lyrical testimony to the wonders of avian intelligence in her new book, “The Genius of Birds.” There have long been hints of bird smarts, but it’s become an active field of scientific inquiry, and Ackerman serves as tour guide. She answered questions from Mind Matters editor Gareth Cook. What drew you to birds? I’ve watched birds for most of my life. I admire all the usual things about them. Their plumage and song. Their intense way of living. Their flight. I also admire their resourcefulness and pluck. I’ve always been intrigued by their apparently smart behavior, whether learned or innate. Jennifer Ackerman Credit: Bob Llewellyn I grew up in Washington, D.C. — the second youngest in a gaggle of five girls. My parents had precious little time for one-on-one. Especially my dad, who had a demanding government job. So when he asked me if I wanted to go birdwatching with him one spring morning when I was seven or eight, I jumped at the chance. It was magical, going out in the dark woods along the C&O canal and listening for bird song. My father had learned his calls and songs in Boy Scout camp from an expert, an elderly Greek man named Apollo, so he was pretty good at identifying birds, even the shy woodland species. Eventually he gave me my own copy of Peterson’s Field Guide, along with a small pair of binoculars. I’ve loved birds ever since. My first run in with a clever bird was on our dining room table. We had a pet parakeet, a budgerigar named Gre-Gre, who was allowed to fly around the dining room and perch on our head or shoulders. He had a kind of social genius. He made you love him. But at breakfast, it was impossible to eat your cereal without his constant harassment. He liked to perch on the edge of my bowl and peck at the cereal, flapping his wings frantically to keep his balance, splashing my milk. I’d build a barricade of boxes around my place setting, but he always found a way in, moving a box or popping over the top. He was a good problem-solver. Years later, I began noticing stories and reports from laboratories and field studies suggesting that birds were in fact far smarter than we thought. I got interested, read up, and began interviewing the scientists studying bird brains and cognition. What these scientists are learning is truly amazing. Especially when you consider how small a bird brain is: on average, about the size of a walnut. You write that in some ways bird intelligence comparable to primate intelligence. What do you mean by that? Birds have a number of mental skills that match those of primates—solving problems, crafting tools, planning ahead for future events, even considering another being’s state of mind. They can do these things even though their brains are a fraction of the size of a primate’s. This is especially true of parrots and corvids, the family that includes crows, ravens, magpies, and jays. Take the ability to recognize yourself in the mirror. We used to think this kind of self-awareness was limited to some of the great apes, as well as dolphins and elephants. But magpies can do it too. Paint a red dot on a magpie’s breast, and when it sees its reflection in the mirror, it will look down at its own breast and peck at the red spot. Or mental time travel, the ability to remember the past and plan for the future. We thought this was our own special cognitive triumph. But it turns out that we share this ability with members of the corvid family. Like western scrub jays. These are birds that cache—they hide a variety of foods in stashes and then return to them later. The jays have a remarkable capacity to remember what they cached where, when they did it, and who was watching. That’s called episodic memory, and we once imagined it was a uniquely human skill. Birds can reason, too, in some cases as well as a child. New Caledonian crows “get” that stones will displace water and light sticks won’t—a pretty sophisticated understanding, on par with a child five or six years old. This ability to grasp the basic physical properties of objects underlies a New Caledonian crow’s skills at making sophisticated tools, which rivals the big primate toolmakers like chimpanzees and orangutans. In primates, sophisticated cognitive skills like these are controlled by the cerebral cortex. Birds don’t have a cortex, so it was assumed they weren’t capable of such complex mental tasks. So how do they do it? The new insights into this are truly fascinating and hint at how intelligence arises in the brain. Can you give some examples of the social intelligence birds display? Empathy is a big one. Ravens appear to be responsive to the emotional states of other ravens, especially mates or other allies. If one bird is the victim of a conflict, others will console it with gestures such as preening or bill twining. Then there’s delayed gratification. This is often used as a measure of social or emotional intelligence in humans because it involves self-control, persistence, self-motivation. You remember the famous Stanford marshmallow experiments? Something like 600 young children were offered one marshmallow (or some other treat) to eat right away or two if they waited 15 minutes. Only a third of the kids delayed gratification long enough to get the second treat. Crows and ravens are masters at this kind of self-control. They’ll turn down a reward now for a better one later. My favorite example of social intelligence occurs in Eurasian jays, relatives of our blue jays and scrub jays. These birds seem to understand the mental states of their mates. A male Eurasian jay brings food to his mate. It’s a way of courting. But here’s the cool thing: He makes choices about what he thinks she may like, based not on his own appetites but on what she has eaten before. (“She’s had too many doughnuts; I’ll bring her some fruit!” — only the food in question here is meal worms and similar goodies.) He appears to understand that she has a mind with desires that differ from his own. This is a critical component of the social intelligence called “theory of mind,” which is the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, knowledge, desires—to others. And to understand that these states may differ from your own, which some consider the foundation of empathy. These are just a few instances. There are many, many other examples of birds with surprising, mind-blowing kinds of smarts.

(Viv Labs) Shares3 Thu, 6 Oct 2016-11:00pm , AFP The company has just bought over an AI startup named Viv Labs. Samsung has bought Viv Labs, an AI startup that developed a voice assistant capable of responding to natural language, marking a clear step forward in the firm's artificial intelligence strategy. According to Injong Rhee, CTO of Samsung's mobile communications business, the tech giant's aim is to offer customers the best user experience across all its products and in all situations. Beyond boosting the brand's upcoming smartphones, the Viv acquisition could potentially bring AI technology to all the South Korean tech firm's products (TVs, fridges, etc.). With Viv's technology, Samsung hopes to offer to its users a simplified and intelligent interface, and an AI-based virtual assistant that understands the user's context and offers the most appropriate and convenient suggestions and recommendations. Samsung's strategy echoes the recent announcements made by Google, whose freshly unveiled Pixel smartphones are the first to come with its new virtual assistant. This is much more advanced than Google Now, and can analyze elements displayed onscreen or in the device history to anticipate certain actions or requests. Artificial intelligence is one of the major fields of development in tech world. In this respect, Viv stands out from the competition as an open ecosystem that doesn't just offer preprogrammed replies. Instead, it writes them itself, as it goes along, and is capable of responding to questions formulated in natural language. According to its creators, Viv can, for example, answer a complex question with several elements, such as: "Will it be warmer than 70 degrees near Golden Gate Bridge after 5PM the day after tomorrow?" The assistant corroborates a multitude of contextual information from the internet to formulate the most intelligible and accurate reply possible. Viv even writes its own code, evolving each time it answers new questions, whereas other voice assistants simply search for readymade answers. In fact, Viv promises to constantly hone its relevancy over time. Viv stands apart from other current voice assistants, which, as yet, are much more limited in their abilities. Current rivals include Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Echo.

According to Injong Rhee, CTO of Samsung's mobile communications business, the tech giant's aim is to offer customers the best user experience across all its products and in all situations. Beyond boosting the brand's upcoming smartphones, the Viv acquisition could potentially bring AI technology to all the South Korean tech firm's products (TVs, fridges, etc.). With Viv's technology, Samsung hopes to offer to its users a simplified and intelligent interface, and an AI-based virtual assistant that understands the user's context and offers the most appropriate and convenient suggestions and recommendations. Samsung's strategy echoes the recent announcements made by Google, whose freshly unveiled Pixel smartphones are the first to come with its new virtual assistant. This is much more advanced than Google Now, and can analyze elements displayed onscreen or in the device history to anticipate certain actions or requests. Artificial intelligence is one of the major fields of development in tech world. In this respect, Viv stands out from the competition as an open ecosystem that doesn't just offer preprogrammed replies. Instead, it writes them itself, as it goes along, and is capable of responding to questions formulated in natural language. According to its creators, Viv can, for example, answer a complex question with several elements, such as: "Will it be warmer than 70 degrees near Golden Gate Bridge after 5PM the day after tomorrow?" The assistant corroborates a multitude of contextual information from the internet to formulate the most intelligible and accurate reply possible. Viv even writes its own code, evolving each time it answers new questions, whereas other voice assistants simply search for readymade answers. In fact, Viv promises to constantly hone its relevancy over time. Viv stands apart from other current voice assistants, which, as yet, are much more limited in their abilities. Current rivals include Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Echo. Ironically, Viv Labs was co-founded by Dag Kittlaus and Adam Cheyer, who previously helped create Siri, which became Apple's voice assistant and a key rival for Samsung.

(Image: Alamy) Omnicom Media Group’s PHD is hosting its annual BrainScape conference on October 12 at the Armani Hotel in Dubai. This year’s conference focuses on artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications on the marketing industry. The conference will also mark the regional launch of the global media network’s latest book, Sentience: The Coming AI Revolution and the Implications for Marketing. The book features contributions by Choueiri, as well as PHD’s director of digital data solutions, Haroon Syed. With the rise of virtual personal assistants (VPAs) and the increasing role technology plays in consumers’ lives, the way brands communicate with consumers and influence purchase decisions is undergoing drastic changes. Since AI applications will be largely ad-supported, marketing is naturally one of the first disciplines to be disrupted by AI. This year’s edition of BrainScape will construct a comprehensive look at the future of intelligence, including products as well as advertising and data models that will support them. Among the key speakers will be Kevin Slavin, assistant professor of media arts and sciences at MIT Media Lab, renowned for his talks on how algorithms will shape our world. “This is an incredibly exciting time to work in marketing as we undergo a revolutionary transformation of what we are capable of achieving, thanks to developments in AI,” says Elda Choucair, managing director of PHD UAE. PHD’s BrainScape conference is produced with Choueiri Group’s dedicated digital media representation arm, Digital Media Services (DMS), as strategic partner. “It’s very encouraging to see how well BrainScape was received last year. The future really does belong to those who can seize it before it appears,” says Michel Malkoun, chief operating officer of DMS.

This engaging study has the latest thinking on the intelligence of humans and other animals Model behaviour … a silverback gorilla observes its own reflection. Photograph: Xavier Hubert-Brierre/Johns Hopkins University Press Matthew Cobb Thursday 6 October 2016 03.00 EDT Last modified on Friday 7 October 2016 19.05 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger In 1747 the French doctor and philosopher Julien Offray de La Mettrie suggested we might, using sign language, teach great apes to speak. He justified this proposal by stating that from “animals to man there is no abrupt transition … What was man before he invented words and learnt languages? An animal of a particular species.” In his fine book, the Dutch-American primatologist Frans de Waal pursues this line of thinking, not so much to see if apes can use language (they can, although only at a very low level), but to show that there is no clear behavioural division between ourselves and other animals. Do you care about animals? Then you really shouldn't eat octopus | Elle Hunt Read more Virtually every characteristic that has been claimed to be uniquely human has eventually turned out to have some kind of a precursor in a close relative. As De Waal explains in a series of engaging accounts, language, self-recognition, tool making, empathy, co-operative behaviour, mental time-travel, culture and many other traits and abilities have turned out not to be exclusively human. This is hardly surprising, given that we evolved from an ape ancestor not so long ago: we share behaviour with our relatives, just as we share anatomy. De Waal is not interested in showing what animals cannot do, but rather what they can do, and clarifying why. He has made a video, as part of a TED talk, in which a pair of capuchin monkeys in adjoining cages each offer a human a token in return for a piece of fruit. One monkey gets a much-desired grape in return for their “work”; the other gets a piece of cucumber, which capuchins are not so impressed by. The monkey that gets the cucumber looks across at the other monkey and its grape, apparently becomes outraged, throws the cucumber at the experimenter and shakes the bars of its cage with frustration. The TED audience laughs at this, but what it confirms is that capuchins show inequality aversion. If they are not treated fairly – equal pay for equal work, in this case – then they protest. All human societies, no matter how unequal in reality, have the same moral basis. People all over the world tell their children “be nice to each other”, “share”, “do as you would be done by”, and so on. And as any parent knows, children are acutely averse to inequality – not just when it affects them negatively, but also displaying generosity toward the have-nots. De Waal’s experiment revealed that something like this key feature of human psychology and morality also exists in the furry heads of members of a primate lineage that separated from our own more than 40m years ago. To understand why animals – and humans – behave the way they do, we need to look at their natural history. In his opening section, De Waal highlights the work of the early 20th-century German biologist Jakob von Uexküll, who argued that, before we can correctly interpret the behaviour of an animal, we need to understand the animal’s Umwelt, or “surrounding world”. For Uexküll, and for De Waal, ecology explains everything – it includes not only the physical environment, but also the animal’s sensory and social worlds. Humans, capuchins and many other primates are inequality averse because their social systems are built on reciprocity. This in turn can be explained by the particular ecology the species evolved in, and the existence of genes that, in unknown and complex ways, produce the structures and chemicals that enable these social behaviours to occur. De Waal does not explore the underlying processes producing the complex and intriguing behaviours described here: we know very little about them. Instead, he focuses on observations and behavioural experiments from the growing field of evolutionary cognition. These allow us to peer into the minds of non-human animals – mainly social animals such as primates and corvids (crows and their relatives), but also dolphins, elephants and one invertebrate, which differs from the others not only in its anatomy but also in its solitary behaviour: the octopus. De Waal’s holistic and empathetic approach to animals contrasts starkly with the arid dead end of BF Skinner’s behaviourism, which dominated studies of animal behaviour in the second half of the 20th century and banished all talk of feelings or mind, looking instead at learned behavioural responses. Despite his hostility to Skinner, De Waal slices through overcomplex explanations of animal behaviour – he describes how various animals respond appropriately to quite detailed sentences spoken by keepers or experimenters, but argues that they probably did not understand the exact words, but instead interpreted vocal tone, body language and gestures. Being confident as to when to embrace a more complex description of animal behaviour is clearly something of an art. The lesson of De Waal’s book is that something like teaching will eventually be seen in our ape cousins One aspect of behaviour not dealt with in the book, and which for the moment does remain uniquely human, is teaching. To impart knowledge involves realising what someone else does not know and working out how to get them to understand it. All tool making and culture in animals seems so far to involve observational learning, not active teaching. The lesson of De Waal’s book, however, is that something like teaching will eventually be seen in our ape cousins. He skirts around the central question that many readers will be most intrigued by – the nature of consciousness, and its potential existence in non-human animals. His explanation for this approach is simple: he is not sure what consciousness is (no one is), and so it is hard to see how to study it or to devise an experiment that could test for its presence. The best proxy we have for consciousness is the mirror self-recognition test: this involves getting an animal used to a mirror and then putting a mark somewhere on its body where it cannot be seen directly. If the animal shows behaviour directed towards the hidden mark when it is looking in the mirror, then it has passed the test. But what that implies is unclear. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Watch how animals respond to their reflections The list of animals that can pass this test is very short: humans, chimps, bonobos, gorillas (though they really do not like the eye contact the mirror involves), orangutans, dolphins, an Indian elephant called Happy (African elephants are hard to study as they tend to smash up the mirror), and a particularly smart magpie called Gertie. As well as touching artificial marks, these animals will also use the mirror outside of the experiment, to inspect body parts they cannot normally see – the inside of their mouths, or their backsides. They clearly know what they are doing. When I was growing up, aspiring naturalists or behavioural scientists would be given a copy of Konrad Lorenz’s zoological investigation King Solomon’s Ring to inspire them. With its wide-ranging and thought-provoking content, Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? is an appropriate 21st-century replacement. If you are at all interested in what it is to be an animal, human or otherwise, you should read this book. • Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are? is published by Granta.

Everybody. The reflexive deep, jaw-stretching inhale followed by a pause and a forced exhalation is pretty much ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, at least among creatures with the right anatomy for it. It’s not clear why we yawn – or when our ancestors started the refreshing routine – but many scientists believe the action serves to cool down the brain. Brains use a lot of energy, and they run hot. Inhaling a rush of cool, ambient air chills the blood, and the widening of the jaw sends a nice blast of that breezy blood into the brain. If yawning cools certain parts of the brain, it makes sense that larger brains ... require longer yawns Elainie Alenkær Madsen, Lund University A new study in Biology Letters could add further support to this popular theory. If bigger yawns produce a greater cooling effect, the study authors hypothesised, then animals with bigger brains – and therefore more brain tissue to cool down – would produce more sustained yawns. Their data suggests that this is indeed the case. Forget the dream of having big brains and brawn; big brains and yawn is much cooler. Led by Andrew Gallup of the State University of New York at Oneonta, who has long investigated this possible brain cooling mechanism, researchers studied 29 mammals whose brain weights had been documented. They tracked down videos of these animals yawning – mostly on YouTube – to calculate the average length of their yawns. When the team crunched the numbers, they found that brain weight and “cortical neuron number” – the number of brain cells in the outer layer known as the cortex – were reliable predictors of yawn length, more reliable than total body size or relative brain size. Gorillas, camels, horses, lions, walruses and African elephants were all found to have shorter yawns than humans despite their massive sizes, which makes sense because their brains are smaller than ours. In other words, the length of a yawn doesn’t seem to correlate to the size of your body. It seems to correlate to the size of your brain. “Consistent with these results, we also found that primates tend to have longer and more variable yawn durations compared with other mammals,” the study authors write, even though some of the non-primates they studied opened their jaws wider. “If yawning cools certain parts of the brain, it makes sense that larger brains with more cortical neurons require longer yawns and more influx of air,” Elainie Alenkær Madsen of Lund University, who was not involved in the new study, told the Atlantic. “It’s a very nice and intuitive finding.” Not all scientists are convinced that yawns exist to cool the brain. Yawns have a tendency to be contagious, even among non-human animals – and there’s some evidence that yawns are more catching among animals that experience empathy for patient zero of the yawn epidemic. Because of this strange social reflex, some researchers believe that yawns are actually some kind of communicative signal – something that evolved for psychological reasons, not physiological ones. But the answer might be somewhere in the middle: Perhaps all animals developed yawns to keep ever-expanding brains cooled down, and only humans and their closest kin have developed a secondary emotional use for the reflex. “Whether yawning functions specifically to cool the brain can still be debated but there is no debate on whether yawning has thermoregulatory consequences,” Gallup said. One potential limit of the new study is kind of hard to believe: there weren’t enough videos of these cute little guys yawning on the internet for an analysis as statistically robust as the study authors would have liked. Further studies could endeavour to observe these yawns in person to get more data. But if you happen to know a capuchin monkey, keep a camera on him the next time he gets sleepy – it’s for science.

Speaking at IP Expo Nick Bostrom who leads Oxford University’s Future of Humanity Institute gave some insight into the future of AI. His team are specifically looking into one area which seems to have been swept under the carpet recently: how will super-intelligent computers impact the human condition in a positive or even detrimental way? It is very doom-and-gloom and usually a topic that is relegated to the comment boards of the Daily Mail but it is a question worth considering. Can we control computers when their own intelligence supersedes our own? Although there are different thoughts on the development of super computers throughout the academic and commercial world, one area is firmly agreed: development is accelerating, and accelerating at a faster pace year-on-year. Bostrom’s team has conducted a substantial amount of research over the last few months to identify how quickly AI is actually growing. The general consensus is AI will match, if not exceed human intelligence at some point within the next 15-50 years. That maybe a big window, however it is potentially within a generation. Once this point has been reached, the continued growth towards super-intelligence will only get faster. How to define the objectives of artificial intelligence and then how to ensure the computer completes these objectives correctly is a key issue. What control methods need to be put into place? Bostrom highlighted any control method which defines the perimeters of the machine would have to be highly scalable, which the community has not achieved to date. If the control methods are not scalable, once a computer reaches a suitable level of intelligence, there is nothing stopping it from retrospectively reprogramming its parameters. Now this may seem drastic, but you have to consider what scientists want to achieve with AI. With machine learning constantly redefining how the computer interacts with the world and dynamically altering decision making processes, how can the engineer ensure the machine is continuing to interact within the parameters originally set? Who is to say an intelligent machine wouldn’t find a loop-hole in the control methods, and redefine the way in which it meets its objectives? Will a computer act illegally to achieve objectives if it deems the actions necessary? Some humans would, and if we are aiming to replicate human behaviour and consciousness, why wouldn’t a machine if it means completing its sole objective if there is no other way at the time? This is down to morality. What is right, what is wrong, what is illegal, what is legal but highly frowned upon, what is culturally acceptable, what is PC, what is rude, what is inconsiderate. These are all questions relevant to the individual and critical to that individual’s sense of morality. This sense of morality will vary so who defines what morality is when translating into computer language to act as a control method for artificial intelligence? Now this is a conversation which is happening between sci-fi geeks and the ultimate pessimists throughout the world, but it is one which should be considered very seriously not only by industry, but governments around the world. Bostrom knows there is a solution, but he also claims something else. AI will have the same profound impact on the human condition as the agricultural and industrial revolution. Most of us just haven’t figured that out yet.

Researchers at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) said the experiments, often used to test the intelligence of apes and birds, showed for the first time that some insects are up to the task, and can also pass skills on through several generations. The findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting the capacity for “culture spread” — in other words the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills — may not be exclusive to humans, but may also be in most animals, including insects. “Cultural transmission does not require the high cognitive sophistication specific to humans, nor is it a distinctive feature of humans,” said Clint Perry, who co-led the study. In the research, published in the journal PLOS Biology yesterday, the scientists were able to train 23 out of a group of 40 bees to pull strings with their legs and feet. The strings were attached to discs — or artificial “flowers” — containing food at their centre but positioned under a transparent screen. The bees, detecting the food beneath the screen, learned to pull the “flowers” out by tugging on the string with their legs and feet to be able to get to it. From another group of bees given the chance to solve the task without any training, only two of 110 were successful. Another group of bees was then allowed to observe the trained bees pulling the strings — and 60 per cent of them successfully learned the skill. Finally, trained bees were put in colonies and the scientists found the technique spread successfully to a majority of the colony's worker bees. Lars Chittka, a QMUL professor who supervised the project, said the team is ultimately keen to decipher the brain processes behind the bees' learning and teaching skills. “How can they do it with such small brains, and how can their miniature nervous systems manage such a diversity of behaviours and cognitive tasks?,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Supermoon rises in Spain (VIDEO) Designer Christmas trees go under the hammer for charity Ancient undamaged mummy found in Egypt tomb First posthumous Rauschenberg retrospective opening in London Bolivian designer exports high-end indigenous fashion Elephants kneel to pay respect to late Thai king Bhumibol ‘Rose Gold’ is this winter’s hottest hair trend What it is like being a 24-year-old female farmer in Singapore Blood pressure spike around doctors might point to heart problem Hilarious Singaporean take on BBC’s ‘Iguana vs Snake’ documentary (VIDEO) Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Two killed as powerful earthquake hits New Zealand Reuters Video: F1 fans watch as Hamilton wins for first time in Brazil Reuters Video: Supermoon rises in Spain Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Related Articles Taiwan beekeepers battle to cash in on pure honey buzz US adds first bees to endangered species list Sugar gives bees a happy buzz, study finds The mystery of a bee’s buzz (VIDEO) Millions of US bees die from spray to fight Zika mosquitoes Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

 MIT is developing a method to train self-driving cars to make morally right decisions Digital Trends Oct. 6, 2016, 7:44 PM 1,123 facebook linkedin twitter email print This May 13, 2015 file photo shows the front of Google's new self-driving prototype car during a demonstration at the Google campus in Mountain View, Calif. AP Photo/Tony Avelar We humans err and err often. If it is not a small mistake like leaving the keys in the fridge, then it is a deadly one like leaving the oven on all day. We tend to be reckless, forgetful, overconfident, easily distracted — dangerous traits when steering a two-ton, metal machine across lanes at 70 mph. Four out of the top five causes for car crashes are the result of human error. Computers, on the other hand, have purely pragmatic minds. They sense data and react in programmed, calculated ways.  Self-driving cars already seem to be safer than humans behind the wheel. The rate of progress in artificial intelligence over the past few years has some experts claiming that driving a car will be made illegal by 2030. But, as most drivers know, driving can require split-second decisions with no obvious right answer. A squirrel darts into the road — do you swerve and risk hitting other cars or drive straight and hope the squirrel survives. How would you react if a dog ran into the road? Or a criminal? Or a child? Which lives are worth risking? These questions are being asked by teams of researchers around the world. Now they are looking to you for answers. “Self-driving cars are now practically inevitable,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student and research assistant Sohan Dsouza told Digital Trends. “That is a good thing, generally, because they would help save countless lives now being lost daily due to human driver error and can offer independent mobility to countless others who cannot drive.” To that end, Dsouza, Edmond Awad, and their team at the MIT Media Lab developed Moral Machine, a platform that engages users in moral dilemmas and asks them how the self-driving car should respond. A handful of factors play into each scenario, including the age and gender of victims, their social status, and whether they are breaking the law. Participants are asked to make decisions in 13 dilemmas. The results then pooled as crowdsourced data and may one day be used to guide the development of ethical machines. After judging the dilemmas, users can compare their outcomes to others’ and even design their own for others to answer. “One of our primary goals is provoking debate among the public,” Dsouza said, “and especially dialogue among users, manufacturers, insurers, and transport authorities. This file photo taken Tuesday, May 13, 2014 shows a row of Google self-driving cars outside the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. AP Photo/Eric Risberg “Not all crashes can be avoided, and the possibility remains that machine intelligence piloting vehicles may have to deal with situations where someone has to die so someone else can live — rather like the classic philosophical thought experiment known as the trolley problem.” The trolley problem has been pondered for nearly 50 years. In it, a train car is en route to hit five people down the track. You have a switch that can steer the trolley down another set of tracks, where it will hit only one person. Would you intervene or do nothing? “There are very few experiment-based studies regarding this possibility,” Dsouza said. “Hence, we needed to create a platform that would be able to generate large numbers of multi-factor scenarios and present them to users in an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use, and engaging way, so as to build a model of how people perceive the morality of machine-made decisions.” Moral Machine has gathered answers on more than 11 million scenarios so far. Although the team has yet to perform a deep analysis, they are noticing regional trends that hint at the rocky road ahead. “On average, respondents from western countries place a relatively higher value on minimizing the number of overall casualties — that is, they approve more utilitarian choices — compared to respondents from eastern countries,” Dsouza said. Revealing these cultural discrepancies fosters debate and dialogue, which is essential to making progress. “We believe we have already made an impact,” Dsouza said. “This dialogue will eventually help the stakeholders in this scene reach an equilibrium of legislation, liability assessment, moral comfort, and public safety.” Read the original article on Digital Trends.

I barely use voice assistants, but it's hard to argue that the tech top dogs think they're the way forward. Amazon and Google are currently battling for control of the living room with Echo and Google Home, and Siri, Google Now and Cortana are competing on mobile, so it's perhaps no surprise to see Samsung beefing up its own offering. And that's exactly what the Galaxy phone maker has done with the purchase of Viv Labs, the team behind the artificial-intelligence software Viv, which aims to handle your everyday tasks without any intervention. You may not have heard of Viv – it's yet to launch – but you'll be familiar with its founders' work. Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham were the brains behind Siri, but they left Apple two years after the acquisition to found Viv. It hasn't been revealed how much the Samsung paid for the company, but it's understood that Viv and its 50 or so San Jose-based employees will continue to work independently of the Samsung mothership. Video of [Interview] Dag Kittlaus, Co-founder and CEO of Viv, Discusses the Future of AI with Samsung   What will this actually mean for Samsung? Well, presumably in the short term it's hoping that people will stop using Google Now on its flagship phones, but there could be more than that too. If Amazon Echo and Google Home take off, then Samsung could try its own version, but there's no reason to stop there either. Unlike Apple or HTC, Samsung devices are all over the house, from televisions to washing machines. Viv could sit within all these devices, adding a sprinkling of artificial intelligence throughout your house. Viv Labs claims that Viv is not your average artificial intelligence, and is able to write its own code to complete new tasks as they appear – something they call “dynamic program generation”. As it hasn't yet launched, it's hard to speculate as to how impressive this will be in practice, but Samsung clearly sees potential there. It may be a few years yet before we see any practical commercial benefits, but this is an unambiguous statement of intent against Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.

ADVERTISEMENT Viv labs has developed a unique, open AI platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned applications and services. Samsung wants to use Viv in its phones, TVs and other devices. “The deal showcases Samsung’s commitment to virtual personal assistants and is part of the company’s broader vision to deliver an AI-based open ecosystem across all of its devices and services,” the company said in a statement.

AI can now play Mortal Kombat better than you By Matt Burgess Viv’s chief executive officer, Dag Kittlaus, was part of the team that developed Siri, the digital assistant Apple bought in 2010. Kittalus worked at Apple for three years after the acquisition before leaving to create Viv in 2012. In the public demo of Viv earlier this year, Kittlaus said he wanted the system to be “the intelligence interface for everything.” Viv says it is building the “simplest way for anyone to talk to devices and services everywhere”. “We see a future that is decidedly beyond apps – where you can get what you need quickly and easily no matter where you are,” added Kittlaus.

Long live the subservient bots ready to fulfil your every desire By James Temperton The AI platform is supposed to be more interconnected than other agents, like Siri. It can interact with multiple silos of information across apps and services to start talking to one another and become links in a user’s command chain. The programmatic nature of its back-end systems means that Viv’s AI is capable of writing its own code to accomplish new tasks. Viv calls this “dynamic program generation”. Earlier this week, Google launched its new AI personal assistant, which will be incorporated into its new Pixel smartphones and Home speaker. ADVERTISEMENT It will use Google’s search technology to find answers from the internet before they are read out to the user. Google's Assistant is also able to tap into its other services. Once permission is granted, the AI can scan emails, calendars, files, and personal photos held in other Google products. Amazon has also ventured into the AI market with its personal voice assistant Alexa, recently launched in the UK. Alexa is part of its Amazon Echo range, voice-activated home audio speaker systems with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It is always learning to adapt to speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences.

The trio were found unfit to stand trial due to intellectual disabilities and instead a special hearing in the Supreme Court of Victoria is underway which will determine if they committed the crime. Mr Fairest and Ms Fields have pleaded not guilty, while Mr Toohey has pleaded not guilty on grounds of mental impairment, Australia’s ABC News reports. The court heard that CCTV cameras in the foyer and lift of their apartment building captured the trio using sign language to discuss the murder of Mr Wright. Prosecutor Christopher Dane QC told the court: “Ms Firleds asked Mr Fairest ‘you want dead or alive and how die?’ “Mr Fairest signs ‘can strangle neck area, what do you think?’ “Mr Toohey signs to Mr Fairest ‘strangle risky’, and Ms Fields signs ‘fall good, fall good’.” The court heard that following the discussion, Mr Toohey and Mr Fairest confronted Mr Wright in the apartment. The men then lifted him over the balcony handrail as Ms Fields looked on. An eyewitness from the apartment building told police he was standing on his balcony below, and saw Mr wright hanging from the rail and holding onto someone’s hands. He said he then saw the hands let go and Mr Wright plummeted 12 metres to the ground. Police arrived and found the trio in the apartment. Each gave a different account of what had happened, the court heard. The friendship between Mr Wright and Mr Toohey had deteriorated since the pair had moved in together, and Mr Wright had accused Mr Toohey of stealing a tablet computer and a phone from his bedroom, a year before he was killed. Mr Dane told the court: “They made a plan and they did it.” Lawyers for Ms Fields and Mr Fairest denied their clients were involved in the alleged murder. Mr Toohey’s lawyer said his client was not challenging the accusations, but would argue that he does not have the mental capacity to be held legally liable for the crime.

Judge Doug Hoffman said in court Friday he received a letter from Berget in August stating he wanted to move forward with his execution against the wishes of his legal counsel. 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Transcript: Rodney Berget Waives Rights To Appeal Death Sentence a man facing the death sentence for the murder of a south dakota prison guard five years ago... made a stunning decision today in court. rodney berget waived his right to appeal his sentence and says he wants to move forward with his execution. but berget's decision is against the wishes of his own lawyers, leading to an investigation that will keep the case going for a little while longer. kdlt's jack eble explains. "today he had indicated a desire to move forward with an execution." today's hearing started with a letter. rodney berget, sentenced to death in 2012 for the murder of south dakota prison guard ronald johnson, wrote a letter to judge doug hoffman in august, asking to move forward with his own execution. the letter went against berget's own legal counsel. berget's attorney, eric shulte shull-tee , requested an investigation to determine berget's mental capacity, which received a nod of disapproval from berget. shulte cited previous u.s. supreme court rulings and argued berget's execution could be unconstitutional based on his intellectual disability. south dakota attorney general marty jackley disagreed with shulte's argument. "there is no evidence of this record, having been the trial lawyer on this case from the very beginning, from the initial plea hearing to the sentencing trial, through the whole process that mr. berget was not of sound mind." judge hoffman granted shulte shull-tee his request to investigate. a status hearing will take place in the next sixty to ninety days with an update on berget's mental capability or to move forward with berget's request for an execution. members of ronald johnson's family were in attendance for today's hearing and were visibly upset with the decision to allow the investigation and process to continue. during the next sixty to ninety days, jackley says the state will file a motion for a hearing to send the case back to a sentencing court to determine a date of execution. kelsie. thanks jack. berget and a co- conspirator -- eric robert -- were convicted of killing officer johnson during an attempted escape from the state penitentiary in 2011. robert was executed in october 2012. berget's execution was delayed by a court ruling in april of 20-15... because of his request to appeal his death sentence.

Artificial intelligence is everywhere. But before scientists trust it, they first need to understand how machines learn. Davide Castelvecchi 05 October 2016 Article tools PDF Rights & Permissions Illustration by Simon Prades Dean Pomerleau can still remember his first tussle with the black-box problem. The year was 1991, and he was making a pioneering attempt to do something that has now become commonplace in autonomous-vehicle research: teach a computer how to drive. This meant taking the wheel of a specially equipped Humvee military vehicle and guiding it through city streets, says Pomerleau, who was then a robotics graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. With him in the Humvee was a computer that he had programmed to peer through a camera, interpret what was happening out on the road and memorize every move that he made in response. Eventually, Pomerleau hoped, the machine would make enough associations to steer on its own. LISTEN Shamini Bundell finds out about AI’s black-box problem You may need a more recent browser or to install the latest version of the Adobe Flash Plugin. On each trip, Pomerleau would train the system for a few minutes, then turn it loose to drive itself. Everything seemed to go well — until one day the Humvee approached a bridge and suddenly swerved to one side. He avoided a crash only by quickly grabbing the wheel and retaking control. Back in the lab, Pomerleau tried to understand where the computer had gone wrong. “Part of my thesis was to open up the black box and figure out what it was thinking,” he explains. But how? He had programmed the computer to act as a 'neural network' — a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is modelled on the brain, and that promised to be better than standard algorithms at dealing with complex real-world situations. Unfortunately, such networks are also as opaque as the brain. Instead of storing what they have learned in a neat block of digital memory, they diffuse the information in a way that is exceedingly difficult to decipher. Only after extensively testing his software's responses to various visual stimuli did Pomerleau discover the problem: the network had been using grassy roadsides as a guide to the direction of the road, so the appearance of the bridge confused it. Twenty-five years later, deciphering the black box has become exponentially harder and more urgent. The technology itself has exploded in complexity and application. Pomerleau, who now teaches robotics part-time at Carnegie Mellon, describes his little van-mounted system as “a poor man's version” of the huge neural networks being implemented on today's machines. And the technique of deep learning, in which the networks are trained on vast archives of big data, is finding commercial applications that range from self-driving cars to websites that recommend products on the basis of a user's browsing history. It promises to become ubiquitous in science, too. Future radio-astronomy observatories will need deep learning to find worthwhile signals in their otherwise unmanageable amounts of data; gravitational-wave detectors will use it to understand and eliminate the tiniest sources of noise; and publishers will use it to scour and tag millions of research papers and books. Eventually, some researchers believe, computers equipped with deep learning may even display imagination and creativity. “You would just throw data at this machine, and it would come back with the laws of nature,” says Jean-Roch Vlimant, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. But such advances would make the black-box problem all the more acute. Exactly how is the machine finding those worthwhile signals, for example? And how can anyone be sure that it's right? How far should people be willing to trust deep learning? “I think we are definitely losing ground to these algorithms,” says roboticist Hod Lipson at Columbia University in New York City. He compares the situation to meeting an intelligent alien species whose eyes have receptors not just for the primary colours red, green and blue, but also for a fourth colour. It would be very difficult for humans to understand how the alien sees the world, and for the alien to explain it to us, he says. Computers will have similar difficulties explaining things to us, he says. “At some point, it's like explaining Shakespeare to a dog.” Sign up - it's free! Faced with such challenges, AI researchers are responding just as Pomerleau did — by opening up the black box and doing the equivalent of neuroscience to understand the networks inside. Answers are not insight, says Vincenzo Innocente, a physicist at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland who has pioneered the application of AI to the field. “As a scientist,” he says, “I am not satisfied with just distinguishing cats from dogs. A scientist wants to be able to say: 'the difference is such and such'.” Good trip The first artificial neural networks were created in the early 1950s, almost as soon as there were computers capable of executing the algorithms. The idea is to simulate small computational units — the 'neurons' — that are arranged in layers connected by a multitude of digital 'synapses' (see 'Do AIs dream of electric sheep?') Each unit in the bottom layer takes in external data, such as pixels in an image, then distributes that information up to some or all of the units in the next layer. Each unit in that second layer then integrates its inputs from the first layer, using a simple mathematical rule, and passes the result further up. Eventually, the top layer yields an answer — by, say, classifying the original picture as a 'cat' or a 'dog'. Design: Nik Spencer/Nature; Photos: Keith McDuffee/flickr/CC BY; djhumster/flickr/CC BY-SA; Bernard Dupont; Linda Stanley; Phil Fiddyment/Flickr/CC BY The power of such networks stems from their ability to learn. Given a training set of data accompanied by the right answers, they can progressively improve their performance by tweaking the strength of each connection until their top-level outputs are also correct. This process, which simulates how the brain learns by strengthening or weakening synapses, eventually produces a network that can successfully classify new data that were not part of its training set. That ability to learn was a major attraction for CERN physicists back in the 1990s, when they were among the first to routinely use large-scale neural networks for science: the networks would prove to be an enormous help in reconstructing the trajectories of subatomic shrapnel coming out of particle collisions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider. But this form of learning is also why information is so diffuse in the network: just as in the brain, memory is encoded in the strength of multiple connections, rather than stored at specific locations, as in a conventional database. “Where is the first digit of your phone number stored in your brain? Probably in a bunch of synapses, probably not too far from the other digits,” says Pierre Baldi, a machine-learning researcher at the University of California, Irvine. But there is no well-defined sequence of bits that encodes the number. As a result, says computer scientist Jeff Clune at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, “even though we make these networks, we are no closer to understanding them than we are a human brain”. Google AI algorithm masters ancient game of Go To scientists who have to deal with big data in their respective disciplines, this makes deep learning a tool to be used with caution. To see why, says Andrea Vedaldi, a computer scientist at the University of Oxford, UK, imagine that in the near future, a deep-learning neural network is trained using old mammograms that have been labelled according to which women went on to develop breast cancer. After this training, says Vedaldi, the tissue of an apparently healthy woman could already 'look' cancerous to the machine. “The neural network could have implicitly learned to recognize markers — features that we don't know about, but that are predictive of cancer,” he says. But if the machine could not explain how it knew, says Vedaldi, it would present physicians and their patients with serious dilemmas. It's difficult enough for a woman to choose a preventive mastectomy because she has a genetic variant known to substantially up the risk of cancer. But it could be even harder to make that choice without even knowing what the risk factor is — even if the machine making the recommendation happened to be very accurate in its predictions. “The problem is that the knowledge gets baked into the network, rather than into us,” says Michael Tyka, a biophysicist and programmer at Google in Seattle, Washington. “Have we really understood anything? Not really — the network has.” Several groups began to look into this black-box problem in 2012. A team led by Geoffrey Hinton, a machine-learning specialist at the University of Toronto in Canada, entered a computer-vision competition and showed for the first time that deep learning's ability to classify photographs from a database of 1.2 million images far surpassed that of any other AI approach1. Digging deeper into how this was possible, Vedaldi's group took algorithms that Hinton had developed to improve neural-network training, and essentially ran them in reverse. Rather than teaching a network to give the correct interpretation of an image, the team started with pretrained networks and tried to reconstruct the images that produced them2. This helped the researchers to identify how the machine was representing various features — as if they were asking a hypothetical cancer-spotting neural network, 'What part of this mammogram have you decided is a marker of cancer risk?” “The problem is that the knowledge gets baked into the network, rather than into us.” Last year, Tyka and fellow Google researchers followed a similar approach to its ultimate conclusion. Their algorithm, which they called Deep Dream, starts from an image — say a flower, or a beach — and modifies it to enhance the response of a particular top-level neuron. If the neuron likes to tag images as birds, for example, the modified picture will start showing birds everywhere. The resulting images evoke LSD trips, with birds emerging from faces, buildings and much more. “I think it's much more like a hallucination” than a dream, says Tyka, who is also an artist. When he and the team saw the potential for others to use the algorithm for creative purposes, they made it available to anyone to download. Within days, Deep Dream was a viral sensation online. Using techniques that could maximize the response of any neuron, not just the top-level ones, Clune's team discovered in 2014 that the black-box problem might be worse than expected: neural networks are surprisingly easy to fool with images that to people look like random noise, or abstract geometric patterns. For instance, a network might see wiggly lines and classify them as a starfish, or mistake black-and-yellow stripes for a school bus. Moreover, the patterns elicited the same responses in networks that had been trained on different data sets3. Researchers have proposed a number of approaches to solving this 'fooling' problem, but so far no general solution has emerged. And that could be dangerous in the real world. An especially frightening scenario, Clune says, is that ill-intentioned hackers could learn to exploit these weaknesses. They could then send a self-driving car veering into a billboard that it thinks is a road, or trick a retina scanner into giving an intruder access to the White House, thinking that the person is Barack Obama. “We have to roll our sleeves up and do hard science, to make machine learning more robust and more intelligent,” concludes Clune. Autonomous vehicles: No drivers required Issues such as these have led some computer scientists to think that deep learning with neural networks should not be the only game in town. Zoubin Ghahramani, a machine-learning researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, says that if AI is to give answers that humans can easily interpret, “there's a world of problems for which deep learning is just not the answer”. One relatively transparent approach with an ability to do science was debuted in 2009 by Lipson and computational biologist Michael Schmidt, then at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Their algorithm, called Eureqa, demonstrated that it could rediscover the laws of Newtonian physics simply by watching a relatively simple mechanical object — a system of pendulums — in motion4. Starting from a random combination of mathematical building blocks such as +, −, sine and cosine, Eureqa follows a trial-and-error method inspired by Darwinian evolution to modify the terms until it arrives at the formulae that best describe the data. It then proposes experiments to test its models. One of its advantages is simplicity, says Lipson. “A model produced by Eureqa usually has a dozen parameters. A neural network has millions.” On autopilot Last year, Ghahramani published an algorithm that automates the job of a data scientist, from looking at raw data all the way to writing a paper5. His software, called Automatic Statistician, spots trends and anomalies in data sets and presents its conclusion, including a detailed explanation of its reasoning. That transparency, Ghahramani says, is “absolutely critical” for applications in science, but it is also important for many commercial applications. For example, he says, in many countries, banks that deny a loan have a legal obligation to say why — something a deep-learning algorithm might not be able to do5. Similar concerns apply to a wide range of institutions, points out Ellie Dobson, director of data science at the big-data firm Arundo Analytics in Oslo. If something were to go wrong as a result of setting the UK interest rates, she says, “the Bank of England can't say, 'the black box made me do it'”. The chips are down for Moore’s law Despite these fears, computer scientists contend that efforts at creating transparent AI should be seen as complementary to deep learning, not as a replacement. Some of the transparent techniques may work well on problems that are already described as a set of abstract facts, they say, but are not as good at perception — the process of extracting facts from raw data. Ultimately, these researchers argue, the complex answers given by machine learning have to be part of science's toolkit because the real world is complex: for phenomena such as the weather or the stock market, a reductionist, synthetic description might not even exist. “There are things we cannot verbalize,” says Stéphane Mallat, an applied mathematician at the École Polytechnique in Paris. “When you ask a medical doctor why he diagnosed this or this, he's going to give you some reasons,” he says. “But how come it takes 20 years to make a good doctor? Because the information is just not in books.” To Baldi, scientists should embrace deep learning without being “too anal” about the black box. After all, they all carry a black box in their heads. “You use your brain all the time; you trust your brain all the time; and you have no idea how your brain works.” Journal name: Nature Volume: 538, Pages: 20–23 Date published: (06 October 2016) DOI: doi:10.1038/538020a Tweet Follow @NatureNews Follow @dcastelvecchi References Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I. & Hinton, G.

Comments 4 comments Subscribe to comments Gerry Wolff • 2016-10-20 10:12 AM Points of interest arising from this article include: * By contrast with deep artificial neural networks (DNNs), the SP theory of intelligence and its realisation in the SP computer model provides an audit trail for all its functions including unsupervised learning, pattern recognition, parsing, and more. This point and others below are discussed quite fully in Section V of “The SP theory of intelligence: distinctive features and advantages” (J G Wolff, IEEE Access, 4, 216-246, 2016). That paper includes an outline of the SP system with pointers to where fuller information may be found. * There is evidence that the SP system is, almost certainly, not vulnerable to the kind of “fooling” described in the article. * Progressive improvement of a DNN’s performance by the strengthening and weakening of connections is consistent with the fact that it takes time to learn a complex skill like playing the piano at a high level but it does not account for “one-trial” learning which is a prominent feature of much human learn. By contrast, the SP system provides an explanation of both aspects of human learning. * It is not right to say that “[Learning in DNNs] eventually produces a network that can successfully classify new data that were not part of its training set.” There are considerable problems of over-generalisation and under-generalisation by DNNs and quite a lot of effort has been and is being devoted to this problem. The SP system provides a solution that appears to be sound, detailed in the paper referenced above. * The weight of evidence is now against the idea that “[human] memory is encoded in the strength of multiple connections, rather than stored at specific locations, as in a conventional database.” By contrast with DNNs, the SP system provides a “localist” model of human memory in which knowledge of “my grandmother”, for example, is stored in one location, although there may be references to information stored elsewhere. * In addition to the points raised above, the SP system scores better than DNNs in several other respects, described in Section V of the paper referenced above.

Most definitions of the question are along the lines of "to ask a question" (they use the word to define itself) because we haven't come to a working definition of the question. Questions are actually a realized lack of logical knowledge structure. When we teach the machine to question and answer questions, it will remove all previous barriers to AI. Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share link to this comment Robert Buntrock • 2016-10-06 02:16 AM Can we know how we think? Taking a Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, I was determined to be an INTP (1% of the population, 5% of scientists). Among other things, black and white don't exist, just many shades of gray. Another is that we in that group are among the only ones who care how we think. Having dealt in information retrieval and analysis for 45 years, I found I had to try to know how my clients thought and in the process, how I think, at least to answer the STEM questions we deal with. Of course, even such analysis can only skim across the surface of the thinking process. The point is well taken that AI may well give a good medical analysis but would be unable to tell us how or why. Can we implicitly trust these expert systems? Probably not. Nota bene: Watson won at Jeopardy because it was allowed to cheat. Unlike human contestants, Watson was allowed to ring in before Alex finished reading the answer. If humans did that they'd be blocked out to the end of the queue before being allowed to give their response (of a question, of course). -- Bob Buntrock Orono, ME Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share link to this comment Anonymous Nemo • 2016-10-08 03:04 AM You might be interested in dialectics if you enjoy contemplating contemplation.

Today, It Means AI An exhibit about branding traces its millennia-old history and points to its ominous future. Slide Show: 34 images Mark Wilson 10.03.16 7:00 AM When was the idea of a brand born? Maybe it’s always been with us—or even before us. That's the argument on display at Like Me: Our Bond with Brands, an exhibit curated by the creative consultancy Lippincott on view at 1 World Trade Center now through October 14. The show has some irresistibly charming pieces on view, from human-sized Starbucks cups to a blinding neon sign reading "Bitch, you're a fan" (a reference to Madonna's Instagram account). But perhaps the most provocative piece is a comprehensive timeline of branding, all the way from 1 BC to today, developed by senior manager Lauren Cascio and partner Matt Miksa. The time line begins with a simple argument: that the world has always been branded. You may not think of a bee's stripes as a brand, but Lippincott argues otherwise—and convincingly, if you’re willing to play along with the conceit. After all, consider that bees' markings are instantly distinctive to each other and across species as a biological imperative. It’s enough to make you wonder if the monarch butterfly has a feasible design patent claim against the mimicking viceroy. Beyond the realm of biology, the curators trace the evolution of brands created by humans, moving toward logos and icons—the IBMs, NBCs, and Nikes—that are instantly recognizable by a symbol. The 20th century, the golden era of branding, is relatively predictable, since we're still so familiar with the giants of branding today. But around 2014, something changes. Things get murky. The idea of the brand goes from optimistic (bees were a brand, man!) to potentially dystopian (robot listening to everything you say is a brand, man!). We see the rise of devices like Amazon Echo, with voice recognition technologies backed by incredibly intelligent AI. Suddenly, Amazon’s logo wasn’t its most powerful totem anymore, nor was its one-click purchase button. It was Alexa, a pseudo-human with the voice of an automaton and the soul of a credit card scanner. The brand is undergoing a paradigm shift. It's no longer a mark. It's not even a voice. It's an intelligent entity, a personality, an algorithm capable of learning. Truthfully, it’s a pretty screwed up future to be approaching! Whether it’s the text-based chatbots like Google Allo or Facebook Messenger, or the aforementioned conversational interfaces like Siri, Cortana, or Alexa, these personality-based manifestations of brands are going to have unprecedentedly intimate access into our lives. The Nike logo on our shoes might have known that our feet smelled, but a Cortana that listens to everything will be able to predict if you have cancer. Of course, today, chatbots are a bit of a disaster. They’re quick with a joke, but slow in a real human crisis. They’re essentially a marketer’s sometimes-cheery, sometimes-snarky Twitter voice, built into a piece of software. They’re all ultimately the same inoffensive mother figure spouting off jokes clearly written by dads. Still, these bot-brands aren’t going anywhere, and several big questions remain about how they will evolve. Convergently, or divergently? Will we ever start to see distinct, convincing personalities emerge as brands—or at least a few decent archetypes? Because right now, I don’t think that most of us could really distinguish a Siri response from a Cortana response from an Alexa response, beyond the specific voice. They’re all ultimately the same inoffensive mother figure spouting off jokes clearly written by dads. The other big questions are even more ominous: Have we evolved to be such inherently social creatures that when we have the opportunity—and eventual necessity—of talking directly to companies all day, will we all just be consumer pinballs, being knocked around a manipulation machine? Will regulators be able to keep up? Will social niceties allow big data to meld with big manipulation, so we’re sweet-talked into supersizing before we’re shamed by a drill instructor into exercising it off? Because as we feel this intrinsic human need to answer to our chatbots simply because they chat, we’ll be prone to everything that comes along with any other relationship: pleasure, guilt, responsibility, and loyalty . . . to our new best friend, the brand.

COMMENT SalesforceIQ CRM now empowers small businesses to have a complete view of their customer Ben Lobel These days, customers expect companies to deliver fast and personalised experiences across every channel and at any time. But nearly 80 per cent of UK small businesses aren’t equipped to meet the needs of customers because they aren’t able to connect all of their essential business apps, which results in a fragmented view of the customer journey, and a less-than-seamless customer experience. As this means missed growth opportunities for businesses, we’ve designed our small business solutions to help companies achieve a single customer view and offer a highly personalised customer experience. We know smaller businesses are often stretched thin on resources , so we’ve made our solutions smarter, so that sales, marketing and customer service teams can work more efficiently and effectively – putting the customer at the heart of the business with technology that is easy to adopt and fast to implement. SalesforceIQ CRM, for example, is able to help small businesses gain deeper insights into their customers’ so they can better connect with them. Thanks to its intelligent core it can proactively surface insights and interactions with your customers and then recommend next best actions, allowing you to build stronger relationships with customers. What’s more, as it’s cloud based, the product empowers small businesses to get up and running within a matter of minutes. Last year we increased its functionality even further: we launched an easy, out-of-the-box integration of the product with Desk.com, our all-in-one customer service app for fast-growing companies. As a result, SalesforceIQ CRM now empowers small businesses to have a complete view of their customer across both sales and service, helping to level the playing field with their larger competitors. Small disruptive financial services companies, in particular those providing alternative finance, have to compete with traditional, established players to win and retain customers. Like most small companies, they must differentiate themselves through innovation and customer experience. But, in looking at technology to help them find, win and retain customers, they also need to consider regulatory requirements and how technology can help them scale. Salesforce and the finance providers Liberis is a great example of a small fintech company that has used Salesforce solutions to support its growth as it’s evolved to become an award-winning, internationally recognised brand. Liberis doesn’t just want to build stronger relationships with its existing customers; it wants to build stronger relationships with its customers of tomorrow. To do this, it needs to serve up the right content at the right time to customers and prospects. For instance, it uses Salesforce to see how potential customers are engaging with its website, and uses this intelligence to provide content that matches each visitor’s specific interests. And, because all of its customer relationships are built on this approach of learning about each customer and prospect to offer personalised journeys, Liberis has achieved a 98 percent service rating on Feefo, a global customer feedback system. To increase convenience for its customers further, Liberis is now planning a fully-automated online decision-making and funding platform. Once the new cloud-based platform is live, Liberis will be looking to offer a ‘clicks-only’ application process with same-day funding as a norm. As client expectations evolve, it’s vital that small businesses stay a step ahead – this is a key differentiator for them – and continue to focus on innovating around the customer experience. Therefore we’ll continue to add new functionality to our small business solutions to support this, while focusing on making the products easy to deploy and intuitive to use. Also, I think that predictive intelligence – the combination of AI and analytics – will become a vital tool for small businesses looking to deliver that outstanding customer experience, helping sales and marketing focus on the right customer engagement, while also saving them time. Predictive Intelligence will help small businesses do more with their data. The British Small Business Awards are a great way to recognise and celebrate the amazing achievements of the UK’s small business sector – not just of the SMEs themselves but also of the supporting eco-system around them. We’re very proud to be part of these awards. Salesforce is sponsor of the Alternative Finance Provider of the Year category at the British Small Business Awards. The British Small Business Awards, taking place on October 20th at the Grand Connaught Rooms, London, is the leading celebration of the UK’s small business sector, recognising the nation’s best sole traders, micro businesses and small companies – as well as the service providers, financiers and advisers that support them.

Blog Engineers Must Balance IQ and EQ Fred Molinari, Former CEO, Data Translation 10/5/2016 00:06 AM EDT  8 comments   post a comment 1 saves Login to Rate Tweet Although you want people with the best technical skills on your team, watch out for those with great technical skills who don't work well with the rest of the team. There's always a tradeoff. Every technical manager wants to find competent engineers who can heavily contribute to a new product design. We all want the best. Someone who really knows his or her "stuff," or do we? Hiring the brightest engineers is a worthy objective. Every good manager wants the best as part of their team. Technical capability is the focus of the hiring sessions with all involved being careful to explore this needed expertise. Many refer to this ability as the intellectual quotient, IQ, capability, i.e. the assessment of the intellectual ability of the individual in understanding and solving difficult technical issues. Often overlooked, however, is the other end of the spectrum, the emotional quotient, EQ, or the ability to interact easily with others in a team atmosphere. This is the rub in a nutshell. A person must be able to contribute as part of a team with the willing cooperation of other members. Someone who turns off others, no matter how smart or capable, will act as a drag on the team and actually set it back, rather than move it forward toward the goal. I remember a quite gifted technical individual who we hired to take a new approach on a media product that had already had an aborted development. He brilliantly came up with a different technical thought process that showed great promise. The task from there was to convince others in the team and work closely with him to develop working models. The process started to bog down. Other team members acknowledged the enlightened approach, but didn't want to work with him. They found him condescending, arrogant, and difficult. As a result, the team was not cooperating in working with this technical guru. His EQ capability was lacking. He didn't comprehend their contributions and value. Everybody wants to feel that they are making a contribution and are valued by others. This presented a dilemma—he was competent and even highly technically skilled, but our schedule was dragging badly. We needed a reset. The result was that we had to find an additional player who could translate the gurus expertise and interface with the group as a means of getting the problem solved. Additional time and expense was the needed solution. In looking back on this process I believe that we hired a very competent design person. But we failed to look at the other aspects of what it takes to get an aggressive team effort to work properly. Each person must rely on the others efforts to move the effort forward. Dissension is a killer for progress and might even make it go backwards. This was our experience. So how should we have approached this? On a linear scale IQ and EQ are at opposite ends of the line: Ideally, everyone has percentages of both. These individuals that have a balance make great team composition work smoothly. But, large leaps ahead in new products require often very strong IQ capability. Selling new ideas take an ample supply of EQ to relate to the group and to any potential customer. So you need both attributes. You need IQ for technical breakthroughs and gifted EQ folks to make smooth progress. Hiring processes must understand these quotients to pick ideal candidates. Even the most technical positions need to be staffed with individuals who can lead others or at least convince others. On the other hand, just interacting with others is not enough. These hires must have the thinking/learning capability for technical issues to get the job done. A good exercise for us all is to understand where we fall on the IQ/EQ spectrum. Also, you might think about people we know in these same contexts. It's only one spectrum, but useful in technical environments. Our thinking has to not only focus on the key characteristic in an important hire, but how those hires will fit into a team environment. See all EE Times articles by Fred Molinari.

Treating all your employees as interchangeable cogs is one of the signs of a bad manager. Not everyone has to be - or even 'should' be - on a team: Some people make great (and are very happy being) individual contributors. If you have the manpower flexiblity to allow that, you, your company and your employees will be better off. If you don't have the luxury of accomodating 'individual contributor only' employees, then you need to be VERY selective in your hiring process.

There are brilliant people who collect adoring followers,  obnoxious incompetents, and people in most of the other positions on the plane. A fashionable management fad a few years ago scored people on a scale (1-9, I think) for each attribute (task orientation and people skills), and the combination was used as a shorthand for personality type. It's management's job to arrange the cages so that conflicts don't happen more than absolutely necessary, (Sometimes they are.)

However, I can think of no reason - barring autism - that IQ and EQ should necessarily correlate negatively.  I have met many extremely gifted engineers who were great leaders and very personable.  And I have met mediocre ones that no one could stand to be around. Btw, I would point out that in the author's anecdote, the "team" also showed a lack of EQ by not being able to work effectively with a difficult colleague.  Reply   Post Message   Messages List   Start a Board User Rank Author EQ and IQ on opposite ends? DCH0   10/5/2016 3:52:01 PM NO RATINGS Login to Rate I disagree that IQ and EQ are at opposite ends of the line.  Being a bit egotistical, I think I have been good at both.  Co-workers may disagree. The arrogant genius is typically very insecure.  They will turn off any questions with a "better than thou" attitude demeaning the questioner.  What this really means is that the "genius" does not have the skill to explain many of the details and chooses to attack anyone who gets close. I have known brilliant college professors, both as teachers and later as peers, whose EQ skills were as far off the charts as their IQ.  Unfortunately, this is not true for all.

(Jon Nazca/Reuters) Related Stories Having helpless babies may have helped humans evolve intelligence External Links Science: Great apes anticipate that other individuals will act according to false beliefs (Note: CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external links.) Scientists using homemade videos featuring a person in a King Kong costume have documented a remarkable cognitive skill shared by chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans: the human-like ability to recognize when someone else's beliefs are wrong. The research published Thursday in the journal Science demonstrated that these great apes — humankind's closest living evolutionary cousins — appear to possess a capability thought until now to have been the exclusive domain of people, according to the scientists. As individual apes were shown videos featuring a human actor and a costumed ape-like King Kong character, researchers tracked their eye movements. In the video, the human watches King Kong hide an object in one of two boxes. When the person leaves, King Kong moves the object to a new location. When the person returns to find the object, the apes looked intently at the original spot in anticipation of the person searching there. Even though the apes knew the object had been moved, they understood that the human thought it was still there, said study co-leader Fumihiro Kano, a comparative psychologist at Kyoto University in Japan. 'Incredibly intelligent' The ability to think about others' thoughts and emotions is at the heart of a lot of human social behaviour, including our unique forms of communication, co-operation and culture, said study co-leader Christopher Krupenye, who worked on the study at Duke University and is now at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.   At the core of this ability is understanding that others' actions are guided not necessarily by reality but by their beliefs about reality, even when false, Krupenye said. Human children fully develop this understanding by around age four or five. "Apes are incredibly intelligent, which isn't so surprising given that they are our closest relatives, but I think that a lot of people underestimate the cognitive abilities of animals in general," Krupenye said. By studying these apes, researchers seek to learn which aspects of human psychology are unique to people and which are shared with other apes and thus likely were present in the common ancestor that lived some 13 to 18 million years ago, before the split of the evolutionary lineage of humans and those other species, he added. Previous research showed that apes can reason about others' goals and intentions, know what others can see, and understand what others know based on what those others have seen, Krupenye said. © Thomson Reuters, 2016 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback Stay Connected with CBC News Mobile Facebook Podcasts Twitter Alerts Newsletter Top News Headlines Trump tones down polarizing campaign promises, rhetoric in 60 Minutes interview What you need to know about the supermoon 'Just utter devastation': New Zealand PM on 7.8 magnitude earthquake video Fall from grace: Michael Applebaum's ill-fated climb to power video Canadians cutting the cord in record numbers despite $25 basic TV deals read comments Latest Technology & Science News Headlines What you need to know about the supermoon Microsoft Surface Book review: Who needs a $4,000 laptop? read comments Facebook sorry for 'terrible error' that killed off still-living users read comments November supermoon will be the closest to Earth since 1948 read comments Housing and job ads on Facebook will no longer exclude users based on race Quirks & Quarks Quirks & Quarks for October 15, 2016 Cosmic rays causing ‘space brain,’ berries turning birds' feathers red, and the book 'Venomous' Quirks & Quarks for October 8, 2016 A Nobel prize winner in chemistry, theory of mind in apes, and diatoms save the ocean Most Viewed What you need to know about the supermoon November supermoon will be the closest to Earth since 1948 Microsoft Surface Book review: Who needs a $4,000 laptop?

The question is whether elders are really an obstacle in the path of the new generation. If yes, what could be the best role for senior leaders? I had an amazing discussion recently with a group of young Kuwaitis who are about to graduate and start their careers. What led us to this debate was their obvious concern about the future and whether it would be easy for them to get promoted and climb the ladder of success at a time when those who have been in service for many years won’t leave their positions and retire. These people are labeled as ‘old school’. There is also a difference between working for the private sector and the public sector. I agree that in the public sector, you may come across those who have been in service for more than 30 years and refuse to leave, unless they suffer a sudden stroke or death forces them to quit. But in the private sector, it is a different situation. The question remains is why do young people don’t find opportunities easily, even in the private sector. There are tools for success, which most youth are not willing to accept. The first one is initiative. Bring ideas into action. I know that young people are energetic and very eager to push forward to use their college knowledge to generate profits and make money, but lasting value is created when the experience of elders who belong to the old school combines with their knowledge and judgment to create prosperity. The elders who are labeled as old school can be divided into two categories – those who haven’t adapted to the technological and ideological revolution, and if they haven’t failed already, they will within the next 20 years or so. The other category is of those who have adapted to the new world order, and this makes them much more intelligent than most people, because throughout their lifelong experience, they adapted to completely different systems and ways of work, and they are well-known throughout the world now. Is it a good idea to pass the torch to the young from those who are older? There is a requirement of basic knowledge and experience, and the young have no right to take the torch if they cannot surpass those who came before us, so that those who come after us will do a much better job rather than creating a cycle of self-improvement with every generation. The ‘new school’ should not seek a better version, but a new one. Another point here is the need to put ideas for sale, whether of products or services. Think of all those who are being labeled as ‘old school’ – they made a fortune because they managed to sell their ideas even if they seem outdated now. Social media has the power and impact to shape and reshape the ideas of young people. The danger of these ideas is seeking to be rich and famous, even if this means you are making a fool of yourself. To many young people, creativity knows no boundaries, no rules, no laws or even traditions, which do not have the ability to stop the new generation regardless of the mistakes they sometimes commit. I love the energy and enthusiasm of young people and appreciate the way they visualize their future. This is normal and logical. But if they listen to the old school, they might obtain things they could use – like wisdom and experience.

We’ve all spent hours wondering where we went wrong, over and over again. Why did he break up with you? Ultimately, you may never know the exact answer but you’ll need to move on regardless. To help give closure, here are 10 things guys never tolerate in a relationship: 1. Acting phony Don’t think that a man can’t see when you aren’t being sincere. He wants you to be yourself. The person you are supposed to be with will love that you don’t pretend to be someone you’re not. 2. Being clingy No man likes a woman who is obsessively attached to him. Especially early on in a relationship, calling constantly, hanging onto his every word and showing up unannounced is going to scare him off. You want to let him know you care, but playing it cool can play in your favor if he spooks easily. 3. Following the crowd He’ll notice if you just follow the crowd. A man is looking for a woman who is original, unique and independent; not someone who can’t think for themselves. Develop your sparkling personality instead of following the crowd to catch a winner. 4. Being too serious I have yet to meet a man who takes life so seriously that he can’t laugh at himself once in a while. He wants the same from you. Many things in life are meant to be laughed about. Show him your silly side and take a joke. Your smile and laugh are contagious, but not if you never show it. 5. Being demanding Of course you want to express your opinion on a date, but no one likes being bossed around. Don’t confuse confidence with pride and remember to let your date talk about what they like to do, too. 6. Being envious Do not get jealous of another woman. He will notice your lack of self-confidence. Envy is feature that can make the most beautiful woman very unattractive. 7. Playing dumb Hiding your intelligence is not an admirable feature. It just makes you look ignorant in front of your date. You don’t have to be a genius to find your prince, but pretending to not know anything doesn’t do you any favors. Speaking up about your interests and pursuing education is a very attractive quality. 8. Being inconsiderate Would you want to be with a man who is inconsiderate? Of course not! A humble person treats others with kindness and understanding, which are qualities you want to find in your partner. Be considerate of others. You may have it all but if you have an ugly heart, he will move on. 9. Negativity Being vulnerable and being emotionally overbearing are two separate categories. It is okay to open up and be honest about what is happening in your life; that is what makes you genuine! However, constant crying, complaining and moodiness are not going to convince anyone to stick around. Being a positive person is much more attractive.

Chippewa County's Cameron leaving bench in December Longtime judge retiring with legacy of fairness, collegiality posted Oct. 6, 2016 12:18 a.m. | updated Oct. 6, 2016 12:18 a.m. (CDT) email article print font size - + by / Chris Vetter. bio | email Staff file photo | Enlarge - Chippewa County Judge Roderick Cameron during the bond hearing of Shane Hawkins, accused of first-degree intentional homicide, on Monday, March 1, 2010. Enlarge Cameron CHIPPEWA FALLS — After 33 years as a Chippewa County judge, Roderick Cameron has decided to retire. Cameron, 66, informed the governor’s office in a letter he wrote Friday that his last day of work will be Dec. 9. He declined to be interviewed at this time but said it was good timing to pass off his caseload to a new judge. Judge Steve Cray, who joined the bench in 2008, said Cameron will be missed. “We are losing a very good judge,” Cray said. “Rory has been solid — he’s a guy I could go to with questions. He’s been doing it so long, he’s seen everything. He’s been a very steady colleague, and I’ll miss him very much.” Tom Evenson, spokesman for Gov. Scott Walker, confirmed his office received the retirement notice. Evenson said there typically is a two-week application window. A Judicial Selection Advisory Committee will review all the applicants and make recommendations to Walker. The length of time to fill the seat is largely dependent on the number of applicants. The person who is appointed would have to run for re-election in spring 2018, he said. Colleagues praised Cameron for his work throughout nearly three decades on the bench. “Rory did defense work when I was a prosecutor,” Cray said. “I always respected him.” When Cameron became a judge, Cray would routinely argue cases before him. “I knew he’d think it through and be fair,” Cray said. Judge James Isaacson also offered Cameron praise for his lengthy career. “Judge Cameron has been an institution here, almost as long as I’ve been a lawyer,” Judge James Isaacson said. “I’ve known him as a colleague and as a presiding judge.” Retired Judge Thomas Sazama — who was on the bench from 1995 to 2008 — began working alongside Cameron in the early 1970s. When Sazama was Chippewa County district attorney in the early 1980s, Cameron ran against him and lost. “Obviously, he’s very intelligent, well-spoken, writes well, and has a lot of common sense,” Sazama said. When Sazama joined the bench, there were only two judges in Chippewa County. Sazama recalls having lengthy discussions with Cameron when he started. “He was very helpful and friendly,” Sazama said. Cameron earned a bachelor’s degree from Trinity College in 1972 and a law degree from UW-Madison in 1974. He served as Stanley city attorney from 1977 to 1983 and was Chippewa County assistant district attorney in 1975-76. Cameron was appointed to the court April 1, 1983, by then-Gov. Anthony Earl, replacing Robert Pfiffner. He was re-elected in 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, 2008 and 2014. He isn’t the only judge in the family — his younger brother, Howard Cameron, was a judge in St. Croix County before retiring last year. Cameron is known as an active runner — he competed in the 2006 Boston Marathon — and an avid bird-watcher.

Viv is a voice assistant made by the same team that created Siri. Siri was available as an App on the iPhone before Apple acquired it and baked the AI into the operating system. The current Viv team left Apple over disagreements on what direction Siri should be developed in, and Viv is what the makers originally intended Siri to be. The Global Innovation Centre of Samsung was responsible for the acquisition on behalf of Samsung Mobile Communications. Jacopo Lenzi, SVP of Business Development and Strategic Acquisitions said “We see great potential in the Viv AI software and platform, and we’re excited for Viv to reach our millions of users through Samsung’s global presence and distribution.” Injong Rhee, CTO of Mobile Communications at Samsung said “Unlike other existing AI-based services, Viv has a sophisticated natural language understanding, machine learning capabilities and strategic partnerships that will enrich a broader service ecosystem.” Here is Injong Rhee, speaking about the Viv acquisition. Viv differs from current intelligent assistants because it uses a virtual network of associated areas and capabilities. It uses a technological breakthrough called dynamic program generation to create programs in under 10 milliseconds, and execute the code on the fly. Viv is meant to be a platform for conversational commerce, which uses a natural language voice interface to book hotel rooms, order supplies from a store, or pay back a loan to a friend. Viv can interpret long and complex sentences, as well as keep track of the context of a conversation. Viv co-founder and CEO, Dag Kittlaus said “At Viv, we’re building the simplest way for anyone to talk to devices and services everywhere. We see a future that is decidedly beyond apps—where you can get what you need quickly and easily no matter where you are, or what device you are near. Samsung offers us a unique opportunity to deliver a single conversational interface to the world’s apps and services across a diverse range of products, at global scale.” Viv has a dual focus on both consumers and developers, which is one of the reasons Samsung has agreed to acquire Viv.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone. Therefore, tough competition between the two big firms is in the cards. Baird Equity Research pointed out that the new Pixel phone would have a complete Google Assistant and Daydream VR, possibly giving it a competitive edge against the iPhone 7. Pixel comes with advanced processor of QUALCOMM, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM)'s Snapdragon and provides rapid charging capabilities. DxOMark, a camera analyst and ratings provider, gave the highest rating to Pixel's camera. Analysts Colin Sebastian and Benjamin Gaither think the latest move is based on the success enjoyed by Nexus and the Android OS. They also believe the search engine flexed its ML/AI capabilities to fit into the scheme of Pixel very well. Related Link: Google Seeking The Trifecta Of Hardware, Software And A.I. The brokerage elaborated, "Google Assistant leverages long-term focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Google's virtual assistant continues to evolve from underlying core search and knowledge graph (70 billion facts), recently extended to Allo messaging app, and now to new Pixel phones and Home smart devices." Baird thinks the search engine's capabilities on ML/AI are the key differentiator with its rivals. Although the firm thinks there is restricted impact from the new devices on the top line, the brokerage expects ML/AI apps improvement with the help of generated data from the use. As far as Daydream VR, the analysts think it offers developers tools to distribute content extensively. According to the analysts, the company made the right decision for a dedicated VR and AR platform. The brokerage maintains its Outperform rating and $900 target price. At Last Check ...

October 5, 2016 1:33pm NYSE:GDX ShareTweet Analyst Larry Edelson revisits his prescient bearish call on gold and silver, and finds that the sell-off in precious metals — as well as mining stocks — is probably not over yet. Please don’t take this as boasting, but for months now I’ve been using my cycle analysis and AI software to warn everyone I could that gold and silver and miners were headed lower, not higher. And I gave a date. I stated they were headed lower into today, October 5. I made that forecast as many as seven or eight months ago. Since then, we’ve seen gold plunge from as high as $1,377 to yesterday’s low of roughly $1,266 — a $111 drop, or just over 8.0%. The loss in silver has been similar. I got my share of hate mail for that forecast, especially from those following the trading analysts out there who keep calling for the death of the dollar and who use every piece of news they can find to make an excuse for higher metals prices. Unfortunately, they don’t understand the precious metals market. They can’t possibly understand it because most of them have never traded it. Most of them are unaware of the history of gold and most of them are simply fear-mongerers. Not me. I tell it like it is, with my Artificial Intelligence Model and the waves, or cycles, I follow. My sole mission is two-fold … Keep you out of trouble, like I just did. Make you money, scientific profits and make it easy, with my very accurate forecasting models and more. Right now, due to the severity of the selling, I cannot claim the low is in and the next leg up is about to start. So we have to wait a few days to watch the action, which I will do for you. Meanwhile, stay alert, the markets are really heating up. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) fell $0.16 (-0.68%) to $23.24 per share in Wednesday afternoon trading. Year-to-date, the largest ETF focused on gold mining stocks has gained 69.31%, although the fund has now fallen 27% from its multi-year highs set in early August.

Arjuna is baffled at this tendency to commit sins though one may want to refrain from it. Krishna replies that one should understand the Self as distinct from the gunas that are integral to the body and learn to extricate oneself from this bondage, pointed out Swami Omkarananda in a discourse. The greatest enemy to man is desire. When desire is thwarted, it gives rise to anger. These two are always in conjunction. Just as fire consumes more firewood and is ready to burn more and more, the desire for sense objects and pleasures never finds satisfaction. In fact, desire breeds further desire. When desires multiply, sins also multiply. The entire human race has been affected badly because of yielding to endless desires. Desire has the power to destroy the inherent power of wisdom and discrimination in an individual. It conceals the wisdom even as smoke hides the fire or dirt the mirror or the womb the foetus. When the senses, mind and intelligence are held by desire, the jivatma is deluded and is unable to recognise the true wisdom about his Self. Instead, he is led to believe that attainment of riches, fame and sensual pleasures is the goal of human life and all his energies are directed in this channel. That is why scriptures reiterate that though the senses are powerful, the mind is more powerful than them; and one’s intelligence is still more powerful than the mind. The way out is to train the mind to keep the senses in check and align it with the intellect or buddhi which draws its strength from the Self.

Silicon Valley’s Dinesh and Gilfoyle talk Google products and virginity By Alex McCown-Levy@alexm247 Oct 5, 2016 10:40 AM Screenshot: Silicon Valley Intro Screenshot: Silicon Valley Intro Share Tweet Yesterday, Google made a big deal out of its announcement that the company had a bunch of new phones and AI-aided products definitely designed for human people who are composed of nitrogen and oxygen, just like how we normally think of ourselves. But amid all the exciting news of being able to tell your phone to show you photos using yet more verbs and nouns, there were two minutes of the presentation in which people actually spoke somewhat akin to actual sentient beings—it just didn’t happen on stage. An introductory video shot for the event, featuring Martin Starr and Kumail Nanjiani on set and in character as their Silicon Valley alter egos Gilfoyle and Dinesh, respectively, preceded the presentation. And it’s a good thing they went first, because otherwise Google’s commitment to the “intelligence” half of the AI equation would be highly suspect, as the clip is definitely the best part of the whole thing. Sure, it’s essentially just a goofy ad for a Google keynote presentation, but these characters are so entertaining, they can even make an effort to hawk new products you’ll see heavily discounted in six months worth a look. Well, maybe not the event itself, which took miscalculations of how to appeal to earthlings who communicate verbally to new levels; but at the very least, it provides an amuse-bouche in between seasons of HBO’s excellent comedy.

The major factors driving this market include the increasing demand for drones for commercial applications and rapid technological advancements in drones.      (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160303/792302 ) Browse 76 market data Tables and 57 Figures spread through 216 Pages and in-depth TOC on "UAV Drones Market".  http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/commercial-drones-market-195137996.html Early buyers will receive 10% customization on this report.  Commercial drones are expected to hold the largest market share in the forecast period  This growth is mainly attributed to the growing demand for drones and drone-generated data in commercial applications. Also, in some countries, the rules for operating drones in the national airspace have been relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the release of the Part 107 rule by FAA for drones below 55lb has paved the way for multiple opportunities in commercial sectors such as mapping, surveying, and inspection, among others. The rules and regulations are being modified for the European countries too so that they can reap the benefits of drones for driving the growth of the economy. Sensors component is estimated to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period  Sensors are being used as payloads in UAVs for many commercial and military applications. CBRN and laser sensors in military drones are used for marking targets, guiding munitions, missile defense, electro-optical countermeasures, and in inertial navigation systems, among others. The sensors deployed in commercial UAVs are used for precision agriculture, pest detection, forestry, mammal species tracking search and rescue, target tracking, volcanic monitoring, pollution monitoring, and micro-climates, among others. North America is expected to hold the largest share of the market during the forecast period  The market for commercial drones in North America is expected to grow exponentially owing to the release of the Part 107 rule by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the U.S. in August 2016. UAVs have been extensively used by the U.S.in strikes against terrorist outfits in Syria, Libya, and Iraq. In Canada, UAVs have been used in diverse environments and high-risk roles such as atmospheric research including weather and atmospheric gas sampling and oceanographic research, among others.

Which is why scientists were able to conduct this latest study and deduce that the length of your yawn says a lot about the size of your brain. The study, published in Biology Letters, showed a correlation between yawn duration and brain weight, as well the number of cortical neurons i.e. the number of cells in the cerebral cortex, the brain’s largest region. They found that mammals with larger brains yawned longer. Lead researcher Andrew Gallup looked at the brain weight data for 29 mammals and then sent his team of researchers out to watch the animals yawn, record the duration and coming up with an average for each type of mammal. They mostly did this by watching YouTube videos of animals yawning, which, to be honest, sounds like the kind of study we want to be a part of. Researchers studied 205 individual yawns from mammals including possums, African elephants and humans. They discovered that humans yawned for an average length of seven seconds, with chimpanzees coming in at five seconds. Mice yawned for one and a half seconds on average. It’s long been suggested that yawning is a way of getting more oxygen into the body, but this study mentions another hypothesis – that yawning is a way of cooling down the brain, in two different ways. Firstly, with an influx of cold air from outside, and secondly, because we constrict then relax our facial muscles during a yawn, which sends more warm blood around the skull, allowing heat to escape. Thus, a larger brain requires a longer yawn. This also means next someone at work passively aggressively asks if they’re ‘keeping you awake’ when you yawn, you can shut them down with a swift, ‘Nah mate, just cooling down my cortex’. You might find this hard to believe, but researchers couldn’t find as many animal yawning videos on the internet as they needed, so their conclusion isn’t as solid as they were hoping for. However, they say their results are a good pointer for further research on the subject i.e. watching animals yawn in the flesh, as well as looking within species to see if yawn length dictates mental skills. Obviously brain size doesn’t equate to intelligence, but it would be interesting to see how yawn length correlates with brain variants within humans, and they hope to do this in the future.
